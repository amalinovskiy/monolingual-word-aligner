An aging population at home and ever more open borders imply increasing racial fragmentation in European countries.
Some favor affirmative action programs that provide preferences for minorities in job allocation, college admission, and public contracts.
Others object to affirmative action, and argue that a race-blind policy coupled with free market polices and pro-family values are all that are necessary to create jobs for minorities and help keep black families together.
French taxpayers' money is better spent on temporary benefits for displaced workers than on subsidies to keep an unprofitable plant alive.
For decades, through Democratic and Republican presidential administrations, America has pursued a set of straightforward energy policy objectives: keep world oil prices as stable as possible; reduce domestic consumption of oil as painlessly as possible; reduce dependence on foreign imports whenever possible; and diversify the sources of imported oil.
Iraq's future depends directly on the fate of Iraqi oil production.
Before the invasion, Iraq's oil production capacity reached three million barrels per day.
This year it was Africa's turn to nominate the chairman, and they nominated Libya.
Let us remember: Libya is a totalitarian tyranny; its leader, Muammar Ghaddafi, combines sometimes erratic behavior with extremist policies, supporting dictators all over the world.
Authoritarians at the Gate
On the contrary, one of them has been promoted to command the newly formed (and US-funded) Jakarta Anti-Terror Unit.
Since Suharto's fall in 1998, Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the largest democratic Muslim community in history.
This implies that for each murderer not executed, three innocent victims would die.
Of course, I worry about the risk of executing the innocent.
And this process has been strengthened enormously with the development of DNA identification.
Although such political screenings are complicated in postcommunist societies, where both victimhood and collaboration were so widespread -- and the lines between them so often blurred -- a sound solution could have been found, as in the Czech Republic.
As in Ukraine, Lebanon, and Kyrgizstan, it will be decided in the streets.
But too little taxation can do the same.
India's government debt exceeds 70% of GDP, so more than half its tax receipts go to paying interest.
In December 1999, the European Council granted Turkey the status of EU candidate-member, implying that Turkey would accede to the Union at some future, unspecified date.
Democracy is either defective or missing in Cuba, Mexico, and Nicaragua, and it is threatened by one cause or another in Venezuela and Colombia.
Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and of the coca-leaf growers, may be an honest, if misguided, democratic leader, but are his followers untainted by authoritarian desires?
The French state spends vast amounts of money to propagate the French language and French culture, yet the French are painfully aware that the global position of their country is not what it once was.
The OECD and Eurostat, the European body in charge of such data, thought they put an end to this aspect of the debate by showing that France, Germany, Italy, and Great Britain all enjoy roughly equal per capita living standards.
A round of "shock therapy" Ã  la Mrs. Thatcher two decades ago might have forged a new political consciousness.
One of the biggest challenges for the future of the EU is addressing today's prevalence of static solidarity oriented towards old people over dynamic solidarity favoring young people.
Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in that it, too, has two interpretations: vertical subsidiarity and horizontal subsidiarity.
It encompasses the relations between state, society, and market.
When the opposition offers the government talks on health-care reform or, most recently, on combating unemployment, the underlying competition is about competence rather than values.
Yet underneath the common battlegrounds of political debate in Britain and Germany and elsewhere in Europe, value clashes are lurking.
But the time will come when world interest rates begin to rise, as central bankers prepare to resist the upward creep of inflation.
So what will happen when central banks start raising interest rates?
International money flows - aside from inflows into the US - are not yet at levels associated with "irrational exuberance," but there is still time for that to happen before interest rates start to rise.
Moreover, confidence in the Federal Reserve is high, and the last remnants of the 1970's inflation risk premium have been wrung out of interest rates.
It is during such periods - particularly when asset values fall swiftly and substantially - that we discover exactly how good our central bankers are at their main job: reducing financial volatility and promoting economic stability.
To be sure, the challenges facing the world's economic policy makers during the next several years will be different from those that they have faced since the collapse of the NASDAQ bubble.
In a word, no.
Even after conviction, the generals were sufficiently strong to exact a termination of the trials and then a pardon from the succeeding president.
Argentine politics is still embroiled in the legal consequences of those trials of 20 years ago.
The ICTY did make several foundational decisions under the leadership of Antonio Cassese.
During Saddam's reign, no effort was made to raise living standards for the poor.
What can we do now?"
Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of Iraq's violent history of wars and atrocities, which has desensitized people to killing.
We can also rehabilitate the technocrats who served under Saddam, so that they, too, have a chance to serve their country.
More meaningful is the respect that comes from incubating insights, rather than the products of past discoveries.
Encouraged by a religiously influenced administration, school systems are shifting their focus from science to "values."
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, stanching the flow of young talent into US universities.
Even if the US avoids a fundamentalist dark age, it clearly risks losing its global research dominance.
The key idea was that military power could be made obsolete if the "food chain" of military technologies was controlled by other nations.
There is no reason that the same outcome could not be achieved in the Middle East.
Iranian pragmatists argue that Iran must inevitably cooperate with the US in post-Saddam Iraq, if only to ensure the rights of Iraq's Shi'a population.
Eventually, it is argued, the US and the international community will recognize the value of Iranian cooperation.
In short, advocates of cooperation call for an open and explicit bargain: Iran's support for stability during the current transitional phase in Iraq, as well as its commitment to maintain cooperative relations with whatever permanent government emerges in Iraq, in exchange for an improvement in Iran's regional and international position.
They believe that America is bent on undermining Iran's security and compromising its national interests.
The only question is how to satisfy it.
Turkey at one end of the Middle East and Morocco at the other are already well on their way.
These groups argue that if the regime is not planning to rig the vote, then domestic as well as foreign observation of the polling process should not be a problem.
There will be appeals to the European Central Bank to expand the monetary base, as if imitating the dollar were the answer to all the industrial, structural, and demographic problems plaguing Europe.
An Epidemic of Politics
But science, almost everyone agrees, is different, and here the United States is beginning to stand as a cautionary example to the rest of the world.
In her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in Moscow, Novaya Gazeta, and in her books "Putin's Russia: Life in a Failing Democracy" and "A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya," Politkovskaya wrote of the vanishing freedoms that are the signature characteristic of Putin's presidency.
After all, as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides Putin, not least of which is the current Chechen Prime Minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom.
The six year period since Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals.
Gerhard Schroeder, who less than a month ago was Germany's Chancellor, has agreed to become chairman of the company that is building a gas pipeline from Russia, across the Baltic Sea to Germany, and on through Western Europe.
By circumventing Ukraine, Poland, and of course, the Baltic countries, the new pipeline promises greater leverage to the Kremlin as it seeks to reassert itself regionally.
Indeed, they revel in it: after we integrate and increase our common gas business, Russian editorialists write, Europe will keep silent about human rights.
As a former Head of State of newly independent Lithuania, I frequently endured such threats.
If Europeans are serious about their common space for human rights and freedoms, they must recognize that those values are not shared by the calculating placemen of Putin's Kremlin.
As we struggled, continued secrecy allowed an explosion of corruption and abuse of office.
Often we had to go to court to force disclosure of information, using Romania's 2001 Freedom of Information Act.
Now, inside government, I realize that sharing information with the public is sometimes hard.
When the United States adopted its Freedom of Information Act in 1966, it joined the exclusive company of Sweden and Finland.
Information released by the government of Brazil indicates that deforestation of the irreplaceable forests of the Amazon, due to factors such as agricultural conversion, reached 2.6 million hectares (roughly 10,000 square miles) in the past year, bringing the total deforested area of the Amazon to 17%.
The WWF/World Bank alliance also motivated partners to establish a trust fund to manage these protected areas in perpetuity.
Business leaders, governments, and civil society organizations must play their part in realizing this vision.
Our results provide a surprisingly nuanced picture of Saudi attitudes.
A century later, the Japanese economic miracle had transformed the image of at least a small part of Asia in European eyes into a place of rapid technological and industrial progress.
They are now fully aware that their slightly nostalgic post-colonial view of these countries as large export markets and deep reservoirs of cheap labor has become outdated.
Perhaps Asians would then come to regard the European model as a political version of Venice -- a place to visit with nostalgia for its past glory and admiration for its museum-like quality.
A larger question is whether the US is hopelessly divided.
The closeness of the result suggests Bush won less of a mandate for change than he seems to believe.
Indeed, the debate nowadays is not about what to do, but how much to do, and how fast.
Vietnam witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty, while in Mexico real wages fell.
All the opportunities that the US market presented to Mexico could not offset the consequences of policy mistakes at home, especially the failure to reverse the real appreciation of the peso's exchange rate and the inability to extend the productivity gains achieved in a narrow range of export activities to the rest of the economy.
The questions are many.
Sometimes individual Iranian officials may have acted on their own to order and coordinate specific operations; they will now feel freer to do so.
Moreover, Ahmadinejad openly advocates Iran's crash program to obtain nuclear weapons.
In view of these changed economic conditions, and the shadow of war in Iraq, you might expect the Bush Administration and the Republican-led Congress to be cautious in advocating new tax cuts.
So massive budget deficits seem here to stay.
Voter turnout in the 2002 election was only around 40%, of which around half went to the Republicans, or around 20% of eligible voters.
George W. Bush has done more to wreck US economic policy than any other President in American history, exceeding even his mentor, Ronald Reagan.
This argument is also mistaken.
In any event, it is a huge mistake to base long-term tax policies on the short-run business cycle.
The second lesson is that countries ought to plan their budgets taking into account the rising fiscal costs of an aging population.
Essentially, one is forecasting not just economics, but politics - and even the cultural values - that shape economic policies and performance.
When markets create an international consensus on the future price of homes in cities around the world, we will be better able to manage the risks facing these cities, thereby stabilizing their economies -- and our own lives.
What News Is Moving the Markets?
Surely, this was a major event that would plausibly affect stock markets all over the world.
But such a focus makes intuitive sense.
The movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in the United States as well, as consumers increasingly turn to organic, locally produced foods, and eggs from hens not kept in cages.
Small farmers, for their part, are required to be organized in cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation.
Brink Lindsey, director of the pro-market Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies, believes that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee is a "well-meaning dead end."
From the growers' perspective, receiving a premium by selling a Fairtrade product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce.
Common sense would, of course, have reached the same conclusion.
Neither Florida nor Arizona are particularly progressive states -- both voted for George W. Bush over John Kerry in 2004.
There is no federal legislation at all on the welfare of farm animals -- and very little state legislation, either.
As a group, his appointments pose a direct challenge to Mr. Karzai's goal of reunifying the country.
An eleventh served as a pilot.
Adam Smith's invisible hand -- the idea that free markets lead to efficiency as if by an invisible hand -- is invisible at least in part because it is not there.
Unfortunately, students of these graduate programs now act as policymakers in many countries, and are trying to implement programs based on the ideas that have come to be called market fundamentalism.
The Nobel Prize signifies how important it is to study people and economies as they are, not as we want them to be.
Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, Bush appears to have finally woken up to the reality of America's increasing dependence; with soaring oil prices, it was hard for him not to note the consequences.
Never before has the world seen such sustained growth; never before has there been so much poverty reduction.
Growth arguments will be advanced to counter strong social and environmental policies: higher gasoline taxes, for example, will kill our nascent auto industry.
There is only one way to prevent this: open discussion of economic policies in order to expose fallacies and provide scope for creative solutions to the many challenges facing China today.
Tocqueville's Lessons in Democracy
They could only pretend to judge events and values on their own; in reality, they would merely copy the rough and simplified opinions of the masses.
If the informed and critical citizenry that democracy requires is to be formed, our schools must stop pandering to the latest popular fads and begin to sharpen the analytical capacities of students.
This concern about mass media is no mere elitist scorn for popular culture.
The result of the failure is a generalized indifference and passivity in audiences.
Is it too late to do anything about a culture that so deadens the spirit?
I believe that our future is as promising as Europe's past is proud, and that our destiny lies not as a forgotten borderland on a troubled region, but as a maker and shaper of Europe's peace and Europe's unity.
Self-determination no longer means isolation, because achieving national independence nowadays means only to return to the world scene with a new status.
Part of the work of renewing Ukraine is a creative battle to put an end to a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism -- ideologies born in the heart of Europe -- battled for mastery.
Following the Kingdom's official denunciation of Hezbollah, the Saudi state called on its official Wahhabi clerics to issue fatwas condemning Hezbollah as Shiite deviants and heretics.
This clearly raises the stakes.
But this hesitant acceptance of a certain normality in its relations with its neighbors has always been vulnerable to a sudden eruption of Russia's famously irrational "derzhava" -- an aggressive ethos that glorifies the state and asserts its strength by pouncing on weakness.
This is the key to understanding the recent Russian gas crisis.
