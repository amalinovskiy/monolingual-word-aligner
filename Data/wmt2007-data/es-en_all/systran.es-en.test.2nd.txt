<seg>Our declaration of rights is first of this millenium.
<seg>We have to know how to organize us like Fifteen with the purpose of to be able to receive in right conditions to those countries that are calling to our doors.
<seg>In article 87 the scope of the existential attendance with cultural and charitable social purposes must be included, so that these important institutions can enjoy a lasting protection.
<seg>Some maintain that it is possible to be created an internal market in Europe without being suitable upon values and basic principles.
<seg>Desire to greet the substantial major intervention and of President Prodi.
<seg>You know who treat in this case of a deliberate decision that she took place in Amsterdam, of distinguishing the two functions, the High Representative perfectly, on the contrary who the Commission, is not pronounced with total independence, but it must like mission coordinate the foreign policies and of security common that they are competence of the Member State and in that case we have to perhaps leave an ample space to the intergovernmental aspect.
<seg>It has asked that the Presidency draws up in Nize the way for the future.
<seg>Indeed, we can wish better more and, but I create with all honesty that is a good principle.
<seg>Consequently, I trust that the European Council in Nice is associated to this project and decides to concretely initiate it like project, not like an accomplished fact, after to have approved naturally the reforms that now we needed.
<seg>Nevertheless, also I have indicated concretely that basing us on the present we can secure extraordinarily important objectives with the Community method on which we at the moment told, for example, for one better action in the Balkan Mountains.
<seg>If we were only able to tie to Russia to the West and to the European Union, we can influence in its policy and maintain the contact and conversations with this country.
<seg>Motion for a resolution (B5-0767/00) of Mr. Napolitano in the name of the Constitutional Affairs Committee on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union
<seg>It continues perpetrating this genocide and in addition it tries to completely eliminate the freedom of press and the Rule of law, whose existence is already precarious.
<seg>Indeed to respond to the expectations of this pensioners who are called Giuseppe Italy and live in Cremona and to which it would like to sail in the Po, I have voted in favor of the Piecyk report on the involution and the development of the sea ports, the inland ports inner and the intermodal terminals.
<seg>- (OF) the result of the vote celebrated in this Parliament will do impossible to reach the objective of the directive, a recognized objective and by which all the speakers have been pronounced and the Commission.
<seg>Sir president, I have voted in favor of the report Skinner, as I showed throughout the previous debate to the voting, because I believe that the risk capital is important.
<seg>My Wild companion of Armonie group indicated yesterday of incisive form that only one minority has interest in the cession of Community money and the contributions of the pensions of retirement to the risks of the industralists.
<seg>Therefore, the Letter will serve mainly to confirm the current practices, even retrograde, of the Nation states, instead of to represent an advance.
<seg>Sir President, finally we have a Charter of Fundamental of the European citizen who contains an article, article 25, entirely dedicated to the people majors.
<seg>In principle this text can seem anodyne, because it picks up existing rights basically. But it would be gotten up to the Deal with binding force, as the European Parliament asks, with time would tend automatically to the uniformización of the national rights in Europe; it would grant an out of proportion power to the Court of Justice; it would favor a greater centralization around the European institutions; it would limit the margin of independent decision of each town.
<seg>· An overload of the Load with detail norm must be avoided, which must reserve to the rank dispositions inferior.
<seg>I will vote on the other letter, participating in the manifestations of Biarritz, days 13 and 14 of October, and Nize, the 7 of December of 2000.
<seg>Progresses towards accession of the 12 countries candidates
<seg>In my opinion, several States have not included/understood until today the existence of this connection and vacillating progresses in the Intergovernmental Conference can involve great difficulties at the time of carrying out the extension in the necessary term.
<seg>We will only be able to take actually to with lasting nature all the questions that I have pointed until now if the policy and leader of the countries candidates for accession and the European Union - and in this sense I give the reason him, Sir Commissioner let know to the public opinion that the enlargement of the European Union is in beneficial itself.
<seg>One is the consecrated formula.
<seg>Permítanme to now mention the second direction according to which the Presidency wishes to make progress during this semester the enlargement process.
<seg>What I propose to them, then, is to work in this direction with the idea that we must examine, in the prospect of year 2003, which are the candidates who could adhere in this date.
<seg>I give thanks to the rapporteur for the Committee of Foreign affairs, Mr. Brok, by its ample one and clarifier informs, as well as to the other rapporteurs.
<seg>In these negotiations the case “if does not consider in any…” , but “how” and “when”.
<seg>But they have obtained also it because the perspective to become States of the European Union provides hope to them in the solidarity of people of Europe and because for it demands solids to them economic political bases and.
<seg>Several countries have registered, with regard to the second economic criterion of the competitiveness in the internal market, so remarkable advances that they approach the compliance with the requirements of the adhesion very quickly.
<seg>For this reason, we try that the coordination with the programs of the national Governments, the Parliament and other Institutions is narrowest possible.
<seg>In all candidate country the opinion is expected with very many preoccupation that annually emits the Commission on its advances, this one goes to emit itself again soon, the 8 of November.
<seg>We have chosen with success the principle of the differentiation, according to which each country candidate will be judged by its own merits.
<seg>This debate represents another occasion my political Group to emphasize that the adhesion of the states of Central and Eastern Europe, and also of Cyprus and Malta, is the best guarantee of future for all we in Europe, as much in the East as in the West.
<seg>It is a matter of the utmost importance and, in spite of it, peculiar thing, as soon as it has provoked the public attention.
<seg>People spend jokes saying that after the collapse of the Wall of Berlin, the extension continues being five years seen.
<seg>The following natural occasion will be in connection with the following Parliament elections European of year 2009, but we want to make an effort to us so that the maximum possible number of countries can adhere already in 2004.
<seg>By the others, they are the six aspects basic worry that us about the followed method.
<seg>In fact, we are sunk in the own model of construction of Europe, that is to say: the simultaneous integration of all the sectors of activity, beyond the traditions or of the specificities of everyone, is transformed again into a trap.
<seg>Their words count on the endorsement of the Hungarian Central Bank President: “The European Union must signal precise”. On the contrary, East Europe will suspect that Europe does not work seriously in the extension, something that could finish in a dangerous disappointment on the promises of Brussels - I mention the Hungarian spokesman -.
<seg>But the things must be clear: it cannot have an entrance with reductions.
<seg>Force is an idea that is also a great idea: we did not realise the extensions against the opinion, and the best way to realise the extensions with the opinion supposes its participation in elections, since the elections are the expression of the democracy and the method of adhesion of the citizens to the political system.
<seg>. (OF) Sir President, Lordships, I mean very briefly something on the prior conditions of the scene wished here by several parts.
<seg>I would have left surprised very if they did not exert that pressure.
<seg>But already I have indicated that all the countries approach with relative rapidity to the maturity for the adhesion.
<seg>This means that the liberalisation of trade in the products sector agricultural already is decided without the Poles have the preoccupation of which for that reason its agriculture sinks.
<seg>Efforts have been needed, but, generally, La Paz and the commerce has established stronger bows between the citizens, now still more solid with the monetary union.
<seg>What counts must be the result of the negotiations.
<seg>The unique amendment that has appeared already is covered in my report, but I am pleased that the Group of the Greens wants to emphasize the importance of an equal treatment for the citizens.
<seg>Here only one law is not included on the public service but also that exists opportunities for the employed young people of the administration and a suitable payment.
<seg>This is applicable as much to Latvia as to the European Union.
<seg>The entailment of lita to the Euro in second half of year 2001 has projected.
<seg>. (IT) Sir President, gentleman Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am rapporteur, is the most important major and, but, as we know, also he is most problematic of the countries that are prepared to enter the European Union, so problematic that voices are heard about their possible exclusion of the first group, the one of the countries that will enter in the first place.
<seg>To Poland, to the countries of the East, the countries that were communist we have done too many promises nonfulfilled.
<seg>It is a point that always appears when it is the Czech Republic. It is the problem of the gypsys.
<seg>Slovakia is not the condemned to the second group, and is logical that it wants to enter when makes Czech Republic.
<seg>At the same time, I allow myself, to finish, to make an observation on the internal policy.
<seg>Thirdly, and as for the agriculture, whose level of productivity is still inferior to the one of the European Union, it agrees to guarantee the total opening of the agricultural market to the necessary capitals for the privatization of earth, the modernization of the operations and the marketing structures, as well as for the improvement of the rents.
<seg>Bulgaria waits for with anxiety the moment for entering in the European Union and NATO.
<seg>The acute poverty has been a fundamental problem of Rumania from 1990 and with the present government the economy, finally, is giving true signs of improvement.
<seg>I trust that these subjects become the priorities of the new parliament that possession within fifteen days will take, and of the new Government.
<seg>But we also indicated that definitive, right the solution and permanent it must totally respect simultaneously the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations, that is neither the more nor less than the Current international law, and the principles by which the European Union is in force.
<seg>Malta arranges besides democratic stable institutions that work.
<seg>- (FR) Sir President, gentleman Commissioner, Lordships, in the name of the Economic Committee and Monetary, we wished to make our contribution to this debate.
<seg>They also must be applied. The right European Community is indeed not only law in the books, but law in action also must be in the countries candidates.
<seg>This transformation raises hard exigencies to the people in the countries candidates but it at the same time assures its future and the future its children.
<seg>It is necessary to dedicate a special attention - in which I adhere with the previous speaker - to the border regions.
<seg>Against this background, one is not due to leave single the Commission.
<seg>The states candidates want to obtain a fast economic growth, also if this one takes place at the cost of a policy of protection of the nature previously established.
<seg>We were with a traffic of roundtrip of bad customs, many of tie them with the health.
<seg>. Sir President, the extension is essential for the construction of a continent strong European and united.
<seg>The European Parliament and its Regional Policy Committee, that is competent also in the dominion of the transports and the transeuropean networks, are conscious that it is necessary to coordinate the different sectorial Community policies in favor of a global policy from arrangement of the territory.
<seg>But before I want to realise the observation that the transport infrastructure is going to be of central importance for success of enlargement.
<seg>. (IT GIVES) Sir President, I add the choir of which they say that the forthcoming enlargement is now the greater task to the one than the EU faces.
<seg>An heavy pressure has been exerted on the traditional social values in Central and Eastern Europe.
<seg>The PPE does not want to usurp the responsibilities of the candidates as far as the rate of the adhesion, since we cannot give a date for this one.
<seg>The second point is the mention of dates.
<seg>There is in addition another reason.
<seg>Third party: acceptance of enlargement and its positive perspective for the individual countries and the EU in their totality depend - this has demonstrated Denmark to it to a great extent that the social and democratic deficits of the European policy are reduced.
<seg>Populism is the defamatory epíteto that the technocrats attribute to the popular will when this one is expressed in a sense that does not agree to them.
<seg>Lordships, have a pause to eat and to rest. We will continue to the 21,00 hours.
<seg>In a perspective to more long term, there will be a single currency in all the continent.
<seg>In these subjects internal battles in each one of the countries concentrate.
<seg>We invited to them to fight by a different Europe, of all the towns, that have gotten rid of all these cruel characteristics, in which the towns are owners of their luck, develop freedom, peace relations, of brotherhood, of reciprocal beneficial collaboration.
<seg>I have publicly praised the work of those organizations and, in particular, the one of Romanian Challenge Appeal that is been in Birmingham and of other Irish organizations supported by many people, among them Daniel O' Donnell, Irish artist of varieties, that a million pounds sterling promised and collected that amount in Ireland and other parts of the world.
<seg>The summit of Nize must mainly contribute clarity on if and how it is going to act the EU on the other hand to be in situation she herself to extend itself in depth and in time.
<seg>The Poles ask themselves: they will be pleased to us when we adhere or we will be countries of second category?
<seg>I am sure that, with good will and European Union aid, a solution will be able to be found that allows the two communities to live in harmony and to prosper they have done since it during centuries.
<seg>But also we have taken care of the question of the minorities, because the issue of the integration of these minorities, including linguistic integration, is also of importance in these countries.
<seg>The exigency to be member is, basically, the compliance with the criteria of Copenhagen.
<seg>It has been spoken to us of the benefits of enlargement, and this one is one of the spheres in which Lithuania shows the way to us.
<seg>They imagine if all we were like them!
<seg>Sir President, gentleman Commissioner, I also want to thank and to congratulate Mr. Brok and to the other rapporteurs, but, first of all, I want to limit to me Slovakia, more concretely, to the situation policy on minorities.
<seg>I urge to them so that in Nize they determine a date of until when prehorseradish tree finalizing the negotiations with the countries more advanced candidates - without mentioning names.
<seg>The European Union must continue helping to Bulgaria in its progress for the entry to the European and, of course, causing that the planning of that aid still more is decentralized.
<seg>The dialogue between the social partners, the other civil society groups, the Government and the Parliament play important and, as we have verified, also positive a role in this respect.
<seg>We are ending indeed the division of Europe in two, and not creating a new division.
<seg>All this figure in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne and I congratulate to him very sincerely in the name of our political Group by this report.
<seg>From this point of view, I believe that the issue of Cyprus is the one that is more going to determine the capacity of Europe to see its political characteristics.
<seg>Alive near the Baltic Sea, to whose it concerns us situation all.
<seg>The political vision continues being the same.
<seg>It has turned out for this reason, me very pleasant to listen Mr. Klaus Hänsch, who has taken part in the name of Grupo PSE, when he has wished that the Commission emits a real judgment on the consequences of enlargement, and also on the economic impacts that would take place in case of not carrying out the extension.
<seg>However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, the Wuermeling colleague, of which without transitional periods it cannot work in the interests of both parts. Indeed like border Member for a region who, like the Schierhuber colleague, owns an agricultural farm near the Czech border, he is for very important me that common economic areas without main problems arise more approximate and that lead to positive results in both parts.
<seg>I want to emphasize three aspects like Social Democrat.
<seg>The EEE, in that they are including the questions of the first pillar, will allow to the access of the economies of the countries candidates to the internal market and will grant to the young people and science the right to participate in the exchange programmes, but, however, it will not force the EU to extend still its agricultural subsidy regime to those countries. This way, the Agreement on the EEE would contribute to give an positive impetus, mainly, to the economies of the countries candidates - very needed growth to put to its societies in conditions of adherirse-, but also to the national economies of the EU, since esteem that, through economic growth, could even be covered two thirds with the total costs of the extension, and perhaps still more if we went to the model of the EEE.
<seg>Secondly: we say not to the idea of the consisting of big-bang simultaneously accepting to a great group of countries candidates, since one would be against at the beginning of which the countries are accepted by their own merits.
<seg>Third party: we must do everything what is in our hand to prepare until the 2003 to the European Union for the enlargement process in the sense of the excellent speech of the President of the Prodi Commission.
<seg>Against this background, I would want to refer me to the relation between the Parliament and the Council and to indicate that lately the Council responds with an important delay to the written questions of the deputies.
<seg>He is worrisome that this happens in a country that is going to get up itself to the European Union.
<seg>I request the referral to committee for its preparation.
<seg>. (SV) Sir President, today we will discuss and perhaps we will vote three information that take care of this matter, two of which are mine.
<seg>All the implied in the food chain would see beneficiaries.
<seg>The safe foods have a cost in all the chain.
<seg>Therefore, we must second to Mrs Paulsen and the Commission, and adopt the not-dissolution principle, to give security to the animal feed and to really protect the European consumers.
<seg>The Directive of 1999 is a meditated good text and it already can exhibit some success, since they have been able to reduce of demonstrable way the loads.
<seg>But to simply admit the possibility “of diluting” products is not the solution.
<seg>Very quickly, that we must insist on amendment 37 regarding the dioxina.
<seg>On this point, we agree.
<seg>For this reason, the result is that, like European consumers, we will have to continue buying meat and milk and its derivatives produced in the world markets with fodder that do not keep any type of relationship with the thresholds and the limit values that we have established like European Union, and with a system of feed production that acquires raw materials in the international, free markets to mix any principle and formulation before commercializing its products in the territory of the European.
<seg>Before the second reading, we needed to know the opinion of the Committee exceeds how the evaluation of the risk factors will be realised.
<seg>On the contrary, he would be lamentable that was approved, for example, amendments 39 and 40, since it would imply that the possibility of the Member States would disappear of taking part quickly against the new dangers that are discovered.
<seg>Consumer protection begins by the animal feed, by the content of fodder, its declaration and, finally, its administrative control.
<seg>Sir President, Lordships, the report of the colleague Paulsen on the undesirable substances in the animal feed takes care of an major issue that, like all the major issues, provokes many discrepancies.
<seg>President, the discussion on this excellent report of Mrs. Paulsen had very emotional shades in a few points, and I fodder that, once finished this debate, we must start off of the base that the requirements demanded to the forage industry for the cattle certainly are strict but next we can cause that the quality modifies adding component.
<seg>These three proposals approach collectively, individual and, the serious lacks that the dioxin crisis has brought to light.
<seg>Amendment 33 eliminates the possibility of re-exporting to the origin country the nonprescribed games.
<seg>The amendments 41, 42, 43 and 44, that propose to introduce the possibility of dilution in certain conditions of raw materials for contaminated fodder, also are unacceptable.
<seg>That would have to be sufficient, having in account our commitment to establish a rapid alert system that includes all the food chain and of animal feed in the fresh proposal on the food authority.
<seg>Sir Commissioner Byrne, after this relative directive marketing of compound feed underlies an old problem at heart, concretely, the one of the open declaration.
<seg>This it is already a benefit that has reported me the session this morning.
<seg>If we do therefore it, if we transpose therefore it quickly and if also we completed quickly the codecision procedure, without a doubt we will have gained much, and I am sure that we will be able to hold a very firm and unanimous position before the Council.
<seg>Sir President, considered and esteemed colleagues, also in the future can return to happen or it is not possible at least to be discarded that in fodder contaminated raw materials are introduced.
<seg>The scandal of the BSE was the known most serious example and more.
<seg>Of common sense - it has said our rapporteur to it - it would be evidently to have a abierta label, that presented/displayed the list of the ingredients.
<seg>I believe that the technical qualification and competition of the members of the Committee on Agriculture to judge on the subjects related to agriculture and also to the animal feed are unquestionable from the point of view of the search for a solution with practicable practical guidelines and, that the affected agriculturists and consumers can apply and include/understand.
<seg>Up to here the positive side.
<seg>In my opinion, it is a legitimate right to the information that must be satisfied.
<seg>I ask, Mrs. Presidenta, in the name of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and in the mine own one, whom the condolence of the Parliament as much sends to the families of the victims and the local authorities of Britain as of Marin, Galicia, from where the majority of the victims comes.
<seg>(The Parliament approves the resolution)
<seg>There is some colleague who is against upon presentment of this oral amendment?
<seg>Thus it is indeed as the rapporteur has explained us the things.
<seg>The majority of their technical proposals deserves to be supported with estusiasmo, for example regarding food safety, to the dismantling of the nuclear powerstations of first generation, to the protection of the environment, the social fight against dumping, the indispensable code of conduct of the companies of the West when they work in the East, etc. The task is enormous, and also absolutely high-priority.
<seg>At the same time, the barriers to surpass are considerable, mainly at budgetary level.
<seg>The extension to thirteen countries not only modifies the geopolitical frame of the European Union, but also it alters its structure, because the total population is going to increase (+28%), but at the same time it will make the number of areas “worked against”.
<seg>Against this background, it is precise to consider that, due to its fort economic and social, competitive an agricultural sector and nourishing weight is going to have an crucial importance for the success of the process of transformation and reconstruction of the countries candidates.
<seg>In this sense, I would like that the outermost regions, between which 6 of each 7 continue appearing in the group of the 10 more poor women of the EU, would benefit from the Structural Funds, not only on the base of the sole criterion of the GIP, but also on the base of geographic, demographic and mainly social indicators.
<seg>We rejected as it, by the good of the French, we cannot, in brings back to consciousness, to approve its enlargement to the countries and to the towns of the East, as soon as released of the communist dictatorship, that not yet can know technocratic and totalitarian the trap in which they wish to fall.
<seg>We would have had to content to us with the national information and, at the most, a short resolution, but filled with content.
<seg>The current system, with subsidy, aid and quotas, must be replaced by the free trade and the adjustment the markets.
<seg>The importance and the amplitude of the problems that the extension provokes not feel sorry with the double language that exceeds she comes used within the European Union.
<seg>For me to speak of extension does not imply to recognize the property or nonproperty of some countries into Europe.
<seg>Our neighbouring country has strived with determination during last the ten years to fulfil the criteria of the adhesion.
<seg>Latvia has its site in this room, not only because generally, their progresses give right this “credit of indispensable confidence” successfully to culminate a negotiation of this type, but, mainly, and first of all, because in Europe it is in his house.
<seg>Gawronski with this report. I consider that Poland is the State, between that they have asked for the adhesion, that deserves more than another our support, since, without major initiatives of Poland, the Comunism would not have fallen and today we would be here speaking of this problem.
<seg>Perhaps this is not so evident for the population, that it continues being mainly euroskeptic.
<seg>I insist to the Prague to that she welcomes this signal, this request, this request of which a dialogue settles down, and to that she responds him and she guards, along with this Assembly, so that it is possible to surpass that inheritance of a nationalistic era.
<seg>. (IN) Greeting the Wiersma report on the application for membership from Slovakia to the European Union and I most of share the conclusions at which the rapporteur arrives.
<seg>He is to me very pleasing to take advantage of this occasion to direct to a very special greeting to the people majors and the pensioners of the Bulgarian Republic. As it is said in the report of Mr.
<seg>If Rumania continues progressing and the European Union adapts its structure and its policies institutional to be able to make face of enlargement, I do not see any reason for which Rumania does not have to be admitted in the Union.
<seg>Whatever the solution that is taken with respect to the colonists, and he is one of the thorny issues, along with the earth return in both parts, this is too hard if some reservations do not become.
<seg>Lamentably, some of the commentaries that the Foreign Affairs Committee, Human rights, Security policy and Defence policy spill in the draft report on the application for membership from Cyprus to the European Union do not facilitate the things.
<seg>This task will not be easy, if we considered the lack of good will of the Turkish Cypriot side and of Turkey.
<seg>Stenzel report (A5-0243/2000)
<seg>Unfortunately, I underwent one slight food poisoning in the European Parliament.
<seg>By all these reasons, I voted in favor of the prohibition of the propose dissolution in the European Commission.
<seg>We must insist to the countries of the ASEM in the present resolution to that they press to the military regime in Burma so that restores the democracy.
<seg>We are partial in our approach and application.
<seg>We cannot allow us to be pusilánimes.
<seg>Some factors of importance of the norm are: first of all, the regulation of the burden of proof.
<seg>The equal treatment and the discrimination are not fundamental principles of the EU.
<seg>For that reason we needed a legislation against the discrimination.
<seg>Partly, as a result of it, we on the one hand, have in front of us an enormous amount of legal and technical amendments that aspire to assure a level equal treatment against discrimination on grounds of race, and for reasons of religion, incapacity, age and sexual orientation, on the other hand.
<seg>It was necessary to deliver an attack of balance, moderation and good legal technique and its report it reflects - in my opinion these qualities.
<seg>Also, they think that the cases of discrimination are not as numerous as to deserve a legislation.
<seg>In the action program there are sufficient funds no to replace this work that is developed in the Fifth Programme frame and that, hopefully, has pursuit in all the other programs frame, although we will have to make sure that they are compatible.
<seg>Everybody is in agreement with which there is to fight against the discrimination, but the opinions vary envelope how to make it, to what extent and whereupon methods.
<seg>I had opportunity, in the commission, to infuriate to me against the fact that expert they could also be outside the NGO and nevertheless having things that to say.
<seg>Also very we are satisfied with the provision of the directive that shows that the equal treatment for disabled also means also that it is expected of the companies that realise adaptations in the place of work.
<seg>Only thus we will be able to fight with effectiveness against the discriminations in all the scopes of the coexistence right in Europe.
<seg>After all, as they teach the great British democracies to us, racism and the discriminations fight with the liberal democracy and not with the limitation or the progressive erosion of the freedom of economic opinion and expression, association and.
<seg>We have a proposal that elevates homosexuality to the same category that the holy marriage.
<seg>We reinforce therefore the positions of the European European for particular situations lived by its inhabitants with respect to the discrimination and to the equal treatment.
<seg>I also want to pause in the question of the religious exclusion.
<seg>There is one who has indicated his preoccupation to me by the possible interpretation of the considerandos regarding article 1 which, once again, they can seem clear little, but make a distinction between the sexual orientation and the behavior.
<seg>So there are hierarchies in the discrimination.
<seg>In Nueva Caledonia preference occurs on a chromatic base of the skin.
<seg>The first positive element of the directive is the universal approach from which the treatment of the discriminations is conceived, aspect that acquires special importance if a suitable implementation of the directive is wanted.
<seg>Therefore those that come here to say that Europe does not have to pick up in a directive the values that all we want to defend, are confused.
<seg>We do not have to interfere in these profits that we reached with so many efforts.
<seg>Finally, Lordships, the mass media must also play an important role in this task.
<seg>The legislative experience has also demonstrated to us that the fight against discrimination promoting measure is essential, but nonsufficient.
<seg>We must avoid absurd red tapes, that the unique thing that will obtain will be to reduce to Europe to a purely materialistic organization, politically correct, but devoid of sense.
<seg>Fodder that this Parliament has adorned as if outside a Christmas tree the little outpost legislation that the Commission would have wanted to put on the table.
<seg>It would want to begin being thankful to both rapporteurs, Messrs Mann and Cashman, this excellent report.
<seg>I will accept the amendments that try to put of relief the importance of coming up and of fighting against the discrimination.
<seg>The second category has the objective to clarify the text of the Commission proposal and the third sandal a considerable number of amendments that try to adapt the present proposal to the Directive regarding the race, adopted the past month of June.
<seg>In particular, amendments 9, 10 and 20 propose the elimination of the reference to the discrimination for reasons of racial and ethnic origin.
<seg>I cannot accept the references that the Parliament in amendments 21 and 45 to the legal natural persons makes and, as well as to the groupings nonofficials, because this proposal on employment is only applicable to the individuals.
<seg>The voting will tomorrow take place to the 12,00 hours.
<seg>We cannot wait for a public support of the operations of peace settlement, if our troops expose themselves to die as a result of projectiles coming from arms that we ourself we have provided.
<seg>In my home country, to own a gun it would need a license, but it does not stop to install to me like arms broker in a shed of my garden.
<seg>Another major point is the export ban, promotion and used commercialization of apparatuses and knows-how to inflict tortures.
<seg>Having said this, naturally I want to congratulate to our Titley colleague by its excellent report.
<seg>We have to extend our examination, on the one hand, besides the questions of obligatory force, also to other aspects other people's to the equipment destined to strict military purpose, such as to the own disarmament and the increase in the efficiency of the police force and the customs authorities, and then, on the other hand, to the applicant countries to the adhesion, as it finishes mentioning Mr. Wiersma.
<seg>The control on the circuit of the money does sharply more difficult to elude the dispositions on the arms trade.
<seg>The objective of the annual report is the one to discover possible improvements.
<seg>The European Union is examining at the moment the possibility of continuing the project after its expiration in November of this year.
<seg>They have defined a methodology and indicators and will appear in the forthcoming Council “Investigation”.
<seg>Thanks, gentleman Commissioner.
<seg>Concerning the problems of the SME, naturally we have verified that in the framework programme, the SME have their part, as it were predicted in the budgetary decision.
<seg>That is to say, at least, which seems to collect itself of the budget debate in Greece; and the fact is that many invoke the points of view of the European Union. It is that truth?
<seg>Concerning the pluridisciplinaridad, I share its opinion.
<seg>First he is the one of which the participation of the EU in national programs has mentioned specifically in its report.
<seg>It would not be then possible to speak of European research area if we only represented 5% of this investigation.
<seg>Thank you very much, Mr. Busquin.
<seg>On the one hand, and after hard work to jeopardize completely the bottoms at the end of year 1999, the requests in instance at the beginning of this exercise for the financing of new projects necessarily were very reduced.
<seg>But I reiterate that Portugal made the things in the previous period well. What simply I want to indicate, and I give the corresponding figures him to the 26 of September, is that the bottoms really jeopardize on the part of Portugal and for the new period, (I am only commissioner for a year) they reach a 2.6%.
<seg>Question nº 2 formulated by (H-0730/00):
<seg>Finally, the fixation of a high level of the contributions of uses and consumption on mineral oils do not lead to a not-fulfillment of the Community provisions on the competition.
<seg>Secondly, as Mr. MacCormick knows, in the cases in that the Member States favor by fiscal means particular sector of the industry, they infringe the norms on the state aid, in this case fiscal state aid, that he is equivalent to a subsidy.
<seg>For example, the nuclear power is a very clear and opportune case.
<seg>Subject: Budget line regarding the minority languages the budgetary resources that the European Union destines from 1983 in favor of the minority languages registered a constant increase until 1995, year in which they reached his maximum amount, 4 million Euros.
<seg>. (OF) Sir President, the colleagues in Parliament without a doubt already know that the Structural Funds - and this is a newness destine many resources for cultural activities, because I have insisted, with Michel Barnier, in which these are not reversed only in highways and airports, but also in the people.
<seg>So that the coming year the Commission is not going to formulate new financial commitments on the matter.
<seg>In relation to the concrete proposal of financing, it is not possible to me to assume a position, since we must respect the normal procedures.
<seg>. (SV) I have thought about many alternatives.
<seg>And it is a reality which there is to face, because we spoke of million small and medium enterprises in all Europe.
<seg>The norms regarding the treatment of products of the hunting, for example of the elk, are also applied to the meat used for own consumption?
<seg>If these rules were applied to the meat that consume the hunters, it would mean a bureaucratic catastrophe for elk hunting.
<seg>When this report has concluded, I set out to present/display proposals to improve the transport of animals and the problem of the insufficient observance of the time limits of the days in the coming weeks.
<seg>In the meeting that I celebrated with the Group of the Greens we examined this question already.
<seg>Our question was clear: What measures take the Commission? Mr.
<seg>General product safety also forces the producers to facilitate to the consumers information on the risks.
<seg>The case of Maryam Ayubi is extraordinarily disquieting.
<seg>Question nº 14 formulated by (H-0745/00):
<seg>The attitude of the EU with respect to that ministerial meeting in Vientiane and if, in fact, it must be celebrated or in what level must be represented the EU in her will depend on development of the situation in Burma from now until December.
<seg>A final point.
<seg>The elections are a major step so that people of Kosovo participate in the administration of her communities.
<seg>I can say to them that the development of those elections has been more democratic, better than the one of the elections in our home countries, in whom in many occasions I have participated or I been observant.
<seg>We saw but it like a principle and no, in no way, like the end of the process.
<seg>It informs pleads more for a closed better control and on the arms trade and for an increased transparency.
<seg>Now I discover that every year they increase to the contracts for arms and components of arms.
<seg>We cannot make real decisions based on information and apparent realities.
<seg>The disposition by which they have stayed together in the same DG would have to be revision object.
<seg>Although these institutions must have the option to designate to an internal auditor, is sufficient with imposing certain minimum requirements of audit to the financial controller.
<seg>This proposal does not count on the unanimous approval of this Parliament as Mrs Comisaria knows well.
<seg>Therefore, we do not have any objection against the creation an independent internal audit service, to which today we give green light with the report of the colleague go Hulten.
<seg>Sir President, Mrs. Comisaria, would want to begin congratulating to the rapporteur.
<seg>The modernization of the administration is urgently necessary to ours to seem.
<seg>An independent audit is essential to avoid errors.
<seg>The money is due to spend in the future of way more fit to the objectives and more effective, and evidently also it is due to guarantee better than the bottoms are dedicated to the aims for which it has destined them the budgetary authority.
<seg>With regard to the proposed amendments, I want to indicate the following thing very briefly: the Commission accepts the introduction of considering additional.
<seg>Therefore, I want to be thankful for his proposals and their advice to them.
<seg>I want to summarize the proposals of this report that seem to me more important and concretely viable. First, the creation of a group of experts formed by personalities of recognized prestige, named by the Member States, to contribute to establish parameters minimal protections mediatic of the minors; second, the creation of a code of self-regulation between all the operators in the sector; third, the possibility of promoting and of turning as much into accessible the systems of filter for the television as for Internet.
<seg>Lamentably, I cannot subscribe requests of the liberal ones.
<seg>This continues being basically task of the law of the Member States, which does not exclude, nevertheless, the agreed possibility of an agreement to European level on certain indicative values, through dialogue with all the interested parties.
<seg>However, and to equality of other circumstances, fodder that is task of the parents of dissuading its children of which they see this kind of programme in house.
<seg>The parents need a special aid in this scope, that must include the following thing: parameters common for the mediatic protection of the minors in all the European territory of the European; the installation and the possibility of having systems of filter to affordable prices; legal dispositions regarding the protection of the minors and the responsibility of mass media, the companies and the suppliers of the public and deprived sector.
<seg>Then me it is strange, and this is euphemism, to hear to some to affirm, during debates in committee, that nothing proves the injurious influence that can have, on the children, television violence in all forms.
<seg>Concerning the introduction of a self-regulation code, it is necessary to make notice, particularly from the technical point of view, that in certain Member States the broadcasters already have introduced the codes of adjustment for televisions that would have to allow that the parents cut the current.
<seg>The debate is closed.
<seg>In particular, my report replaces the valuable international generalizations by a return, in fact, of the decisions to the Member States.
<seg>This would be the minimum to offer that space to us of freedom that is a fundamental right of all citizen of Europe.
<seg>There are things still, President, that have not been pleased from 1996.
<seg>Sir President, Mrs. Comisaria, Lordships, in the first place I want to be thankful to the rapporteurs, Messrs Evans and Mantovani, the work carried out.
<seg>I would recommend east report to the House and would recommend the support for the amendments presented/displayed by Mr. Evans.
<seg>Our human resources are our unique future in a world where the knowledge is what more bond.
<seg>The problems with green, white, black or red books are not solved, but with a concrete action.
<seg>But the Parliament, and is its paper, the Parliament pressed so that the investigators were in spite of everything including in the same text.
<seg>Today it visits to us in a while crucial for the future of construction of Europe.
<seg>Nevertheless, we know that the process has not concluded and that its inconclusión threatens its vitality.
<seg>If not it tenth now, in this delicate and boisterous stage of European and world-wide history, we will do when it?
<seg>No of us can try to know now with exactitude when and whereupon sequence we will reach these objectives. Nevertheless, all we know that believing in them and wishing them fervent, we will have crossed half of the way.
<seg>It is necessary to guard so that the women benefit from the induced works, without for that reason stopping avoiding that the same inequalities reproduce that in the most traditional sectors: specialized uses less, sometimes nonchosen a partial day, precarious contracts and lacks of access to the managerial positions.
<seg>A proposal of indicators will appear to the Council that allows to calibrate the obtained advances on the matter.
<seg>Finally and said briefly, the fourth pillar dedicated to the equality of opportunities reaffirms the integrated approach of the equality with gender mainstreaming and specific directives.
<seg>Fodder more in particular in the violences undergone by them, one of the priority issues of my government action and that it also mobilizes in particular - you are it to the Honourable member.
<seg>We know that the measures of conciliation of the family life and professional favor particularly the women, although still lack studies of the situation present of family and paper that the woman carries out in the same, that no longer is the traditional one, since the society has changed much and, paralelamente, the family structure also.
<seg>Sometimes, colleagues in this Parliament even think there are that them, but this is not thus.
<seg>It would want to finish, to Sir President, declaring that the equality of opportunities begins in the home.
<seg>That position seems to me embarrassing and ambiguous and deserves - I create reflection for the projects that set out to us, because he is not certainly that we end yet actually.
<seg>In that sphere there is no equality.
<seg>The European image of women, the one that is discovered throughout the pages of our report, of our directives, does not square with those Danish womens who are against in their majority the Euro.
<seg>In this sense it seems significant to me that the report insists on which there is to obtain a numerical balance in all the sectors of the society, for example on the labor market.
<seg>For this reason it seems to me that an opportunity at this report is had lost because the marriage and the family are completely marginalized.
<seg>He is something that also would have to consider the Commission on Human from the Woman and Equality from Opportunities!
<seg>We have the news that the previous Presidency of the Council first reconstructed the Ministry of Equality of Opportunities of its country soon to eliminate it.
<seg>The average salaries of the women continue being inferiors, on the average, in almost a 28% to those of the men, which contributes to that the women are the majority of the poor population and makes difficult its participation in the social and political life.
<seg>This is excellent.
<seg>Today we see in Europe a pauperización of the women employees and in France also, where 15% of them live, after all, with less than 3,650 francs French to the month.
<seg>All the countries have not been able to follow their example and I hope that the example of France ends up fructifying in other countries.
<seg>Evidently, the history of the women is very long.
<seg>It is necessary to really help the candidates to put itself at the level of the Community acquis.
<seg>But it would need its aid.
<seg>It is not the case, but it is a satisfactory text and, after thinking it long and after a broad debate, the Legal Affairs Committee chose not to present/display amendments.
<seg>Legal Affairs Committee, after long debate, understood that not was reasonable to maintain legal uncertainty during six years, that three years, that is the term that settles down, is a term more than reasonable so that, with adequate resources and one it hastens median, it is possible to be gotten to establish if it has had or nonirregularity in a declaration.
<seg>Nº 15 is the amendment, regarding the fraud.
<seg>The objective to arrive mainly at a simplified communication but from high quality with a sufficiently flexible norm, an improvement of the tax collecting procedure and with a greater adaptation of the dispositions in the scope of the customs proceedings, responds to one of the market requirements unique and it has obtained, to such an extent that many countries have even been based on her to be able to participate quickly in the international trade.
<seg>Palace, its effort and the interest whereupon have worked in the writing of this report.
<seg>Welcome
<seg>It would wish that did not change the sense of the vote that will be expressed, but the truth is that there is to verify the translation of the French version.
<seg>Sir President, I have voted in favor of the report Evans.
<seg>One is clear that the knowledge of foreign languages is a necessary prior condition for mobility.
<seg>Also we thought that the Member States, by themselves, will have to decide the taxes that wish to apply.
<seg>Moan somewhat that the so necessary proposal to introduce a period of limitation that allows to conserve the documentation during a limited period has not obtained the majority of the votes.
<seg>During the negotiations of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we congratulated ourselves of inclusion of Article 13 regarding the discriminations based on sex, the race or the ethnic origin, the philosophical religion or nonsectarian convictions, the incapacity, the age and the sexual orientation.
<seg>My final point talks about to the budget of this program, that is to say, 98.4 million Euros, sum that is, naturally, insufficient for the predicted actions.
<seg>The arguments used in this amendment one explicitly comes off that its intention is to also take part in the effective stipulations of age in the Member States, which are, nevertheless, perfectly just for reasons of psychological development and they do not have any repercussion in the working life.
<seg>In my opinion, all whatever also exceeds is stipulated twice in new article 12.
<seg>With respect to the creed or the religion, the PLPE greets the principle of protection in this scope.
<seg>. (SV) The Christians Democrat we applauded the proposal for a directive on equality in the world of work.
<seg>But this only says to something of the group of an internal audit service and nothing of the financial importance nor of the utility of this service.
<seg>The EU has decided to put a military capability still on common to fulfill the calls nevertheless objectives of Petersberg (the fight against the crises and the conflict resolution outside the territory of the EU) and, does not have a common defence policy.
<seg>The world would be safer without arms.
<seg>With this resolution it is not wanted to reduce the arms sales radically to favor a policy of disarmament, but to only regulate them to assure plus the benefits of the industrial groups.
<seg>The Commission communication recognizes the problem but it does not offer concrete measures because she is ofuscada in the logic of the liberalisation of the market and the competitiveness, and thus any proposal touches harsh reality, especially for the children, of the libertinism of the multinational companies, that, in his it looks for of the benefit, they ignore the repercussion of its programs and products and transfer all the responsibility to the parents, inviting them in addition to consume new products to protect its children.
<seg>Like the rapporteur, I believe that the directed measures to protect the young people of the violent and detrimental programs do not have to be limited the traditional television, but to be applied to all the mass media.
<seg>With an average of three hours per day, it is the more important human activity after the dream and, for the adults, after the work.
<seg>On the other hand, the women occupy often “flexible” positions; the temporary contracts or the low wages are typical of the sectors that mainly employ women.
<seg>That they continue falling as primary victims of cuts in the public spending, of the privatizations in the area of health, the right to the medical and pharmaceutical attention - at the most to the right on the prevention programs and information.
<seg>B5-0792/2000 of Messrs Marset Fields and I gave Lello Finuoli, in the name of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Nordic Green, on the situation of crisis in Peru.
<seg>Sir President, in fact would wish that instead of to celebrate a debate on Latin America on the occasion of some matter of urgency we would approach this subject after a meditated good discussion in the commissions.
<seg>We must try that Peru arrives at the goal with candidates who are around the challenge and which they can respond to the demand of the Peruvian people of a political renovation and a substantial democracy.
<seg>The joint debate is closed.
<seg>However, we know that the Afghanistan is not far, that Afghanistan is world-wide the producing major of opiate and, therefore, we know and we can to imagine paper that carries out those political Mafias, that are not only political, in the expansion of trade of the drug.
<seg>It asks to the Commission that adopts humanitarian aid programmes directed to the Afghan populations, not to forget to anybody in the territory.
<seg>The suffering that brings about east conflict is tremendous.
<seg>For years, a budget line finances programs of cleaning of mines and prevention.
<seg>Paciotti. I can assure to him that today I will ask in the Commission what has happened and what it assumes is going to happen to average the destined one to the retirement of mines.
<seg>B5-0794/2000 of Messrs Medina Ortega, Linkohr and Fava, in the name of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, on the kidnapping in Colombia of a participant Spanish Jesuit in the negotiations with the guerillas;
<seg>Unfortunately, all we would want not to have to return to speak of Colombia.
<seg>The Commission already has shown its disposition to coordinate the measures of this package. About the coming days it thinks to destine ample resources to this aim.
<seg>Therefore, once again, to two pesos and two measures are applied, and I believe that we must deplore it.
<seg>The attitude adopted by the Albanian opposition is to me especially incomprehensible, since it consciously refuses to accept a solution essential destined to remedy an Albanian problem in Macedonia.
<seg>It seems to me that he is something extraordinary that the Macedonians within their country reach agreements to each other.
<seg>Nevertheless, the Government, who has provided to samples of an extremely valuable when looking for a university solution to the problem and other many subjects, needs positive clear indications as well as a strong support. On the contrary, the consequences for La Paz in the zone can be ominous.
<seg>The anticipated PHARE resources for the year 2000 within the framework of the national program can be used also to help to the University during the academic coming year, that is to say, course 2001-2002.
<seg>I want to indicate that already today all the Greek Members to the European Parliament we have reacted before this situation.
<seg>And as all this concerns Greece, that counts on the greater maritime sector of all the European Union, basically concerns to the security of all the navigation in the all the Union.
<seg>In the last years, in our own waters, many lives have been given to the sea, not only in major accidents of ferries but also, with excessive frequency, among our fishing community.
<seg>On the contrary, it is operated to the innocent victims to foment ampler objectives of the shipping companies.
<seg>We have to consider that also is European credibility of the European here.
<seg>In order to finalize it would want to emphasize that the Commission totally is convinced that the problem of the European legal provisions on the security of the passage ships must constitute one of priority concerns of the European Union, and that is to guarantee a strict application and uniforms of the same in all the Community.
<seg>. Mrs. Presidenta, ladies and honourable Members, discúlpenme by to have arrived a little take for reasons that the Honourable member good know, to both make a brief statement on subjects that are in the order of business: the situation in Belgrade, and the ex--Republic of Yugoslavia generally, and the situation in the Middle East.
<seg>Commissioner Verheugen is going to express itself, like it has made Mr. Solana, on both subjects that occupy to us behind schedule this, that is to say the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.
<seg>We must show arranged to us to fulfill this promise as soon as the will of the town is respected.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, Mr. Representing Alto, gentleman Commissioner, I participate in this debate with reserves, because it did not want in a while that the Parliament appeared solely like an authorized judge to send an anathema against such-and-such, in that, after the hopes so vivamente encouraged right here a month ago, we faced to the dramatic consequences of this new explosion of violence in Near East.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, my intervention of today is not based on a remote number of analyses, but on my personal experiences of the last week, since by chance she found me in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip when these disturbances happened there.
<seg>Although I am against all violence, it is not possible to be dealt with in the same rasero the Israeli violence and Palestinian violence.
<seg>It would want to ask to him to the Parliament, in these critics moments, that a statement of support to brave that today they have defended the freedom in the streets of Belgrade, becoming the echo of the support emits that we, the European, not for so many years loans to those people who in other capitals also fought by their freedom.
<seg>European, Mrs. Presidenta, without a doubt would be very inspired if they gathered to the flight the ball that the President of the Palestinian legislative Council sent to us right here.
<seg>The position of Jerusalem is the complex issue in the negotiations.
<seg>During years it has been able to deceive the inhabitants of his country with his propaganda machine and the brutal repression of mass media and, unfortunately, also has been able to engatusar to numerous people of the western world creating a false image of the reality.
<seg>While the drama concludes, it is obligation of this Parliament, like symbol of united Europe and frees, to support to the masses around the Yugoslav Parliament and to help Mr. Kostunica to reach and to carry out its mandate.
<seg>Exactly its so hard position makes us fear the worse thing at the same time - and the current events corroborate these phrases that were written up hours ago.
<seg>I wonder myself if the Commissioner already is studying the steps that there are to give to make clear that we really considered to Kostunica like the legitimate elected representative of Serbian people, and like the authentic interlocutor with whom the European Union wants to speak as of today.
<seg>The European Parliament wants to express its total at this moment historical solidarity to him in which the tyranny staggers and prevails the democracy.
<seg>In accordance with the order of business, it is come to the debate on the report (A5-0237/2000) of Mr. Seppänen, in the name of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council by which the Decision modifies 2000/24/CE with the purpose of to extend the guarantee granted by the Community to the European Investment Bank to the loans for projects in the Croatia (COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336/2000 - 2000/0122 (CNS)).
<seg>It is necessary to greet the new political direction that was abrió in this country after the legislative and presidential elections.
<seg>Between Unión and the Croatia it exerts its functions, among others, a group of advisors whose mission is within the framework to offer to the Croatia its experience and technical assistance to him of the negotiations for the normalisation of relations agreements.
<seg>We do not forget that until recently, the Croatia constituted an textbook example of a privatisation programme completely bankrupt, del that only benefitted a few. This process will have to lean in its totality.
<seg>The amount of 250 million Euros in the form of a loan of the EIB for period 2000-2007 that we are debating will not be a landmark, but it will serve as aid and promotion.
<seg>For that reason he is not absolutely correct that is spoken in the report of ´democratización `.
<seg>When the Croatia and Slovakia obtained an apparent independence for the first time, they acted like vasallos of the regime of Hitler.
<seg>Also we could, naturally, have considered the question of the guarantee request and the Croatian question in the same context of the debate of yesterday in the evening and the situation in Belgrade.
<seg>When it seems that Milosevic has fled and who the will of the town has prevailed, we trusted that the actions to establish an association and a normal relation between Serbia and this Union of democracies are only delayed days.
<seg>I declare resumed the period of sessions of the European, interrupted Parliament Friday 6 of October of 2000.
<seg>(The Assembly, still on, keeps a minute from silence)
<seg>My question is the following one: Who is authorized to speak in the name of the European Parliament on this Statute?
<seg>Him request, Mrs Presidenta, that does you all the managements possible to make agile the current proceeding in the Committee on Petitions about a writing of protest which they have presented/displayed more than thirty social groups and NGO against this situation, in that flagrantly has failed to fulfill the Community legislation on radiation protection.
<seg>The autopsy practiced in Georgia has demonstrated clearly that it was a murder with possible tortures.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, honourable Members, the opportunity appears to take a great step to us towards our dream - that by the others, I do not share.
<seg>This is the basic legislation and the foundation for any other norm regarding modified plants by means of genetic technology.
<seg>Evidently, it goes of a metedura from leg to another one.
<seg>(The session, interrupted to the 17,40 hours, is started again to the 17,50 hours)
<seg>In accordance with the order of business it is come to the debate on the report (A5-0291/2000) of Mrs Van Lacker, in the name of the Committee on Employment and Social affairs, on the Commission communication to Council (COM (2000) 379 - 0508/2000 - 2000/2219 (COS), to the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the sociopolitical agenda.
<seg>Thirdly, only one question: to emphasize the importance of this open method of coordination does not mean that this method is going to replace the social legislation, because there are to also determine to Europe the social rights, we must dare to write up the minimum social standards and is essential that a social legislation with a view to the inner European market becomes.
<seg>Also, in our opinion we supported the social dialogue and the collaboration with the civil society and especially with the associations of women of the countries that are preparing their annexation to the European family, since also we must there obtain a development uniforms that it follows the steps and the logic of the rest of Europe.
<seg>The areas of action enumerated in the Commission communication have been also object in a general agreement.
<seg>Memory, to this height of my intervention, that will be celebrated in Biarritz an European seminary, which I will preside, on that subject days 4 and 5 of December.
<seg>Regarding the fight against the exclusions, we have progressed much when defining, 17 of October the last, in the Council over “Use and social Policy”, appropriate objectives of fight against poverty and the social exclusion that will be used basic for national action plans.
<seg>I have heard in some circles that, after to have read the report, are in agreement with the diagnosis, but not with the formula.
<seg>The technological development and the new methods of organisation also speak in favor of a flexible cooperation where we bet more by objectives and to less secure results and by a rigid regulation.
<seg>It is necessary to look for by that side, in our opinion, the archaism that is reproached to them to that they hope that a market without obstacles is the best one of worlds.
<seg>Certainly, it has contributed to reduce the displeasure between the workers in our country and to increase the investments in the country coming from the outside.
<seg>However, the used method seems more debatable.
<seg>If we spoke of a Charter of Fundamental and if we watched an European Constitution favorably we cannot be strabismic, but we must say that they are had to take all the necessary steps, although this demands one more a more kind legislation. I do not believe that the Mrs
<seg>It would want to critically indicate the absence of initiatives on the new challenges in employment protection, the participation of the workers and the labor relations.
<seg>Sir President, I also want to congratulate so much to the rapporteur as to Mrs. Comisaria and the minister, Mrs Péry, by this presentation of the Social policy agenda.
<seg>As we know, the conservatives are against those points. Our Group attributes a very particular importance to them.
<seg>The third subject is the extension.
<seg>The voting will take place Wednesday to the 12,30 hours.
<seg>The Commission measures must be complemented with studies on the individual access to the systems of health and the social pension and security systems, deficiency in the job organization and, perhaps, also general diminution of the labor day.
<seg>This way, the women will feel Europe close more, and also Europe will win with interesting and innovating the ideas that they are expressed by means of his relation with this program.
<seg>We wait for an annual report of the President of the Commission within the framework of a debate that is celebrated annually in the European Parliament.
<seg>I am glad apart from which it is predicted one better distribution of the child care to facilitate the balance between professional life and family life.
<seg>To my it will consider it Group in its final vote.
<seg>(The President interrupts to the speaker)
<seg>The fresh approach of the Commission seems to me very positive, and thought the proposal for a decision for program 2001-2005 very well.
<seg>I believe that the considerable number of amendments approved shows to the common feeling of the European Commission and the Commission on Human of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities.
<seg>On the one hand, throughout the past year I have received several requests of companies that have felt a certain impotence as a result of certain decisions on fusions, mainly related to cases where they have had necessity to appeal the Commission decision before the Court of First Instance.
<seg>Also I want to take this opportunity to ask Commissioner Monti exceeds when we can hope that one starts up a public register, effective cash and of State aids, and also on when reality will be made long the engaged table of results.
<seg>Also, it would want to make the observation to Commissioner Monti of which it is important that in the forthcoming report we find a section rather more extensive dedicated to the financial services sector.
<seg>What I have said is not only worth for the policy area energetics, but also for the totality of the other scopes.
<seg>Sir Commissioner Monti, in the name of the Italian radicals, I also want to give thanks to the rapporteurs for the excellent job realised concerning both information that emit a positive judgment as much on their personal work as on the one of the Directorate General of Competition.
<seg>I emphasize this because the market cannot regulate everything and in this sense it does not have either to exist nor it can exist an unrestricted competition.
<seg>Sir President, today nobody discusses and, of course, I am not going it to do, who the public aid alters the conditions of competition and constitutes a harmful element that it urges the inefficiency of the companies.
<seg>To hear to him deny the fact that the public aid is handicapped during period 1994-1998, when the same Commission recognizes that reduction, has been at least quite strange.
<seg>And, evidently, Sir President, although my opinion talks about to XXIX the Commission report on competition policy, we cannot at the moment stop watching the past, but nothing else that to learn facing the future.
<seg>Sir President, during the time which I have, I want to approach three points: the modernization of the Community law in the matter of competition, the developed activity in 1999 in relation to the rules of the competition and the subject of State aids.
<seg>The Commission has continued acting especially signs and against the cartels and the abuses of dominant position.
<seg>Mr. Rapkay, for the Commission has been very important to count on the support of the European Parliament in the search of his policy of competition and I do not believe that this endorsement is going to disappear.
<seg>This mechanism can be activated or at the request of a Member State or in accordance with article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, a Monetary disposition that continues being in force during the third Economic phase of European and for the States which, at the present time, they are object of an exception, that is to say, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.
<seg>Facing the future, the resource to the capital market would have to continue being the unique possible option.
<seg>Therefore, I ask that the report in its current version obtains the conformity of the Assembly and that in this way can also be used in the scope of the propagating material of the grapevine in the internal market.
<seg>Today, its revision is made taking into account the evolution necessary of the phytosanitary regulations and realised the scientific and technical progresses, in particular in which to the test-tube multiplication it talks about
<seg>Also, with this precautionary principle, I consider that to talk about to the possibility of genetic modifications it means, for example, to reduce the intensive use of phytosanitary treatments. On the other hand, in the sense of the precaution the amendments of the Mrs go
<seg>In conclusion, honourable Members, to respect the precautionary principle, as much in their spirit as in their letter, if unfortunately the articles and amendments that I finish mentioning were not retired officers, would make lack rely on the opinion of Marianne Isler Béguin, and therefore of the Environment Committee, and vote in favor of their suppression.
<seg>Sir President, if he allows me: Sir Commissioner, could you give your opinion about the amendment by the Committee of Environment, Public Health and Consumer policy us? It is amendment 1.
<seg>The unique aspect on which it would be possible to be discussed is the one if I must have taken note or as soon as the French Government did not transmit the resolution to me of decay of the mandate of Mr. Le Pen.
<seg>I have to remember to the Honourable member that the voting will be celebrated later, the 12,30 hours.
<seg>In the field of justice and the internal affairs, I am optimistic on a solution for the civil judicial cooperation.
<seg>The preparatory group is going to totally play its role until the 19 of November, date of the forthcoming meeting at ministerial level.
<seg>We needed that vivifying climate, since Mr. Moscovici has said and also I felt, in the level the Heads of State or of Government, a very serious sensation of in a while historical collective and historical responsibility of construction of Europe.
<seg>Simply there will be, Lordships, that to guard from now on, as far as those subjects of the qualified majority, so that we are not more here of the spirit or the climate of Biarritz.
<seg>The small countries are not to the orders of the greatest countries of the European Union!
<seg>It would be thankful to him to the President of the Council that clarified east end.
<seg>On the one hand, the Kostunica presence of the President was an historic event.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, Sir President of the Council, Sir Commissioner, although advances have been obtained on the enhanced cooperations and the qualified extension of qualified majority, subsists deep discords on the composition of the Commission and the consideration of the votes in the Council, since you have indicated.
<seg>It seems to me that we go in the opposite direction.
<seg>Those that remains outside the enhanced cooperation really enjoy the same freedom that the passengers of the seats of back of a car.
<seg>I am not here, like the Honourable member, to either ingest me in the internal affairs German, but I believe that position is deeply coherent and follows, by the others, the direction that wishes the Commission, if not equivocal me.
<seg>We have begun to interchange opinions in that respect, than one follows that all the Member States wish the maintenance of that maximum limit after the extension.
<seg>I believe that it will not be thus.
<seg>First: sometimes we have had the impression that in Biarritz there was an obsession by the debate between the Member the small ones and the great ones.
<seg>From that point of view, I believe that it is not enough with saying that the Community method is due to safeguard.
<seg>Also, when the states candidates enter, each Member State must be able to maintain attached or main a commissioner.
<seg>The wording of the text of article 93 is so much more dramatic whatever that, once obtained the first wave of enlargement, will be to us still more impossible to advance towards the qualified majority.
<seg>It is necessary to convince the citizens of those countries of the clear merits of any new European Treaty.
<seg>To imagine that the fears fed during generations could yield without new frights to the definitive pacification, prelude of the reconciliation, would have been to not know the means of similar crisis.
<seg>Also it worries the smaller correspondence to me in the question that asks for the Parliament on the democratization.
<seg>The guilty of this are rather that plead so that major reforms become before the extension.
<seg>On the one hand the command decision of the Israeli Government to congeal the peace negotiations by the violence in the zone and to center its efforts in the creation of a Government of concentration with the Head of the opposition, Mr.
<seg>We have found out with very many satisfaction of the victory of the people of Yugoslavia and the election of Kostunica like president.
<seg>I advise to Mr. Baron Crespo who asks his Italian colleagues who explain to him why they are in the Government in Italy with an openly communist party and why they are being prepared to participate in the political choices with another openly communist party, the Party of Communist Refundación.
<seg>On the contrary, in this scope it would be necessary to advance in the implementation of the codecision procedure!
<seg>The Commission, that has the possibility of making its decisions by simple majority, is in one more a more favorable situation to give this impulse in the future.
<seg>The Union does not need now visionary that has the telescope put in 2030, but has necessity of leaders who are able to catch the problems that will bring with himself the consumation of the extension within 3 to 8 years, as well as to facilitate answers to the same.
<seg>Thus, then, one is an open work that has not fallen of above and it has not been imposed.
<seg>The debate is closed.
<seg>For want of this fundamental reference, in the best one of the cases we stopped being understood, and in the worse one, we killed ourselves between us.
<seg>The democracy has improved in Europe, but, on the other hand, the European democracy is ill.
<seg>Today, 24 of October of 2000, in Strasbourg, the European Parliament says something simple, it says and it very high: the European Constitution? Yes, you can obtain it, yes we wished, it.
<seg>That is to say, the same express idea that insularity of in case it is a sufficient criterion.
<seg>I will go to the essential concentrating me in the excellent points of the Gil-Rivet report by the chairman, del that I will say that excellent encounter simply to it.
<seg>First of all, the one of a simplification and a clarification of Treaties.
<seg>I am not going to go more far, because we are not here - in any case, I am not here -, to debate the report by the Institute of Florence.
<seg>According to the information - I am going to be technician, perdónenme - that has been communicated to the Presidency, I believe that a clear majority of the linguistic versions, contrary to the Italian version, only makes reference, for the application of the cohesion policy, to the favored islands less, and not to the islands generally.
<seg>Mr. Duhamel, without a doubt you in agreement with me when affirming that if there is success in no Nize, there will be no site, there will be no credibility at least, for a reflection on the future of European integration will be, at least within the framework present.
<seg>The mentioned European Constitution also will have to establish of clear way the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union and of incorporating the dynamics of European integration in those scopes, like the one of the foreign policy and of security, in which an common action is essential.
<seg>They could also be necessary to surpass persistent blockades.
<seg>It is necessary to clarify to distribution of powers and the principle of subsidiarity.
<seg>As it is already known, in the different Member States and between the diverse social forces very different opinions exist on the matter.
<seg>Unfortunately, the final objective of an European Constitution would be exactly the opposite, and is evident that we cannot approve it.
<seg>Indeed, in the reinforced European home, there will be towns invited to, possibly fiscal military, monetary the table, and later the other towns, that will be alongside.
<seg>It is evident that the second version is not correct because, first, with one or the other form the Structural Funds cover the worked against regions economically and, secondly, because if this interpretation were the correct one, we would not speak on the adoption of the declaration nº30.
<seg>Sir President, I am going to center my small sixty seconds in the report of Olivier Duhamel, who is an excellent report, because she dares to say the things clearly, and the lyricism of our rapporteur has convinced to us definitively of it does awhile.
<seg>In my opinion, the unity of Europe only can be political.
<seg>It seems to us that the new Constitution would have to be on the verge of entering in force for the forthcoming European elections.
<seg>Consequently, the denomination of “less developed” is applied so much to the island regions as to the rest of the regions and, according to the proposal of Mr. Barnier, which fits here is a modification of the Italian text of the Treaty, in accordance with the dispositions of the Convention of Vienna.
<seg>The debate is closed.
<seg>As my colleague said that she was going to vote against, that amendment decays.
<seg>Sir President, which is being requested here is a formula for the chaos.
<seg>I welcome with approval the approval by the EP of the Trakatellis report, because it arranges that very strict norms of quality and safety of blood settle down and the blood derivatives.
<seg>If the immunity Member of the European is independent, the French authorities must to us have required of the rise of the one of Mr. Le Pen.
<seg>I feel particularly disappointed by the vote of the EP on the report regarding the proliferation of the vineyards.
<seg>For some, the alcohol is like the tobacco and drugs, a product that harms much to they consume which it and to the people who are to his around; others, on the contrary, mainly see like a source of employment and something it and so much money can be won.
<seg>The rapporteur generally welcomes with approval the proposals in the White Paper of the Commission in that respect, but the possible implications of the reform worry to him, directed mainly to decentralize the application of the rules of the competition.
<seg>. (FR) Although, in the debate of yesterday in the evening, I congratulated to Jonathan Evans by its work, had to express of entrance my deep disagreement with the liberal approach, excessively even ultraliberal, of its report.
<seg>The Agency of Industrial Development of Ireland has been reorganizing its direction to secure half of the new resulting places of work of projects in new zones in the region of objective 1 in the three coming years.
<seg>The state interventions, the financings and other financial incentives or public prosecutors, sometimes, come to balance something this situation before the howl who bring about the consequences of this policy.
<seg>(The session, interrupted to the 14,06 hours, is started again to the 15,00 hours)
<seg>The situation in October of 2000, when already it lacks little to make a decision on budget figures 2001, is the following one.
<seg>Nevertheless, the Council did not have repairs in altogether reducing the agricultural expenditure in 555 million Euros.
<seg>By the others, also we considered, like is logical, that 400 additional positions are not due to create simply, besides the present ones.
<seg>I only can recommend the Council to him who follows our example.
<seg>The administration of this Camera must be, therefore, to the service of the deputies and not to the inverse one.
<seg>The Court of Auditors is the one that less preoccupations he causes to us at the moment.
<seg>Finally, also it corresponds to us to examine the budget of the European Ombudsman.
<seg>On the contrary, we especially thought that the investigation would be due to reinforce, with a view to the accession of the countries candidates.
<seg>We also propose that it is continued informing regularly the Parliament.
<seg>And when a legislative agreement is celebrated on social affairs, culture or environment - the Commissariats are going to recognize that I am right we met the Commissioner for budgets, the ministers of Property and the members of the Committee on Budgets to say jointly, so that a financial mistake is not committed.
<seg>Sir President, Lordships, Mrs. Comisaria, ladies, gentlemen, thanks for its welcome.
<seg>By the others, when giving rooms for manoeuvre, especially with respect to ceilings of heading 3 and of heading 4, the Council wants to offer the Parliament, last competent body in relation to these nonobligatory expenses, the possibility of expressing his priorities without returning to put those of the Council at issue. Therefore, simply I will insist on the most outstanding points of the Council draft budget.
<seg>These are two subjects often appellants in the debates between the Parliament and the Council and that could give rules, if care is not had, to tension between both arms of the budgetary authority.
<seg>The situation is similar with regard to the structural policy.
<seg>The result of the conciliation of this summer was also satisfactory, like already has indicated Mr. Naval Colom i, concretely in the sense that in the future the information to the Parliament in relation to the legal bases with repercussions will be extended also on the expenses.
<seg>Permítanme that remembers to them that in the financial perspective that were only adopted the past year they anticipated 1,850 million for the Balkan Mountains for all the period until 2006.
<seg>I request to them once again that they examine this proposal - leaves it to the Commission on the table without preconceived judgments and also contemplate that it like a possibility.
<seg>That material was, evidently, useful for the preparation of the budget for 2001 and the granting discharge of the management in exercise 1999.
<seg>Although, like member of the same, I value much the work of this commission and in spite of the deep respect that deserves to me the work of the rapporteurs, in my Monetary capacity as rapporteur of the Economic Committee and I do not want to stop insisting on two amendments that our commission returns to present/display now before the Plenary session and which they continue being important although they have reduced the posts.
<seg>With these measures we set out to obtain that the judicial control returns to work totally, to restore legal confidence in the safety within the European Union and to consolidate its character of Community of law.
<seg>The suppression of this initiative from the Commission, without replacing it by no other, was clearly opposite to the political desire of the Summit in Lisbon and the priorities of this Assembly.
<seg>It was an amazing decision and many of us we had the sensation of which that most important program had passed to be simply a ball of soccer in a party between the Committee on Budgets and the Commission.
<seg>The third question is the European agricultural policy as now figure in the budgetary proposal.
<seg>If the use is the political priority of the European, the fishing, as an economic sector more, cannot be stayed to the margin.
<seg>I feel especially satisfied with which the funding of the programmes has been able to be guaranteed SOCRATES, JUVENTD and CULTURE 2000, who finalized at the end of the past year.
<seg>For example, our aid to the Mediterranean countries account with a delay that affects the budgets of many years.
<seg>Sir President, in the debates of previous years I spoke in the name of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Mass media and Sport, which it has represented Mrs Iivari this behind schedule.
<seg>But it would mean to the Parliament this behind schedule that we do not have to lose of view that the EU spends only 1% of the GIP and the administration of a great part is the responsibility of the Member States.
<seg>Permítaseme to happen to the overall strategy.
<seg>With this passage to the strategy of our Group, because the fundamental thing of our conception is the desire of which the bottoms have a yield adapted for the European citizens.
<seg>On the contrary, we must toil for a Parliament that campaigns in favor of the transparency, the efficiency and the effective democratic control of the European institutions.
<seg>When this happens we must reflect how we can solve this problem.
<seg>We want to drive the processes of democratisation and we want to maintain a balanced relationship between the traditional fields of the foreign policy that now we must take care of.
<seg>The main problems in the first draft of budgets are related to the external actions.
<seg>Of course, a rigorous management is necessary; supported we it and we would not have to try to elude it.
<seg>It is an extremely exceptional initiative, mainly in first reading, and is an ungrateful initiative, since it cannot, in the current context, to obtain a majority of votes in favour.
<seg>Said this, the importance of grant for Kosovo does not stop posing some problems.
<seg>The budgetary policy must take care of which the citizen trusts the European policy.
<seg>All the directed measures to fortify to the small and medium enterprises also deserve, therefore, our support.
<seg>budgetary implementation rate;
<seg>Preserving that strategic line in the exposition of the budgets of this year and the next ones, the European Parliament totally occupies its space in the budgetary process.
<seg>With the transference of 175 million Euros, we have calculated, approximately, 25 million Euros more than we hoped.
<seg>As for MEDA, the Council it said that the commitments were not a problem, in view of the eight years of delays in the payments.
<seg>I believe that Mr. Duff was present this morning when we mentioned the European Council in Biarritz.
<seg>My answer will be very simple.
<seg>Ramiro Zapata has been the last one of the 25 defenders of the assassinated human rights and, recently, the Colombian press has denounced “Plan 100” of the paramilitary groups to assassinate one hundred defenders of the human rights.
<seg>Today I feel a little more satisfied than in July with the attitude with the Council, because, like often in crisis situations, the European Union always seems the last authority in arriving at the international stage and making hear its voice.
<seg>The question, gentleman President, and I finish, is if there is no a formula of pressure greater than the proposal by the President in its information and if the aid that we are going to give is completely going to be different from the one of the United States, that is to say, directed not to the fumigation of the cultures, but to the substitution of cultures and also to the social aspects and not to the military.
<seg>The questions that other deputies and I have formulated refer very concretely to the situation in Colombia.
<seg>For being similar subjects, questions 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 will be answered jointly.
<seg>Subject: Tax on the financial transactions the vindication in favor of a tax burden of the speculative capitals has been gaining land in the last months, with the proliferation of committees ATTAC (Association pour unites South Taxation them Transactions financières ET pour l´Aide aux Citoyens) in France and Europe, and the proposed amendments in the French National Assembly and the Senate of the same country.
<seg>Also it would like, me that she was responded to the question of its influence on the volatileness of the exchange markets and, especially, of the effect of a tax of the 0.1 by thousands on the speculators who wait for devaluations of the order from the 20 to 50%.
<seg>On the other hand, it requests in section 6 the establishment of an arbitration international organisation to reduce the debt of the countries of the South.
<seg>By the others, it is what it happened in the case of the Euro in the scale of a year, or to lament it or to wish it.
<seg>I will add, to which Danielle Auroi said does a little while in relation to the countries of the South, that some estimations, formulated by specialists, they give interesting figures: for example, a fan that goes of 50,000 to 250,000 million dollars, that could recover of a tax Tobin type. The PNUD, on the other hand, it number in an amount of 40,000 million annual dollars, an amount that could be enough to give minimum living conditions to hundreds of million people who lack everything in the countries of the developing world.
<seg>The disease has been detected during the last months, for example, in different places from France.
<seg>Being useful that appears a representative of the French Presidency, I ask: will be paid these slaughters of bovine at the expense of the budgetary resources of the EU or will pay you to them of the national budgets, and consider you who would be indicated that they were pleased of the Budget of the EU?
<seg>I request indulgence please to him so that it can hear the answer.
<seg>Therefore, the action of both governments interested is limited by this international right.
<seg>It seems to me a mystery that the Commission already can say in February and the Council in July how much it is needed.
<seg>Acting of this form in the name of subsidiarity, in fact, the Union abdicates of one of its tasks since it has happened in these weeks as much in the north of Italy like in Spain.
<seg>Like Member of the European Parliament interested in that majority, how I can approve the cost of 11,500 million of the contributors of the United Kingdom - it is to say, our present annual contribution, when it does not count on an ample public approval?
<seg>With a flexible position on the part of the Council, it would be possible to be reached an agreement in second reading to close the budget.
<seg>If anybody still is not convinced, that it examines the tests simply.
<seg>Joan Naval Colom i, vice-president in charge of the buildings, already has introduced that strategy.
<seg>The political messages in the budget of this year are - since already Commissioner Schreyer- has said to the gentleman many. The reconstruction of the agricultural policy, the new structural programmes, to assure one better implementation of structural policy, the pursuit of the decisions made in the Summit in Lisbon regarding the creation of one more the EU and hard more competitive and to the fight against social exclusion.
<seg>The war of NATO has made too many damage and has caused too much misery.
<seg>In spite of which one remembered, sometimes I wonder myself if it is possible to achieve that objective with the budgetary current restrictions without undermining necessary the agricultural budget for a sustainable rural sector in the present Member States.
<seg>And I say to them of clear and unequivocal way: to Kostunica we must give an opportunity to him and I hope that in the coming weeks or months it starts up an amnesty, but meanwhile yes I want that at political and budgetary level political conditions to the execution of these two new budget lines, that is to say, the democratization and the reconstruction are put.
<seg>The Yugoslav elections have demonstrated two things: finally, people are indifferent of the dictator Milosevic and at the same time she trusts professor Kostunica.
<seg>In addition, I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners will be soon in freedom.
<seg>Not to inevitably make it, in “financial engineering”, the redistributions and the reductions either in the general expenses or in the environmental social spending and or in the cooperation caímos, but the certain thing is that, in spite of that, the allocations for the Balkan Mountains will continue being insufficient.
<seg>Against this background, efforts are required to solve the major social problems like, for example, unemployment.
<seg>There is a subject that is, by all means, of much importance: we have begun focusing category four, but it has still not been absolutely clear if we have been able to provide a solution to him, also because the Council refuses in full contributing ideas.
<seg>In all budget work the priorities are important.
<seg>This is not very serious in the horizon next to the expiry of the Treaty, but it would be worrisome if the legal framework postmint maintained the possibility of prolonging similar practices.
<seg>And in this way step third commentary, to the challenge that hopes to us now.
<seg>The new financial arrangement does not indicate anything on the matter. I have been able to verify that the European citizens distrust more and more of the politicians.
<seg>I pay tribute to them for that reason.
<seg>The availability to the dialogue of all the implied Institutions has given rise to an exemplary cooperation who will allow us I wait for, it sincerely, to arrive at a consensus in first reading.
<seg>Who we represented the European values in a skeptical country the EU we now found a new argument in favor of the Union, that is to say, one better individual protection of privacy, something that is important for the citizens in the modern society.
<seg>In my home country the law of personal data will reform, undressing to the power parliamentarians on the Commission decisions.
<seg>Many other points also pose problems and deserve the judgment of the practice to see themselves assured.
<seg>The Commission would wish in the first place to remember the commitment that all we have adopted with personal the citizens to guarantee data protection treated by the institutions.
<seg>With this declaration, the Commission accepts that the scope of the regulation is limited the activities of the first pillar exclusively.
<seg>With a view to honoring the political agreement that has concluded with the Council and the rapporteur to allow the approval in first reading, the Commission rejects any other amendment that does not comprise of the Paciotti report approved by the Parliamentary committee of Liberties and Rights of citizens, except for the amendment 69 that corrects amendment 41.
<seg>Thus, he is urgent that the personnel of the interservice group is itself reinforced quickly in the heart of the Secretary General of the Commission, in order that all the proposed acts of general scope can be seen accompanied, during its examination on the part of the school, in agreement with the paragraph 2º of article 299, by a detailed card of impact.
<seg>From the point of view of the Committee of Legal Affairs and Internal market, which interests to me to stand out is that, in fact, equal can only be tried which is equal.
<seg>Given the importance of fisheries for the most remote regions, I cannot less than feel ashamed on the matter.
<seg>Until today, since under the presidency of Delors an Interservice group for the outermost regions was created, we have crossed a length and fruitful way and to that European Group has presided over I I must express the deep appreciation of the ultra-peripheral ones.
<seg>Indeed although already before the Treaty of Rome reference to the French overseas departments was made, was necessary to wait for until 1989 and the tie specific action programmes to the distance and insularity, the famous POSEI, so that the European Union admitted finally that the permanence and the combination of the structural problems of the outermost regions justified a special treatment with respect to the other regions of the Community.
<seg>I do not doubt that the proposals that the Commission formulates the Council will take the seal of these qualities.
<seg>This question is made excellent more and more as the extension of the EU comes near towards the east.
<seg>And it nótese that right to difference is not more than an emanation of the equality principle, that also it demands that it is different form what is different.
<seg>One is a document that my equipment and I considered rich in ideas and that she does not elude any of the subjects that worry to the communitarian ultraperiphery.
<seg>Its report, Mrs. Sudre, make emphasis with reason in the necessity to act in the time. It makes moments.
<seg>As far as the relaunching of the diversification of the economy, we have advanced in several essential areas.
<seg>It is important now that an huge number of projects appears within the framework of the DOCUPS, but, paralelamente to this action on the ground we have to reflect deeply on the specific needs, the access, of each from those outermost regions to this society of the information.
<seg>Approval of the Minute of the previous sitting
<seg>Naturally I will inform to the President of its intervention.
<seg>The possibility that worries to me a general failure of numerous voting machines takes place, which would put in prohibition the decisions that the Assembly makes.
<seg>As much this Food authority as the legislative proposals that set out to us, directed toward guaranteeing food safety, is going to count on the support of this Parliament, Sir Commissioner.
<seg>Its main task consists of providing scientific advice, since the debate about food safety also has to be worthy of credit.
<seg>Sir President, to conclude would want to give thanks to the rapporteur by his constructive contribution and its disposition to consider the opinion of the other commissions.
<seg>When we faced a possible risk is important to apply the precautionary principle.
<seg>On the question still controverted of until where we would have to arrive concerning to allow him that it examines the nutrition, and even that presents/displays recommendations and is consulted by those whose main task is risk management, we have also said that in the matter of security, the subjects would have to be subject at least to the opinion and the advising of this food authority.
<seg>A central idea is to assure the survival the rich inheritance of traditions.
<seg>They are not the laws nor the norms those that feel the bases for this respectability, but integrity, the high academic quality, independence, the sense of the responsibility, the transparency and intelligibility.
<seg>Certainly, he is indispensable to start off of the base of a good scientific knowledge, to evaluate better the tie risks to the food chain, from the farm to the table.
<seg>Sir President, is clear that a considerable enthusiasm by the creation of an European Agency of food safety exists, as our rapporteur prefers to denominate it.
<seg>Bearing in mind that the program of the WHO continues counting on the necessary bottoms and the support, especially one with a reach so limited would be said that any necessity of another agency does not exist absolutely, as they are the 15 Member States of the European European.
<seg>Food safety is the basic condition for the consumer because the consumers want to feed themselves healthily and of it we to us must occupy.
<seg>If we do not only obtain a new directive frame many aspects related to food safety they will be paper tiger.
<seg>Consequently, we must in the same way modify the treaty of the EU in such a way that power is granted to the Commission to apply sanctions in the area of food, that today is made in the matter of competition.
<seg>Support to all the actors who support the strategy “foods for all” and that work in the policy area, office staff or another anyone.
<seg>I do not share these words, since we know that the man is not solely body.
<seg>This one must represent the true nucleus of coordination of the network of the agencies national that, as well, will have to start up and to coordinate a network of centers of excellence of food safety to regional basis.
<seg>I create, therefore, that their 11 amendment and my amendment 17 are perfectly compatible.
<seg>The reform of the nourishing laws of the European Union will be carried out concerning the European Union.
<seg>Its report does not pick up many proposals to amend, but it is limited to emphasize particular issues.
<seg>It is said very clearly in the report and I am glad of it.
<seg>However, the creation of a European Food of food safety is very positive.
<seg>It is possible to wish that these criteria by the good of the citizens of all the Union are fulfilled all.
<seg>I believe that one prevails to establish certain temporary margins in which the European Commission in the cases will have to be informed into just restlessness.
<seg>The EU must count on the highest levels possible of food safety for its citizens.
<seg>The Commission now proposes the creation of an European Food Authority.
<seg>I fear that Europe is in danger again to allow to an inflation apparatus of civil servants that is incapable to act.
<seg>As we created new levels of bureaucracy and we used more bottoms, every time it is less what we obtain in return.
<seg>It prevents similar or parallel works in several institutions.
<seg>Nevertheless, it is necessary to avoid that, under protection of the debate on the White Paper, it increases in the public opinion the fear to a bureaucratic Europe that influences in the quality of products without punishing of effective way the frauds that threaten the consumer health.
<seg>As you know, the Commission attributes the highest priority to its strategy on food safety.
<seg>The Commission has intention to adopt a proposal for a regulation by which the principles and global objectives of the food law settle down, that will provide the frame for the future health protection measures in nourishing matter.
<seg>Thank you very much, Sir Commissioner.
<seg>Happening now to our report, I consider the Commission proposal positive and I have to say that the Parliamentary committees of Foreign affairs and Development have worked intensely to still more improve it, if it fits, especially in some points.
<seg>Since it has said of very explicit and clear way Mrs Bonino, with the Commission proposal for a regulation a new step forward has occurred.
<seg>The Commission proposal for a regulation seems to us too vague.
<seg>It is necessary that grant for the elimination of the mines is organized of a reasonable way and that we finance research works to carry out works of detection and elimination, for instruments that can be used in situ of a simple way so that they indeed contribute a aid in the developing countries.
<seg>During last the eight years, we have contributed with more than 200 million Euros, at the expense of the Community budget, to the fight against the terrestrial mines.
<seg>But we cannot penalize the people who have an evil government.
<seg>First of all, since already I have mentioned, I believe that it would be an error, well-meaning, but counter-productive, to impose the adhesion to the Convention of Ottawa like essential requirement for the Community assistance to the anti-mine defense.
<seg>I cannot accept amendment 19.
<seg>Secondly, the international community must improve the coordination of its efforts at global level, as well as and in particular, within the affected countries.
<seg>Sir President, the Socialist Group shares the pride that finishes expressing Mr. van Orden with respect to the role played by the European Union.
<seg>They think about the Soviet pumps toy in Afghanistan!
<seg>Thanks for an excellent report.
<seg>Sir President, the Cambodians call to the mines sentries ether to us.
<seg>In front of uniformed the people they have a justified mistrust that been accumulating during long years of war.
<seg>Sir President, I congratulate of whom is finally an European legislation, in the form of Regulation, on the mines persons and who we have today an excellent report of Mrs Bonino exceeds he.
<seg>Sir President, gentleman Commissioner, considered and esteemed colleagues, today we took care of a very sad subject.
<seg>He is not accidental that the mines are, mainly, in crisis areas, that is to say, zones in which they could have assumed another type of initiatives in order to surpass these crises.
<seg>To two kilometers of a village of Bosnia, in 1999, in a field a signal warns of the existence of mines, which does not prevent the presence of a boy in that place.
<seg>He is tragic that is the civilian population who suffers because of the stupidity of her leaders.
<seg>Permítanme, honourable Members, to give the welcome them in the name of our institution, with which its country within the framework maintains privileged relationships of our joint text of construction of an area of prosperity, security and peace about the Mediterranean basin.
<seg>All the mines are stored.
<seg>Sir President, as I am in agreement with almost everything what my colleagues have said before, I am not going it to repeat. I resign speaking time.
<seg>The conception that you have of open coordination is to fall in the institutional scheme dominated by the Commission officials.
<seg>Also we create in the principle of subsidiarity, that is to say, that the decisions must as close be taken as it is possible of the people to those who will affect.
<seg>But as essential amendments of the Group of the PPE finish obtaining an huge majority, I have voted in favor of the report.
<seg>Sir President, I have abstained in the vote on the resolution on the results of the Informal European Council of Biarritz by two sorts of reasons: first, because I have had opportunity to vote, nominally, separately, paragraphs 2 and 5, which has allowed me to express my frontal opposition to both.
<seg>In other words, around the table of the common European home, some would eat to the letter and others the minimum menu.
<seg>And the democratic control does not have to lack. Nevertheless, one did not feel like to us that the enumeration of these rights and their inclusion in Treaties, was the key problems of the European Union.
<seg>It has been spoken of referendos and the proposed amendments to this report regarding referendos sayings.
<seg>In the European Parliament election of 1999 the 40 percent of the electorate participated only, without considering to the countries in which the obligatory vote nor to those exists in which national elections were realised simultaneously.
<seg>In order to reach the desirable objective of an European Constitution, he is inadvisable to impose rigid models and methodologies, that would fatally prevent the wished achievement of the objective.
<seg>A social real constitution would have to upwards make level the best thing of the profits for the world of the work, the women, the immigrants and the citizens.
<seg>Even without denying an laudable intention of fortification, explanation and deepening of the European Union, as well as a simplification of texts necessary for the proximity of its operation in relation to the citizens, I have not voted to favor.
<seg>distribution of competences and responsibilities
<seg>I think that he is essential that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU implies the company/signature of the Convention on Human Rights of the European Council.
<seg>Gil-Rivet helps me, since it proposes that for certain subjects, sectors and matters some Member States of the European European decide an joint action.
<seg>To allow that the decisions on increasing number of issues important are adopted by qualified majority hits the fundamental democratic standards.
<seg>Today it tries to prevent the relaxation of the enhanced cooperations, and will finish losing the game, also in this case.
<seg>The present report must as objective make specific the taking of position in this sense of our Parliament (resolution of the 13 of April of 2000).
<seg>. (SV) Generally, our attitude towards the call flexible integration is favorable.
<seg>. (IN) the British Labor Members of Grupo PSE we welcome with satisfaction the adoption of its contribution in the ongoing work of the CIG on the enhanced cooperation, although it does not support all the details.
<seg>These islands must feel like European active part of the European that I hope it turns that them into a paradise for the tourists and a paradise for his inhabitants.
<seg>In the Middle Age these regions and their inhabitants did not belong to Europe. Nor so at least now they are considered like genuinely European.
<seg>Indeed, the particularitities of those regions, generally due to the insularity and the distance of the European continent, but also to its chronic dependency of a unique production or a few, demand adapted special measures to surpass those limitations.
<seg>Sir President, I want to request excuses to entertain to the Presidency and the interpreters being listened my last explanation of vote and, in particular, desire to show my solidarity with the translators of our explanations of vote, in which respecta the Mrs
<seg>We can deduce clearly that the objective of the agency is to canalize the national powers of defense, or to paralyze them, to put them to the service of the objectives of the Commission.
<seg>That does not prevent that the Commission and the Parliament denominate this agency “European Authority”, totally opposite denomination to the philosophy in which it assumes is inspired.
<seg>This is not what it proposes the Bowis report to us, which gives the impression that food safety is considered essentially like a new pretext to feed the well-known process of strengthening on the powers of the Commission, to the detriment of the national body and of the organs that protect safety of the citizens.
<seg>For this reason, I believe that this declaration will allow me to condemn these unqualifiable acts in the name of our European Parliament that always is lawyer by the religious respect for freedom and of the tolerance between all communities.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, I include/understand the objections formulated by the rapporteur, but by virtue of the amendments by the Committee of Agriculture and Agricultural development not only one will vow on questions of money, but one will also vow on a determined direction of the question.
<seg>I want to request its support to them so that we introduce the necessary adjustments in a-206 line, regarding the acquisition of buildings, following what amendments are approved, with the intention of that we do not transfer our own limit of 20% of the totality of the administrative expenditure.
<seg>Before the vote on the motion of modification 929
<seg>Section I SAW, Economic and Social Committee
<seg>Report (A5-0276/2000) of Mr. Nicholson, in the name of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council that restores additional technical measures to reconstitute cod stocks in the Irish Sea (division CIEM VII a) (COM (2000) 0190 - C5-0219/2000 - 2000/0071 (CNS))
<seg>(The Parliament approves the resolution)
<seg>Export subsidies cause that the world market with the food surpluses is flooded of the Union, which entails serious disadvantages for food industry in many developing countries.
<seg>In order to secure resources that allow to increase the aid to the Balkan Mountains, the Member States must realise modifications in the current budgets.
<seg>Nevertheless, the Parliament has managed to introduce major priorities, such as a major concern by the fight against unemployment and the poverty, numerous environmental issues and of equality of opportunities, et cetera. We have voted against the rightist attacks against the Life Program and the group of pressure European Women.
<seg>- (SV) In relation to the payment of expenses of transfer of the deputies to the European Parliament, we maintain our criterion that the compensation only must cover the true expenses which has been incurred across trips realised in the performance of the position.
<seg>Childbirth of which - and I hope that the Commission contributes solutions with constructive spirit we will cover years 2002 to 2005 with a transitional provision.
<seg>- (OF) For the purposes of, mainly, putting a jaw in all rule to the European parliaments, the European Commission, in its regulating and liberalising rage, has presented/displayed a directly applicable proposal for a regulation, instead of a directive, that is to undergo a laborious one to íter procedural through Parliament and of the Council of Ministers to in force enter already the 31 of December of 2000.
<seg>We endorse of this form the reform efforts of the Commission and we are against to continue favoring this sector.
<seg>It has made them to this depend much on the loans.
<seg>Report Nicholson (A-0276/2000)
<seg>It is important to make sure that the aid is not used with military purposes.
<seg>Our opinion of always is that the reduction in carbon dioxide of carbon and other gases with greenhouse effect will have to be obtained mainly with a cost assumed by the true polluting agents (that is to say, major industries), to the detriment of its benefits.
<seg>Report Moreira Da Silva (A5-0271/2000)
<seg>This money would be due to spend agreeing and coordinating the expenses for the research policy in all the fifteen States of the European Union.
<seg>It is good that we manage to know, by precaution, the truth as far as these substances.
<seg>The period of votings has finished.
<seg>This one will replace the national format that now is used everywhere.
<seg>The loss of data facing the statistics regarding the balance of payments is minimum.
<seg>As they will imagine, the main ones affected are the small and medium enterprises.
<seg>For years we come demanding a harmonization from the efforts, then, after all, is possible to establish a rapid system, insurance and cheap.
<seg>In my opinion, this report has a capital importance to indeed integrate to the citizens and citizens, the small and medium enterprises in the zone Euro and to increase the acceptance of the Economic and Monetary Union.
<seg>Obstacles or major differences do not have to exist when there is a free movement of capital with a communitarian currency.
<seg>Nevertheless, the European Parliament and the Commission give much importance him.
<seg>Endorsement the policy two-way whereupon the rapporteur wants to induce to the sluggish banks to act.
<seg>Radwan and Mrs Peijs in the name of Grupo PPE-DE, in which the adoption of measures is demanded stops before end of the coming year and, preferably, the establishment of these standards before the tickets and the euro coins enter circulation.
<seg>The proposal that I presented/displayed the Peijs colleague and lays for the direction of which to seat to the banks in a table does not stop to make concessions, because no longer we can increase plus the political pressure.
<seg>After all, if the system for the accomplishment of the cross-border payments continue being as expensive as it is it nowadays, the credibility of the new system of currencies and tickets will be put in prohibition.
<seg>We think that form of collection of data statistical on the payment system internal Europeans is a vestige of the past; that in an integrated and unique space, they stop being just, and that they constitute an obstacle for the proper functioning of the market.
<seg>When hearing the interventions of some of my colleagues in the commissions, some that have been more time here than I, I had the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and the entrepreneurial spirit, whom this Parliament is put under by fourth time, belongs to that category.
<seg>Esteemed colleagues, I am thankful for the support in advance to them who will contribute report.
<seg>If one gives up to this political action at European level, must then offer more possibilities to the regions.
<seg>The SME is main source of job creation, as much in quality as in amount. They carry out an essential role for the social cohesion and the arrangement of the territory.
<seg>The care whereupon made the study of proposals and the agreement that it has persecuted with numerous interested parties has been a triumph to define better and to optimize the restoration of this program.
<seg>Thirdly, we must look for the European added value.
<seg>Of it is deduced that the small and medium enterprises only can march well if unemployment rate is reduced and the Public Administrations of all the levels are not become indebted and have resources sufficient to destine them to the investment budgets.
<seg>The companies need clarity.
<seg>In particular, if an individual industralist or a company with 250 employees counts on a project, it cannot be unique the average one to receive financing the collateral security of the 120%, but also it must be possible to receive financing to which it only has an nice idea.
<seg>The Nation states, and the regional or local authorities already even behave like true financial pumps, that drain the taxpayers money, that is to say sums that are retained to the majority of the population, including most underprivileged, they pump and it towards the great companies and therefore towards its proprietors and shareholders.
<seg>The medium enterprise and breeding ground small include thousands on fragile attempts that nourish of human potential and ideas to the great companies.
<seg>Of the measures that we have proposed here, the one that would like me more that it approached the Commissioner is to facilitate and to make agile the access to the aid and the information so that the people who manage these companies can use them effectively.
<seg>All of them will occupy a preferred place in the multiannual programme.
<seg>Finally, it pleases the idea to me to arrange an annual meeting to us to realise a balance of the restoration of the program.
<seg>The recent incidents to the detriment of the Greek minority in Himarë make the necessity more urgent to drive democratisation measures, strengthening of the institutions and respect for human rights in Albania.
<seg>A considerable number of Albanians leaves its earth by the insecurity that reigns in its country, by the social difficulties, their premodern social and familiar structures.
<seg>We need to count on preventive measures especially designed for Albania that contribute to the construction or reconstruction of the country, with the intention of making a dignified life in the region possible.
<seg>It is as well as the documents go of an instance to the other and the European Commission, for example, refuses to make public the report on, among others, Customs Assistance Mission (CAM), elaborated by the Albanians.
<seg>We see the truth as it is.
<seg>Mrs. Karamanou, congratulations by the ample and extensive point of view that demonstrates its report.
<seg>One is a subject of the greater importance, generated under the influence of historical, social, political and economic factors.
<seg>We will never know the true number of deaths.
<seg>The activities common trade involve the people of a peaceful way.
<seg>What, on the contrary, unacceptable encounter in this report, I say and it frankly, that the effect with the cause is confused, that is to say, that the procedure of average visa expedition is confused and, therefore, the possibility of emigrating, with the illegal cause of migration.
<seg>The institutional major reforms derived from the Treaty of Amsterdam have influenced in the management of the asylum issues political and immigration.
<seg>In third and final point, the plan of action and its ways of accomplishment must be evaluated by zones.
<seg>But, logically, this requirement also demands to us not to exceed us in the communitarian volume of adoption of rules.
<seg>Exactly now the strength of the Community action has to stress itself.
<seg>I plead, also, so that the modifications of the proposals on codification of the European legislation in force take place by means of the inclusion of amendments in the directive or regulations in force.
<seg>Understood with property, the principle of subsidiarity aims in two-way traffic: decision making in the level more under possible, and the recognition of which the level under possible can more be, in fact, a very high level, when there are general goods in game that will be lost to less than than they are protected everywhere in the same terms.
<seg>The report is a clear and concise rough draft model and I hope that they take it to the colleagues with the seriousness that deserves.
<seg>The Commission report of Legal Affairs and Internal market did not count on the enthusiasm of its members.
<seg>To it even referred that me in the Slim report on the draft, because the Community legislation, and Mr. Medina finishes it to us trying with the reading of one of articles of the Treaty, is hardly comprehensible, for the experts.
<seg>Therefore, some aspects of the report produce little enthusiasm to me, because I had liked “a more comunitarizante” report concerning the internal market, and mainly, in this point, evidently, they are not the winds that blow in the report.
<seg>The important thing for the institutions of the EU is that we have a strong commitment to lift the quality of the legislation, especially in relation to subsidiarity.
<seg>The debate is closed.
<seg>The maintenance of this situation could influence negatively in the acceptance and the public opinion the Euro.
<seg>Sir President, in the Committee on Citizens and Rights of citizens, Justice and Internal affairs we prepared of concientious form the Karamanou report.
<seg>However, like chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, desire to take advantage of our oral question and this debate to express to both parts - then to both our proposal of resolution goes, and I want to make it by far calmness, some considerations.
<seg>People of the European who we represented here therefore demand it.
<seg>But, already much water under the bridge has run, the agreement has prescribed and it has not been replaced.
<seg>I can understand the reasons of Mr. Commissioner, but I cannot understand those of the Director General.
<seg>We could say that, eleven months after the mooring, we continued paying to the previous agreement and the previous one of the previous one.
<seg>Sir President, a year ago we maintained a debate similar and the fact that it has had to spend a year so that they begin the negotiations put in evidence the difficulty to find fishing-grounds for the enormous fleets of the EU.
<seg>In the second agreement, the things were very clear.
<seg>But also it is necessary to include/understand that nothing is eternal, not even the fisheries resources!
<seg>For this reason, it interests to me especially to make clear that if in something outstanding is had the Group of the PPE-DE is not only in supporting, defending and to cause the fisheries agreements, but in fomenting its extension decidedly.
<seg>Thirdly, since the fisheries agreement was interrupted, it has continued the operation of the fishing-ground of the Sahara by noncommunitarian Community fleets and that are put under the control neither of the Commission nor of the Member States: it is spoken mainly of an important fleet of the Netherlands.
<seg>I include/understand it, since those activities of fishing represented a source of income and work for a poor region in relation to the rest of Europe.
<seg>Another aspect that wanted to emphasize is the one that at the end of the month they conclude the temporary aid paid to the fishermen and shipbuilders to compensate this year of shutdown. One is an intolerable situation, since all prefer the work to the aid.
<seg>This andalucista parliamentarian has been a year negotiating and proposing initiatives by the corridors, the offices, in the Committee on Fisheries and hearing with Mr. Commissioner so that the most special idiosyncrasy of the fishing fleet considers Andalusian who works in Morocco.
<seg>Spain has developed of an excellent way the most difficult neighbourly relation than it has had recurrently in history between Europe and Africa of the North, between Spain and Morocco.
<seg>Like Spanish parliamentarian and Andalusian, I vindicate the right of thousands of families Andalusian and Spaniards to maintain and to defend, and to that we also defend from this Parliament, their places of work, that are seen almost in danger for a year.
<seg>It will be come now to the voting.
<seg>A full history of almost twelve years of consolations from the chancellery, delaying tactics, hopes, personal necessity also, placebos for the affected ones, stubborn defense of old woman rights regard to the citizens that did not look for another thing that its rights.
<seg>As you know, the subject is very complex and affects seven hundred people who work in more than twenty-five Italian universities.
<seg>If reform and modifies the Italian legal system, since it has happened for the university personnel, we did not think that the Commission can take part from the moment at which all the European citizens enjoy equal access to all the professional categories.
<seg>The injustice resides in which two people who carry out the same work, working shoulder to shoulder do, it, nevertheless, with different pays and under different conditions.
<seg>The worse thing of everything, in my opinion, is to have to notice to them perhaps that a favorable sentence does not constitute more than some comforting words and it is not going to suppose any real change in his lives.
<seg>Him memory to the Commission that I hope that it responds to which the judgment of the Court, in the Allué case, expressed of the following way: “it hereby dictates that he is contrary to Article 48 (2) of the Treaty of the EEC that the legislation of a Member State limits in any case the duration of contracts of employment of the assistants of foreign languages a year, with the possibility of renewal, if in principle that limit is not applied to other professors”.
<seg>Well, I believe that these subjects lead to the heart of associated the fundamental principles of freedom to the European law, especially the freedom of movements, and exceptions to these principles cannot be done.
<seg>Still we have positions, as today it has been seen in this discussion, too many restrictions, too many obstacles for this internal market, and not only in this case.
<seg>The debate has concluded.
<seg>(The President retires the word to the speaker)
<seg>And I propose a minute to them of withdrawal.
<seg>There is some observation?
<seg>Support the proposal presented/displayed by Mr. Ceyhun, and very would be been thankful for of which the Council could clarify to us if he has true intentions to present/display a fresh proposal on this subject.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, esteemed colleagues, our Grupo considers so important east event who we think that it would not receive a treatment adapted under the form of a matter of urgency.
<seg>The Galeotes finish exposing. I have the impression that you adhere to those reasons, Sir Baron Crespo, although I understood.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, kills some time already we discussed in this Parliament the issue of sanctions to Iraq.
<seg>He is urgent that we celebrate a debate before the proposed amendment by the British authorities is introduced, and that the Commission indicates with all clarity which is the norm that must be observed in this respect.
<seg>(A5-0314/2000) of Mrs Roure, in the name of the Committee on Citizens and Rights of citizens, Justice and Internal affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the adoption of an Agreement regarding the improving mutual assistance in field of criminal, especially in the field of fighting against the organized crime, the whitening of products of infractions and the financial crime (10213/2000 - C5-0394/2000 - 2000/0815 (CNS)).
<seg>The declarations must come often from concrete measures to come to the pursuit, preventive embargo, seizure and seizure of the benefits of the crime.
<seg>The European creation of an area of freedom, security and justice cannot continue being into the hands of a specialized agency, holds to the unique control of the national Governments.
<seg>On the other hand, article 8 of draft convention limits solely essential interests the reasons for attendance refusal that could invoke the Requested state.
<seg>In order to begin I want to congratulate to Mr. Marinho by the work that has realised and I mean that, really, the attempts to fight the organized crime must enjoy support and attention.
<seg>To locate, to persecute, to condemn the dirty laundering of money of the terrorists and the arms dealers and drug, by all means that yes!
<seg>Our mission consists of coming to the pursuit, preventive embargo, seizure and seizure of the benefits of the organized crime.
<seg>All these considerations are picked up in the amendments and, judging by the debate celebrated in the commission, I totally trust that the Parliament will approve these amendments.
<seg>In my opinion, the establishment of these initiatives is advancing of a way that can ignore the protection anticipated in article 6 of European Convention on Human Rights and the Fundamental Liberties.
<seg>Nevertheless, in fact all this is not so simple.
<seg>Finally, Sir President, the Group of the PPE supports the compromise amendment at which we have arrived with Mrs Roure on the activities of the lawyers.
<seg>The second measurement, the second instrument, is the harmonization.
<seg>One is a Portuguese initiative that already has praised several previous speakers.
<seg>And that one was the object of the joint meeting of the Council of Justice and Internal affairs and of Council ECOFIN of the past day 17 of October.
<seg>The best form to fortify the parliamentary control and the judicial control of EUROPOL is the total integration of within the framework legal Agreement EUROPOL of the European Union.
<seg>A step in the right direction that the European Parliament tries to give for a long time is the creation of an provisional unit for judicial cooperation.
<seg>This one is the sense of the guarantees, that is to say, to make progress that slope of the liberties.
<seg>The European Parliament is the communitarian supranational authority enabled to establish that relation, and with this intervention I propose to them therefore that endorses that right supporting to our rapporteur
<seg>When the institutional model and the rules that will govern the European area of justice only clarify, it will be possible for the citizens and the Parliament to pronounce itself on each one of the measures that to us the Council offers.
<seg>For this reason, Europol is a step logical in the process to equip to the citizens of an high level of safety in a freedom space, security and justice, by means of the fortification of the organized fight against crime.
<seg>Sir President, gentleman Commissioner, Lordships, Mrs Gebhardt deserves a congratulation by the excellent report that presents/displays, in accordance with one of the decisions made in the Council of Tampere.
<seg>But since with Eurojust, the coordination of the public prosecutors and the national magistrates considers to fight against all the forms of serious crimes - and in that I am in agreement with the approach of the rapporteur - ample the concept: no longer it is spoken only of cooperation for the purely transnational crimes, is also spoken of cooperation for the repression of the criminal activities.
<seg>We will have the opportunity, from the 1 of January of 2001, to enter us in that provisional unit, but the Commission wants to celebrate a debate exceeds what must be the definitive unit of Eurojust.
<seg>Each part held its position sincerely, I create therefore it, without falling in rigid confrontations.
<seg>The problems arisen with the expenses did not worry to the Committee on Fisheries excessively, although yes they paid more attention to other questions.
<seg>Something is from all unacceptable point that we do not count on clear objectives nor we pruned to measure the results, that would not happen in no other Institution.
<seg>Secondly point: in the scope of the hierarchy in the faculty of finance section it has been arrived here at unacceptable intersections, Sir Commissioner.
<seg>I want with that to emphasize that a positive role for certain number of problems played.
<seg>It is obvious that work in partnership does not create any duality in the responsibility joint financial.
<seg>Therefore, really we have acted to recover those 3.4 million, and it is possible to be said we have obtained that it in more of a 90%.
<seg>There is some observation?
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, Lordships, after nine months of works and lengths struggles in search of a consensus, now we have on the table a draft Charter of the Fundamental rights.
<seg>I trust that, even though today she is limited to give his vote in favour to this Letter, this Assembly is going to leave indubitablemente clearly in the coming weeks that the obligatory nature of the Letter asks the Council and that this one also includes the possibility of resorting to the European Court of Justice.
<seg>This position is united, as you know, to the adopted one by the Heads of State and of Government at the European Council of Biarritz in whom they themselves approved, unanimously and without reserves, the Letter and, therefore, I only can invite to them, in the name of the Council, to follow this position, but doing some reasonings to them.
<seg>But mainly it is by the force of its content reason why the Letter, I am safe of it, will make history.
<seg>On the other hand, the Trade Union of Unions has been able to denounce what she considers lagoons, as the lack of reference to the right to a minimum wage, for example.
<seg>Nevertheless, diverse personalities, and especially the members of the European Parliament, have proposed that includes an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in article 6 of the Treaty on European, that already makes reference to Convention on Human Rights.
<seg>Our Group unanimously supports the Letter with the single exception of the British delegation.
<seg>European European People plead in its totality and of unanimous way so that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is gotten up more soon possible to Treaties, in order that also it has direct force of law for people of the European Union.
<seg>They have demonstrated that it is possible to deal with the European affairs a new and exemplary way, a way far better that the intergovernmental conference, dice its democratic and abierto work, with great transparency and which makes possible the participation of the citizens.
<seg>The right to the health, to the social security, the house, the minimum wage is nonexistent or solely of the order of solidarity.
<seg>In fourth place, the Letter - and this seems to me particularly important part of the principle of the political nature and citizenship indivisibility of human rights and the fundamental rights of social order.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, gentleman President of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, Lordships, I believe that this Letter is simply the nth demonstration of the ability of the European and our Member States to multiply empty texts, the declarations of intentions.
<seg>The representative of the Commission in the convention of Turin attributes legal meaning to the document.
<seg>Perhaps after the hour of the market, the hour of the Europe of the rights has arrived finally. The concept of citizenship in the European Union is a relatively new concept.
<seg>The Letter is written up, indeed, like a text that can have a binding value.
<seg>Also I can verify with great pride that a representative of my parliamentary group in my country, Gunnar Jansson, had a major role in the formulation of this Letter.
<seg>As I said last night - and I return to say it today, in all this Union there are many deficiencies in that respect and sometimes, with our impatience to develop the judicial and police cooperation, we ignored the importance of guarding so that the innocents are not passive victims, collateral damage of a war against the delinquency.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, the draft resolution of the European Parliament on the Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the same ambiguity that the works of the Assembly.
<seg>The Italian Constitution anticipates, for example, the limit of good behavior; the Convention anticipates the limit of the rights of the others, of the public order.
<seg>Sir President, today in the voting of the 12 we will conclude a process that began in 1984 when this Parliament approved the draft treaty of the European Union, where it appeared the request already of a declaration of rights, a process which we continued in 1989 with the Resolution of Of Gucht.
<seg>The Letter is going to have effects. It is going them to have is or not in the Treaty.
<seg>One is due to welcome with approval and not with fear, as it seems to think Mr. Bondi.
<seg>It seems that the century that finishes, with all fights by the emancipation of the worked against social classes, has happened uselessly and it has not taught anything to us.
<seg>The Letter fills an emptiness in the communitarian right and fortifies the protection to the individuals in front of the upsettings of the European police, the authorities that fight the fraud and of the authorities that guard by the competition.
<seg>I do not understand the dissension of motivates that it because the Letter does not contemplate everything what it would want to see including.
<seg>Sir President, I will continue where it remained Mr. Gahrton.
<seg>The third observation that I want to do refers the rights of citizens of nonmember countries.
<seg>The Council of Europe counts, besides with the Court of Human rights, much experience in similar forms of control, that we can be useful.
<seg>In view of the text of the Charter that today we are going to approve - I hope that by a great majority, it is evident that with our Letter we are going to obtain one more a ampler protection and also more updated of the fundamental rights that the one that would have supposed the adhesion to European Convention for the protection of the human rights.
<seg>By this it is necessary to advance more.
<seg>It seems important to me to have this property in possession if we want to reach the necessary endorsement of the citizens from Europe to the Letter.
<seg>After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be my guide of analysis for this report and to where my average personal and intellectuals and the means as far as collaborators who facilitate me allow it, I will make a right analysis by right, country by country of the respect to the Letter in the fifteen countries of the Union.
<seg>. (FR) Sir President, gentleman Minister, ladies and honourable Members, the Commission would want, first of all, to adhere to the intentions of President Moscovici, and to show the fundamental contribution that the members of the European Parliament have contributed to the debate, to the Convention, especially the paper that Mr. Méndez of Vigo has carried out in the praesidium of the Convention for the drafting of the Charter of the Fundamental rights.
<seg>I will not talk about more than to some of the most outstanding points of this debate. First of all, Mr.
<seg>The Convention has chosen to include fundamental rights inspired by the different instruments from the Council of Europe, by Treaties, the constitutions of the Member States.
<seg>In accordance with the order of business, it is come to the joint debate of the following information:
<seg>In the present state of the things, it also corresponds to our Parliament to say to the Turkish people who at this moment are three conditions for his adhesion.
<seg>As a result of it, the European Investment Bank is one of the last ports of refuge of the banking activities in the world. There they do not sprinkle the waves of the social debate.
<seg>For that reason it is reason why I have taken careful note from the suggestions formulated by Mr. Morillon in relation to the prior conditions to the accession of Turkey and deserve the greater interest.
<seg>I have the satisfaction to be able to announce that the Turkish Government has accepted this association in the meantime as bases for our future cooperation, so that we can cherish justified hopes of which we will obtain the objectives set exactly, that it is to support with our policy to the forces of reform in Turkey, to give a reform fresh impetus to the process and to make advance it with a view to the wished accession to the European Union.
<seg>Most important for me it is that from Helsinki one has begun in Turkey, between the Turkish public opinion, a debate on the conditions for the accession of Turkey to the EU, a debate that supports to the forces of reform of the country and foments its development.
<seg>This text is in the hope of its opinion.
<seg>What now it is tried is to give an necessary impetus in the scene of an future accession.
<seg>However, I would insist warmly to Turkey - I do not know which will be the result of the voting to that also it is taken in serious this question.
<seg>The European Parliament will play its role in the promotion of the relations with the political parties, the NGO and the press, besides sometimes developing its delicate and tense relation with the Grand National Assembly.
<seg>Mr. Morillon, his report is, to seem, absolutely realistic and responsible.
<seg>On the occasion of its visit to Turkey in past March it at least mentioned by its name the problem of the Kurdish population, since also it has done today.
<seg>To consider that the European are going to take to the Turks, and I mention, “to a radical change of its customs and their mentality” at the same time reveals a great naivete and a great sufficiency.
<seg>Sir President, Lordships, the report that today struggles fills to me of restlessness.
<seg>Recommendation (A5-0325/2000) of Messrs Duff and Voggenhuber, in the name of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the approval of the draft Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487/1/00 - C5-0570/2000 - 2000/2233 (ABC))
<seg>Thus and everything, in the next occasions in which we are going to debate the computer science power, we will have to realize of which a ampler control makes lack and, therefore, garantizador of the person.
<seg>Duff/Voggenhuber recommendation (A5-0325/2000)
<seg>We indicate indicatively:
<seg>The rights contemplated by the Letter already comprise of the national constitutions and are defended by the parliaments national, next to the towns and their cultures.
<seg>For example, the article 19-1, that mentions that: “the collective expulsions are prohibited”, nonspecific that this prohibition can be suspended in case of war or of serious disruptions of the public order.
<seg>We are going to offer a brief explanation of these three objections by order.
<seg>The right of a government to leave of side arbitrarily its constitution is the distinctive characteristic of a tyranny.
<seg>But I repeat, it today, we have all the reasons to feel us proud of the conditions in which we have culminated this important stage for Europe.
<seg>A society that only knows rights, and nonduties, becomes an egoistic society.
<seg>It is our high-priority combat so that the affirmation of the fundamental rights is materialized in political choices.
<seg>Although the Convention method is interesting and fecund to establish a basic text, looking for a broad compromise, nothing justifies that it is deprived to the European Parliament, that incarnates the representation of people of Europe, of the possibility of amending, to enrich the text.
<seg>This Letter must be improved, and our Parliament must propose a strategy that allows to its update and its enrichment.
<seg>Therefore, the Letter would not be due to decide and to proclaim in the Nice Council, but in this Summit an European debate would be due to impel on the same.
<seg>Fortunately, the predominant tendency of the national Governments seems to merely indicate the way of the common, that is to say, the acceptance of the Letter with a reach politician and nonbinding sense.
<seg>Created like “assembly” by the Cologne Summit, “Convention” was self-proclaimed, a name that unfortunately remembers 1793 and to the terrorist implications of the French Revolution materialized on the other Convention.
<seg>In return, the used method, the proclaimed exclusions and the ambiguity that the own nature surrounds by this text shed a quite crude light on the new totalitarian effervescences that act in the same heart of the process of European integration.
<seg>Luckyly, the European Parliament still does not have in this field more than a consultative role, in the hope of a total application of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but it finds the form to exert it in the mistaken sense, restraining the right decisions.
<seg>However, discrepancies as far as the procedure exist.
<seg>A century ago it was thus and, after obtaining that something backed down, it returns now with force.
<seg>The latest that we want is that the Single market allows the delinquents to enter the Single market by the back door and without being seen.
<seg>And we also supported the future creation of a convention that facilitates the organized fight against crime and the money laundering, as well as the different proposed measures to reach those aims.
<seg>Indeed, a provisional Unit, integrated by a representative of the judges or the police is created that carry out a judge activity in our fifteen Member States.
<seg>Sir President, in my capacity as a member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I dedicate an intense attention to the draft of accession of Turkey.
<seg>The paper of Turkey in Cyprus is not acceptable either.
<seg>Nevertheless, we endorsed the critic of the rapporteur insofar as an evaluation around the concession loans of the EIB and to that is needed are deficiencies in regards to transparency and of democratic control in the activities of the Bank.
<seg>Turkey, with all their differentiation, always has been and continues being one integral part of the European reality.
<seg>The accession of Turkey to the European Union has become more than ever a subject at your service of the day.
<seg>Mr. Morillon says that Turkey must try not to see the European Union like a “exclusive Christian club” that wishes to exclude it.
<seg>Turkey will be a totally democratic country when it learns to live with its past, just as democratic Germany learned to live with his and we also asked it her.
<seg>As soon as the authorities in Ankara have understood who the status quo is unacceptable for Europe and the rest of the world, will be able to be realised significant progresses: the island could be reunified and tomorrow a right, lasting global regulation will be contributed and conforms to the international right.
<seg>Really, why is not included all this in the European Commission report?
<seg>This it is the balanced framework in which we will have to continue resolutely with our action to favor the rapprochement between the European and Turkey.
<seg>If we approached the Armenian question in the context from the adhesion to the EU - and them request that listens well what I say: if we approached the Armenian question in the context from the adhesion to the EU the project that today we are debating it will not get to start; that simple.
<seg>By the others, also it is the reason of our insistence in that balance becomes of the five first years of implementation of the process of Barcelona, so that in Marseilles, indeed, we can to establish the necessary guidelines.
<seg>Nevertheless, we have been able to maintain the dialogue, and sometimes on sensitive issues: the stability, the terrorism, the emigration, the human rights, for example.
<seg>In addition, the Council has delivered an attack, in particular from 1995, to equip to the Mediterranean with average more important, in accordance with the challenges of the partnership.
<seg>This it is, in fact, a subject of extraordinary importance and I mean it also in my quality of Central European.
<seg>Sir President, as you know, in English thinks that, when the star does not appear in a function, he is like a representation of Hamlet without the first enterrador.
<seg>We want that there is a mancomunación of political on the questions regarding the Single market and agreement to introduce the accumulation of origin along with free trade regional arrangements so that all the interlocutors maintain free trade relations to each other and adopt the protocol harmonized on rules of origin.
<seg>We have found out with satisfaction that the Commission is arranged to give an fresh impetus to the process of Barcelona.
<seg>There am outstanding these aspects because in them it is necessary to look for the key to relaunch the process, and to all this it is necessary to add the extension of the political agenda of Barcelona.
<seg>Therefore, it has to be our priority assuring La Paz and the security the European Union in the Mediterranean and we have to deliver all the possible attacks for the sake of this cooperation and so that the bottoms jeopardize are applied effectively, based on we say egoistic European generosity of the European to it.
<seg>These are the specific major issues and that I would like to raise, and I thank for to Mr. Brok the one to him that is authorized east debates just before the Presidency and the Commission can debate these subjects.
<seg>The world goes towards an unstoppable globalisation and against this background it is necessary to organize itself in great blocks that act like protagonists in the great scene of the world-wide competition.
<seg>It is dissapointing that the Mediterranean countries have solicitd only as soon as a quarter of the 4,700 million Euros briefed for the program MEDA I, that expired in 1999.
<seg>For it the proposal of an fresh impetus is positive that has realised the Commission and we agreed totally with the two priorities that Mr. Patten in his interventions has marked and reiterated this behind schedule here.
<seg>It is an attention touch so that the European Union much more plays an active role in the Mediterranean area that historical and culturally enriched and engrandeció our European continent.
<seg>Nevertheless, still much more it burdens, at the same moment at which in this chamber we interchanged sometimes divergent points of view calmly, are continued killing more Palestinian.
<seg>Reconstruction aid
<seg>If, nevertheless, we did not contribute in December the average ones to execute this regulation, today we will have maintained a content debate devoid.
<seg>One is complicated procedures, but neither we must nor we want to close the eyes, and I hope that the Member States do not do it either, before the paper that have carried out in it.
<seg>The mass media in that one region have been responsible often for the tragedy that has lived and are necessary totally free means and that acts according to the rules that reign in our democracies.
<seg>Also, I am lucky because I believe that the Parliament has been successful when obtaining to give the return to a situation that originally was not so good because it has maintained a pressure continuous.
<seg>I repeat it once again: it is absolutely essential to avoid unnecessary expenses in unnecessary meetings.
<seg>Nevertheless, we do not have to only pay attention to Kosovo.
<seg>He is also unfortunate that a number of programmes has put in the call action reserve, “opførselsreserven”.
<seg>In Feira, it recognized the quality of potential candidates the adhesion to the participating countries in the process of stabilisation and of association.
<seg>I reiterate the main priorities assigned to program CARDS: strengthening of institutions in the sense of the democracy and the Rule of law, the economic development and the reconstruction; the regional cooperation.
<seg>The European Union was right when reacting positively before the access of President Kostuniça to the power.
<seg>The 6 of November an initial examination was carried out.
<seg>What initiatives are going to adopt the Presidency of the Council, as asked for the European Parliament in their resolution of 16 of March of 2000, to play a role more active with the purpose of to guarantee the total and absolute application of the plan of peace of the UN?
<seg>How to manage to give this new impetus without the resolution of this conflict? The narrow bonds that exist between the European Union and Morocco, and between France and Morocco are known more especially.
<seg>Simply I can indicate that France and Germany to him - here no longer I express myself as President of the Council mentioned these subjects during a bilateral summit in Vittel, the last week, and that he was decided to set up an working group with the purpose of to remedy the problem.
<seg>At the same time, the Union continues contributing an important material assistance to these two countries, by the intermediary of its different programs, especially TACIS.
<seg>The question of the honourable Member offers, then, to the Presidency the occasion to dissipate certain confusions.
<seg>And I add an additional precision: one treats especially, in these two texts, to reinforce the penal framework to fight against the organized networks of pins.
<seg>In the report that the Turkish Council of Ministers the past approved 21 of September like reform programme, they appear in the part of the legislative changes several projects: to register in the civil code measured that reinforces the effective equality of the men and the women in the socio-educational scopes; to fight better against violences within the family; to condemn better those violences by means of the creation of judges specialized in the scope of the family and, finally, to prohibit the possibility of a reduction of pain by crime of honour.
<seg>Therefore, the Presidency does not have why to give an answer on this point.
<seg>The next week, will be a meeting of the European Conference, to invitation mine, in France, that is to say with the countries candidates. They announce to me that the Mrs will come
<seg>Create you who the model that has been followed in the case of Austria, that is to say, decision making bilateral majority, could be used in the future like an instrument making decisions besides the European institutions and to create a new institution or a new group, with the purpose of to be able to elude the unanimity in the Council norm?
<seg>Cem. The terms of this answer were communicated to the set of the Member States.
<seg>President of the Council, Mr. Moscovici- who says that to advance in the association of Turkey with the European Union, is not possible to take into account the question from Cyprus?
<seg>It is necessary to consider that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more that a simple fisheries agreement and that, as he knows, if he did not reach this agreement, considering which it means, this fact could hide-and-seek a deterioration in relations between the European Union and Morocco.
<seg>For this reason, I have to indicate my skepticism on the result.
<seg>Concerning the application of the principle of mutual recognition of the criminal decisions, in accordance with the Council conclusions European of Tampere, it is possible to observe that this principle must allow the strengthening cooperation of the Member States, but also of the protection of the rights of people.
<seg>The supplementary questions must be of other deputies.
<seg>On the other hand, the Commission, in the communication that approved the 4 d October of 2000 on the oil provision of the European Union, indicates that it wants to present/display, in the European Council of Goteburgo, a plan of energy savings and diversification of energy source that would have to contribute to fortify the energy efficiency, especially in the buildings and the transports.
<seg>With this spirit, we did within the framework, on the occasion of the vote on the resolution on the embargo, of the third commission of the General Assembly of United Nations, the past 9 of November, a call to the Cuban authorities so that they cooperate totally with the international organisms that defend the human rights.
<seg>It corresponds, then, to the NATO to take the dispositions that judges necessary so that they cannot return to take place.
<seg>(The session, interrupted to the 18,55 hours, is started again to the 21,00 hours)
<seg>When one offers money has the privilege unquestionably to establish with all clarity the political objectives, and that is what it has come making the Commissioner.
<seg>This presence can give a perspective to the global policy that we followed.
<seg>If we see the region as a region of virtual political competences we will commit an error.
<seg>The Parliament must be consulted and be informed regularly, and is this one the second request that the rapporteurs formulate and that all we will have to endorse.
<seg>The heads of government have also confirmed the determination of the European to endorse that process with technical assistance and economic.
<seg>It was the Parliament that supported the Commission proposal to create the European Agency for the Reconstruction.
<seg>As the Camera knows, we do not create necessary to make an explicit reference to this in the regulation. In spite of the eloquence of Mr.
<seg>The voting will take place Wednesday to the 11,30 hours.
<seg>The leaders decided an extended and up-to-date frame 2000 cooperation between Asia and Europe that the work programme for the coming decade constitutes.
<seg>In my opinion these questions remember the major role that represents Europe in Asia, not only in economic and commercial terms, although it must say that one of the reasons of the recovery of Asia is that we have maintained our word to maintain our markets to the exports of Asia open during last the two years.
<seg>I believe that we have formulated an excellent political declaration, but still are to solve some problems.
<seg>We know that the Commission is taken extremely in serious the ASEM and supported totally to this institution in which to it respecta.
<seg>It is necessary to improve the existing mechanisms in the transposition of the Community law, to increase the legal certainty and to surpass its present slowness.
<seg>For that reason it would have to impel the creation of new regional organisations there, beginning where already communitarian presence exists, as it is the case of the western Pacific and the South Pacific.
<seg>This will really contribute to that the fishing grounds are sustainable.
<seg>I believe that the future on the international water fishing ground it depends on these organizations and all the efforts of the Commission, Sir Commissioner, are few. In order to defend the position of the United Nations, as much in the Convention of 1982 like in the one of New York, to which reference has become here, we must have a very active presence in these organizations in favor of responsible fishing.
<seg>This is the reason for which I believe that the Commission has a significant role to animate to the fishermen to put themselves to the front, to cooperate with her and to offer a solution with which we are all in agreement.
<seg>Besides this, the Commission must become position of all type of tasks related to the negotiations that are to carry out themselves in the context of the regional fisheries organisations.
<seg>Sir President, I have the same problem that Nicholson, but in my case is even more serious.
<seg>Sir Commissioner, Lordships, these is the solutions that recommend the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
<seg>Sometimes we have gotten to ask to us to what extent the own cyclical crisis of the market does not come caused by the speculative action from the mentioned business structures, that therefore are made sure the control the sector based on their interests.
<seg>The raised communitarian extra aid in the report of Mr. Garot is, way to see, opposite to all sanity in these years, when with the Agenda the 2000 and forthcoming enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe we must reform our agricultural policy.
<seg>We try to introduce an insurance scheme and is clear that it is based on social criteria. In my opinion, the rapporteur has carried out an excellent work that demonstrates that the administration gives much game when a defined purpose is persecuted clearly, as it is the case.
<seg>On the one hand, the most important producers, or those that are integrated with the production companies, would not participate in this device, preferring the systems that already they have: individual saving, bank loans, compensation fund.
<seg>Sir President, gentleman Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, permítanme that says to them beforehand in principle I applaud the Commission proposal to create a regulatory fund, also within the framework of Austrian agriculture.
<seg>I would like to be thankful for to the rapporteur his report.
<seg>I have understood that an organisation of the market for the intensive livestock holdings and the collapse of the agricultural policy is wanted when she is tie to the Earth, when she is an extensive production.
<seg>An organisation of the market already exists and we would not have to commit the error to put in judgment fabric the existing organisation of the market, since in general terms she provides the desired effect.
<seg>According to the Commission he is totally just that only demands utmost rigour to the agriculturists who participate at heart in regulation, since after all these receive stable rents in return, whereas those that do not adhere do not obtain any compensation.
<seg>(The session rises to the 23,10 hours)
<seg>The resource coming from the tax on the added value represented 36% and the traditional capital resources ascended to 15% of the total.
<seg>Another element of the reform that corresponds faithfully with one of the fundamental priorities identified by the Court is the predetermined convenience of attributing greater importance to the measurement of the results and the action within a frame of resource allocation who is coherent with the priorities and objectives that are defined clearly and can be measured.
<seg>It is good that thus it is and I want to be thankful to him sincerely, Mr. Karlsson, to the equal to the members of the Court of Auditors and also to their services, the support that offer to the reform of the Commission their report.
<seg>Against this background and given his proximity, I also would want to remember that, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we have proposed an amendment to the Treaty that allows to create an European prosecution in charge to persecute the fraud to the detriment of the interests Community financials. I hope sincerely that the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice is not limited to take note from the proposal or to reject it immediately, but this one is discussed seriously.
<seg>The reality, as it describes the annual report to it, is rather dissapointing.
<seg>The number of detected errors is too high to be able to offer that guarantee.
<seg>The amount destined to planning activities has remained short in 240 million Euros.
<seg>Also I supposed that the report by the Court of Auditors would be a little easier to use and that in him some clear recommendations would occur, for example, one or two clear recommendations by chapter.
<seg>In 1995 a Convention on the Protection of the economic interests of the European Union was approved.
<seg>The Commission and the Member States would have to contemplate it from this angle and to use the results of the report like a tool to improve their action in the management of finances of the European Union.
<seg>I know that this report and the function in which it get ready to embark the Parliament in the context of the discharge of the management will contribute to increase the monitoring with regard to the Community expenditure.
<seg>And at this moment, Mrs. Presidenta, I would like to be silent to me and to hope that somebody of the Council came here.
<seg>The Court, like other years, he has not indicated exactly where the failures have taken place.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, the enlargement of the European Union approaches and the report by the Court of Auditors leaves of manifesto that still is due to realise an arduous work in the applicant countries.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, considered and esteemed colleagues, recently we reached an agreement with the Court of Auditors by whom we could in advance receive information of the Court of Auditors with absolutely confidential character and also we agree we would indeed maintain that it in silence.
<seg>Also it would want to direct me to the Council and to ask to him why it does not advance with regard to article 24 of the Financial Regulation.
<seg>Perhaps a little common sense of the European Union contributes to the resolution of the problem and to place to George Bush in the place of the history that is deserved - its dustbin!
<seg>We must look for expiatorios chivos, neither in our institutions nor in our States.
<seg>First of all, regard to the procedure of presentation of the annual report to the Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control, cheers to me to listen to the reassuring words of the Honourable member in the sense that the east situation year is more satisfactory than in previous years.
<seg>But we will have opportunity to treat that mainly.
<seg>When it is important, from the point of view of the control, we mentioned everything what there is to mention.
<seg>Lordships, since they must have noticed, the final part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors has undergone the consequences of the interference of an ill-fated virus between its speech and this Assembly.
<seg>Some amendments, like the 1 and the 18, have to do with questions that concern essentially to the United Kingdom and is necessary to say that all the groups of the United Kingdom, are socialist, popular or green they have defended, them with great vehemence and they have been approved in the Environment Committee.
<seg>Sir President, in March of this year we adopted the manager on the funicular ones destined to transport of persons.
<seg>We thought that they are not due to make fall on the commerce the anticipated obligations of the manufacturer to the legislation regarding product safety.
<seg>We have heard the justifications in favor of the same and to favor also repeat the arguments of the sector that already we listened in commission.
<seg>The selling report would have to be enough whereupon to the buying one on the nature of products and the little data which it has on the same.
<seg>Finally, an European question to the Commission in relation to article 4 with regard to the European standards and to the question of if these norms are due to make public.
<seg>I feel satisfied with the exceptions that include for the establishments of institutions and charitable organisations without profit spirit, and for the articles that are commercialized as articles of second hand in swap-meets or on the part of individuals.
<seg>The reliability in the innocuity of products and the attendance posventa is one more a capital gain for the particularly difficult and in a while decisive European label.
<seg>When in another context we asked to the Commission that presents/displays a proposal regarding safety of services, turns out incomprehensible which now they are tried to jointly regulate the aspects related to the services, instead of to wait for to that the Commission to present its proposal. Indeed, already it is possible to be anticipated that delimitation problems will arise from the scope of application of the different norms and legal uncertainty will be increased with time.
<seg>It would mean words to present/display the main aspects of this proposal.
<seg>Also, we have now anticipated the possibility of abrir the system to nonmember countries, in particular, to the countries candidates: the simplification of the procedures to introduce emergency measures to Community level, so that we pruned to take part quickly as a result of the opinion of a Regulatory committee.
<seg>This new requirement does not involve any additional substantial responsibility in the case of this type of stores.
<seg>To replace “the producing” word by “borrower”, as it proposes amendment 11, would create more confusion than clarity, since any definition of borrower in the directive does not exist.
<seg>Although the Commission is in favor of the creation the sooner of a network, this end will have to be decided between the Member States.
<seg>This certificate always can be used to present evidence, but it cannot be considered in himself like a decisive test.
<seg>After to have explained of way detailed the reasons by which the Commission cannot accept amendments 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 up to 30, 32, 33, 36 up to 34 and it leaves from amendment 7, the second part of 21 amendment and first number of the amendments 27 and 34, I can inform to them that the Commission yes can accept the amendments 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31 and 35 and part of amendment 7, first part of 21 amendment and second number of the amendments 27 and 34, because they constitute an improvement and a clarification of the Commission proposal.
<seg>Evidently, for Mr. Crespo if he is socialist Italian not it can be member of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists.
<seg>I believe that conflict between 12 amendment and amendment 37 does not exist.
<seg>As far as the order of the voting I leave, it to the decision of the President, and indicate that, in any case, I am against the three amendments.
<seg>The extracommunity Mediterranean countries face, what it doubts fits, particularly serious problems related to the economic development. The regional inequalities are increased incessantly.
<seg>As for the respect for the dignity of the legal immigrants, for the sake of a harmonized European policy in the matter of immigration, besides the legal instruments to guarantee its fair treatment, it would be necessary to create instruments of financial aid in favor of all those young people who, having finished to a cycle of studies superior or college student in the European countries, wish to return to their States of origin to begin to carry out a professional activity.
<seg>It would want to emphasize a factor, that I consider determining frankly in this question; the lack of equality in the labor land.
<seg>Although delayed, the Commission presented/displayed the Program regarding the communitarian strategy frame on the equality between men and women (2001-2005), that separates markedly from the previous ones and, in particular, of the fourth program of action that concludes at the end of this year.
<seg>On the one hand, because proposed improvements presented/displayed by my Group have considered diverse. On the other, because it is insisted on the necessity to examine the situation of women in the national labor markets and the inadequate access to the social security systems on the base of statistics elaborated from representative and detachhed data according to the sort.
<seg>. (IN) My party has serious reservations regarding to on sale apply consumption product Community legislation, like with respect to the refusal to apply the concept of mutual recognition of the norms.
<seg>Now it understands already it and the amendments Labour Party members offer the guarantee of which these stores will remain intact and be free of the directive.
<seg>Finally, amendment 15 leaves the free hands to the Commission with respect to the language regime of the Agency, which we considered very worrisome.
<seg>The simplification of the decision making procedures, the creation of decentralized operational bases (not only in Pristine, where it has acquired the meaning of his separation of Yugoslavia), the treatment of the double structure between the Management board and the Commission, positive movements in the direction can turn out to confront the great bureaucratic insufficiency of the European Agency for Reconstruction.
<seg>We vote against for that reason as much of the Commission proposal as of the Parliament report.
<seg>By all this, it seems just that the existing Community legislation in the matter adapts.
<seg>Also, the bottom offers the possibility that the administrations more or less grant concealed aid in the form of co-financing on the part of the Member States.
<seg>. () In spite of its serious deficiencies, the Morillon report is, without a doubt, more advanced than the Commission proposal with regard to the association European Union - Ôurquía.
<seg>We have voted against.
<seg>Like the rapporteur, we must admit that Turkey has progressed in some planes and that exist positive signals.
<seg>From 1987 our Assembly had initiated the route of the recognition, and the approval of the present amendment demonstrates the coherence of the Parliament in this debate.
<seg>The Union must do more propose ones and to consider the extension to Turkey like indispensable a geopolitical strategy.
<seg>These second unworthy intentions are unworthy of Europe and of Turkey.
<seg>For several years, like member of the delegation for the relations with Canada, I have been able to observe operation of one of these regional organisations, the OPANO (Fisheries Organisation in the North-western Atlantic), in which the States of this region participate, among them Canada, as well as all those who use in this place traditional fishing zones, among them European France, Spain and other countries.
<seg>One will not be satisfied until its fleet of canteens, hoisting the flags of the “ring of stars”, watches the fulfillment of its fisheries policies.
<seg>The important thing is not, then, to satisfy the will with hegemony of the Commission and to debilitate the position of Europe, which would be in contradiction with a correct application of the principle of subsidiarity.
<seg>Finally, after difficult negotiations one reached a result that is worth the trouble to defend.
<seg>Thus, the objective of this proposal directed toward replacing three directives regarding the waste incineration is to improve air quality, of the water, of grounds, the human health, reducing the tie pollutant emissions with the activities of incineration and coincineration, and mainly of dioxinas, furanos and heavy metals.
<seg>However, also it seems important to me to emphasize like newness that now no longer is solely about the emissions to the atmosphere but also the emissions to waters and the Earth.
<seg>The proposal has been improved during its elaboration.
<seg>The introduction of much more strict limits of emissions of NOx for the new facilities of coincineration, such as the cement furnaces, is another step forward that will serve as incentive for the reducing emission, although the proposed regulations do not reflect the best techniques available.
<seg>. (IN) Sir President, Lordships, I request excuses - especially to Mr. Blokland - by to have arrived minutes takes.
<seg>In order to finish, the present directive is a major contribution to the reduction of the harmful effects on the environment and the risks that these represent for the human health.
<seg>The European Parliament will be honored, in the name of the discriminations and of the fight against the exclusions and in the respect of the responsibilities of each, in giving an strong impetus to the creation of a device that will allow that the essential principle of solidarity exists concretely.
<seg>Major differences between the individual countries of the Union are registered, nevertheless, and lack comparable statistical data detailed to be able to state of trustworthy way what is what is in force in each country, what is - and where what works better, which are the weak points, et cetera. Therefore, indeed, in my opinion, elaborated by behalf of the Commission of Economic and Monetary Policy, the necessity is emphasized, before legislating Community rules on the supplementary health insurances, of which the Commission prepares a Green Paper that picks up and systematizes all these now dispersed data and all the information on the matter.
<seg>Until today, this subject has considered taboo to a certain extent.
<seg>We are in danger that due to the presence of serious risks the citizens with health problems and the people majors only can contract a limited private insurance, which is incompatible with social development.
<seg>The second point of view illustrated by the initial intention of the rapporteur and shared by many colleagues consists of promoting the regulations and the codes of conduct necessary to restore, between insuring, the forms of mutualización of the costs - guaranteeing to all the benefit of an high quality health care - and to avoid the risks of which they are developed to practices discriminatorias, as well as a selection of the risks and the clients.
<seg>I think that he is absolutely erroneous that the money is the determining factor to put itself first in the tail.
<seg>The fresh proposal of the Committee on Employment and Social affairs seems to us correct: first an inventory in a green book is elaborated and soon we will decide if we needed a directive or a recommendation.
<seg>At present, in the Netherlands a debate is taking place about the introduction of structural changes in the system.
<seg>This one is the base of which there is to divide the Commission to elaborate an initiative and to articulate concrete litmus tests that can become lines directives for the health systems of the Member States.
<seg>For this reason, it is little probable that the answer is an absolute single solution and for all the health insurances.
<seg>For that reason, I believe that we must bet by the content of the report of Mr. Rocard, to that we congratulated, that requests to the Commission the service provision, of a Green Paper that will allow us to know the present state the insurances in the Member States and also to define the future.
<seg>Both are developed on a model of three pillars: the state one, enterprise and the private one.
<seg>With regard to the supplementary pensions, the European Union already has elaborated a set of rules. It has done it through the writing of a green book del that follows a draft directive.
<seg>. (IN) Sir President, would want to express my gratefulness and to give the enhorabuena to Mr. Rocard by his report, and to congratulate Mr.
<seg>This study will be able to form the base for a Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament that proposes initiatives or measures.
<seg>In relation to the amendments by the Committee Budgetary, I can affirm with joy that all has been gotten up.
<seg>We have supported the characteristics characteristic of the program, as they are the multidimensional treatment of the phenomenon, the measures on the health, the education, the house, the coherence and the complementariness with other related policies, as well as the participation of the nongovernmental organizations, and own people in question by the social exclusion.
<seg>This means that we must take advantage of the ascending phases the cycle to give back to the situation to a balance or a surplus.
<seg>In this respect simply I will remember that the Ecofin recent Council has solicitd of the Commission that, as of the coming year, already includes in the stability assessment of the programmes indeed this aspect of long term of public finances regarding ageing of the population.
<seg>One of the positive characteristics of the program of the Netherlands is the special attention that renders - since I have said before to the impact of the ageing of the population in public finance during the coming years.
<seg>For that reason, the budgetary resultant for the year 2000, in the case of Germany, will give to a situation of surplus of a point and means of the Gross domestic product.
<seg>If to it we united the change in the exchange rate of the Euro relation to the dollar, we have known a clearly negative impact in terms of inflation.
<seg>They also go in the sense to make a public system compatible of distribution with deprived systems of capitalization and, evidently, they are compatible also with supports for the creation of specific investment funds that can obtain long term tax advantages and that can help to make deal with the problem of the aging.
<seg>The third principle that guides to us, then, is the precautionary principle.
<seg>It is precise to remember that at the moment several prescribed proposals are being discussed, that they will help to reinforce the effectiveness and the relevance of the Community mechanism and, therefore - I wait for therefore it -, consumer confidence.
<seg>However, this relatively low incidence is not reason to feel satisfied us.
<seg>Frankly, it disappointed to me that in the declaration that did yesterday Prime minister Jospin was not any so positive recognition of the role that has carried out the Community during the past few years.
<seg>The necessity evident exists to find explanations to the increased incidence of BSE, not only in France, but also in other Member States.
<seg>The Nourishing and Veterinary Office of the Commission already grants absolute priority to the controls of the Member States in relation to the measures of protection against the BSE.
<seg>With regard to its security, permítanme that repeats that already a wide range of controls exists in force to guarantee that the animal meals do not represent a threat of contagion of the BSE.
<seg>Yes, although it can be difficult to believe, were necessary four years to approve a measurement that I consider fundamental for public health protection.
<seg>Sir President of the Council, I want to demand specifically that the Council makes public, finally, its opinion about the Regulation on the BSE.
<seg>In this situation, the unique form to break the circle of BSE contagion is the total ban to use animal meals in fodder.
<seg>In this matter, it would want to show that the Liberal Group has presented/displayed an amendment that I hope that it is approved.
<seg>The policies must change this state of things so that the true people in charge of this crisis are penalized and so that precise decisions allow to take a first step in order to end this tragic crisis.
<seg>It would have, then, that to review them.
<seg>The labelling of the bovine meat that has been has been approved, that is a minimum labelling and that entered in force makes only two month and a half, does not allow to track the origin of animals suitably and we have prohibited very delayed the specific materials of risk.
<seg>The public opinion must be totally informed into the characteristics of the test to which I talk about.
<seg>At that time, Sir President of the Council, almost did not do anything or nothing, as their homologous ones either did not do anything with regard to the consequences of Chernobyl, nothing with regard to the epidemic of AIDS, nothing with regard to the contaminated blood, always by the same reason: not to bring about the panic in the public opinion.
<seg>The French prohibition will cause an enormous increase in demand, but the existence of this products is limited.
<seg>The consumers are lost confidence, and to contain this phenomenon it is necessary to generalize tests BSE to the bovines and the ovines.
<seg>In the sense of the Commission proposal now it is much more important to work so that the animal meals respond to the maximum safety criteria.
<seg>By the others, I agree totally - by once and without she serves as precedent with whatever ladies Ainardi, Auroi and Grossetête have said to the colleagues.
<seg>Then, representatives of the Council and of the Commission, have a financial basis sufficient to carry out a solid policy.
<seg>We must stop it. Mr.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, I congratulate myself to hear here, in this chamber, that, costs what costs, is necessary to change the CAP.
<seg>Had denounced we it at the time, right here, with Jimmy Goldsmith.
<seg>The food must be a safe food the human being.
<seg>I consider very exemplary that France has hurried to take this step.
<seg>But, to those not them aid!
<seg>For this reason, it surprises to me that in these circumstances they are continued being able to use or to process corpses.
<seg>Recently the report has been published in the United Kingdom Phillips on BSE.
<seg>It would want to suggest European Commission also applies the precautionary principle to it with respect to the meat of bovine of France.
<seg>Today we must know, since we followed in the uncertainty, which are the scientific datas, which are the measures that must be adopted.
<seg>On the other hand, I have heard all these proposals; I am not insensible to them.
<seg>If representatives of the Member States come and they say to me that the legislation he has not been applied in its totality, perhaps we must reframe the subject, but we will not do it because the scientists say to us that it is necessary, but because lagoons in the law enforcement in the European Union exist.
<seg>The best way of nonoírnos is not to invite to us. In any case, Mr.
<seg>The Commission considers that for the explanation and the coordination of those policies the readmission agreements play a role important and at this moment are in negotiation course the first Community agreements of reinstatement with Russia, Sri Lanka, the Pakistan and Morocco.
<seg>What proposals have the Commission in this matter on basis of Article 31 of the Union?
<seg>(The speaker is interrupted by the President)
<seg>The objective during this period has been to reduce the public deficit to obtain a monetary policy more acomodante, minors interest rates and an increased growth.
<seg>I say whenever the Euro will not introduce the 1 of January of 2002, the Euro already is in our pocket; we have it with different fractional currencies, but we have already it in the pocket.
<seg>The maximum values established by Directive 92/72 were not exceeded in the city of Athens, although it is possible to observe that measurements in the middle of summer did not take place.
<seg>Subject: Public aid to the audiovisual sector In a seminary of the French Presidency on the industries related to the culture, a representative of the Directorate General of European Competence of the Commission affirmed that imposed the legal obligations of investment to the television channels constitute State aids because these investments are imposed with compulsory nature by the legislator.
<seg>It will be respected and protected ".
<seg>However, this is not evident, since the new growth is very desigualitario and can be accompanied, we have seen since it in the United States for about ten years, by persistent phenomena of uncertainty, exclusion, poverty, urban ghettización.
<seg>The governments of the Member States did not accept this definition, that also is truth is something simple and too banal.
<seg>In the hostile atmosphere that is created, they are many those that are in the way and which they are rejected.
<seg>Sir President, in this Plenary session is listened to very frequently, like one cantinela, the glorification of the model European social, the social market economy whom there is to oppose with pride - they think many it - to the wild model of the United States.
<seg>(Technical defect)
<seg>This is an huge amount.
<seg>In addition, they must get up all the political levels.
<seg>I agree upon the necessity to know the causes better the poverty, support the preventive actions against the exclusion as a result of fusions, industrial changes, transfers of undertakings, rural desertification, urban hyperconcentration, with innovating and concrete interventions that involve the participation of the social partners, the local authorities and nationals and the joint action of the citizens.
<seg>A very interesting debate has taken place on the paper of the use in the fight against social exclusion and the paper of the social and structural reforms.
<seg>This is a legal nature problem, since, with adjustment in accordance with the Treaty, only fits the reference to the social exclusion and not to the poverty.
<seg>In my opinion, these proposals constitute a pragmatic response to their question.
<seg>But to agree in the strategy necessarily does not mean to agree in the details.
<seg>If we defined a binding clear framework and for the Member States, the diverse systems that they must fulfill such exigencies must have a longer probationary period.
<seg>The renewable energies are not going to be the panacea to solve this problem. But nobody doubt that, mainly, they can contribute to palliate it and also to diversify the power plants and to reduce our dependency of hydrocarbons, which on the other hand would not come anything to us badly.
<seg>I am going to repeat three of our demands.
<seg>The setting target realistic will serve without a doubt to increase public confidence in the energy policy who is applied.
<seg>I believe that a vigorous policy in the matter of renewable energies is a symbol for the Europe morning.
<seg>Finally, these agreements must allow that the European countries make reality their contribution reach the objectives sets in Kioto.
<seg>He is lamentable that excludes any category that can contribute to the general achievement of the objective to recover energy from residues as much - if it is projects on small scale as if it is a part of the total calculation.
<seg>The conformation of the biomass of the crowd in its vegetal photosynthesis and production of waste is similar to the one of the other vegetal biomasses.
<seg>I want to inform to Mr. Chichester who against the coast of my town is settling windmills in the sea quickly, a project that doubtless is going to enter operation in very just a short time, so that I would like to invite to see it to him when she has already started up.
<seg>The controversial one on the resignation to the nuclear power, for example in Sweden and Germany, is developing that if ecological energy alternatives do not exist in the horizon that are viable to a competitive price, the debate is condemned the failure.
<seg>For this reason, the Member States must count on binding targets.
<seg>Therefore, I am optimist before the future potential of the renewable energies, whenever the necessary incentives are lent.
<seg>I believe that it is necessary much value to place continuously to the renewable energies in the place that deserve.
<seg>A very strong ascent of the oil price, doubtlessly, locates to us with greater crudity before the associated problems to our energy dependence of the fossil energy sources.
<seg>Therefore, we cannot accept amendment 28.
<seg>However, when doing it, the Commission remembers very that the used terms do not prejudge their right of initiative nor must be incompatible with the single market of the electricity.
<seg>In the commission for the reconstruction of Tajikistan, where there are 25 000 widows, only one of the 26 delegates was woman.
<seg>Although the proportion of women has been limited, there are studies that demonstrate that the participation of the women in the peacekeeping forces of La Paz of the UN improves the relations with the local population and the general moral.
<seg>The Theorin report enters this field in detail very concrete and realises repetitions that as European Group of the European People and of the European Democrats we requested they extract in the sense of an official document.
<seg>From the political point of view, I consider that amendment 19 can be interpreted like a tactical defeat or a tactical one step back instead of a real commitment, which is not worthy of the cause of the woman.
<seg>Prisoners were maintained.
<seg>Also Portugal, where the women did not have access to the diplomacy until the “Revolution of April of 1974”, has demonstrated recently, with the case of Eastern Timor and of our ambassador in Indonesia, Ana Gomes, who the paper of a woman and its sensitivity towards the problems and the suffering of a people that confronted solo a fight of 25 years by the freedom can be felt by everybody and, in particular, here, in the European Parliament.
<seg>To date the Member States are few have done that it.
<seg>For this reason, it is necessary to consider this dimension when drawing up the policies of the European European in the future.
<seg>Unfortunately, it is not come to define the concepts nor become distinctions.
<seg>It transmits, please, to the Council our protest.
<seg>They are people with different experiences; necessary experiences in the way in that the policy is exerted, especially in conflict management.
<seg>It is closed the debate.
<seg>What it takes to the second point to me. If it is desired to regulate the sector, several aspects will be due to analyze.
<seg>The last weeks I have known that a great interest on the part of international the union circles like of some national union organizations exists as much.
<seg>Allegation against two. Then they are in agreement with a wage for mistresses of house?
<seg>It makes the easiest life to many families and favors the equality of opportunities.
<seg>Frequently, in this project two or three families have been united to jointly place a person.
<seg>We were reunited in the Plenary session of that partial initial period of sessions of the month of October, while the debate on the situation in Yugoslavia was celebrated immediately, when we knew of the brave reaction of Serbian people, and, as they remember, honourable Members, we requested the lifting of sanctions international.
<seg>In this way, Europe has demonstrated the vitality of its civilization, within the frame of the history of the world, and its capacity of creative political imagination for its future development.
<seg>It is evident that the issue of the situation of Kosovo is a democratic problem.
<seg>On the other hand, we would like to have the opportunity to demonstrate to Europe that we are able to develop the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia by our own means, through recognition of the authentic principles of democracy.
<seg>I must say that, when listening to him, I was at the same time impressed much by the form in which you controlled a so difficult situation, and by its determination.
<seg>It will be fixed in the next Act, Mr. Watson.
<seg>The access to documents and the information regarding the activities of the institutions allows the citizens to control to the control systems of the EU and stimulates an increased effectiveness.
<seg>I consider that a fifth major amendment is the annual report that must especially examine the documents that must keep secrets or that, at least, keep secrets.
<seg>This question is ambiguous, and is possible that also they enter and they are in force more restrictive norms, reason why we have presented/displayed amendments to this point, among others.
<seg>The Foreign Affairs Committee rejects the idea to except of the transparency, automatically and in group, to documents regarding the foreign affairs and of security.
<seg>If we want that the rights of citizens are really effective, we specifically needed for those places new personal creation preparation that know to guide the citizens who look for information through complicated labyrinth of the institutions.
<seg>These are important to be able to reach an internal publicity.
<seg>I am pleased that the Parliament has managed to create a broad majority in favor of an increased openness.
<seg>Sir President, would want to begin being thankful for to the rapporteurs this excellent work.
<seg>Sir President, the access and European transparency in the European do not enjoy good reputation.
<seg>Of being thus, an error is committed, since it is the credibility and reliability that the European Union for the citizen has.
<seg>Documents are many things nowadays and we would like to guarantee that there is the possible amplest access to whichever types different from documents of the diverse forms is possible.
<seg>Sir President, the position of the Commission with respect to the public access to documents can see itself in the internal handbook that was sent day 11 of October to the Commission employees to inform to them into how they must manage the requests for access public document presented/displayed by the deputies the European Parliament.
<seg>This disposition must be eliminated or, at least, extended so that it includes the consideration to evaluate the interest of the applicant.
<seg>The normal way in which it is developed to the international cooperation in the field with the game rules and uses of the diplomacy, that is to say, that everything is carried out with the lowered curtains, does not serve in the modern cooperation to which the EU has evolved.
<seg>It is not necessary to confuse it with the role of the European Parliament or the future interinstitutional agreements.
<seg>I consider that a step forward has occurred towards the exercise of the right of the citizen to the information and to the knowledge.
<seg>Nevertheless, he is not the unique one to who I thank, thank you very much deserves also Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen of Grupo PPE-DE, that has been the editor of the proposal by virtue of the strictest application of the procedure Hughes.
<seg>The transparency must be elevated like basic pillar of all the activities of the Union, but the right to accede to documents is not still sufuciente of in case for the consumation of the transparency.
<seg>The European Parliament asks, then, that the common European security and defense is introduced in the future in the structures of the European Commission.
<seg>When one went to the Parliament, the past 3 of October, President Prodi talked about the institutional triangle and evoked that in an European system based on controls and balances, the fluidity of the operation of each institution contributes to the common interest.
<seg>I must recognize that the major challenge in this Regulation is the precise definition than they are the documents.
<seg>I want to stand out that, at the time, practically, the Commission could accept the totality of the amendments, like the 9, the 18, the 21 partially, the 23, the 25, the 26,1, the 28 f, the 35, the 38, the 40,1, the 40,6, the 41,1, the 42, the 43,1, the 47, the 49 and the 52.
<seg>It would want to vote sometimes in favor of the proposals formulated by the Commission, and for it is necessary indeed that the deputies have of the list of amendments that the European Commission can support and the list of which she does not want to support.
<seg>Equity capital of the credit institutions
<seg>Finally, and the most controverted, the commission made a strong call in favor of the use of a fast track procedure to apply this legislation.
<seg>These amendments replace several other proposals in the report that probably will be rejected in the voting and which then they will be replaced by these new resulting amendments of that consensus.
<seg>. (IN) President, in view of the excellent vote of support to this report and given the response from the Commission this morning, is obvious - if all the parts are observed on which we have voted - that, under protection of section 2 of article 69 of the Regulation, we would have to postpone the vote on the draft of legislative resolution to be able to initiate meaningful negotiations with the Commission and the Council.
<seg>Sir President I feel, it if I said that Grupo PPE-DE also had asked that postpones the voting, but his coordinator approached to me and he said that they also wanted to me to postpone the subject until the period of sessions of November II, instead of to vote now.
<seg>The reason by that it would suggest we postponed the voting is that - since has indicated Mr. Goebbels - one is a very important question.
<seg>I do not know how much the recorded vote costs, but it is without a doubt hundreds of thousands of francs, or Belgian francs, our budget.
<seg>I know that in France whole herds have sacrificed themselves and it does not seem that one is the best form to advance.
<seg>to eliminate the animal meals of the feeding of all the animal, not only of the one of the cattle and ovine, but also of the one of the pig, the poultries and the fish,
<seg>This is not permissible.
<seg>It will be with dispositions as these as the consumers will tranquilize and the agriculturists will hear the message of solidarity that we wished to transmit to them.
<seg>He is necessary and urgent to go more far: to promote a change of the Common agricultural policy.
<seg>The prohibition to use animal meals in feedingstuffs of the cattle is not more than the first passage in this direction.
<seg>We are sorry enormously, on the contrary, that the proposed amendments by our Group have not been approved.
<seg>I believe that he would be reasonable to reduce the working hour of the people who work in companies that contaminate.
<seg>I will end up again insisting on the fact that the generalization of the operation of hazardous waste does not have to take to accommodate us to us to the production of such residues.
<seg>Indeed, if, for example, there were more pensions sufficient to live, there would be less poor men.
<seg>The report raises a game of 100 million Euros in five years to reduce the poverty.
<seg>I give my unreserved support to the proposal to twice start up a process of Luxembourg in the scope of the social exclusion, that includes lines directives and national action plans.
<seg>Indeed, the report solicits that qualitative and quantitative indicators of the social exclusion pay attention.
<seg>When presenting/displaying its proposal for a programme to fight the social exclusion, the Commission is fulfilling the request of the Council to present/display “for June of 2000” a “initiative for the cooperation in this field”.
<seg>Sir President, I have abstained for a very concrete reason: this report, in my opinion, has not realised, from the ecological point of view, those progresses that I hoped and augured.
<seg>I trust that this system extends to all the cities of Europe.
<seg>Some European Parliament proposals are not realistic and they cannot count on my support.
<seg>Also we must be able to obtain in the future better than more the good practices are known existing publicly.
<seg>The people who count on high incomes and are conscious of the environment have the freedom to choose one more a cleaner energy within a free market, whereas the rest follows without being able to choose.
<seg>In accordance with the order of business, it is come in the first place to the joint debate of the following motions for a resolution:
<seg>These three reasons are the following: first, because it abounds in the process of consolidation of the democracy and the deepening of the exigency of the respect for human rights, particularly in relation to the indigenous populations.
<seg>Sir President, in this debate we want to express, like the other colleagues have said to it very well who have preceded to me in the use of the word, solidarity and the support of our institution to the Central American Parliament in a while in which we are fighting so that the priority in the field of the external relations of the European Union with the countries of Ibero-America stays.
<seg>I do not have the reserves that have been able to express our companion and dear friend, the chairman of the delegation for relations with the Countries of America Central and Mexico, Mr. Seguro, as far as the issue of human rights.
<seg>Finally, in the dialogue with the Central American authorities, the Commission also is reiterating the importance that must occur to the process of regional integration like instrument to consolidate the democratization and the development in the zone.
<seg>In order to cling to the power it has not doubted in seizing of the obsessive debate on the “marfilidad”, causing a xenophobia big wave: hatred to the other, the foreigner, the original one of Burkina or the Malian and, nevertheless, those are many that work and live in the territory of the Ivory Coast for long years.
<seg>The restoration of a true democracy in the Ivory Coast will not be able to be made without the independent establishment of a committee of inquiry of the committed crimes and without the official commitment cause that the human rights and civil La Paz are respected.
<seg>Some think that the importance of the democracy is relative when is Africa, that is complex procedures, that is precise to give time to the time. However, I believe that there is no possible compromise with the democracy and the question that considers today for the Ivory Coast she is the same that the one that considers for example for Guinea, when it knows at the moment that there are people in prison and who there is no a democratic system.
<seg>I will finish with the following question: dictatorships exist, Sir President, only because there are towns that suffer of misery, which they do not have access to the knowledge, that do not have access to the knowledge.
<seg>He would not be illogical that the European Union today demanded the celebration of new presidential elections in which they could participate, this time, all the candidates.
<seg>This occurs in many parts of Africa with the most different religious and ethnic mixtures.
<seg>These elections must even if it is only allow the representation to national level of the political parties that were excluded in the presidential election and to compensate thus, partially, the imperfections of this first election.
<seg>on the situation in Burma
<seg>They are carrying out an major offensive against the Shan town and against the town Karen and, according to it has affirmed the relator of the UN, some of dialogue between the SPDC and the National League for Democracy does not exist signal.
<seg>For this reason, we reaffirmed the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.
<seg>I hope that when giving priority to this urgent question like, this Parliament transmits a clear message to the people of Burma which its urgent situation is not forgotten and that we recognize that the situation in Burma is getting worse instead of to improve and are determined to try to do something on the matter.
<seg>It has taken much in being obtained.
<seg>In Asia indeed one occurs the danger that the economic reforms and the policies disconnect, of which can have economic progress and economic liberalization without liberalization in the policy area and fortification of the right state, although I I am of the opinion that without a right state that works, the commerce, the subsidys and the investments will be had lost in the long run.
<seg>Sir President, I am in agreement with my predecessors in the turn of word with many essential points than there are saying much, because than today it is happening in Viet Nam is not acceptable.
<seg>However, now Human Rights Watch says, to that Mr. Swoboda made reference, who Vietnam has taken to time some steps in the last to improve the situation in relation to the human rights.
<seg>These extremely secret documents provide a stranger to us watched between frames of the Vietnamese government policy.
<seg>The Commission follows convinced, however, that a lasting solution to the current situation by means of a dialogue between the military regime, the elected opposition democratically and the representatives of the ethnic minorities only can be reached.
<seg>Clear pressures of the Vietnamese authorities also exist so that its own press has a self-censoring regime.
<seg>In accordance with the order of business, the debate comes now on the following motions for a resolution:
<seg>Also we required that the EU gives aid and attendance, not only in the southwest but in all the zones that have been affected.
<seg>I ask to them all you the support to our resolution.
<seg>He is urgent that the Union is not limited to unfold extraordinary nature action when the catastrophes already have happened.
<seg>The Commission has taken two initiatives in this sense.
<seg>Sir President, has taken place a merely linguistic error when introducing one of the amendments in the joint resolution.
<seg>The voting on its delay means to delay the order to the Commission.
<seg>(The Parliament adopts the resolution)
<seg>The report leaves from the establishment with which an increasing part of the health insurances in Europe is covered by means of supplementary health insurances.
<seg>It seems rare to me that it is now wanted to handcuff to the Commission facing a proposal for a directive, but that simultaneously requests a Green Paper to him on the present state of the voluntary associations and the complementary health insurances.
<seg>At a time at which the population ages of spectacular way, he is crucial that we try to improve the health system for the people of all Europe.
<seg>We could not contribute to it.
<seg>Sir President, are firm arguments in favor of the fast track when he is to apply the results of the revision of Basel on banking capital adequacy.
<seg>In those conditions, an initiative thus would have rather the inverse effect to the hoped one imposing to our banking sectors additional obligations without compensation guarantees. In spite of the exhortations of this Assembly, the Commission absolutely does not have any means to guarantee that the banks of the European Union will stop being object of a discriminatory treatment on the part of the American authorities.
<seg>We must have well-taken care of of which Basel, in addition, does not produce that to the banks it causes a second to them ballast one more a higher demand of equity capital.
<seg>East fact initial comment, I would like to indicate that I believe that the economic operators also consider the approach satisfactory that is had been giving to these regulations on the capital which they reinforce the subjects referred to the risk.
<seg>Those are initial thoughts from how we could get to secure a controlable and outside efficient fast process legislative that within the present regulations of the Treaty.
<seg>And, in fact, the moment has arrived for recognizing that the institution of the “European European Ombudsman” sufficiently is developed and has already given maturity sufficient evidences to have an own budget.
<seg>Grupo EPP/ED especially supports the position of the Constitutional Affairs Committee of which the competitions of the European Ombudsman would have to be extended and the sooner better, with regard to the powers of established investigation of the European Ombudsman in Article 3 of the 1994 decision.
<seg>An European Ombudsman obvious is limited by the norms that govern the documentary secret, but is or that the citizens know that he or she, like European Ombudsman, can have access to documents to which they themselves do not have.
<seg>The starting point of the present report is the recommendation of the ombudsman to the Commission, in relation to the previous thing, of which it makes possible to the candidates access to his examinations already corrected with respect to the procedure of selection organized by the same.
<seg>We think that the Community institutions would have to carry out their recruitment procedures of personnel, and, in fact, all procedures, with the maximum openness and transparency to avoid the suspicions of bias, injustice and administrative incompetence.
<seg>I talk about here to an amendment regarding the exigency of the unquestionable test of the development of an oral test, for example.
<seg>Our colleague, Mr. Bösch, already has set out briefly here the amendments that have become to this report.
<seg>After to have formulated individual questions to the Commission on the management and the organization of the last internal opposition, I received detailed practical responses and.
<seg>Thus one begins abrir the process of the government and to do it is transparent it.
<seg>First, in the examinations that become on the part of the Commission, the corrections are made always anonymously.
<seg>Evidently it was speaking of 2000 July.
<seg>VOTINGS
<seg>(The Assembly rejects the postponement of the vote proposal)
<seg>In order to evaluate the Manager on Capital resources of the Institutes of Credit the several interests must be hefted carefully that enter conflict there.
<seg>Thus the idea arose from an European Police College for the Member States of the European European and the Countries candidates.
<seg>This one is the position also defended by the rapporteur and that European European People joint party.
<seg>The social situation in the majority of the Member States of the European European is of such nature that, indeed, is great necessity of collaboration between the different police forces beyond the borders from its home country.
<seg>It seems that the majority of that they have taken part until now considers that he is essential that the school has soothes permanent.
<seg>The nth provisional but nonprecarious decision, a small gift that the Council usually makes this Parliament.
<seg>The rapporteur wishes that year the prevention of the delinquency, the provision of services, the innovation and the border surveillance and also wishes that the internal security modifies so that it includes the maintaining law and the order.
<seg>Those were the ideals that proposed to us and that one was the type of state by which they worked.
<seg>Greeting the possibility of making level the standards of some Member States of the European European.
<seg>From the first reflections on this dossier that became in the European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission was committed before the Member States to make advance an action destined to develop what we could consider a laid the foundations European police culture with more the highest standards of deontology, respect for the rights and liberties of the citizens and effectiveness in the fight against crime.
<seg>This one tries that the Academy of police is developed mainly from an intergovernmental perspective.
<seg>By the referred reasons, the deputies to the European Parliament of the Party Greek Communist we voted against the report.
<seg>- (SV) I have voted against the report on provisional establishment of the European Police College.
<seg>Doubtlessly many of our courts are very slow and weighty, and is very difficult to make them act quickly in these subjects.
<seg>By all means, the proposed regulation is not perfect, since it is connected with the regulation “Brussels II”, that does not include the children whose parents are separated, as well as to the maritally children.
<seg>My own mother underwent resemblance type of separation and kidnapping 85 years ago, and still it speaks to envelope.
<seg>For that reason, which meant to the Parliament is that in the action program on the mutual recognition of the judicial decisions in civil matter - whose approval we hoped from now until the end of this year, the Commission proposes that the first and highest priority is granted to the extension of the scope of implementation of the regulation of Brussels II and, therefore, of this regulation on the right of access, including without discrimination to the children of married couples and those of unions in fact.
<seg>We go to proceedings to the vote.
<seg>Nowadays, the sport - and is suitable decirlo- is bound to other economic sectors closely, like, for example, sector industries audio-visual or to the one of the promotion and sale of sport products.
<seg>What we needed is an intelligent and flexible way to interpret the current rules.
<seg>One treats, rigorously, of an attack on democracy, no matter how much we avoid to see the things with that prism.
<seg>For that reason the Commission this in the hope of shortly receiving an answer to its detailed request for information on the measures planned by the government of the United Kingdom.
<seg>This proposal was presented/displayed by the Finance Minister in a pre-budgetary declaration realised six months before the presentation of the complete draft budget in spring of the 2001.
<seg>Again, I believe that what has said Mr. Simpson has been of enormous aid to tranquilize to us on the probable intentions of the government of the United Kingdom.
<seg>Cloggings are not only waste of time, not only stops generate costs, but for environment is everything problem, and for that reason I create, if the British government really assigns money to solve these problems, that then all will receive something of it, especially all the citizens of Europe.
<seg>We are practically the unique oil producer of the European Union and in spite of it we suffer the highest prices of the gasoline, the highest prices of diesel engine in comparison with any other European country - in Great Britain we paid 1.20 pounds sterling by liter of diesel engine.
<seg>This item on the agenda is closed.
<seg>The European Parliament must let them know that it is to its side, and I propose to them, once again, that we express with a minute of silence our solidarity and our emotion.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, is for supporting it totally, since I comprise of which have requested the insertion of this point.
<seg>We obtain some significant progresses.
<seg>The EU will deepen its relations with all the important groups and also it will be put in contact with the new Government of the EE.UU as rapidly as possible.
<seg>Prescott on the agreement that he himself had elaborated, how it is that not only Mrs Voynet, but also - I create the majority of the other European ministers of Environment - and this one is my final question to rejected it to the Commissariats?
<seg>It is to fear that the impulse is had lost and the American negotiators change and in May is necessary to begin again.
<seg>The forests have constituted this time the major obstacle.
<seg>A part of the ground of the countries of the European Union will become sea or desert as a result of the continuous heating which they are put under.
<seg>The wealth level is high and the price of the petroleum products low.
<seg>I congratulate to the Wallström Commissariats by its managements in The Hague and him desire more success.
<seg>Without a doubt he was better not to reach an agreement that to have a bad agreement, and in this case the American position was a position of reductions, totally unacceptable for Europe.
<seg>The climate changes have major consequences in the developing countries.
<seg>I want to repeat it in English: Forest turns from being coal sinks to coal sources.
<seg>Only that credibility will allow that the European Union heads the position and the action in the COP I SAW “B” in Bonn.
<seg>We are going to have to make our own evaluation than it happened and to prepare documents to put to us in contact with the different parts and, naturally, with “the ample umbrella group”.
<seg>Naturally, the pursuit of the next COP6 or the continuation of the COP6 will be the ratification in an agreement within the Union.
<seg>Before the European Council, Pierre Moscovici and I myself we will maintain the Sunday next a conclave to which I have invited to Messrs Brok and Tsatsos, as well as a session of the CIG ministerial, Monday, on the occasion of the Council “general Subjects”.
<seg>The minimum number of Member States that were going to participate was going to limit eight, and the clause of appeal to the European Council, that constitutes a genuine right at present of I veto, will be replaced by a knowledge right.
<seg>It would be possible to lament it, but I am myself forced to make this observation.
<seg>The European Council also will debate of the progress of the accession negotiations, and therefore of the extension.
<seg>The European Council in Lisbon had approved directions to promote an innovating and competitive European economy.
<seg>The protection of the consumer constitutes a growing concern of the European, by obvious reasons that do not require major explanation.
<seg>We must prepare us for this unprecedented enlargement.
<seg>Lamentably, the current text of the Conference is very complicated, very ambiguous and very long, with two protocols: nevertheless, in spite of this amplitude and to this complication, he is also very weak, does not facilitate the simple answer to us is used that us for the simple problem which we suffer long ago.
<seg>(Applause)
<seg>One consisted of which the own states candidates had to adopt and to apply the “Community acquis”; that one is the task that shares with us.
<seg>We appreciate the Charter of Fundamental Rights deeply and we do not want to limit to us to declaim it.
<seg>It is truth that its text could have been better, and could well be perfected and be emphasized after Nize.
<seg>It seems to me unacceptable that several governments have fully refused to consider the possibility of including a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty.
<seg>You not even want to introduce it in the Treaty and it in test that this document, this exercise had to leave a side.
<seg>We will speak with a single and ungrateful vote in the WTO.
<seg>Taking into account the doubtful prospects of success, it does not seem to me right to load the Intergovernmental Conference with another very complex and controversial subject.
<seg>I make an urgent appeal to the French Presidency in order that one strives to the maximum to eliminate this spacing, since it is extraordinarily destructive.
<seg>In the matter of trade policy, the Commission has made a proposal that must be examined carefully.
<seg>Although in the previous Treaty some advances in the extension of that formula were obtained, also contributed to the absurd formula of codecision more unamimity for the subjects regarding the citizenship, the social security, the rights of workers independently and also the cultural policy.
<seg>The simple exposition of that question is, by itself, clearly demonstrative of the failure of a policy of strengthening of the bows of mutual confidence between the countries that integrate the Union.
<seg>The situation is this one in which we have been involved for months in this Intergovernmental Conference, and the cause is in which nobody resignation to its toy.
<seg>The experience of this year forces to say to us that the impulse that there is to give to the process of constitucionalización of the Union after Nize and watching at the future of Europe does not have to trust to the method, already exhausted, of the negotiation reserved between the representatives of the Governments.
<seg>As it finishes very well indicating Mr. Prodi, if a rule is not adopted on the majority, decision making is obstructed irremediably.
<seg>In our current debate nothing has been said on that aspect of subsidiarity, but it is very important.
<seg>We did thus it, it passed the extension of 1995, it arrived the Group from reflection that presided with great success Carlos Wensterdorp, came Amsterdam and now we are going to have Nize and we practically followed equal, Mr. President: giving returned to the institutional issues, without finding solutions that allow to give exit us to a most ambitious task, that is that extension to 27.
<seg>We do not add to the deception that will cause the Nice Summit, if Nize, of course, is unfruitful, the deception caused to the towns by our Parliament.
<seg>In the past we demonstrated that objective one was attainable and, like representative of a Member State that has benefitted from a transition planned to the adhesion, I wait for with positive attitude the attainment of an extended and pacific Europe.
<seg>But it is necessary to understand that, if you have the right of veto, also they have the others.
<seg>But also it will be necessary to make one first transition for the Parliament that will be chosen in 2004, because at least some Member States will adhere before the new Parliament in 2004 is chosen or during their legislature until 2009.
<seg>The President of the Council is boarded the question of the enhanced cooperations and has said that he advances towards a consensus in that respect.
<seg>Sir President, at first sight, Nize deals with about the necessary adjustments and the questions still not solved facing the extension.
<seg>If we had something of this mentality, if we made less emphasis in which he goes bad in this part of the world and we put more emphasis in which he goes well, we would be something more lucky people than we are at this moment.
<seg>The decisions by majority that are adopted in the Council not only must be applied to the merchandise, but also to other compatible scopes as they are the services, the investments, the intellectual property and the competition. Section 1 of article 133 has to modify in that sense.
<seg>The right of initiative of the European Parliament would lay the way so that the abuse of the political parties also ended up invading this highly sensible scope.
<seg>Therefore, as it said one of you, alluding to the North American optimism and the way in which the North Americans speak of themselves, it would be necessary to also stand out what works and what advances.
<seg>It would wish to also say that I do not believe that a problem between great and small countries exists.
<seg>We have worked much, but we faced this old problem, and I do not believe that a evolution by the action of a single country can begin, because we faced, once again, in twelve of the fifteen members, to realities - national, political, democratic - very important.
<seg>Finally, President Védrine, you have shown a too tense situation and has also spoken of certain pesimism.
<seg>Will adopt you, in addition, measured generally to intensify the security of right ways so that she does not return to happen something similar?
<seg>In my opinion, we have to adopt the suitable precautions - something that not yet we have done so that the guests of this Parliament can be to taste, without having to feel fear before potential threats. To this aim we must create the necessary specificationses, as much from the point of view of the organization like from the point of view of the security.
<seg>Here, hospitality; there, hospitality and respect.
<seg>I am thankful for its contribution to him, Mr. Tajani.
<seg>The best tribute to Ernest Lluch and his memory would be the one to respect its message - diàleg, in Catalan: we can offer all that opportunity to Basque people?
<seg>On the other hand, each can, of course, express its opinion.
<seg>(B5-0550/2000) of Mr. Brok, in the name of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Human rights, Security policy and Defence policy, directed to the Commission, on the political situation in Afghanistan and the humanitarian aid.
<seg>When I speak of organization I mean also that, taking into account the enormous efforts undertaken by the European Union, are logical that to her also the responsibility of the same corresponds to him.
<seg>Secondly, you will verify in the resolution the will very clear of the Parliament to base the defense and security policy on two pillars balances: civilian crisis management and, in case of failure, the military management, since both pillars are complementary.
<seg>- (FR) Sir President, considering the delay that we also took and my obligations, I will try to be brief the intervention that was preparation.
<seg>These relations will concretely shape in meetings between the Council of the North Atlantic and the COPSI and in meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European countries candidates or allies.
<seg>They see, for example, which has happened in the Balkan Mountains, where it can say that each has performed totally its function.
<seg>Also in this period we have maintained widely informed to the United States into the progresses in course by way of the common European security and defense, which constitutes a condition sine qua non so that the same is developed in harmony, as it happens at this moment.
<seg>In the European Parliament the second edition of the annual report of the European Union appeared on the human rights. The 13 of December a forum dedicated to the human rights will be organized in Paris.
<seg>Political happiness, you say, do not have by ambition to compete with the Atlantic Alliance, that today continues being the base of the collective defence of its members, or to create an army permanent European.
<seg>On the other hand, although I have mentioned the number of the 100,000 military, that does not mean that we seek to surpass the objectives set in Helsinki, but we have a reserve in qualifications and different specialties, which allows to guarantee that the 60,000 men who correspond to the objective of the Council, beyond the operational conditions of their use would be reached.
<seg>Permítame, gentleman President, ladies and honourable Members, to allude briefly to the deep political sense, approved by great part of our public opinion, of this new task, by means of which Europe acquires an political influence tool that it needed.
<seg>Now we confronted the problem of guarding so that, when we spoke of consolidation of the liberal democracy in Europe, we talk about all the European continent, because of that it consists the extension and the enlargement process.
<seg>We must integrate three branches in an all coherent one: Community policies, cfsp, including the PECSD, and measures nationals of Member States.
<seg>Even with our laborious committee procedures, we did not need a force 60,000 soldiers to realise our objectives.
<seg>Therefore, it is precise to establish with all urgency a solution of humanitarian aid.
<seg>Although it is certain that I am not in agreement with the cynical ones that says that Europe obtains a new impassable game in this way, it is truth that the rapid reaction force will not be versatile in many situations.
<seg>The EU does not have to develop a system of self-defense with regular troops.
<seg>Finally it would want to every time express the preoccupation of my Group by the worst situation in Afghanistan and to insist to the Commission and the Council so that they do whatever can to reach a pacific solution and so that they help the population, especially now to the entrance of the winter.
<seg>To say it simply: where, when and how the European force must act of intervention.
<seg>They allow to include/understand the terrible balance of these two months of “intifada”: 270 deads, the majority Palestinian, and near 10,000 wounded, often crippled of by life.
<seg>For that reason also its continuing effort serves to create an arsenal of arms of extremely dismal massive elimination.
<seg>Secondly, against which he has said the previous speaker, I do not know if it would be possible or desirable that the European Union did more than mainly makes before the conflict and the escalation of violence that has taken place in the Middle East, now, in the transitional period in which is the United States.
<seg>Sir President, I am going to center this intervention mine in dealing with the report the Mrs Lalumière, which, in my opinion, well is elaborated and it are expressed with clarity.
<seg>A political concept does not exist and really not yet a Foreign policy and of Security policy exists.
<seg>The EU has only a problem, that is to say, that has until now not known to wake up the interest of the public opinion by such measures although these are much more sustainable and effective.
<seg>Sir President, next comes, by all means, the budget; how this one must be distributed.
<seg>And I say this, in spite of the enormous amount of apparent guarantees that on this subject have arisen in the last days miraculously.
<seg>We would have to work in co-ordination together and. We would have to advance towards one better European policy of acquisition of provisions to have one more an defence industry more efficient than it offers major value in exchange for the money.
<seg>Even those that question the utility of the decision, for example, to create the euroejército call, must repair in the important political dimension of this decision and its influence in European cohesion of the European.
<seg>The first presence of a Defence Minister in our Assembly has been so historical that we have reserved the night sitting to him so that the impression is not too strong for our deputies.
<seg>For all of them, a preventive civil crisis management is means better than the military solutions.
<seg>It wishes Russia, in the long term, to participate in a political union with a nondemocratic regime?
<seg>Therefore, Europe is not going to constitute a new alliance, as it seems to me to have heard mention in an argumentation informed into incomplete way.
<seg>I have received a motion for a resolution, in accordance with section 5 of article 42 of the Regulation, to close this debate.
<seg>Before the spread of the task, it was entrusted to four commissions and an unpublished procedure settled down, with four parallel information.
<seg>The set of the proposed measures in White Paper must agree in modernizing and making all the operation effective of the Commission.
<seg>Therefore, he would be advisable that the reform was the occasion to limit its intervention solely in the scopes that do not imply expenses.
<seg>The appreciation differences that arose were not only of political nature, but they still reflected plus the cultural divergences between the Fifteen.
<seg>The new internal audit service, under the direct responsibility of you, Mr. Kinnock, Vice-president in charge of the reform, will have like main task the analysis of the functions and the internal control systems that exist in the Commission.
<seg>It has been a pleasure to work jointly and I believe that the process to approach a crucial reform of the Commission, that is essential for the future of the European Union, is counted with an added depth and a wealth thanks to participation of us four.
<seg>They can have expectations of transfer to other European institutions, accomplishment of temporary detachments for duty in the national administrations or to work in the private sector.
<seg>In this way, our constitutional committee remembers its adhesion to a strong, independent, effective Executive Committee, is transparent and politically responsible.
<seg>As Committee on Budgets we considered that the establishment of the budget by activities causes to problems by the little visibility of the cost and our desire to us to reinforce the powers of the European Parliament like budgetary authority.
<seg>That will mark, evidently, the good will of this Parliament to ahead take this reform with the Commission.
<seg>Sir President, first of all, I want to give them thanks to the four rapporteurs by excellent work carried out.
<seg>This is shameful if we took into account that the own EU is the first defender of the modernization of the economic life.
<seg>Sir President, in spite of the effort of the rapporteurs to endorse the work of the Commission, is that to the recommendations of the committee of independent experts a coherent global response and with a view to a government policy still does not occur and not only to one better administration of the Institution.
<seg>That change of attitude would have to be translated in the transparency of the Administration.
<seg>From my point of view, in the world a structure does not exist that magazine one more a greater and fundamental importance: fifteen States and in the future twenty or more, a continent whole number; the part of the globe at the moment more industrialized barks in the Union and, through her, in the Commission by means of its structures.
<seg>The change never is easy.
<seg>When doing it, nevertheless, from the socialist Group we considered that the present communitarian public functioning of the administration is quite effective.
<seg>The result is the known one, that it has indicated the dedication and the competition of the numerous members of the Committee and its administration.
<seg>Many thousands of project applications already take more of a year hoping an evaluation.
<seg>The debate, since we have verified, is not as much of principles, objectives or opportunity of the reform, whatever of procedures, rate, calendar, the possible dysfunctions or consequences nonwished of its application.
<seg>I would like to begin informing to the Camera of which in its meeting this morning, since it has indicated Mr. Van Hulten before, the School has adopted an institutional draft agreement for the basic establishment of an advisory group on standards in the public life, as planned in Action 1 of the action program of White Paper.
<seg>In addition, such changes are evident that they would only be possible with an amendment of the Treaties.
<seg>The central objective is to obtain a simplification, to elevate the transparency and to fortify the budgetary principles, that is to say, in particular less incomprehensible regulations of exception, less special arrangements and to elevate the efficiency and effectiveness in the budgetary procedure.
<seg>He is simply very uneconomical for the Commission that according to contracts for costs X must reimburse a 20%, for costs and a 30% and frequently join and verify the proofs of very small sums.
<seg>In accordance with the order of business, Perez of the Arc comes itself to the debate on the report (A5-0337/2000) of Mrs Sauquillo, in the name of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of the relations between the European Union with the developing countries and the impacts of reform of the Commission in those relations (2000/2051 (INI)).
<seg>These final aspects affect of very particular way the NGO.
<seg>Of course, that is not sufficient, but it must yet put to us safe from the cartoons on the shortage of our development aid.
<seg>We return to this now, since it constitutes a good frame in itself.
<seg>Sir President, I have returned today from Mozambique where the European Union has been responsible for a shining humanitarian aid after the flood disaster, but, once again, the reconstruction projects, to which already we have assigned money, are delayed in the hope of the companies in Brussels.
<seg>Before these realities, the necessity of a greater implication and a greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and under-development are inescapable.
<seg>We have a harmonized scheme now to draft indicative country strategy papers and cooperation programmes in all the developing countries.
<seg>In addition, the creation of the SEM did not provide a solution to the continuous disparity between 8 voluminous administrative resources.
<seg>. (FR) Mrs. Presidenta, ladies and honourable Members, Mrs. Comisaria, reason that she had a very special interest to be with you today in this debate on the marine preliminary package in the European Parliament, is that you go to examine three texts important, that they constitute a first indispensable step in a subject that the recent events have located, unfortunately, in first flat one of the present time.
<seg>From the point of view of the Presidency of the Council, this could allow us, on the other hand, to debate with the Member States an agreement based on the proposals presented/displayed by you, and adopt the text in first reading, with qualified majority if it were necessary.
<seg>The treatment fast and specialized that has had by result both packages Erika and six proposals have generated an impulse enormous.
<seg>The lesson that this Parliament must retain this morning is that, doubtlessly, the maritime law is anywhere in the world in imprecision state and we have to begin the process to put it in sequence.
<seg>We must emit a clear signal that in waters and European ports we are not going to tolerate ships that do not fulfill the standards.
<seg>For the small boats, we adopted a compromise position between the limit of the 5,000 tons, raised by the OMI, and the one of the 600, raised by the Commission.
<seg>These data will have to be put at the disposal of the European authorities, state and harbor, as well as of the interested public.
<seg>Transboundary nature of means marine, that implies that the contamination of a zone can affect a greater region, leads the necessity of a communitarian framework for cooperation for the field of accidental pollution.
<seg>In the local cooperation in the field the protection organisations of the nature are had including a.
<seg>To modify the directive in the sense of an utmost rigour in its application, of an harmonisation of legislation, particularly with respect to the selection of the ships submissive the inspection and the scope of application of the different types from inspection, is evidently positive.
<seg>It would want to once again emphasize that the urgency does not exist, in which you you insist.
<seg>I believe that in the case of the limit of liabilities of classification societies, regardless of which he is decided today, it is precise that the Council and the Parliament return to reflect jointly on this.
<seg>The black box, a black list and all other seems to us excellent ideas and we are completely in agreement with them. However, I would like to emphasize some points.
<seg>Against this catastrophic and anarchical situation of maritime transport, Europe it has accepted the challenge and, eleven months after the Erika, the European Union will be at readiness to announce that procedure some has never worked with as much rapidity.
<seg>It is clear to what extent the liberal logic is against, in fact, to a marine high level of safety.
<seg>In order to finalize, independent of the technical measures that are taken, one of the insecurity main sources will continue existing in as much is not red-balance, the zone of La Mancha and the North Atlantic, the exponential growth of the traffic derived from the hypertrophy of the ports of the North Sea.
<seg>It would honor to him to the current President of the Council who ordered the situation in his home country.
<seg>Sir President, from the shipwreck of the oil tanker Erika a series of measures has appeared under political pressures with the purpose of to increase safety of ships in the sea.
<seg>Some Greek ships sank immediately, Mr. Gayssot, without there were storms.
<seg>Thirdly, when we spoke of this type of report, it seems to me that it is being clear that the relation does not tie enters, on the one hand, the oil supply and, on the other, the fact that it is still used combustible of fossil origin.
<seg>Therefore, we have to the aim the political courage of our ecological ambitions.
<seg>This means that, in this field more than in no other, our responsibility is great, and that we must, to seem, to silence any sample of institutional pride.
<seg>For example, for Finland it is of utmost importance that Russia subscribes these agreements.
<seg>One is the hardening of the exigencies for the construction of tankers, of the improvement of the norms for port controls and the greater severity of the rules for the organizations of inspection and expert work of ships, that is a consequence of the previous thing.
<seg>Sir President, today we are debating the marine security basing us on three information whose rapporteurs I congratulate sincerely.
<seg>With regard to these three fresh proposals regarding the marine security, I cannot more than to congratulate to the three rapporteurs that have demonstrated in extremely short terms that the Parliament is very determined to adopt new measures to harness safety at sea, the controls, the construction standards and the intolerable thing that are that similar accidents become to produce.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, in the past recent several marine accidents of considerable consequences, those in which were especially involved oil, has shaken our continent.
<seg>But of 80% of the accidents they are related to a human error, but there are reasons for the human error, that are of social order.
<seg>A parliamentarian or parliamentarian has used the term of “rastreabilidad”.
<seg>The State control Directive of the international Port is designed to control compliance with the requirements and it does not stop to introduce new norms.
<seg>Amendment 18 introduces the state control of the port put in relation to the rest periods of the sailors, although the implementation of the provisions regarding the working hours of the sailors already completely is covered by Directive 99/95.
<seg>It satisfies me to verify that the rapporteur has introduced in amendment 21 a reference to the regime of evaluation of the conditions and we agreed with the propose perspective, nevertheless is necessary that the writing adjusts to make it clearer.
<seg>Amendment 4 and leaves from the 18 regarding point “k” are not acceptable.
<seg>I can assure to them that if a shipbuilder thinks to register a ship in those registries, after our proposal will have to think it twice.
<seg>Mrs Comisaria has spoken during 18 minutes, and throughout that time, it has mentioned tens and tens of articles, and has rejected the position of the Commission.
<seg>Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council in relation to a set of actions regarding the transeuropean network of compilation, creation and diffusion of statistical on the victories of extracommunity goods intra and (EDICOM) (COM (00) 0458 - C5-0401/00 - 2000/0201 (COD)) (Economic and Monetary Commission)
<seg>Nevertheless, when retiring the resolution, express the conviction that, with a view to the Nice Council, our Parliament would have made hear better its voice dedicating a resolution specific and different from the so important and difficult subjects from the Intergovernmental Conference, instead of to treat them in the scope of a single resolution that also includes all the other agenda items of the Council.
<seg>(Since they have risen more than twelve deputies, the oral amendment is rejected) (the Parliament approves the resolution)
<seg>Report (A5-0337/2000) of Mrs Sauquillo Perez of the Arc, in the name of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of the relations between the European European and the developing countries, and the impacts of reform of the Commission on these relations (2000/2051 (INI))
<seg>I have voted against to express my protest because the European Union still does not manage to take part as it would also have in this matter.
<seg>Although neither the proposal for amendments of the existing directive on control of ships nor the report Watts respond to the actual requirements, they take certain passages in positive sense. Therefore the Members of the European Parliament of the Party Greek Communist we have voted in favor of the report.
<seg>Thus, we can be sorry that the Commission proposal has not retaken the idea of the creation of a true body of European monitoring, following the model of “coast guards” in the United States.
<seg>. () Necessary Condition for safety of ships, the protection of the life at sea and the protection of the environment is the fight against the immunity which the shipbuilders enjoy, the adoption of stringent measures for the control of the situation of the ships and the imposition of rigorous penalties to the shipping companies that violate the safety standards; also, to improve the working conditions of the workers of the merchant navy, and providing adequate training, as well as guaranteeing organic compositions to them that they respond to the growing demands of the ships.
<seg>The Hatzidakis rapporteur, lamentably, has made the opposite right.
<seg>The shipwreck of the Erika, in December of 1999, is in the origin of the emergencia of the marine issue of safety in the agenda Community policy and was under the pressure from the European Parliament as the Commission proposed the texts that we have voted in today, almost a year after that sinister shipwreck.
<seg>The present compensation funds suitably have not been equipped and this has become than more evident in the case of the disaster of the Braer, in which the industry Shetland Islands fishing has not been compensated suitably by its losses.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, already I have said that some years ago I had occasion to sail.
<seg>The proposals of the rapporteur regarding the harmonization to European level are totally positive.
<seg>One is an important section since one talks about the societies of ship classification.
<seg>It would be rather a major success, since Europe that we needed, on the eve of the extension, is not a Europe rigid, hierarchized, distant, but a Europe flexible and near the towns, therefore based on the respect for national democracies.
<seg>The fight more and more abierta by the power between many Member States clouds the possibilities to reach some commitment.
<seg>The most important task of Nize is to guarantee that the EU has effective institutions.
<seg>To one week of the Summit, personally I have hopes.
<seg>I am not either in favor of relating the qualified majority voting automatically and the codecision and also I think that any initiative to extend the codecision powers must case by case be undertaken.
<seg>When modifying article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extend the qualified majority voting, at the moment in force in the Council for the trade in goods, to other scopes like the services public, the intellectual property, the health or the education.
<seg>In this way the Parliament does without the influence right, keeps silence like tribute to the partisanship, the national fidelities and the Governments and forgets its obligations towards the citizens.
<seg>I have also voted against a text that requests the incorporation of the Charter of fundamental rights in the future Tried which it is approved in Nize.
<seg>It is an error to divide to the Union in two groups and for that reason I cannot support the idea that at the top one third part of the Member States goes.
<seg>Its new paper has ended the neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.
<seg>In this report there are many things that the Group of the Consevadores British can support, especially the emphasis that is put in the enlargement of the European Union.
<seg>The Social-Democratic Democrats in the European Parliament we have endorsed the report regarding the creation of a common European policy in the matter of security and defense.
<seg>But also against people of the European Union whom they will have to finance, in any case, the new expenses of armament that proposes the report and that not even will have the guarantee of which the military forces are not used a day against they themselves, in the name of the “maintaining order”.
<seg>Also it burdens is the pretension that a State that does not wish to participate in a mission sees forced to pay a financial contribution that will distribute the Participating States in that war.
<seg>Nevertheless, with military means of outside any solution is not obtained, because thus the cause of the conflict does not take off nor changes the public opinion.
<seg>· That military operations must be financed with a communitarian budget line and that the Member States must contribute with bottoms even if they do not wish to participate in the operations (paragraphs 49 and 50).
<seg>However, to the EU it would come to him well that the priorities of the tasks of Petersberg were reversed and the attention would go towards humanitarian and civil options.
<seg>East support report of my colleague Maj-Britt Theorin.
<seg>But the needs of this category are not mentioned more than to take step to the demand of a fiscal deductibility of the domestic services and of a “adaptation of the prices and the costs to the financial resources of the individuals”.
<seg>In fact, he is extraordinary that in the 21st century we must recommend that the Member States would have to guarantee for the domestic servants the right to social security and to a suitable retirement.
<seg>For many young people, its first contact with the labor market can be a black work.
<seg>Most serious it is when above trafficking in women coming from distant countries, that have taken east type of work by necessity and that they do not have another possibility of gaining the life of lasting form.
<seg>The reform of the Commission will be judged by the facts, of there the necessity of regular monitoring reports that it will throughout haben the period of duration of the programme and the importance of the waited for complete balance for December of 2002.
<seg>In a recent past, different scandals and failures from operation concluded, in March of 1999, with the resignation of the Commission.
<seg>In order to finish, I consider indispensable to remember that through this reform, essential for the future, we at the same time waited for more rigor and more transparency on the part of the Commission in its daily management, but also a perfect sense of the responsibility on the other hand, within the framework strict of its competitions.
<seg>The conservatives also we supported the declaration contained in paragraph 7 of the report according to which the democratic control would be due to guarantee and that it is allowed that operates the system of the three pillars.
<seg>(The session rises to the 13,15 hours)
<seg>We have received the information - and I want to add immediately that I cannot believe it, absolutely - of which the President of the Council and Head of the French State is going to appear tomorrow only 30 minutes here to speak.
<seg>Therefore, it seems to me that there is to exclude that we pruned to have a meditated and argued position.
<seg>We do what we do, we vote, and I am in favor of a resolution since they have suggested Mr. Poettering, Mr.
<seg>Throughout the night one has worked as much in these texts as in the numbers regarding balance of votes in the Council and to the distribution of the seats in Parliament.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, would want to ask with insistence that does not suppress of the east order of business report of Mr. of I nibble, since, besides being elaborated very well, in the last Environment Council of the French Presidency, that will take place Monday and Tuesday of the coming week, is predicted to prepare a common position on this matter.
<seg>Thanks, Mr. Parish.
<seg>In the meetings of the Committee of Foreign affairs, Human rights, Security policy and Defence policy, in their capacity as chairman, feel there and smoke.
<seg>The political basis is clear: to harmonize the market as much respecting a high public level of health and of consumer protection being based on the existing regulation as in the evolution of the scientific knowledge.
<seg>It is in game its quality and concept of life, in which health protection acquires a very excellent weight.
<seg>This rule can be also applied to all the dangerous drugs of diversion but, if nobody more than the consumer can be affected.
<seg>Recently in the United States judgments against the tobacco multinationals have gained to poison and to lie on the absence of toxicity of products.
<seg>We think that unique possible and the consequent thing is that is finished with export of cigarettes prohibited in the Union by health grounds.
<seg>Instead of to the past learn lessons of the failure registered in Luxembourg 9 of October, we insisted on a legally indefensible attitude.
<seg>I have analyzed at great length what the Commissioner said to colleague Mr. Hume: “It cannot have massive losses of places of work in this sector.
<seg>They are the Parliament and the Council those that they have to approve that proposal for a directive and to examine the proper legal basis for it, among other things.
<seg>Maaten and others more, there is a danger that, if this Parliament and the Council accepts the restrictive interpretation whom the leader of European European People and Vallelersundi Mrs propose Palace, this Parliament, the Council and the Community institutions as a whole would be tying of feet and hands for the legislative development of the Community institutions, that so important is for the development of the Community law.
<seg>The weak point of this proposal is that it is insisted much on the promotion of the free competition.
<seg>In conclusion, from the signing of the Treaty of Amsterdam the European Parliament owns faculties of coordination in environmental issues and consumer protection, and will collaborate closely, of course, with the Council and the Commission in this matter.
<seg>In fact this does not have anything to do with the tobacco, but the sentence of the European Court of Justice could be also dictated to prohibit the alcohol publicity or the publicity of the chocolate then, evidently, the sugar also can be injurious for the health.
<seg>Simply I do not understand that a majority of this Parliament wants to propose to smooth out the norms regarding the export more than the governments propose the own governments of the Member States - who also represent the numerous industries to which reference becomes.
<seg>It is an established fact that 80% of the smokers want to stop being it, but in tobacco industry it foments very few directed policies to help that people to stop smoking.
<seg>If we insisted on saying to the other countries what levels of health public must fix extending to the exports our reasonable internal market proposals, we will put in danger all the excellent work carried out by Mr. Maaten.
<seg>We are in favor of which it is arrived at a test method recognized in all the countries of the EU, to realise in a given country in a research laboratory recognized.
<seg>Nowadays the effects are clear abiertamente on the health of the tobacco consumption, and as much the legislators as the public opinion shares the sensation from which the moment has arrived for adopting strict norms and regulations in this matter.
<seg>Consequently, the Community rules will fit perfectly in the future international agreements, avoiding therefore the danger of the commercial obstacles to trade and reinforcing consumer protection at the same time and guaranteeing a high level of protection of the health.
<seg>He would be preferable to wait for until the question of additives has treated as a whole in the initial report of the Commission.
<seg>As far as the laboratory tests, the amendment regarding the approval of tests is superfluous, since another article anticipates the movement of goods already that fulfill the provisions of the directive.
<seg>. (IN) Mrs. Presidenta, this report does not have complications: at present, the managers on summer time are only five years in force, and soon they must return to the Parliament for its renovation.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, lordships, the proposal for a directive regarding summer time arrangements, that there is we examined, is a sound proposal.
<seg>Therefore, I believe that in this Assembly we would not have to take care too much time of this subject, because the Member States, as well as the population, has already accepted to a great extent the summer time arrangement and this one has been recognized like part of our annual rate.
<seg>In my opinion, he is advisable that the issues relateds with the hour strips and the application of summer time arrangements are, according to establishes the proposal, in the scope of decision of the Member States.
<seg>He would be more just than summer time finished at the end of September, to about six months of its beginning.
<seg>Yes it can accept the presentation of proposals adapted on the basis of the conclusions of the 2007 report to that article 5 talks about.
<seg>It is put in clear that the interventions in the human germ line cannot be accepted.
<seg>Indeed, I believe that to ethics committee, in that people work who do not do that work like main profession, can be granted to a term something to him more length, but on the authorities a certain pressure of time would be due to exert so that they are put quickly to the work.
<seg>Those groups must stay in the field of application of the directive.
<seg>But I am pleased also that we have managed to throw cerrojazo to the genic therapy.
<seg>It would want to give my congratulation to the rapporteur, Mr. Liese, by its report and to be thankful for its effort to him to conciliate the opposite views.
<seg>These programs are related to the fight against cancer, with the prevention of AIDS, the prevention of the drogodependencia and the promotion in the matter of health; and its interruption would mean the aim of the relative projects and the work of the networks that were created to this aim.
<seg>He is something very good to be able to smooth a priori land, so that, still in case it is necessary to realise one second reading, to be closely together of the point in which the decisions are taken.
<seg>In addition, we must consider that as much the prevention and promotion as the monitoring are more and more going to be important and, for this reason, it would be necessary to equip them with more estimating and to give more importance them.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, on the occasion of the Trakatellis report on the prorogation of the existing European programmes in the field of public health, would want to express my preoccupation exceeds how and in what sense evolves the European policy in the matter of public health.
<seg>I have understood that the Council also has given in principle his consent.
<seg>In the European Union the paradox takes place at the moment of which abolition of internal borders for the free movement of goods, people, services and capitals must coexist with the maintenance of 15 borders in the police scopes and criminal justices, that the Member States put difficulties in eliminating.
<seg>In order to finish, the initiative supposes a significant progress in creation of an area criminal justice European, although partial and limited, but it responds to the actual requirements of an enormous mass of European citizens who, until the moment, been practically have abandoned when they have been victims of a crime outside the territory of its normal residence.
<seg>What we have requested for this group of people?
<seg>At the same time, a special training to the professionals is due to guarantee who will have to their position the direct bonding with the victims.
<seg>The victims do not have to become people doubly harmed, first because of a crime and next because of the system.
<seg>Also, in this respect it is important that them report of a discreet and professional way to the relatives, that is to say, to the relatives of the victim, of the facts if they wish therefore it, and that they can count on the necessary aid so that they do not have to find out everything through the press.
<seg>This bond independent of the crime that has been committed.
<seg>Never, in the level of the Member States nor in the communitarian one, it is necessary to leave the basic principle of which the individuals always must assume the responsibility of their acts.
<seg>In other cases the information could be obtained that is needed in a language of the European that is not the own one.
<seg>It cheers to much the positive response of Parliament to me before the first text on a so important subject, so that the space of freedom, security and justice that we are constructing progressively can offer to our fellow citizens support in situations that often is difficult to support.
<seg>Emergency vote on the request
<seg>(The Parliament rejects the urgency)
<seg>In this way, at night from the 23 to the 24 of November we have put ourselves in agreement with the Council on the main points of a budget that although is not shining yes is reasonable.
<seg>For this reason, the Commission proposed a revision by 300 million Euros to which it was against with nails and teeth the Council.
<seg>But also I know by the maintained conversations that it is still much more difficult to formulate a negotiable Council position, to obtain a mandate and to obtain that the pure national egoism ends at a more or less reasonable and defensible Pan-European decision.
<seg>I hope that the works for recruitment office common, as an European authority of recruitment is said in the modern German, that is to say, really advance so that we pruned to jointly overcome the problems that are going away to raise in the coming years to all the institutions - al Advice like to the Commission, the Parliament and the other institutions, that is to say, the necessity of personnel of the coming years.
<seg>The Council refuses to make this revision - it seems that now already we must have the data and I want to him to come up: to use the flexibility instrument two years runnings, two year runnings - of fact, in less than fifteen months and first of them to less than six months of the approval of the perspective it is draining financially the flexibility instrument because it prevents its replacement and its possible accumulation, that it is predicted until a height of 600 million.
<seg>This so important amount, that it responds to the existence of needs very elevated in 2001, will be able to finance mainly thanks to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument for 200 million Euros.
<seg>Considering this new element, the Council has voted in second reading a budget increased in a 2.5%.
<seg>Finally, before you come to the final adoption of this budget, desire to emphasize the persistence of the Council in respecting some budgetary rules basic, in the matter of putting in reserve of credits, basic legal and of classification of expenditure.
<seg>And on the contrary that in Nize, I believe that the three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are very satisfied generally with the result.
<seg>Lordships, the new appearance of ill cows of BSE also made necessary that it was acted immediately in the budgetary sector, in particular for health protection, the protection of the consumer and also for aid to farmers affected by this situation.
<seg>In addition, the Council has fixed for the reconstruction aid framework programme to the western Balkan Mountains a multiannual post, evidently indicative, that he is compatible with these financial perspective.
<seg>With very many effort, we obtained a pair of million Euros.
<seg>I sincerely thank for it to Mrs Haug.
<seg>It will think then that 1% of the budget of the European Union are very well used.
<seg>You have said, I have understood if it correctly, that we do not have to use the reserve, because was a disobedience of the norms.
<seg>I believe that we have seen very positive things next to other many that I am not going to mention now due to the pressure of time.
<seg>Although the expenses in agriculture, that almost represent half of the total budget, are increased, once taken in account the rectifying letter, in more of a 5%, the increase total budget is only of 3.5%.
<seg>We see the grave danger that already in the coming years it increases the confrontation between MEDA, projects of coastal countries of the Mediterranean and the Balkan Mountains although all we know that the money is needed there urgently.
<seg>Satisfied with to have overcome the difficulties that made so narrow the route towards the goal pursued fulfill the commitments acquired in Helsinki with the countries candidates without undoing the Union, to allow the Europe morning that continues working with effectiveness.
<seg>They are real, although they do not go as far as the Presidency - that has given tests, and it rebound, for a reason or purpose national, of to a great would have wished it opening.
<seg>A new legal basis for the status of political parties has been anticipated European and to the Parliament the statute of anticipated institutional plaintiff in article 230 of the Treaty is granted to him.
<seg>These last weeks three substantial achievements have been obtained.
<seg>This it is the sense of the declaration adopted in Nize and the initiated reflection to coordinate to European level the fight against doping.
<seg>Between the threats, it is, as all you know, climatic overheating.
<seg>In addition, in Nize, the European Union has established the permanent body necessary to define and to direct a foreign policy and of common security: a political committee and of security, a military committee and an European General Staff.
<seg>By this cooperation, by its support and also by its European refugee, Mrs. Presidenta, ladies and honourable Members, the French Presidency thanks to them.
<seg>In these scopes, in fact, the Conference has hit the intransigencia of some Member States. With regard to this, I feel a profound disappointment not only by the short term consequences, but by the spirit of overcast sky, closing, lack of understanding that arises of this position.
<seg>We must render a sense tribute to the Belgian Prime Minister Mr. Guy Verhofstadt who has fought until the bottom for the sake of one more a righter presence of the States candidates for accession and to turn into less irrazonable, although he continues being too high, the threshold of the qualified majority. In this way, it has confirmed the great historic role of Belgium in the European Union.
<seg>Now we must carefully examine the text in the Parliament.
<seg>I indicate, of step, Sir President of the European Council, that the expenses pay the contributors to them.
<seg>And I see in her a failure in relation to the proclaimed ambition of the European Union not only change the institutions to be able to welcome correctly in the new members being improved the European effectiveness of the European, but also a failure in relation to another important objective, that it has perhaps been mentioned very little, the approach of the European Union and the citizens.
<seg>The right questions are for us those that the impressive human tide has formulated that, from all Europe, has converged in Nize the eve of the Summit.
<seg>First of all, the fifteen have signed quickly and running and with tear gases the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
<seg>(Applause)
<seg>My Group feels disappointed by this Treaty and worried about the future that it will provide to us, reason why we will be against to him with all our forces.
<seg>Sir President, you have it word.
<seg>Finally, it would say to him to Mr. Hager who the instrument of the enhanced cooperations is, in my opinion, a useful tool to allow that Europe has a dynamics and that alum the way, since it said awhile ago, I create, Mr.
<seg>Sir President, I would like to know if the power of the European Parliament on summer time is a new conquest of Nize.
<seg>Perhaps demoralized until now by the complexity of the clinical trials, the laboratories find, in the indicated will so much by the States as by our Assembly, the value of developing the market of paediatric medecines, although it does not have the sufficient size like allowing the return on investment!
<seg>. It is necessary to lead back the change of summer time, that was fixed during the oil crises, with the purpose of to save energy, and that had been prorogued until 2001?
<seg>Not always the protection of the situation of the victims in a criminal proceeding is the due one.
<seg>Consequently, many travellers and tourists will benefit from this European initiative.
<seg>Sir President, I will only take part to salute to Mr. President of the Commission, that is here, and to the Presidency of the Council who approaches itself, and to emphasize that, probably, never a unamimity like this one has been expressed in this Parliament on the results of a summit.
<seg>The one that works she is the one that, in six months, under the baton of the French Presidency, it has culminated, I create, in spite of everything, its work on six essential chapters.
<seg>Nevertheless, my greater fear is the one of which Great Britain, France and Germany can now subvert the delicate balance created between States of different sizes and the institutions throughout several decades.
<seg>It is difficult to understand how the Nice decisions could facilitate the extension of the EU.
<seg>Sir President, considered and esteemed colleagues, today I can be very brief.
<seg>By all this, I only can extract the consequence of which when one vows on this Treaty of Nice, I am going to vote negatively.
<seg>Sir President, the most important result of Nize was, in spite of everything, that signed a treaty, so that now it is possible to give to space to the countries candidates.
<seg>The true winners of this conference are Blair and Aznar, the gentlemen “not” of Europe.
<seg>Then, we forget Nize, fijémonos in which come later, and permítanme you who feed my hope with the project on grand convention advanced by Belgium for their Presidency, because is demonstrated, it is necessary to make blotch and it counts new, it is necessary to change of method, it is necessary to accelerate history: 2004 are too much behind schedule, are too much far, are too dangerous.
<seg>Instead of it, the spirit of Nice has consisted of asking itself how it is possible to be blocked, how it is possible to be intergubernamentalizar, how they can praise to him to one in defending house as of the national interests instead of to work so that the European Union advance really.
<seg>After Amsterdam and of Nize we were a Europe of principalities, a Europe of national administrations and not it Europe of the political unification.
<seg>We cannot continue facing us the lack of qualified majority decision making in the essential issues.
<seg>It is certain - I will paraphrase Mr. Bayrou - that I occupy east bench from this morning; at the outset, accompanying the President by the Republic, and later, in a personal view, and critics, that, to seem, are moderate, friendly rain, but that, nevertheless, is still critics.
<seg>In fact, it is not necessary to forget that it is the first time, from 1957, that reform, that reviews the model.
<seg>We are within constitutional systems, and the powers cannot be confused.
<seg>I thank for much, Sir Minister.
<seg>But neither it has been incorporated to Treaties nor there has been a reference to the Charter in section 2 of article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.
<seg>Finally, there are some positive aspects: the new version of article 7 of the Treaty; the article regarding the political parties and their statute; the right of this Parliament to demand to the other institutions before the Court of Justice: that one is also a major factor of political control; the new formula for the European Commission, when including the call “lex Prodi” in the Treaty, when fortifying to the President and the new composition of the Commission: reasonable compromise that acceptance and will work with time; and, since it has indicated to my colleague Mr. Tsatsos, it constitutes the route by which to advance in the future.
<seg>Sir President, already we have made a rigorous evaluation of the happened thing in Nize, but it agrees to remember that the Nice Summit began with an order of business very limited.
<seg>We examine the things: it is not had including in the work of the Treaty the Letter, not even an observation.
<seg>We want to demonstrate to the Heads of Government we know who it to do better.
<seg>In spite of the chest blows that the French Government has occurred this morning, the CIG frankly, has not concluded well.
<seg>Sir President, is not easy to criticize to the French Presidency during this debate, because he is not present. I include/understand that President Chirac, Mr.
<seg>Sir President, the Nice Summit has demonstrated that the Intergovernmental Conference has been out of phase.
<seg>Budget 2001 (continuation)
<seg>Nevertheless, this does not mean that something could not have been done more and better. It would want to divide scopes both.
<seg>This principle forces the Commission to establish priorities within a limited budget, as all Administration must do.
<seg>With the voting that will follow this debate it finishes to the length and complex discharge process of the budget of the Europe Union for 2001.
<seg>That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis resorting to article 272; the Perspective have stayed Financial, in spite of to have used the flexibility instrument.
<seg>Permítaseme to say simply to the Council who, as for this party, we have not remained without balls and this equipment proposes to continue playing until we obtain the suitable result.
<seg>We do not want that in the Resolution Colom it already appears a proposed revision for the coming year, because we want to wait for the valuation of the World Bank, but we shared its critic of which this way to solve the financial insufficiency in category 4 distorts the multiannual nature of the major objectives Union externals and the actual definition of the financial perspective.
<seg>So that this is possible, it will be necessary to establish priorities.
<seg>Only therefore the money will be dedicated correctly and suitably that our fellow citizens and fellow citizens make our available.
<seg>If we calculated the supplementary budget that is possible to wait for then it will be of almost 8% whereas in all the other fields - she is already the training policy, the internal policy, inclusively investigation, the foreign policy, the administration, the aid to the pre-accession altogether undergo only one growth rate of the 1.1%.
<seg>And as the cooperation is so positive, in the additional forthcoming budget, already in January, we will have the opportunity to continue it.
<seg>Also it interests to us to criticize the relations still not regulated between Russia and the Baltic states.
<seg>We follow with great interest Russian development of society and of the internal policy.
<seg>Sir President, considered and esteemed colleagues, the common strategy for Russia represents the first strategy common in the European history of the European.
<seg>Although President Putin even guarantees the democratic development to us of his country, he is not automatically a guarantor of a stable and democratic Russia. The democratic order is not still a reality lived in Russia.
<seg>We do not have to be insidious by our part, but we must construct the Europe of the economic cooperation.
<seg>As far as the Caucasus, Mr. Van Orden is right all the.
<seg>Who it observes Russia from outside and it receives isolated impressions of the country and Russian partners are in danger to selectively declare this like the reality of the country that fits indeed in its image of Russia.
<seg>In the policy area, the common strategy for Russia proposes to enter a permanent dialogue on policy and security and to create for it a permanent mechanism.
<seg>It would want to emphasize the gravity that Russia constitutes a political union with Belarús.
<seg>Have you it intention to support this project, gentleman Commissioner Patten?
<seg>In that respect, in the recent summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi, since there is to know the Parliament, sent a long-range dialogue on the energy.
<seg>Shelter many hopes to personally visit Kaliningrado in the first part of the coming year and not only because Immanuel Kant passed all their life in that city.
<seg>I congratulate once again to the Honourable member by its excellent report on a very important question, to which in the coming years we will return to talk about time and time again - I am safe in this Parliament.
<seg>Locate you me in a very difficult position.
<seg>Sir President, I mean that this debate is very necessary because the crisis of the BSE has huge implications on fodder, on the culture and import of fodder.
<seg>The Council has expressed his preoccupation in numerous meetings with Russia, at all the levels, in particular to dissuade it to make a use excessive of the force and to avoid a possible extension of the conflict, so that he comes to effective independent inquiries and on the violations of the human rights, so that he supports to the assistance group of OSCE in the fulfillment of its mission and, finally, so that he guards by the transport of the humanitarian aid.
<seg>Sir President, a point of order. He is usual in this Assembly that the questions that cannot be responded orally of sufficient way respond later in writing.
<seg>(Interruption of Mr. Posselt)
<seg>This directive is of 1992.
<seg>In this sense it will be necessary to work.
<seg>Those groups are evidently lazy besides this fresh proposal.
<seg>. (FR) The Presidency and several Member States have already received correspondence of the European Committee of sugar manufacturers concerning the Commission proposal, whom they will consider in his deliberations.
<seg>Question nº 6 of (H-0886/00):
<seg>First of all, I must say that, in my opinion, the President of the Council has still not answered the question of Mr. Korakas.
<seg>Now, it is necessary to establish that authority and I believe that the European authorities are very brought back to consciousness and that there will be to follow ahead.
<seg>More concretely, the representative of the Presidency has met, in this case the Ambassador of France in Algeria, with Mr.
<seg>We in this respect celebrate proposed arrangements by the preparatory Committee and decided by the General Assembly regarding the way of accreditation of the nongovernmental organizations, to the preparatory process and the special session of September of 2001.
<seg>The cooperation includes several references to the European Convention of the Human rights.
<seg>As it already emphasized the Council to the Honourable member in his previous answer, the process of mutual recognition of the criminal decisions will allow to protect better the rights of people.
<seg>It would want to urge it a little more.
<seg>In particular, it guarantees the political control and the strategic direction of an military operation of crisis management.
<seg>Simply, it wanted to remember that the system of the Treaty establishes a difference in treatment between the rates and the indirect taxes, whose harmonization is necessary to guarantee the establishment and the functioning of the internal market - article 93 - and the approach, anticipated in article 94, of the legislations that affect of direct form the establishment or the functioning of the common market, between that appear regarding direct taxation.
<seg>We see these three sectors briefly.
<seg>If the behavior model stays of which in case of doubt all fight against all, this could make jump by airs the stability pact for the Southeast of Europe that is based on the regional cooperation.
<seg>In the end, we also needed the cooperation with Yugoslavia, in addition a cooperation on both sides.
<seg>Sir President, our Group supports the work carried out by Mr. Baltas in relation to the report on the viability of the negotiation in stabilization agreements and association with the Republic of the Croatia.
<seg>Sir President, during the years in which I was Parliamentary President of the House of the Council of Europe, I had the opportunity to accompany to many Croatians in its efforts towards the freedom and the prosperity that they, like other towns of our continent, identified with their integration in the European institutions.
<seg>From the results obtained by the east Croatia year, I have to say that I trust that we will be able to reach a fast rate.
<seg>That one is, of course, our criterion and the rapidity with which we have fit to our policy towards the Croatia in the last months testifies it.
<seg>We have the obligation towards the Croatia to give to its Government and his town all class of aid in the coming years and are thankful for deeply to the Honourable member its wise advising with a view to guarding so that we follow that way.
<seg>He is incomprehensible in this respect that the Laskar Jihad had the opportunity to go to the Moluccas this spring with thousands of those in favor to exacerbate the conflict again.
<seg>In Timor, the militias block the return of the refugees and the people who give the aid find besieged.
<seg>In the name of the Committee on Industry, I limit myself three questions.
<seg>Sir President, gentleman Commissioner, Lordships, would want to begin congratulating to Mrs Maij-Weggen by the excellent work that has realised.
<seg>It is not the unique country in which this happens.
<seg>The persistent violence in the Moluccas, in Aceh in Irian Jaya causes much pain to the population.
<seg>Tomorrow, we celebrated here the ceremony of the delivery of the Sajárov Prize.
<seg>According to the news most recent arrivals of the Indonesian archipelago are urgent, also, the question of if the situation still does not seem more serious, yes, more precarious, for President Wahid and are used the enemies who the rapporteur analyzes.
<seg>If we want to help Indonesia, we must now act with money and facts and nonsimple words.
<seg>I believe that the report is extraordinarily valuable when throwing light exceeds what is been happening.
<seg>It is clear that the difficulties of Indonesia will not be solved overnight.
<seg>Protection of the financial interests of the Communities
<seg>It is necessary to suppress finally the obstacles for its independent activity, especially in the recruitment of personnel and its structuring.
<seg>For this reason, the Commission must fulfill finally by means of an internal reform process its announcement of which it is not going to tolerate the frauds and that each of them is consequently going to be persecuted.
<seg>I believe that this must exactly be the consequence also of Nize.
<seg>It would like us that the Member States abrieran negotiations facing having a homogenous legislation in field of criminal, however, we do not want to put under our countries a communitarian federal Office of the public prosecutor.
<seg>Also it would want to know why it was delayed until yesterday, after the Danish referendum on the Euro, the publication of the Commission document on this subject.
<seg>I have presented/displayed an amendment so that the names of those countries are mentioned, because it is already hour of which therefore it is made to shame them.
<seg>I am sure that indeed OLAF has interest in forming of way is transparent the selection of the directive pictures superiors.
<seg>Nevertheless, in the European Parliament we must try not to see the beam in our eye be so trims in seeing the straw in the other people's one: the one of the Commission.
<seg>We are trying to extinguish a fire and asphyxiating to us with the smoke.
<seg>And it cannot understand it to nobody, I either.
<seg>With a view to reaching that intention exactly, I allow myself to put of relief four questions that I consider fundamental in the work of the budgetary supervisory authority.
<seg>The Treaty supposes a problem for the European Parliament.
<seg>Mrs. Comisaria, is worrisome whom there is to explicitly draw attention of the Commission on the respect for the rights of the deputies being as she is defending of Treaties.
<seg>They talk about to several directions for the action that the Committee on Budgetary Control can follow when it finds problems in different spheres, among them those to recommend to the Committee on Budgets that congeals or reduces the amount of the consigments destined to the games in question in the following budget year; not to authorize transferences of consigments that involve the increase of the games affected during fixed period until they have concluded additional internal investigations; until getting to ask the President of the Commission that requests the resignation of any Commissioner affected by the serious problems shortages: something as well as a Caesarean one of the EU.
<seg>The report demands that detailed inventories of the operational activities, exhaustive controls of the budget lines and the irregularities become as well as an internal evaluation of the results on the part of the Commission.
<seg>Mrs. Comisaria, the starting point of the transmission of information to the European Parliament is the Treaty of the EC and not the Interinstitutional Agreement.
<seg>But the result of this common position would be, if it does not modify, that in the end not only we would have an equality of arms with respect to North America but not even within Europe.
<seg>I do not know because it would not have to be obtained in the present case, like it has been obtained for all the other directives, of arriving in the end at a commitment.
<seg>It is a proposal that has had a length, and I am afraid that stormy, way to surpass some of the existing difficulties.
<seg>The first amendment talks about the article 4, in which it settles down which has to be the competent authority for the supervision of the supply.
<seg>Now we have a proposal that would cause messes, search of the most favorable court, possible dispute in a while delicate in an enterprise agreement.
<seg>In the United Kingdom the regulation of the public offers of acquisition by means of the voluntary code of practices administered by the group in charge of the public offers of acquisition has given very good results: a good example here of an pragmatic approach of an extremely complex question in which the legislation she would be less appropriate.
<seg>But, more than that, the best thing is than we can ahead remove the program from Lisbon of creation of a competitive and dynamic European economy.
<seg>In the European Parliament what we must do it is to regulate of a minimum form in the European level the great fields that cause tension in the right of acquisitions, for example, presidency in front of shareholders, major shareholders in front of small or companies in front of capital market.
<seg>Some proposed amendments by the Parliament still improve plus the common position text of the Council. Due to it, their points focus attention on questions that could give rise to difficulties in the interpretation and which they are urgent more to a rapid change of the directive.
<seg>After all, he is not proven none that the proposed definition of equitable price is better than any other, since the different definitions that are used at this moment in the Member States work all very well.
<seg>The debate is closed.
<seg>In addition, a right to information is clear the artist to have the news of its rights within a term of up to three years before the professional retailers of art objects, which is reasonable, since these must take to the accounting of the purchases and sales.
<seg>Consequently, they must here go to the Austrian legislator and not attack the European legislator who only creates positive conditions frame for the artists and auction houses.
<seg>In addition, in the subject that occupies to us, the necessity of a common position is as much greater whatever than only one common position will allow the European Union to influence to international level so that the interest of the creators to global scales can be defended.
<seg>I trust the wisdom and shrewdness of this Assembly.
<seg>In Germany, for example, from the 7,000 artists who transferred their rights in 1998 only 274, in fact, they obtained money some for that reason and 40% of droit of suite were destined to support the costs to acquire the sum.
<seg>In summary, a harmonization of this type in that sector is not necessary.
<seg>A similar amendment had been rejected already in first reading.
<seg>They have thought that the translations could continue in spite of this quite tight and difficult calendar.
<seg>Nevertheless, we have arrived at a point in which, lamentably, no longer we can pospone more east subject.
<seg>Our commission proposes that this one went ahead a year.
<seg>This Parliament is, naturally, in favor of those values and is going to continue defending them.
<seg>The technology and market development will cause the change in any case.
<seg>Any legal basis does not exist that allows to exclude the competition in those cases.
<seg>A universal shortening of term of service - the same essence of the sector of the postal service - up to 50 grams would put in serious risk the capacity of the national postal servants to provide a universal service to a reasonable tariff for all regardless of the place in which they reside.
<seg>Them memory to my Conservative colleagues the mess in which they put in the United Kingdom when they tried to privatize the British postal service.
<seg>We have turned the safety net for the service users of post office into a hammock where the great companies of post office ease up to continue and so they have always done.
<seg>I feel very satisfied because this notion of special services tried to put to modern technologies outside the field of the universal service. Grs is made happen to the reserved sector of the weight limit of 50. proposed to 150 grs.
<seg>We cannot tolerate, Mrs. Presidenta, Sir Commissioner, and we will not tolerate that a similar situation takes place.
<seg>For this reason, the European Commission has not proposed the total liberalisation of the postal services in the second phase.
<seg>This is something that him desire to the other European countries.
<seg>In Dutch newspapers, Mr. Bolkestein recently threw in face to the French his antiliberal position, or at least thus he appeared in the holder of a newspaper.
<seg>In this sense, Spain could say to something that has created this bottom and it has been worth of the same, and this to speak of the random legal bases that the bottom shows, of the virtual criteria as far as its composition and of the discretionary guarantees of its application.
<seg>Tomorrow we voted, and I hope that in favor of the amendment of Mr. Atkins or Mr. Sterckx because otherwise I will be forced to vote against this report.
<seg>Royal Mail is in the competition and it distributes letters to me in Malmo, Sweden.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, gentleman Commissioner, what has taught the debate to us, or rather the controversy provoked by Commissioner Bolkestein in its search of a liberalisation of postal services for want of any balance of the initial stage and violating rules defined by this directive? That using progressive terms and that they are valued, such as modernization, liberalization, support of the technological development, fall in a regression of the social quality of a country.
<seg>The anticipated protection of the universal services by means of a compensation fund that would allow to use the private profits for services public cannot be permanent.
<seg>These same limits and delays have contributed to a debate in which frequently the aims with the instruments are confused.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, when dealing with this subject we are speaking of economic and social cohesion.
<seg>Mrs. Presidenta, first of all, permítame to congratulate to the rapporteur Mr. Ferber because, of course, she has carried out a complicated work, difficult, where she has had to try to look for the balance between completely different proposals, positions and starting points and of arrival.
<seg>I am afraid that the effect will be that the present monopolists will be able to still more strengthen their position at the cost of the contributors and who the ribbon for the new aspirings rises.
<seg>Also it cheers to me to verify that our Liberal friendly of the continent are giving example to the British Liberals.
<seg>Certainly I recognize that concept of liberalisation Rep does not have anything of bad and that can be beneficial for the consumers.
<seg>Justified, since one includes in the logic of Treaties founders of the European Union, who put in front completion of the internal market by the free movement of goods and services in competition surroundings.
<seg>The universal service is the angular stone of the Community policy in this scope and everything what we do is thought to create the right conditions for its improvement.
<seg>The special services are another one of the scopes of major importance in which it must foment the innovation and the modernization.
<seg>It has said that the opening to the competition of the practical totality of the postal market seems inevitable before the decade finalizes.
<seg>I am in favor of which solid guarantees exist of which always the service obligations will be protected universal.
<seg>It is for that reason reason why I cannot remain in silence and I will not remain in silence while the future of the sector one is threatened by the incapacity to properly meet the challenges marked that us all in Lisbon.
<seg>Thank you very much, Mr. Simpson.
<seg>However, I must remember that this common organisation of markets has like main objective the guarantee of access to the Community market of her products.
<seg>It is absolutely necessary to find, over the tariff preference of 300 Euros, means to allow the effective access to contingent C and to evaluate of subsequent way the impact of the system in these producers.
<seg>For example, we cannot stop expressing our restlessness by the plataneras productions in particular countries the ACP, the producing tiny countries of the Antilles and in some countries of Western Africa that have been traditional suppliers of the banana market with which we have commitments that we cannot forget.
<seg>Therefore, I ask that this report is endorsed in their totality on the part of the members of this Assembly, as were it in the Committee on Agriculture.
<seg>Whereas the United States first condemns the historical reference periods, and now defend their own historical reference periods.
<seg>Powerful interests take part, mainly those of the Americans, who are not cultivating direct of bananas, but that have invested capital American in the commercial companies.
<seg>Sometimes it seems as if the Commission, in the proposals of deregulation in the commerce and the agricultural production at international level, outside even more far than the Group of Cairns.
<seg>It is a pity that the Commission and the Council persists in particular in a solution that can jeopardize seriously that production, after 2006.
<seg>The successive opinions of the WTO do not say that we did not prune to grant a preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers.
<seg>Thus, the transitional period would have to be of almost fifteen years and inferior to the ten and compensatory aid never must include the guarantee of the communitarian incomes for producers and the exit of the production of the outermost regions, reason why also a aid to the organizations is due to include that commercialize produced bananas there.
<seg>I hope that today it listens to our arguments, since this system proposed by the Commission, this tariff preference, although is of 300 Euros, can be revealed like quite useless in the facts since producers the ACP to be will see laminates by the system called “by arrival order”.
<seg>VOTINGS
<seg>(The Parliament approves the Commission proposal)
<seg>The Commission rejects the remaining amendments.
<seg>Before the voting:
<seg>(The Parliament approves the amendment oral)
<seg>Report (A5-0376/2000) of Mrs Morgan, in the name of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the reform of the procedures and institutions of budgetary control (2000/2008 (INI))
<seg>The majority of the smokers does not know all the risks nor supports all the costs of their option.
<seg>During already the 35 years of my long parliamentary life always I have relied on this norm.
<seg>I am afraid that their hopes will be in vain.
<seg>This one is our desperate final attempt to place in the small boxes labels and images that reflect the true costs of the tobacco consumption.
<seg>Lehne report (A5-0368/2000)
<seg>I believe that this judgment still continues being correct and excellent and, consequently, have voted against the report in its totality.
<seg>With good criterion, the Legal Affairs Committee insists on refusing to a maximum limit and a minimum percentage inferior to 7%.
<seg>When voting against this directive, my Group wishes to present/display a political warning so that in Europe we do not take care to establish unnecessary norms.
<seg>If he is right to denounce the dictatorship of Stalin of decades ago, how can be granted a minimum confidence to Mr. Putin, twig of Chechen people, godfather of the different Mafias, that it insists on eliminating all type of opposition, the civil society (political unions, parties), to reinforce its personal power?
<seg>Certain that Indonesia would not deserve this intensification of the relations, since in the last years the governors of this country have distinguished themselves indeed neither by a great democracy nor by great merits; nevertheless, we must worry about the Indonesian citizens and by this, welcomes are the intensification of the relations and these aid.
<seg>The unit only must take care of the crimes committed by the communitarian employees.
<seg>The Theato report on the fight against fraud allows to discover that the Bank European Central, without a doubt to prove better its famous independence, has not considered advisable to add itself to the agreement on the Office of Fight against fraud (OLAF).
<seg>Voting time is closed.
<seg>Or we belong to a club or we do not belong, and is especially important that we recognize this principle.
<seg>Esteemed colleagues, we to the change of name do not contribute.
<seg>The exclusively tariff regime is, nevertheless, an essential element, that guarantees the balance of the Commission proposal and forms a base important to be able to make some progress in the Council.
<seg>The national and regional programs of promotion of the rural development also include measures of support for marketing of these bananas.
<seg>Europe and the United States works in close collaboration in defence of the values that we shared.
<seg>We hope that it will be spoken on future a new round of the WTO, as well as on the consequences that the wide range of fresh initiatives will have for this round bilateral trade that is being debated in the American hemisphere.
<seg>Since it has said rightly, the transatlantic relations have intensified enormously in the last ten years - mainly, it is certain, on the part of the United States, thanks to President Clinton, but I believe that history will tell that to these new relations also Europe has contributed, that has carried out a fundamental role for its development, through the Transatlantic Declaration of 1990 and the new Transatlantic Agenda under Spanish Presidency in December of 1995.
<seg>In summary, it will be important to secure a change of direction and to make a Transatlantic real agenda for year 2001.
<seg>In order to finish, I will talk about the Dominican Republic, that says assumed that the WTO had to become an impartial referee of the common rules, in that the countries could learn to act according to the norms.
<seg>Secondly, although we did not prune to cheer us for the backward movement of the communist impostura, the collapse of the Soviet Union left a single superpower: the United States of America.
<seg>I know that the Commissioner maintains a good and very constructive dialogue with the Parliament and the commissions that bear some relation to these subjects.
<seg>In accordance with the order of business, it is come to the joint debate of the following information:
<seg>These objectives, main and the secondary ones, will be the litmus test with which they must judge the concrete proposals presented/displayed by the Commission.
<seg>A solution is known that thus - installation in a single country with possibility of serving in all the Union could make possible an avalanche in those countries with lower imposition.
<seg>Thus, in 1992 an agreement was obtained, then considered a minimum harmonisation, according to which the standard rate of the IVA could not be inferior to 15% and the Member States had the faculty to apply to one or more rates noninferiors to 5%, in this case with established derogations.
<seg>We have asked that the European Commission guards so that market distortions do not take place and that this one report on the results to the Council and the Parliament.
<seg>Really, the objective of this proposal is correct, but the method is preposterous and if we really want to foment and-economy of Europe, a right signal would be to determine a type zero of IVA for our companies that operate through the network, to time to try to impose our problems to the others.
<seg>In order to be able to fulfill the exigencies to diminish the gas discharges of greenhouse effect, we will have to adopt all sort of measures to limit it.
<seg>The single case in which until now any tax is not collected is the one of the benefits that are realised in the European Union from a country third.
<seg>The positive discrimination of air transport must finish.
<seg>The companies of other countries, other people's to the community, do not pay taxes.
<seg>The compact discs are not so archaic and would be necessary to impose a rate to them, while the programs that circulate around Internet would be outside the imposition of a rate.
<seg>Nevertheless, the solution that sets out is destined to being technically nonviable and to put restrictions to the promotion of the transactions by Internet in the Union, indeed when all augur their expansion.
<seg>Sir President, Lordships, the tax systems of the Union are losing claw and capacity of collection.
<seg>We would have to be looking for average to foment the electronic commerce and not to devise new forms to burden it.
<seg>The liberal ones say to us that the minor is necessary Been possible.
<seg>The Primarolo group has made simple rules that are necessary to apply.
<seg>Like objection, the Group that I represent in this Assembly thinks that it would be due to correct the fact that, while the newspapers enjoy reduced types of IVA normally, this reduction is not of application to newspapers by electronic means.
<seg>The imposition of kerosene can only be introduced, therefore, by means of an international consensus that allows to guarantee the equality of competition.
<seg>I welcome with particular satisfaction the fact that the report reinforces one of the key arguments that I presented/displayed in my report on behalf of the Committee of Transports and that was put under voting in this Parliament a few months ago, that is to say, that bearing in mind that without a doubt it is politically difficult to reach an international agreement on the taxation of aviation, at least in the short term, we would have to look for alternative tools to obtain the same effect, including a rate by the emissions.
<seg>In fact, the industry pays the 100% of its infrastructure costs through the rates of airport and air traffic control, that in 1998 rose to a total of 4,000 million dollars the USA; unlike other means of transport, like the railroad or the highway, that continues strongly being subsidized.
<seg>The current situation is not favorable.
<seg>Against this background it is precise to state, lamentably, that the emissions of the air traffic constitute a problem that, although as a percentage is not too great, is being increased much and, therefore, we would not have to scorn it.
<seg>The plan will be detrimental for the development of the SME, as much of inside as of outside the Union, especially taking into account the proposal prohibitively to reduce the exemption threshold to the level under invoicing of 40,000 annual Euros.
<seg>If we are too greedy when confronting the question that occupies to us, we will be putting really in danger the future of the important commerce ecommerce in Europe.
<seg>The starting point of which the suppliers of outside the Community which they only provide to clients within the Community must be registered in a place cannot suppose a displacement of the tax revenues between the Member States.
<seg>Considering that the discussion in the Council still continues and the desire of the Commission in the short term to trench of right way the question of the IVA and the electronic commerce, I believe that the best thing at this moment is not to formally assume the proposals to amend of the Parliament, but as far as possible to make them reality through the negotiations in the Council.
<seg>For this reason, I cannot accept the proposed amendments.
<seg>Thank you very much, Sir Commissioner, by all the dossiers to which this week has talked about.
<seg>On the other hand, only three months after the accident, the Commission assumed its responsibilities and adopted a preliminary package of measures, that the European Parliament authenticated the past 30 of November totally.
<seg>Indeed, with more than fifteen directives or regulations in force, it is urgent to uniformizar the practices and to exert a greater control on the application of Community rule, to avoid unacceptable significant differences and in the field of maritime safety that could take place within the Union.
<seg>Sir President, I am thankful for to Mrs Comisaria its continuous commitment in the field of the marine security.
<seg>I want to remember the Honourable member that in air safety the indemnifications that are applied in the European level and in the North American scope, they are not equivalent to the same amounts that the applied ones in other countries.
<seg>Secondly, I will say to him to the Honourable member that who could have the capacity to confiscate or to congeal the bottoms of a concrete company to compensate damages or others, is the French court, that could establish responsibilities beyond predicted according to the criteria the objectives that the international current regulation raises on oil pollution.
<seg>The Commission considers that these dispositions go in the right direction towards the establishment of righter charging systems, than in addition stimulate a more rational and effective use of the road network.
<seg>As a result of the received critics, especially of Ireland and France, the measurement changed and now the British minister of Property has given a different turn him: now one appears like a rate by right of usage for all, including the British lorry drivers.
<seg>I have myself it jeopardize to guarantee that the foods that are put at the disposal of the consumers, whether come from inside or of outside the European Union, they fulfill the norms the more strict.
<seg>. (IN) Naturally I include/understand the Honourable member preoccupation.
<seg>Moan to say to him, Sir Commissioner who its answer does not interest to me.
<seg>The question that raises the Honourable member is important.
<seg>In Nigeria, Chevron has been accused by the indigenous population all-ijaw to incite the violence against her and to even pay to the Nigerian soldiers so that they shoot against the demonstrators in the naval base of Warri.
<seg>. (IN) In its approved report the 15 of November, the Commission reached the conclusion that operating aids by virtue of Regulation 1540/98 have not allowed to solve the problem of the South Korean pricing policies.
<seg>I believe that the set of intentions is enormously reassuring, but the reality is that meanwhile our shipyards are closing.
<seg>Question nº 38 formulated by (H-0868/00):
<seg>Sir Commissioner, I include/understand that it does not wish to modify its decision although ten Member States are opposite to this tariff.
<seg>This initiative is based on a Council regulation, that modifies the regulation that defines the EGP.
<seg>I represent some producers and for that reason I feel a deep concern.
<seg>We work in it in commission, we have not retaken it this week when being Poul absent Nielson by a trip to the Balkan Mountains.
<seg>We are working in the clause of safeguard and if Mr. Clegg needs arguments to speak with his producers of beet I have, them to its disposition.
<seg>I want to thank for to Mr. Liikanen very positive his and shining answer.
<seg>I will deal on this subject with my services once we know the budgetary resources available for the coming year.
<seg>At this moment, the efforts of my services and the mine personal concentrate in limiting the distance between the parts the future and court.
<seg>In the same way that the courts of D5usseldorf, Munich and of other German towns have specialized in the Patent law, and also courts specialized in London exist, a Community court who meets and judges cases regarding the Community patents will have to be very specialized.
<seg>In order to avoid that this provisional situation acquires a permanent nature, the 13 of 1999 July, the 13 of July of the last year, the Commission remembered in a letter directed to the corresponding Member States their obligation to designate courts for the Community marks.
<seg>As the honourable Member of his assembly knows well, the presentation of a denunciation by itself does not affect the advance of the project.
<seg>Question nº 47 formulated by (H-0877/00):
<seg>This means therefore that the Commission will only make use of the legal measures which it has as it is indicated in the regulation.
<seg>The question is where these students must go to understand that when follows that cycle of studies they culminate and it in Great Britain must right to obtain results.
<seg>The King could be chosen by a fixed period among the most commendable Finnish Members the Parliament.
<seg>Also it could see like a subject that affects the competition, since it will be possible to be continued selling without taxes in the South part of the Baltic Sea, in the route between Stockholm and Helsinki, whereas that is not possible in the route between Umeå and Vaasa.
<seg>What we must do is to correct this situation through promotion of multilingual contents, because they constitute an essential requirement for the success of European content industry.
<seg>The problem that worries more to me is that the small companies not always have sufficient guarantees and a resisted commercial trajectory that to offer to him to the investor.
<seg>In order to take to successful conclusion the development of the European ambitious programme and-Contain is necessary to simplify and to consolidate from the point of view of the security the considered procedures.
<seg>For this reason, the objective of the public measures of support destined to the promotion of the content industry of the EU is to be also the achievement of a high level of culture and the diversification of the same.
<seg>Across, are the communications networks, that they need the contents to fill his virtual space incessantly, and that considers the subordination of the contents obvious, its purchase, its use without special attention to the production rules.
<seg>Sir President, I welcome with great satisfaction the program regarding the European digital contents and would want to emphasize two considerations.
<seg>For that reason support the amendments that request the approval of special actions in the scope of modern technologies.
<seg>First, on the social and cultural function of the digital content, the Commission welcomes favorably the fact that the Parliament insists on the social and cultural dimension of the digital contents.
<seg>Evaluation and management of the environmental noise
<seg>Indeed, I am been thankful by the support that the Christian Democrat ones and, by the way, also the one of a part of the liberal Group, have given this amendment in particular to limit the noise of the airplanes.
<seg>Only this year, six years later than the dates above-mentioned, and under strong pressure of the French Government, the Commission has presented/displayed a proposal to establish harmonized indicators of noise.
<seg>This proposal is, in fact, quite moderate, if we consider that the Scandinavian countries already have norms stricter than those than we propose for year 2012.
<seg>Orly, Schiphol, Barcelona and other airports fulfill strict measures already.
<seg>Another major point that we propose that he is gotten up and that is going to be fundamental in the context of the problematic one of the noise of the airplanes is the definition of other additional indicators of noise, besides whom has indicated the rapporteur.
<seg>For want of common rules in the European Union, we have attended situations of well-known distortion of the competition between airports and lack of fairness between the citizens of the different Member States.
<seg>For that reason the amendments of my colleague Bernd Lange seem so important to me.
<seg>Sir President, first of all, I must say that I welcome the present report favorably.
<seg>This was at heart the purpose of amendment 36, although I believe that the idea has still not been developed thoroughly.
<seg>We would have to examine at great length this aspect and to adopt soon in both scopes a combined approach, establishing on the one hand limit values for the different sonorous sources of emission and, on the other side, quality standards of the emissions.
<seg>We need more time and moan than we have not had it, although in general terms, support the directive frame.
<seg>Once the Member States have provided comparable information, the Commission will study the question to introduce communitarian limit values and other measures to reduce the number of people who are affected by the noise, and will present/display a report to the Council and the Parliament.
<seg>Food additives different from colouring and sweeteners
<seg>These are the three criteria.
<seg>Thank you very much, esteemed colleague, I support with you, because, if you have the throat like a scourer, have I it like a floorcloth, like tenth to the north of the Rhine; the certain thing is that it seems that the influenza this way walks making the rounds.
<seg>If the diet problems become chronic increases, in addition, the risk of contracting cancer.
<seg>Then, also it was verified that the Commission lacked the instruments necessary to act suitably.
<seg>Tomorrow we have in the program another stage. Then it will touch to the turn to our colleague Marit Paulsen to him, of the liberal Group, that will have the opportunity to clarify the directive even more than it occupies to us.
<seg>The Member States and the Commission have a better instrument now to guard by faithful compliance with Community legislation in animal feed and, in case emergency situations in nonmember countries arise, they can adopt measures without waste of time.
<seg>We know that most of the European live in the cities, and until now these questions have been in embryonic stage concerning the cities.
<seg>The planning process must be applied of a right and innovating way.
<seg>Multiannual programme 2000-2004 for the sustainable development in urban means is an instrument adapted to this aim, as well as implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent way of coordination and development of action.
<seg>In order to secure that it changes the climatic threat it is necessary that the transports fall and that the fossil fuels in the local level give in.
<seg>Those have been many that have suggested the budget is too small.
<seg>What it is tried is that the main partners in this frame are the Commission and the networks of local authorities, that have the legal responsibility to develop and to apply the sustainable development policies in urban means.
<seg>The Court of Justice of the Communities and the organs of conflict resolution of the WTO even consider that sometimes the precautionary principle is applied in environmental field or in the matter of public health, and even sometimes against the European, as demonstrates the outstanding issue to it of cheeses made with fresh milk.
<seg>The purpose is to be the limitation or indemnification of the no damages, but the primary objective must be to avoid the damages against the health or the goods of the people.
<seg>Already in 1996, the European Parliament left in favor of a prohibition of the use of animal meals in all the European Union, according to the precautionary principle; although only for that reason.
<seg>It has never existed, and it will never exist, absolute a scientific certainty on new substances nor on new products.
<seg>Finally, if we want that the application of the precautionary principle is effective and credible, is fundamental the participation of all the interested, including the representatives of the civil society, in the political decisions that surround their application
<seg>And, finally, that the public health and the environment must prevail over other considerations, mainly economic.
<seg>An essential condition for the implementation of the precautionary principle is that to the preoccupation by the possible harmful effects is provided it with a scientific basis.
<seg>Only yesterday, in Lisbon, of first hand, an American, professor George Car it, to whom the Food and Drugs Administration is trusting in the seven last years a study on the effect of radiation in the human health, revealed that the risk exists of which the use of the cellular telephones harnesses the appearance of brain tumours, the disease of Alzheimer and injuries in the skin.
<seg>Sir President, the environment and the public health are like a complicated machine with a pile of functions that we watched and we controlled to be able to take part and that thus does not spoil.
<seg>The application of this principle must avoid at all costs to contain the innovation and the economic activity, to generate pusilanimidad and industrial do-nothing policy, to become means to dissuade to the competition.
<seg>Since it will have observed the Parliament, the position of the Commission is in accordance with the majority of the questions that raises in its motion for a resolution.
<seg>The voting will tomorrow take place to the 10,00 hours.
<seg>Its article 2 consecrates the right to life. And in each occasion in which in Spain the terrorism kills a person, all the Union is affected in which it constitutes one of his more essential principles.
<seg>We do not want to replace the legitimately established institutions, but to be urgent them to that they protect our rights and our liberties without concessions to the terror.
<seg>VOTINGS
<seg>Also, the observation of the Council remembered on the classification of the budget lines regarding the project of anticipated retirement of the Commission and on the administrative expenditure of the fisheries agreements.
<seg>(The Parliament approves the resolution legislative)
<seg>That is to say, no longer he is present.
<seg>The 23,428 obtained permissions will seem to them few, but on the other hand they will be contentments of which space is offered to them so that they can grow.
<seg>The consequence of that suppression, that began to be applied in the middle of the last year, was, since we had anticipated, a dramatic interruption of the rate of approval of projects and execution of payments, and so the annual execution of authorizations of that bottom, at the end of June of the year 2000, was reduced a percentage point.
<seg>The text is a letter in ideal target for a closing actually of the General Secretariat of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.
<seg>Before my trip, they said to me: “It is Christmas, and in Bergamo we celebrated Christmas and Santa Lucia. He will be Mr.
<seg>In addition, we objected the agricultural product overproduction and the use of average destined to the information to sell them.
<seg>Sir President, I have voted in favor of the report Garci'a-Margallo and Marfil on the tax burden of the electronic commerce.
<seg>Sir President, I will try to reform before year 2004 with some explanation of vote in favor of Malta.
<seg>Nevertheless I say, it with certain solemnity: it is the maximum that I can accept of a Europe, in my opinion, too liberal!
<seg>The existence of a date top would stimulate to the postal sector to develop and to modernize its services, while it would facilitate the planning and the investments in the markets.
<seg>They will continue exerting pressure. They consolidate its position with the money that wins with the distribution of shipments of more than 150 grams.
<seg>The liberalisation of postal services, as she was propose by the Commission, is not adapted nor coherent, reason by which I have voted in favor of the report and of all the proposed amendments that expressed that same direction.
<seg>Report of I nibble (A5-0378/2000)
<seg>Also we have reserves on amendments 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31, not being convinced that they are compatible with the WTO.
<seg>The Commission proposal is unacceptable in the state in which is, since it represents a capitulation without conditions before the American dictatorship! This capitulation is unworthy of our European project and the social and environmental model that tenth to want to construct!
<seg>It attempts against the respect of the national identity as it is stipulated in section 3 of article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.
<seg>It is precise to emphasize that the linguistic minorities, instead of being devoured by the globalisation of Internet, are finding in this means a new economic cultural openness and.
<seg>Sir President, for want of other results, the negotiation that took place in Nize will have made the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union clear.
<seg>In this respect the tone of the joint resolution is excessively simplistic.
<seg>The delay of the publication of the written conclusions - that still they are not officially available at this moment, four days more late demonstrates well the difficulty to clearly write up decisions taken in the confusion.
<seg>The unique one half to avoid dangerous conflicts in the future, is to maintain the conception traditional according to which Europe is based on the mutual respect of national communities.
<seg>The Nice Summit concluded Sunday with an agreement that would have to give rise to a draft treaty.
<seg>The resolution on Nize, voted today, does not reflect this.
<seg>Finally, a reference to the social policy, by which France had bet in the presentation of its Presidency, but that, in the end, was handed over full of very not much, aside from the declarations of intentions and of the titles of documents of very vague and clearly insufficient content before the existing problems and the enormous displeasure, del that the manifestation of the workers in Nize also was important expression.
<seg>In the really important subjects like taxes, tributes, social policy, asylum and emigration, everything it stays as before.
<seg>What makes an impression in the debate on Nice is the sensation at the end of which the Treaty has father neither mother nor is son of anybody: the French Presidency unfolded in excuses, instead of to clearly assume the results of the CIG and their reasons; the political Groups that correspond to the Governments of Member States multiplied the critics.
<seg>On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies by means of the encroachment on the right falls to I veto and to that more power occurs to the European Parliament.
<seg>If these consequences had been able to calculate in my year of birth, in 1944, when concluding the Agreement of Chicago, possibly an tax exemption for the fuel and other products would not have remembered aviation.
<seg>Bearing in mind that risk zero does not exist, the scientists or, at least, the politicians must apply the criterion of proportionality, judge the uncertain risks and assume their responsibilities.
<seg>But this Parliament also fought so that this reduction of the resources for the innovative measures was compensated using the instrument of flexibility determined to a clause of the Budgetary Forecast.
<seg>All have a paper that to carry out in this important field because, in the truly global market in which already we were, the fresh ideas - with the adequate resources, and a support it signs and realist - will do that in Europe we pruned in particular to maintain our place to the vanguard of the technological development in the new industries and communications technology.
<seg>In the previous speaker already hard words against the budgets were pronounced, and is that 400 million Euros are really the minimum financing, whereupon in the second part of the exercise it is necessary to take advantage of the possibilities of funding additional that it offers the flexibility instrument, as it has been indicated in the report.
<seg>According to my opinion, to it will accompany automatically, and not as it concludes the report, a diminution of the European added value.
<seg>As all we know, in the European Union unemployment is concentrated less in the territories economic and technologically developed, in particular in those of objective nº 1, reason why it is precise that the innovative measures do not have only a simple technological character, but are inspired by an explicit will of economic development and the use.
<seg>When I return own region, the east of England, and discover that not one local authority has used that money in this final stage, I doubt that we have been all the effective ones that there are to be in the future giving the welcome to these new communities.
<seg>Sir President, my opening words are for Helmut Markov to be thankful to him and to congratulate it by the constructive presentation, competent and extremely serious of the project of communication regarding the innovative measures of the ERDF for period 2000-2006.
<seg>The energy efficiency and the aspects of the common environmental have not forgotten in these directions. They can give rise to innovative measures as a third subject, that it concerns the regional identity and the sustainable development.
<seg>However, we wished that the projects are chosen in the regional level, like, by the others, has understood Mr. to it Berend in its intervention well.
<seg>The debate is closed.
<seg>For that reason we asked in this report and the three amendments that there are addition that the Commission redoubling its efforts to present/display a conciliation resource before the WTO.
<seg>I believe that the Commissioner must demonstrate to the industry that is doing everything what can in this sense to make against this external threat our industry.
<seg>Finally, naturally, we hoped that, from the 18 of December, the agreement is examined in the meeting of group 6 of the OECD “ships”.
<seg>Nevertheless, all the indications aim at that the final goal moves time and time again, so that we were never able to reach it.
<seg>As all you know, the simple procedure of this procedure will need more than six months.
<seg>For great trusts, like for its political lawyers, vindicating less Been it only means that the State and its finances must be to their exclusive disposition.
<seg>But to obtain it, so that the process allows to consolidate shipbuilding industry, the places of work and to give tranquillity to the families who depend on him, continue being necessary aid beyond the 31 of December of 2000, because the market situation is not of equality, but of disloyalty and the dumping.
<seg>The Commission foments the improving competitiveness of the shipyards of the EU, but in front of massive cuts of prices of the Korean shipyards, the increase in productivity that can be obtained is not sufficient.
<seg>The Council insisted on which this mechanism of support does not have to distort the competition within the EU.
<seg>The presence of water the damaged nuclear submarine of the bay of Algeciras has become already, unfortunately, in a diplomatic conflict between a nuclear military power and colonial and a Member State of second category, according to the last classification of Nize, that does not demand its rights and it folds before infantile explanations.
<seg>When, through medical report that spread in the country in which the owner lives - or is, through the British press, he was discovered that the disease was serious, instead of to change it of center changed the qualification to him to the center.
<seg>And, of course, we hoped with interest the answer of the Commission to verify if the objective has been fulfilled.
<seg>Sir President, I also would want that my opening words were of condolencia with the family of the murdered councillor and the companions of European People, and by ricochet to this facist barbarism of ETA and the groups are protecting that it.
<seg>Also I believe that it would be advisable that the Tireless submarine takes to Great Britain for its repair, the sooner, as soon as the suitable weather conditions occur.
<seg>The Honourable member have asked if the Commission considers that the Directive 89/618/Euratom, on information to the population in case of radiological emergency, and the Directive 96/29/Euratom, on basic safety standards, is of application to the submarine and what measures have been adopted consequently.
<seg>In agreement with the normal procedure for the complaints, we cannot make this answer public, although we can say in broad strokes what says.
<seg>An aspect of the Euratom Treaty is transportation of waste contaminated between Member States; but, by all means, Gibraltar is part of the United Kingdom and all contaminated waste will go of a part of the United Kingdom to another part of the United Kingdom, without happening through no European Member State of the European.
<seg>Everything what they must do is to gain the confidence of the people who live on the Rock.
<seg>However, we see here a Member State that tries to the public opinion of another Member State it would do since it with any other State in the world, as if, at heart, affectio was not any societatis fifty years after the beginning of the European company, as if European solidarity had not progressed in minimum.
<seg>It is a fact that at a certain time the one that the unique submarine that operated in British waters was a German submarine.
<seg>There one is struggling but the citizens, based on their knowledge or its intuition, direct their attention to the European institutions.
<seg>The lack of cost in the new military equipment due to cuts in the defense area of the government British Labor will give rise in the future, without a doubt, to more frequent episodes of defective military equipment who retires to carry out essential repairs.
<seg>Community competence, no matter how much some people wish another thing, includes the classification of the ports to carry out repair works in submarines, neither security issues technical of nuclear reactors nor the requirements so that a submarine is retired for their repair in another place.
<seg>It would be precise, to still give more aid to them, to ask to the Community institutions that reinforce financial resources, humans and materials of the ACR.
<seg>I ask to the Commission that returns to increase this aid and that it always designates to the ACNUR like coordinating body in all the contracts celebrated with the NGO.
<seg>Therefore, it must be able to have access to the civilian victims and their equipment on the land would have to be able to move with complete certainty and to have the resources necessary to fulfill their mission.
<seg>The 22 of November the Commission adopted a communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform statute for those to those who valid asylum in all the Union is granted, which was the final objective established in Tampere for the European common asylum system.
<seg>Finally, I would like to pay tribute to all the work that Mrs Ogata has carried out the ACNUR and to wish Mr.
<seg>It seems important to us that we are impelling a political amnesty in Yugoslavia for that recovery that mentioned, but also it seems very important to us that we condemn certainly the reappearance of the incursions and the terrorist activities in the borders between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo, because it remembers of worrisome form what it happened during the conflict in Kosovo, where were responsibilities of western powers.
<seg>In sections 1, 2 and 3 of our resolution of commitment we spoke very clearly.
<seg>I also appeal to President Kostunica so that it clarifies what has happened with people like Mr. Ukshin Hoti, of whose luck we have taken care here in several occasions and of whose whereabouts we do not know anything.
<seg>I also subscribe the one that becomes a call to the Kfor so that it ruins all act of violence in the Presevo valley.
<seg>I favorably welcome the measures that already the KFOR has adopted to approach the problem and itself demanding moderation in all the parts.
<seg>B5-0916/2000 of Mr. Baron Crespo and others, in the name of the Group of the PSE;
<seg>This clause was decided in the Palace of the Currency in March of 1990, I know and it well because I had the privilege to be there in the act of taking up office of President Alwyn, after the plebiscite by which aim to the regime of general Pinochet was put.
<seg>Sir President, Lordships, would want to take part on the joint resolution in whose favor evidently we will vote.
<seg>It agrees that the international community exerts its right of democratic monitoring, not like interference in the internal affairs of an independent country, but like political procedure, precautionary and preventive.
<seg>The situation in the prisons and in the police quarters, with tortures and bad treatments, is totally unacceptable.
<seg>This treatment is exactly the same that we see in western Europe and, before the protests, Minister Hikmet Sami Turk has postponed the transfer so that a political and social consensus is obtained on the reform of the prisons in Turkey.
<seg>He is urgent, and for that reason we decided to include this item on the agenda.
<seg>One will process next the 8 to him of January. It is reproached to have participated to him to a meeting of Tunisian opponents in France, which, on the other hand, he denies.
<seg>When the militants and people in charge of these associations want to meet the day of the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of the Human rights, the police surrounds its houses and those that attend this meeting are attacked in the street by men dressed civilian.
<seg>The second problem is, in fact, only one part of a set of humiliations.
<seg>My Group, like this Parliament, is particularly sensible to the human rights situation in Tunisia and the rest of the world.
<seg>Sir President, Lordships, we show a little moderation, please.
<seg>The negotiations marched very well and it pleases that those negotiations are acquiring speed, which I hope that it gives rise to the conclusion to that the Honourable member talked about.
<seg>Several deputies have talked about to the situation of the prisoners in Turkey.
<seg>B5-0912/2000 of Mr. Van Hecke in the name of the Group of the PPE-DE;
<seg>We could not, in my opinion, Sir President, gentleman Commissioner, to retractar itself with respect to this attitude.
<seg>In this frame the taking of the power of the military took place that, as always, only contributed to make worse the situation.
<seg>This attitude fits well in the continuity of the policy of French imperialism.
<seg>To the Commission the recent violence much also worries to him.
<seg>The debate on issues present, urgent and of special importance is closed.
<seg>Unfair competition helps to destroy good atmospheres for the European shipbuilding, to the loss of knowing how to do (know-how) and jobs and can take long term to monopoly situations, which will not benefit to the world-wide commerce.
<seg>Approval of the Minute of the previous sitting
<seg>By this, I want to give thanks to all the colleagues by the contribution whom they have also given in the proceeding of submission of amendments and to the technicians of the commission because they have been elements extraordinarily valuable to take to successful conclusion the resolution.
<seg>The adoption of the social agenda by the European Council in Nice satisfies, and we hoped us especially that the Member States know to take this opportunity to foment the development and the coordination of the social security systems and attendance to the people majors, and promote other measures, like, for example, the learning throughout all the life, that guarantee their reintegration to the working life.
<seg>The promotion of the lifelong learning throughout all the life - something that already has been mentioned by another speaker - is another subject that also support.
<seg>Naturally, the people of more than 60 or 70 years still can make many things useful, but it is an error to cause that, to their age, their income depend on their work.
<seg>Already, in its monthly report of 2000 July, the Bank European Central emitted very serious warnings in this respect.
<seg>Reason why respecta, the Member States can confront this problem far better they themselves by means of their own legislation.
<seg>With its proposals for a working life during the oldness, the society wins to all a generation.
<seg>It is necessary to fulfill the promises on the pensions, but the pensions must be guaranteed with the capital resources of these countries, without needing going to the political common financial of the EU to make cash their payment.
<seg>In the last 100 or 150 years we have lived the greater social revolution, than it has duplicated the life expectancy of the people.
<seg>It is what gives sense to the mathematical prolongation of the life, that the medical progress has allowed.
<seg>They acquired indemnifications - all the society saw itself, therefore, affected, the elderly workers left the use, but he was not contracted young workers and many places of work were eliminated.
<seg>The result of the family policy and public prosecutor would have rather to be that the women and the men with family responsibilities can decide freely if they wish to develop a working life or no.
<seg>My brother and I met there with him.
<seg>Other future initiatives in the field of public health mainly intend the issues relateds with the health and the attendance of the people majors and the promotion of a healthy aging.
<seg>. (IT) Sir President, I have accepted amendments 2 and 3 presented/displayed by Mr. Pronk, in which it maintains that there is to modify the text and insists on the demographic concept of development against the one of ageing of the population.
<seg>One is not to duplicate the advertising operations or of promotion of the operators of each sector nor of the public authorities.
<seg>Sir President, the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, in principle, was also in favor of the Commission proposal.
<seg>By this it is very important to offer a compensation and this one can very suitably be made specific through promotional measures and publicity.
<seg>I believe that in the context of the commercialization and the sale it would be necessary to grant a much more central place to the lifelong learning within the training programmes, since modern technologies, the management of the promotion, offer absolutely new opportunities for logistic a modern one.
<seg>First of all, I want to congratulate to Mr. Dary by its excellent report.
<seg>My following observation talks about to the subject of the exports and the intervention.
<seg>It is not necessary to pay by certain products that are not demanded, nor to do propaganda to them.
<seg>Everybody has sufficient food, so that if we promoted a product we do evidently it against the consumption of another one.
<seg>The 18 amendment and the first part of amendment 24, that reduce of to two three years the regularity whereupon the selected subjects and products will be reviewed in order to improve the effectiveness of the promotional tools.
<seg>Jutta Haug like the rapporteur, that is to say, man, and Mr. Markus Ferber like the rapporteur, that is to say, woman.
<seg>This allows to appreciate how with minor changes great effects can be obtained actually.
<seg>This it is temporarily our last Friday in Strasbourg, that is to say, that Strasbourg is going to lose twelve days of presence of Parliament.
<seg>By the others, I want to wish Merry Christmas and a prosperous one, but, mainly, wise person new century to all, but, in particular, to which they think that east is worth the present trouble to be Friday, in this last Assembly of the year 2000 in Strasbourg.
