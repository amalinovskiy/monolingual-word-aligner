<seg>The Divided Racial Camera of Europe
<seg>A common characteristic of the extreme right of Europe is its racism and its use of the subject of immigration like political force.
<seg>Lega Nord of Italy, the Vlaams Blok of Holland, those in favor of the National Front of Le Pen in France, is examples of parties or movements formed from the subject common of the aversion to the immigrants and the promotion of simplistic policies to control them.
<seg>Although the individuals as Jorg Haidar and Jean Marie Le Pen come and (never too much soon) go, the question of the race does not disappear of the European policy at no near moment.
<seg>The more and more old population in house and the abiertas borders more than ever, imply a racial fragmentation in the European countries.
<seg>The main parties of left center and right center have faced that prospectus having hidden the Earth head, sheltering vain hopes of which the problem disappears.
<seg>It will not do it, as clearly it shows the racial history of the United States (the USA).
<seg>The racial relations in the USA have in center been of the political debate per decades, and still they are, until the point of which the racial cracks are as important as the entrance, if not more, like determinants of the preferences and political attitudes.
<seg>The first step to face the racial policy is to understand the origin and the consequences of the racial animosity, even if it implies to reveal disagreeable truths.
<seg>That is indeed what a great amount of investigation in economy, political sociology, psychology and sciences has done for the USA.
<seg>That investigation sample that the people of different race trust others much less; the targets less are prepared to support the cost in well-being because it is considered that it favors to the minorities; the racially fragmented communities more have less efficient governments, more corruption and padrinazgo, more crime and less public goods productive by each dollar of taxes.
<seg>That does not mean that the answer is to eliminate the heterogeneity and to create racially homogenous communities, but makes lack recognize the reality of such questions to begin to construct solid public policies for the racial relations.
<seg>Clearly, the Americans do not agree about how doing this.
<seg>Some favor programs of affirmative action that give preference to the minorities for the allocation of works, the admission to the school and the contract granting public.
<seg>These policies are considered a form to offer repair by past injustices and, more important that, to create figures model (role models) and to control to the residual and perhaps involuntary discrimination.
<seg>Others are against the affirmative action and argue that a political blind person to the races, along with the policies of free market and the profamiliar values, is everything what makes lack to create works them minorities and to help to maintain the black families united.
<seg>This last one is crucial for any policy, because one of the most important causes of poverty in the USA is the propagation of homes of single woman parents (it entiéndase single woman mothers) in the black community.
<seg>Independent of which it is the correct answer, the point is that to determine what to do about the races is a dominant subject in the American policy.
<seg>Clearly, the minorities have progressed in the way towards a greater integration and economic success.
<seg>In the Fifties the black could not sit down in the front section of the buses, nowadays two of the most important people of the American external policy are black.
<seg>Without a doubt, the American politicians of right continue using the “racial letter” like a tactical tool.
<seg>We consider the case of Patrick Buchanan, the exasistente of Nixon and Reagan that became independent presidential candidate in the last elections.
<seg>He published a book that had acceptance recently, titleholder “The Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasion Imperil Our Country and Civilization” (the death of the West: how the dying populations and the invasion of the immigrants put in danger to our country and civilization).
<seg>But by each book since that are other ten that offers a serious analysis of the racial questions in the USA.
<seg>The analysis of policies and the debates about the racial relations are very slow in Europe.
<seg>The much those subjects they face little of open form, in terms of quotas of immigration and border restrictions, not in terms of the social problems and the opportunities created by a Europe more and more mixed racially.
<seg>Clearly, it is necessary to know a clearly policy of immigration to avoid the accumulation of illegal immigrants.
<seg>But that cannot be the end: the border controls with Mexico are not the end of the American policy towards the domestic racial problems!
<seg>Europe is rich and it is made old quickly; the European, accommodated in generous programs of well-being, no longer are preparations to accept “dirty works” in, we say, agriculture or the industry skinner.
<seg>This causes that he is inevitable to have an increase in immigration.
<seg>The European, nevertheless, are quick to criticize to the USA by any failure in their policy for the minorities and by any manifestation of racism through Atlantic.
<seg>When reading European press one often perceives a superiority complex towards the USA as far as the racial subjects: they, the Americans, have problems with racism; we are immune, except by rampant skinheads neonacistas and people of the style.
<seg>What it has happened in the last weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, sample that the racial problem in Europe is much more deep and, like in the USA, it is originated in the sad truth that the relations of races are inherently difficult and the confidence and the cooperative behavior do not journey well through the racial lines.
<seg>If the main parties of Europe do not invest more seriously in the understanding of the racial tensions in Europe and put to the “race” like one of their majors priorities, the individuals as Le Pen without a doubt tries to fill the emptiness with its message of hatred.
<seg>Against the French exceptions
<seg>The attention of Europe nowadays is centered, with reason, in the extension and the constitution that the members of the EU are designing.
<seg>But the result of several Gallic skirmishes with the European Commission will not be less important to determine the destiny of the new one and extended Europe.
<seg>France has decided to ignore, of unilateral way, the Pact for the Stability and the Growth, when incurring a predicted deficit enough over the limit of 3% of the GIP.
<seg>To the French they like to proclaim the rational rigor of their thought, but concerning deficits, Descartes yields their place to the confusion.
<seg>France was between critics main of Ireland when, in 2000, the Irish government reduced his budgetary surplus, that in that then ones was of 4% of the GIP, in as soon as a 0,5%.
<seg>Other countries have violated the Pact of Stability, but France is first that does with a abierta attitude of presumptuous challenge.
<seg>Nothing of the previous thing would have to sorpender to anybody.
<seg>France simply is applying to the rules of the EU its innate habit to consider to its own culture like exceptional.
<seg>For example, France consistently vetoes the reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU.
<seg>As the children even know to it, the CAP is beautiful and completely an unmerited gift for the rich European agriculturists (paricularmente the French) at the expense of the afflicted farmers of the developing countries and the consumers of the EU.
<seg>France also is trying to return to the old woman policies to rescue, with money of the contributors, to nonlucrative private companies on the verge of the collapse.
<seg>The Commissioner for Policies of Competition of the EU, Mario Monti, cannot lose this battle: he needs the support which creates in the markets and the equal treatment for all.
<seg>Here, the case is simple.
<seg>The French government thinks to rescue to Alstom, a company that developed to a series of high tech products, including the TGV, the French fast train, but that recently broke.
<seg>The French government maintains that never he will back down in his plan to rescue to Alstom, a plan with all the known motivations dirigistes: to maintain the use, to protect the investment, etc.
<seg>In addition, as Alstom is a high tech company, the French government resorts to the pretext of the investigation and the development, affirming that they are good for the growth.
<seg>To rescue to Alstom by means of the nationalization of the company obvious is bad.
<seg>The company is made up of different parts, some lucrative ones, some in bankruptcy: the obvious thing is to divide it.
<seg>The lucrative components, like the TGV, will find buyers with facility; the nonproductive plants would have to close themselves.
<seg>The money of the French contributors would be better employee in temporary benefits for the displaced workers whom in subsidies to maintain a nonlucrative plant lives.
<seg>It is important that the European Commission does not allow that France is applied special rules in competition policy, as it seems to be doing it with its budgetary deficits.
<seg>The Commission must prevent that public attendance to companies deprived in France occurs, since does with subsidies of that type in any other Member State of the EU.
<seg>The Commission already has been some successful in this scope, between which the salary forced to the German government stands out to cancel the governmental guarantees for the banks public.
<seg>Alstom in particular, and France generally, does not have to be the exception and they must fit the same landlords.
<seg>If the Commission does not act, the EU will still seem plus the park of diversions of the French officials government.
<seg>France always has assumed a role of leadership in the foreign policy of the EU, and the minister of outer subjects, Dominique de Villepin, every time seems more and acts more like the minister of outer subjects of Europe.
<seg>At the same time, France violates essential rules of the common economic policy and public aid to private companies.
<seg>Perhaps it will lose the European Commission what it has left of credibility to end up looking oneself like small arrondissement Parisian?
<seg>A defeat in the Alstom case would have serious consequences in Europe (and not only as far as competition policy).
<seg>The war by petroleum
<seg>During decades, through democratic and republican administrations, the United States has looked for a series of clear objectives of political energetics: to maintain as stable the prices world-wide of petroleum as is possible; to reduce hydrocarbon the internal consumption of the less painful way; to reduce the dependency of the imports whenever it is possible; and to diversify the imported petroleum sources.
<seg>In spite of the appearances, no of those objectives has changed under the administration Bush.
<seg>Many observers think that Bush has settled down a new course because the invasion of Iraq apparently goes against those objectives.
<seg>An important increase in the Iraqian petroleum production probably would increase the dependency of the EU towards petroleum, in relation to other power plants, perhaps since the world-wide prices of petroleum would fall as answer to the increase in the supply.
<seg>This would as well mean an increase in the dependency of the EU towards imported petroleum, particularly of the Middle East.
<seg>Nevertheless, the irony is that the EU Petroleum by foods” of the UN in force exerted a greater control on the Iraqian oil sector under the program “, before the war (in which that organization, nonSaddam Hussein, determined the level of sales of Iraqian petroleum to the outside), del that they will have under democratic Iraq in the future.
<seg>If the administration Bush had been looking for stable, safe, diversified and cheap petroleum sources, simply it could have raised the embargoes against Libya, Iran, Iraq and Sudan, to allow that petroleum flowed.
<seg>But the interest of the United States in Iraqian petroleum was not impelled by the economy or the political energetics.
<seg>The administration Bush recognized that, before nothing, Iraqian petroleum is a critical geopolitical resource.
<seg>Who it controls Iraqian petroleum will have the control of Iraq.
<seg>The power of Saddam was in its control on the second petroleum greater reserves of the world.
<seg>It understood perfectly what petroleum meant its power.
<seg>Before the possibility of the invasion and the defeat, Saddam threatened setting afire the oil deposits of the country.
<seg>Great part of the destruction and the sacking of the oil facilities that occurred later reflects that everybody understands that to control petroleum means to control Iraq.
<seg>When the EU was planning its invasion, to assure the oil deposits became a critical priority.
<seg>The goal was not to increase the supply or to reduce the prices for the Americans, but to prevail to Saddam of its power and, in the long run, to establish a new and solid Iraqian government.
<seg>The future on Iraq it depends directly on the destiny of the oil production of the country.
<seg>Nevertheless, the whims of the oil businesses, mainly in so unstable conditions, do not allow to see clearly how the administration will be able Bush to reach its goals in Iraq in the future near.
<seg>The logical one is simple.
<seg>The EU must use the oil income to clear to the American contributors the load to him to finance the change of regime in Iraq.
<seg>All the projects of reconstruction depend, in the long term, of the capacity of Iraq to export great amounts of petroleum.
<seg>If Iraq does not give petroleum, president Bush will not be able to fulfill his promises to the Iraqian town, the American town and the world-wide community.
<seg>Before the invasion, the capacity of Iraqian oil production reached the three million daily barrels.
<seg>Iraq will not be able to reclaim that level during the time that is needed to establish a new government.
<seg>Any increase in the production demands the development of the oil deposits, which implies great investments, a legal and representative government, and political stability.
<seg>Not even the administration Bush hopes that those conditions are fulfilled soon.
<seg>Indeed, the political stability is the main condition to increase the capacity of production.
<seg>The historical evidences of Iran, Kuwait, Russia, and the same Iraq, even indicate that they are needed around three years from the reestablishment of the political stability so that the capacity increases of significant way and maintains a level high.
<seg>Iraq needs several years to write up a new constitution, to establish a legitimate and democratic government, to negotiate the distribution of the oil income between its regions, to implement investment laws and to cause that the economy is attractive for the foreigners.
<seg>Also it needs time to negotiate with international the oil companies and their neighboring countries, to carry out technical studies and of viability, and to reconstruct, to rehabilitate and to explore its oil deposits.
<seg>Thus, a calendar of three years even seems optimistic, since it assumes that, during that period, the occupation will finish, the Iraqians will settle down their own democratic government and the political stability will be obtained.
<seg>It is not needed to say that the situation can be developed of different way.
<seg>The tensions could continue during years.
<seg>In addition, nobody would have even to be surprised if the petroleum production pauses completely, under a democratic government.
<seg>History suggests them strikes and other similar events that can interrupt the oil production are a greater threat in democratic countries that in that they are not it.
<seg>If Iraq cannot quickly increase its capacity of production in the future near, that will be an obstacle for the foreign policy and the energetics of the EU.
<seg>How they will finance the long term reconstruction of Iraq?
<seg>Who will pay to maintain a fragile democracy Iraqian?
<seg>They can the EU maintain its occupation if they are not able to give basic foods, attention to the health and other services to the Iraqian town?
<seg>Those are difficult questions, and essentially they will not be possible to be answered until a stable regime and democratic in Iraq can control and guarantee a continuous flow of oil exports.
<seg>When the assassins take care of the human rights
<seg>If not outside so absolutely sad, it would be without a doubt the joke of the millenium: Libya has been chosen to preside over the Commission of Human rights of the United Nations.
<seg>When Calígula appointed senator to its horse, the animal did not have blood in the hooves at least.
<seg>By all means, the procedure was perfectly legal: the broken presidency every year of a region from the world to another one.
<seg>This year was the turn of Africa to name the president, and named to Libya.
<seg>The only United States and Canada voted against.
<seg>For their eternal shame, the European countries abstained.
<seg>The one that this decision occurs in a while so delicate for the organization is revealing of the moral bankruptcy of the UN.
<seg>President Bush has challenged the UN that he shows his seriousness as far as his own decisions on Iraq; of another form he could have the same ignominioso end that Liga of the Nations, that was impotent in the Thirties when it faced the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany and facist Italy.
<seg>To choose to Libya to preside over the agency of the UN responsible for the human rights hardly aid to fortify the legitimacy and the moral authority of the world-wide organism.
<seg>We remember: Libya is a totalitarian tyranny; his leader, Moammar Kadafi, combine erratic behaviors with extremist policies, and support dictators anywhere in the world.
<seg>It heads one of the most repressive regimes, where there are at least simulations of no elections and where the dissidence is squashed immediately.
<seg>Under its government, Libya has supported terrorist organizations throughout the world (from the ERI to diverse Palestinian extremist groups).
<seg>It has been following under sanctions of the UN by its paper in the derribamiento of a flight of Pan Am in Lockerbie, Scotland, for ten years.
<seg>In the last decade, the position of the UN as symbol of the ideals of a Pacific world has been eroded.
<seg>He was totally incapable to stop the war in the Balkan Mountains, and in at least a case (Srebrenica), a Dutch force of peace of the UN stayed like simple spectator of the worse massacre in Europe after 1945, when the Bosnian Serbs assassinated to around 6.000 defenseless Muslim men.
<seg>A Dutch investigating commission admitted later that the Dutch battalion of the UN had been, in fact, accomplice of that crime military.
<seg>In Rwanda, when the genocide began, the civil servant of the UN responsible for the operations of maintenance of La Paz ordered the evacuation of the country of the forces of the organization, and so he left the field abierto for the bloodier genocida massacre from World War II.
<seg>The name of that civil servant is Kofi Annan.
<seg>It is a depressing and pathetic file that the UN is trying (probably in vain) to redeem when appearing in the crisis of Iraq like the voice of the reason and the international legitimacy.
<seg>But in a while in that them inspection of the UN in Iraq seems like commanding to the Army of Salvation to eliminate a band of gangsters, to elevate to Libya to the presidency of the Commission of Human rights it could happen to history as the definitive failure of an organization whose life began with so many hopes.
<seg>The organizations do not sulen to die, and certainly raison is much d'etat to make sure that the UN continues advancing, although is cojeando.
<seg>But it will be as soon as one shades than it would have, and could, to be.
<seg>Nowadays, hypocrisy is the mark of the UN.
<seg>Authoritarian to the doors
<seg>Last Thursday, the judges of the Central Court of Yakarta, sentenced me to Indonesia to a year of prison.
<seg>Like publisher in head of the Tempo Weekly Newsmagazine, I am guilty, according to the court, to defame an enterprise tycoon called Tomy Winata to insinuate its possible participation in a fire in the textile market of South-east Asiático de Yakarta and to promote disturbances spreading lies.
<seg>It will be that my case, and other similarities, foretell the end of another democratic experiment of short duration in Indonesia?
<seg>The “disturbances” that I supposedly fomented happened in March of the last year, when almost two hundred maleantes, that claimed to be following of Winata, attacked the offices of Tempo, threatened burning the building, harassed the personnel and hurt a reporter.
<seg>In order to try to solve the situation of pacific way, they convinced to me to negotiate in the central station of police of Yakarta, but I discovered, for my horror, that was in the hands of the leaders of the crowd.
<seg>They struck to me and they kicked to me while the police closed the eyes.
<seg>Luckyly, many journalists got to rescue with the recorders and the ignited cameras to us.
<seg>Their emissions brought about protests that forced our parliament to organize a public hearing.
<seg>The heads of the national police and Yakarta were summoned and, under an enormous popular pressure, the leaders of the crowd were accused penal.
<seg>Pero Winata evaded the police investigation declaring in public simply who their followers had acted without knew he it and without their consent.
<seg>It then presented/displayed his own penal positions, against Ahmad Taufik, who wrote the article, of Teuku Iskandar Ali, published that it, and of my person.
<seg>The judicial procedure that lasted a year was plagued of a series of suspicious events, all in favor of Winata.
<seg>First, the case that presented/displayed the police and the solicitor of the State contained documents that had been falsified so obvious that the police accused two officials.
<seg>But the court rejected our request to delay the process until the legality of the case of the State could be clarified.
<seg>The case against the involved officials seems not to be advancing.
<seg>On the contrary, one of them was promoted to direct recently created (with bottoms of the EU) Antiterrorist Unit of Yakarta.
<seg>Of the other one says that it was sent to the academy for the police personnel to receive advanced training.
<seg>Later, during the sixth month of the process, the president of the panel made up of three judges suddenly was promoted to head the court from a city to one hour of Yakarta.
<seg>One of my lawyers commented that in his 35 years of experience in courts never it had seen that they replaced a magistrate president during a judgment in course.
<seg>In fact, in spite of his ascent, the judge continued taking another case in the same enclosure.
<seg>A judge who previously had dictated sentence against Tempo in the civil demand of Winata held his position.
<seg>Finally, when Winata rendered its testimony, it committed perjury when denying that it had interviewed it to Tempo.
<seg>A recording of the telephone interview in the court reproduced, the reporter who made the interview and two publishers were present at who gave it sworn testimonies, the official registry of the telephone company appeared as it demonstrates of the call and an expert concluded that the voice in the recording was the one of Tomy Winata.
<seg>But the judges denied the request of Tempo to arrest and to judge to Winata by perjury they said and us that we gave warning to the police, something that we did.
<seg>Then the judges denied our request to pospone the decision of the court until the case of perjury against Winata was solved.
<seg>Given the so defective process, my sentence and my sentence it is not to be strange.
<seg>But I itself having the hope of which we will win in the end, when the courts superiors take care of the appeal presented/displayed by Tempo.
<seg>The courts of Indonesia are cleaner while more discharge is their hierarchy, and the President of the Supreme Court is a firm defender of the democracy and the freedom of press. The case of Tempo could become a victory that marks a landmark in our democracy, as it were it the famous decision of the Supreme Court of the EU in the case of The New York Times v. Sullivan.
<seg>When doing more difficult the accusations of defamation, that decision guarantees that the American journalists can cause that the officials government render accounts.
<seg>No country knows better than Indonesia than the freedom of expression and a free press indicating is proven of the democratic development and that to treat the criminal journalists as it is a first symptom of authoritarianism.
<seg>Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the Fifties, before president Sukarno, with the support of the military, would begin to repress to the press in 1956.
<seg>With the voices silenced critics, to consolidate a power without limit it was easier and, in 1959 July, Sukarno decreed the beginning of the “Guided Democracy”.
<seg>During the first years after the fall of Sukarno in 1966, all the advantages of the genuine democracy recovered, including the freedom of press (safe for the Communists).
<seg>But the regime of president Suharto initiated a new repression against the press at the beginning of the seventy, and in the end it prohibited several means and it jailed to many journalists.
<seg>With the press under control, other political rights quickly were restricted and the democracy of Indonesia returned to fail.
<seg>From the fall of Suharto in 1988, Indonesia has become the third greater democratic country of the world and the greater Muslim democratic community of history.
<seg>There have been two parliamentary elections and two direct presidential elections - including the last fight presidential-that have been abiertas, right and pacific, which demonstrates that the Islam and the democracy can coexist.
<seg>Nevertheless, the enemies of the democracy never rest.
<seg>Islamic radical groups have participated in indiscriminate attacks, whereas groupings with strong authoritarian tendencies have penetrated in the intimate circle of president Megawati.
<seg>But Mrs Megawati finishes being defeated in its attempt of re-election.
<seg>Perhaps recently elect president Susilo will continue accusing the journalists?
<seg>Perhaps my sentence and the judgments and sentences of other journalists, will indicate the principle of the aim of the third democracy of Indonesia that as much work cost?
<seg>The answer is in the support that the activists in favor of the democracy in the country are able to generate internamente as much as at international level.
<seg>To lose Indonesia - a potential light of hope for all the activists in favor of the democracy of the Muslim community world-wide-would be a terrible defeat.
<seg>The morality of the capital punishment
<seg>Often criticism to the United States to refuse to abolish the capital punishment.
<seg>Many affirm at the moment that the abolition of the capital punishment is precondition of a civilized penal legal system.
<seg>The Nobel prize Gary Becker does not agree.
<seg>The European governments firmly are against the capital punishment --the European Union prohibits it completely-- and some European consider that its use in the United States is cruel.
<seg>Indeed, many European intellectuals maintain that not only the capital punishment but the punishments generally does not dissuade the criminals.
<seg>But whereas the European, with rates of criminality very below the Americans during the last half century, could relatively occur the luxury of being “soft” with the majority of the crimes, they have seen an abrupt increase of its rates of criminality in the last twenty years.
<seg>However, the American rates have decreased, had to a greater use of the punishments partly.
<seg>This includes the capital punishment.
<seg>I support the execution of some people the condemned by homicide because --and only because-- I believe that he avoids other murders.
<seg>If I did not believe would oppose that me to the capital punishment, because the revenge and other possible reasons do not have to be the base of the public policies.
<seg>The serious empirical studies on the capital punishment in the EU began with a pioneering study of Isaac Ehrlich published in 1975 in the American Economic Review.
<seg>Some later studies have found much more weak an effect dissuasive, whereas others have stated one much more hard.
<seg>Nevertheless, the data available enough are limited, so that any conclusion is not due to base exclusively on the econometric evidences.
<seg>Naturally the public policies concerning any punishment cannot wait for until the evidences are perfect.
<seg>But, even with the limited quantitative evidences available, there are reasons to think that the capital punishment dissuades.
<seg>The majority of the people, and the assassins in particular, fear to the death, mainly when a considerable certainty arrives with speed and after a murder is committed.
<seg>As Hume said to David when speaking on the suicide, “nobody rejected its life while it was worth the pain to live it.
<seg>So it is our natural terror to the death… “Similarly, Schopenhauer thought that “as soon as the terrors of the life arrive at the point in which they are superiors to the terrors of the death, a man will end their life.
<seg>But the terrors of the death offer a considerable resistance… “
<seg>Who are against the capital punishment they frequently affirm that the State does not have the moral right to clear the life to him to anybody, including the worse one of the assassins.
<seg>Despite that it is a conclusion totally mistaken for that believes that the capital punishment dissuades.
<seg>In order to see why, we suppose that by each executed assassin (instead of the condemned to perpetual prison, for example) the number of murders is reduced by three, that is a number far below to those of Ehrlich and other calculations of the dissuasive effect.
<seg>This implies that by each executed assassin three innocent victims would not die.
<seg>In fact, the government would indirectly be contributing “to clear” many lives if he did not use the capital punishment.
<seg>To save three innocent lives by each executed person seems to be a good compensation, and two lives even saved by execution it seems to be a convincing rate of cost-I benefit for the capital punishment.
<seg>Nevertheless, it is certain that the arguments in favor of the capital punishment become less clear as the number of lives saved by execution falls.
<seg>But, itself a life by execution would even be saved, the option could continue being desirable if the saved life is far better that the cleared life, that would generally be the case.
<seg>Many people are against to compare the quality of the saved life and the cleared life.
<seg>Nevertheless, I do not see how avoid such comparison.
<seg>We consider a race delinquent that a victim robs and kills who took a decent life and that leaves to several children and a wife.
<seg>We suppose outside that possible to save the life of an innocent victim when executing to that delinquent.
<seg>For me it is obvious that to save the life of the victim it must merit more than to clear the life to him to the delinquent.
<seg>Evidently, all the cases are not so clear, but the comparison of the qualities of the individual lives must comprise of any reasonable social policy.
<seg>This aid to explain why the capital punishment is only due to use in cases of murder and not of misdemeanors.
<seg>When one is to choose to clear lives and, we say, to reduce the robberies, the arguments in favor of less severe punishments are much more solid.
<seg>Although the severe aggressions, including some terrible violations, can approach the severity of certain murders and could justify the capital punishment, I I do not support their use in those cases.
<seg>A powerful argument in favor of reserving the capital punishment for the assassins is the “marginal dissuasion”.
<seg>If the aggressions were punished with the execution, the delinquents would have an incentive to kill their victims in order to avoid they discovered that them (what constitutes an important reason for which the severity of the punishments must generally be proportional to the severity of the crimes).
<seg>A complication is that the capital punishment can cause that the assassin fights with greater force to avoid his capture, which could lead to more deaths.
<seg>But, although the marginal dissuasion is important, I believe that the resistance of to be captured assassins, possibly at the cost of its own lives, is in truth a test that the delinquents fear to the capital punishment.
<seg>By all means the risk worries to me of executing an innocent.
<seg>My support to the capital punishment would be debilitated considerably if the rate of executions of innocents were as high as many affirm.
<seg>Nevertheless, I not as much believe that the process of appeal in the EU offers an enormous protection, against the erroneous sentences but against the illegal executions, so that there are very few documented cases, if there is some, of innocent people who have been executed.
<seg>And this process has reinforced much with the development of the identification based on the Mrs.
<seg>Again, the debate on the capital punishment is essentially a debate on the dissuasion (that can be reduced with prolonged appeals).
<seg>I understand that some people are skeptics as far as the evidences, although believe that they are mistaken as much on that as on the element of common sense of the question.
<seg>He is angustiante to clear the life to him to somebody, even to an assassin, but sometimes very disagreeable acts are required to avoid behaviors still worse than they end the life of innocent victims.
<seg>The town versus Putin
<seg>I helped to select to Vladimir Putin to succeed to Boris Yeltsin, the first elect Russian president democratically.
<seg>Since the structures of the KGB and the Mafia now govern Russia and manipulate their judicial system, it assumes that Yeltsin wanted to define who would be its successor to avoid legal processings in the future.
<seg>But who we selected to Putin we had the mission to find a person that continued the reforms of Yeltsin, not somebody who shielded him and to her family.
<seg>In fact, Yeltsin did not have any fear and she did not look for its personal survival, but the one of the democratic idea that she introduced in Russia.
<seg>Nevertheless, now that idea is threatened due to the successor whom it chose.
<seg>I do not deny my responsibility to have supported to Putin.
<seg>Nonéramos near friendly, but we worked together in situations critics, and I never doubted its sincerity.
<seg>Putin acts guidance by its convictions.
<seg>The problem is that these, including their belief that Russia only can prosper if is governed by a power originated in a single source, are erroneous.
<seg>This great error is taking to Russia to the political ruin.
<seg>By all means, nobody that holds a high position stops committing errors, even some fundamental ones, and this is particularly certain in boisterous periods.
<seg>Yeltsin was not an exception, but recognized he them.
<seg>For example, when one retired in the New Year eve of 1999 apologised to have initiated the war of Chechenia.
<seg>In resistance, Putin seems incapable to recognize and to admit its errors, and persists much in the implementation of a policy after its failure is evident for everybody.
<seg>One of the errors of Yeltsin was not to put the priorities at the top morals of its program of reforms.
<seg>Russia must have sorry of the estalinismo and the system Gulag of fields of forced work.
<seg>The whole nation, without exceptions, must have itself sorry, of the way as they have done it to the Germans from 1945.
<seg>This omission is important, since it allowed that little the happy belief of Putin in a central authority would lead to the recapture of the state on the part of the services of security.
<seg>In fact, a direct result of the national repentance by the era Gulag must have been the prohibition of the communist party and the disqualification of those who had worked in the KGB to exert political positions.
<seg>Although these political filters are a complex subject in the poscomunistas societies, where as much the victimización as the collaboration so is generalized and the limits among them are so blurred, could have been found a good solution, like in the Czech Republic.
<seg>Not to do anything it left to the undamaged Russian structures of security and with the capacity to carry out a political return, which at present have obtained.
<seg>The political resurrection of the structures of the KGB under Putin and its efforts to silence the dissent, once again has turned to Russia into a country of dissidents.
<seg>It is impossible to silence to the politicians and independent means without strangling the independent sources of financing, and for that reason the Kremlin de Putin is concentrate its attacks in thus called “oligarcas”.
<seg>The arrest and judgment of Mikhail Jodorkovsky were orchestrated indeed for this reason.
<seg>When eliminating the independent sources of financing, the services of security that dominate the Kremlin hope to destroy the independent political life in Russia.
<seg>Without independent bases of thought, a fear climate is holding fast.
<seg>But the fear not only degrades: it creates the conditions for an evil government.
<seg>Yeltsin understood of intuitive way that the fear and centralized and verticalista the decision making were not ways to govern a modern country, and consequently insisted on reforming the relations between the citizens and the state.
<seg>Putin still does not include/understand that a centralized political system is so incapable to include/understand and to correct errors now as were it at the Soviet time.
<seg>Putin, that is not a man well mannered, is taking to Russia, with a deep and sincere conviction, to the same disintegration that happened with the collapse of the Soviet state.
<seg>The town is beginning to realize this.
<seg>People see that the desire of Putin to create a modern and hard effective state cannot be made reality, since a modern state is governed not from above, but by an informed citizenship that forces its governors to recognize and to correct its errors.
<seg>Also Putin seems to suspect the impotence its regime.
<seg>This is one of the reasons so that Russia has become so aggressive with its neighbors, the Ukraine and Georgia, and seems to maintain a military presence in places like the Transdniéster, the separatist region of Moldova.
<seg>When sending its weight on its nearer neighbors, the Kremlin thinks that it can convince the Russians of his omnipotence.
<seg>Given the castrated thing that is the debate in Russia, and the ability of the Kremlin to manipulate the elections, a change of regime is the unique option for those who wishes to preserve the democratic idea in the country.
<seg>It does not have sense to cling to vain illusions.
<seg>Who are against Putin they must decide what they want and to declare that, if the regime does not rely on the constitution, they have the right to force it to she does that it, by any means that are necessary.
<seg>At present, the question of the power in Russia no longer can be decided solely in the ballot boxes.
<seg>Like in the Ukraine, the Lebanon and Kirguistán, will be decided in the streets.
<seg>Taxes and cost in India
<seg>Too high a tax level can reduce the incentives and obstruct the growth.
<seg>But a level too much under can give the same result.
<seg>The governments with little fiscal income cannot provide to services basic public.
<seg>Worse still, the little fiscal income in the poor countries are frequently the result of defects in the systems of collection of taxes (more than of the low tax rates) that also promote the little productivity in the companies.
<seg>India illustrates the importance of a system of good collection of taxes designed.
<seg>In Bangalore, the high tech companies have constructed to facilities of international quality with well-taken care of meadows good and communications networks of high speed.
<seg>Nevertheless, outside these facilities there are abiertos drainages, sweepings without collecting and streets in terrible state.
<seg>Whereas the technology companies very instantaneously transmit terrabytes from information to remote continents, the local transport works to an almost medieval rate.
<seg>Like result, the companies in Bangalore have their own services of buses, contract deprived potable water suppliers and install generators to protect themselves of the interruptions in the electrical provision.
<seg>The State cannot fix the disaster because it is bankrupted.
<seg>The governmental debt of India is of more of 70% of the GIP, so that more than half of his fiscal income they are dedicated to the payment of interests.
<seg>But the debt is not consequence of an excessive cost in the past.
<seg>The governmental cost of India is of approximately 15% of the GIP, in comparison with an average of around 40% of the GIP in the OECD.
<seg>Rather, the financial difficulties of India arise from a tax system badly designed and badly administered.
<seg>The rates and the rules for the taxes to the personal and corporative entrance are reasonable under international criteria.
<seg>Nevertheless, the government of India collects taxes to the entrance that hardly arrive at approximately the 3,7% from the GIP, more or less half than they perceive Asian South Korea and other tigers.
<seg>Agriculture in India represents around 25% of the GIP, but not even the rich agriculturists pay taxes.
<seg>The companies oriented to the export in the industry of software and others enjoy fiscal privileges, although their employees yes pay to taxes envelopes their personal income.
<seg>Although the rates are reasonable, the evasion is generalized.
<seg>That happens because the government has not invested in personnel or systems to detect to the fiscal evasores, that rarely go to the jail and often they can give bribes to leave the jam they manage when them to catch.
<seg>Of subtler way, the evasion of “the direct” taxes on the entrance and the gains reflect the disorder in the system of “indirect” taxes on the production and the consumption.
<seg>The tax to the consumption represents more of 60% of the indirect taxes of India, which is the same proportion of its total fiscal income as well.
<seg>The basic tax to the consumption pays attention to 16% of the value of the production of a company.
<seg>Later there are several concessions, exemptions and surcharges.
<seg>For example, a “rate of concessionary rights” of 8% to headings like nutritional products, the matches, the spinnings of cotton and the computers is applied.
<seg>Additionally, a “special tax of consumption” (IEC) of 8% to products is applied that include polyester filaments, automobiles, air conditioners and tires.
<seg>Also a “additional tax of consumption” (IAC, not to confuse with the IEC) to “products of special importance” is applied.
<seg>The exemptions of the tax to the consumption are numerous and complex, and include to companies with total annual income of less than 10 million rupias and companies located in conflicting or slow zones.
<seg>Altogether, the exemptions are divided in 70 categories, subdivided in 259 games, 52 conditions and seven lists, each one of as it contains several articles.
<seg>The exemptions invite to the abuse.
<seg>By an amount of money, it is possible to be convinced to the civil servants of low level, who have a considerable discretion to apply the conditions, of which they make interpretations favorable.
<seg>The merchandise with high rates (for example, the polished granite) are sold like merchandise with smaller rates (for example, like granite without polishing).
<seg>The evasion of the tax to the consumption is more contagious than the evasion of the taxes to the entrance and the gains.
<seg>If a company evades the taxes to the consumption and the tax rate high is compared with the margins of gain before taxes of its industry, their competitors also must do it, simply to survive.
<seg>As the evasion increases, the governments impose additional” or “special” rights “that generate more evasion.
<seg>The collection of direct taxes also is affected.
<seg>The bribe that is pleased to the collector of taxes to the consumption, the difference between the value of the polished granite and without polishing and the inexact information on the true income creates “black” bottoms that cannot be written down in the declarations of taxes.
<seg>Besides affecting the capacity of the State to provide to services basic public, the tricks to evade indirect taxes also discourage to the companies to adopt more productive technologies, than they require methods with operations on a large scale.
<seg>But, because it is easier to evade the indirect taxes operating several small units instead of a great one, the scale economies cannot be created.
<seg>It is worth to emphasize that in the industry of software, where all the units are free of the indirect taxes, the Indian companies operate on an efficient scale.
<seg>Could India emulate the example of China, where the rationalization of the indirect taxes in 1994 created the conditions for a great boom?
<seg>Or perhaps the governments of coalition of a vigorous democracy are not able to make such reform?
<seg>The last year, the government of the India, headed by the BJP, adopted legislation that ordered severe cuts in the budgetary deficit.
<seg>It named a special group to formulate the necessary changes in the policies of taxes and cost.
<seg>In July of this year, the group proposed, among other things, to increase the taxes (instead of to trim the cost) by means of the elimination of the majority of the exemptions of indirect taxes.
<seg>The new government of the India, headed by the Party of the Congress also seems to be in favor of those proposals.
<seg>If the Party of the Congress and the parties of make specific them to opposition, it will be a great advance to maintain the growth economic of the country and to dissipate the idea that the democracies cannot do what is needed to promote the development.
<seg>What has of bad with Turkey?
<seg>The 16 of December Orhan Pamuk, one of the most famous writers of Turkey, will appear before a court of Istambul to face the accusation “to insult the national identity” after to have shown in favor of a debate abierto on the Turkish genocide of 1.5 million of Armenian in 1915 and 1916.
<seg>Pamuk can face a sentence of three years in prison.
<seg>The attitude of Turkey to fine and to send to the jail to those who does not follow the line official confirms my opposition abrir negotiations on its entrance like member to the European Union.
<seg>In December of 1999, the European Council gave to Turkey estatus from member-candidate to the EU, implying that he would accede to the Union in a future and not specified date.
<seg>Later, the Council asked to the European Commission that if decided for October of 2004 Turkey had satisfied with sufficient way the political criteria - including the democracy, the empire of the law and the respect of the rights of the ethical minorities for its membership.
<seg>That decision was one of the last ones of the Commission of Romano Prodi, of who I was member.
<seg>Of their 30 members, 29 said that Turkey had satisfied the criteria sufficiently like advancing in the process.
<seg>I was the unique one in dissenting.
<seg>The own report of the Commission on Turkey, preparation by Günter Verheugen, that in that then was in charge of the extension of the EU, shaped my decision.
<seg>The document mentioned that in 2003 near 21,870 they presented/displayed requests from asylum to the EU, of which 2,127 were accepted.
<seg>In other words, the own governments of the EU recognized in 2003 that the Turkish government had persecuted to more than 2,000 of his citizens.
<seg>Meanwhile, the Commission published an advance report on Turkey that affirmed that the reforms continued, although to a smaller rate, under the government of moderate Islamic direction of Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
<seg>However, the report also raised serious apprehensions: they continued the violations to the human rights, including the torture; the influence of the military continued being too high; the freedom of expression was not fulfilled of universal way; nonMuslim the religious and cultural minorities underwent discrimination; and there was a no clear and sharp opposition on the part of the power to the violence exerted against the women.
<seg>There have not been many changes from the beginning of the conversations on the enter the EU, realised in October.
<seg>Beyond the present persecution to Pamuk, the unacceptable conducts abound.
<seg>In March of 2005, the police violently dispersed a manifestation that celebrated the Day the International of the Woman.
<seg>In May, the greater union of professors was prohibited to promote the education of the 14 million Kurds of Turkey in its own language.
<seg>In fact, the intolerance arrives until the highest positions of the Turkish government.
<seg>The minister of Outer Relations, Abdullah Gül, steeply cancelled a press conference in Copenhagen when he saw a Kurd journalist between the public and the Danish refused themselves to expel it.
<seg>These actions and attitudes widely justify my discord of October of 2004.
<seg>Nevertheless, even if they were surpassed, Turkey would not have either to be admitted in the EU, because it is not an European country.
<seg>The Christianity, the feudalism, the Renaissance, the Illustration, the democracy and industrialization have turned to us into which we are like European, but have not turned to the Turks into which they are.
<seg>So that I am not convinced that the reforms implemented in Turkey by the insistence of the European Commission continue after the country finally enters the EU.
<seg>In fact, I suspect that there will be a backward movement.
<seg>Still more, the entrance of Turkey would lead of inevitable way to the one of the Ukraine, Bielorrusia and Moldova, and perhaps the one of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
<seg>Certainly, the three first of these countries are European than Turkey.
<seg>Leaving of side the three republics of the Caucasus, but including the states that before formed Yugoslavia, the EU would happen to have near 35 members.
<seg>What type of Union would be that?
<seg>The EU is not simply a friendly club.
<seg>One is based on the freedom of movement of goods, services, capitals and people.
<seg>The Commission, like guardian of treaties of the Union, must protect these four fundamental liberties, which means that sometimes it must persuade and, if necessary, to force the Member States to change his laws.
<seg>The policy of Sweden on the alcohol, the law Volkswagen in Germany and the discrimination against the foreign investment funds in France is examples of cases that have made unpopular to the Commission.
<seg>But they were necessary.
<seg>For when I left the Commission, it had before me I wrap of 1,500 of these causes by infraction.
<seg>Briefly, to be member of the EU entails to have to accept sharp measures that would deeply affect the internal subjects of a state.
<seg>That will be impossible to do with so different members.
<seg>The EU would become victim than the historian Paul Kennedy it calls “imperial sobreextension.”
<seg>It would be diluted beyond the acceptable thing.
<seg>For that reason ex- French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing feared that its entrance ended up producing breaks in the EU and the German chancellor Helmut Schmidt declared that “the entrance of Turkey would be more than the EU could support.”
<seg>Nevertheless, the most solid reason to be against to the entrance of Turkey is a democracy question: the majority of the population of the EU simply does not want it.
<seg>The crisis in Bolivia, a failure of Latin America
<seg>After where is watched it, Bolivia is not a typical Latin American country.
<seg>After Haiti, it is the second poorer nation of the Western Hemishpere, and is even less stable, with a history marked by more than two hundred coup d'etats from its independence.
<seg>In a region with indigenous a past fort, but with a disarticulated and isolated present, Bolivia is, along with Guatemala, perhaps the unique country of Latin America where the indigenous towns constitute the majority of the population.
<seg>Their topography and ethnic distribution are generally autonomous, and they even act like separatist forces that threaten the national unit of ways more frightful than in any other country.
<seg>And, by all means, it is along with Paraguay the unique nation without access to the sea in the subcontinent.
<seg>So that the present Bolivian crisis to the rest of Latin America would be highly imprudent extrapolar.
<seg>He is too simplistic to generalize: the institutions in all the other countries are much more solid, the poverty (particularly the extreme poverty) is falling and, to a great extent, the battle by the natural resources has been solved.
<seg>Even in countries like Venezuela, with enormous reserves of petroleum and a government of traditionally nationalistic mentality, the status quo that allows the foreign investment in the power resources has survived almost eight years of government of President Hugo Chavez.
<seg>Although the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries, of Chiapas to the “Araucanía” and from the Amazonia to Ayacucho, in no country of Latin America it has represented a real threat national integrity.
<seg>So that the one of Bolivia it is not a crisis that foretells others in the region, nor the rotten “theory of dominated”, maintained so much by Lyndon Johnson as by the Che Guevara in the Bolivian case, it seems valid or moderately reasonable at least.
<seg>Nevertheless, the present crisis of this country is a signal of the “democratic deficit” that undergoes Latin America at present.
<seg>The elect governors have failed, for a reason or another one, in Bolivia, Ecuador and Haiti.
<seg>The democracy is absent or is incomplete in countries like Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua, and it is threatened for a reason or another one in Venezuela and Colombia.
<seg>No of these cases is identical to the others, since they include variable levels of risk, damage or reconciliation.
<seg>The question is what can be done about this situation, that contrasts remarkably with the stimulating perspective that predominated only years ago.
<seg>In the last assembly of the Organization of American States in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the United States took a good idea that others had had and, when supporting it, basically ended her.
<seg>History began a pair ago of years, when ex- Argentine minister of outer relations Dante Caputo and the Program of the United Nations for the Development were in charge of outlining the Report on Democracy in Latin America.
<seg>They reached the conclusion that an early system of alert about crisis of the democracy in the region would help to generate action before the things got to be outside control, as it happens today in Bolivia.
<seg>Caputo and the equipment of the UN convinced then Chilean president Ricardo Lagos to that it took the initiative promoted and it between several of its colleagues.
<seg>It did it, but the subject did not arrive very far.
<seg>In fact, the Report of the PNUD on Democracy in Latin America, published in 2004, it mentions as soon as it.
<seg>The United States and the new Secretary General of the OAS, the Chilean Jose Miguel Insulza, revived the plan during the encounter of the OAS in Florida, but it was rejected due to the reasonable Latin American fears of which the idea was directed against Venezuela, combined with the anachronistic distrusts of the countries of Latin America of which the sacrosanct principle of the nonintervention was violated.
<seg>Although the continent could not reach an agreement on the underlying principle to the proposal, the idea of a system of early alert deserves to receive attention.
<seg>At present, it is possible that it is little what the hemispherical community can do with respect to which it happens in Bolivia, and nevertheless the situation is pregnant of risks for all.
<seg>Evo Morales, leader of the opposition and the cultivators of cocaine leaf, can be an honest, although disoriented democratic leader, but lack their followers authoritarian desires?
<seg>Perhaps Hugo Chavez is not financing to Morals and the other Bolivian dissidents, but really Venezuela and Cuba have not been having the temptation inmiscuir in the country where the Che Guevara died trying to generate a war of guerrillas for almost 40 years?
<seg>The community of businesses of the Bolivian region of Santa Cruz can not make reality its threat separate of the country, but they will prefer to share its reserves of petroleum and gas with the indigenous towns of the plateau, instead of to do it with the Brazilian industrialists of Sao Paulo?
<seg>Before the events arrive at these ends, it could be a good one devises the one that the OAS (nonEE.UU.) became jumbled.
<seg>The region continues needing that participation, with a commitment opportune, message and based on an suitable democratic platform, that is distinguished of the traditional American intervention of the traditional Latin American indifference.
<seg>The deterioration of France?
<seg>The French are extremely sensible (even that is put to the defensive) as far as the stature of their country in the world.
<seg>The French State spends enormous amounts of money in the propagation of its language and its culture, and nevertheless, the French are painfully conscious that the global position of its country no longer is what sometimes was.
<seg>Not it is surprising, then, that during last elections presidential, publication of report of Commission European, that maintained that in economic France it had happened from the third party to the tenth place between the European countries in a lapse of ten years, has brought about examinations of brings back to consciousness and controversies. Shortly after, president Jacques Chirac accused his rival, Lionel Jospin, to bring about a “deterioration of France”.
<seg>The OECD and EUROSTAT, the European organ in charge of that data type, thought that they had ended that aspect of the controversy when demonstrating that France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain have the same standards of life approximately per capita.
<seg>But the most general debate did not yield.
<seg>Again they appeared the mentions on “the French deterioration” during the street protests of this year against the reform of the system of pensions, the increasing disputes on fiscal policy with the European Commission and the argument with the United States about the war in Iraq.
<seg>At the moment, the book better sold in France is an controversial work of Nicolas Baverez, the France qui tombe (France that falls).
<seg>The book of Baverez is full of appointments of De Gaulle and Napoleón.
<seg>In agreement with the author, the last great profits of France occurred in the Seventies, with the launching of the fast train, the TGV, and the Airbus.
<seg>It attacks so much Mitterrand as to Chirac by its “shared talent to gain elections and to make of France a failure”.
<seg>The success of the book is by itself symptom of a type of “frustration”.
<seg>But, of what type?
<seg>The degradation evidences that present/display Baverez are not as convincing as he creates.
<seg>For example, it indicates to the industrial deprivation of rank and privileges like the clearest test of the deterioration of France.
<seg>However, the desindustrialización is common to all the advanced countries.
<seg>In fact, to France it goes to him better than to the majority of his rich rivals and, unlike Germany, the United Kingdom or the United States, has conserved the same proportion of the world-wide market in the industrial sector that it had at the beginning of the Seventies.
<seg>In addition, according to a better indicator of the competitiveness, the foreign investment, to France goes to him very well.
<seg>In agreement with a recent report of the Council of Economic Analysis, the direct investment in France grew until arriving at 60 billions of Euros in 2001, almost the double that in Germany.
<seg>The competitiveness in costs of the country also improved (in 20%) in the three last decades, since a greater productivity has balanced the fast growth of the wages.
<seg>But the marrow of the economic problems of long term of France is indeed the fear to lose industrial uses.
<seg>France continues being a strong industrial power in traditional areas like automotive and the aerospace one, but it is falling behind in innovating markets, where smaller companies scatter new technologies.
<seg>For example, France only invests 30 billions of dollars to the year in investigation and development of high tech, in comparison with 51 billions of Germany, 98 billions of Japan and 265 billions of the United States.
<seg>In summary, the analysis of Baverez lays for the mistaken direction.
<seg>France has crossed by a series of reforms of critical importance throughout last the two decades: economic and financial liberalization, elimination of controls in the prices and the type of change, the end of the restrictions on the credit, the commercial reduction of the inflation and deficits, the arrival of the Euro and the forced globalisation of the companies of the country.
<seg>The French frustration does not have anything to do with any of them.
<seg>The problem with France is that it does not manage to recognize the new world del that already comprises.
<seg>The Capitalism of French State has died and to France work costs to him to accept its death.
<seg>Indeed, France has to be the unique country in which Prime minister, Lionel Jospin, feels the obligation to request excuses the day after to have said in television that “the State is not omnipotent”.
<seg>There are many reasons behind this French schizophrenia, but one of the main ones has to do with the political game of last the 20 years.
<seg>Until 1981, in France there was a clear division between the right and the left.
<seg>Since then, the administrations as much of Mitterrand as of Chirac moderated their ideological positions in order to carry out the difficult process of adjustment towards Europe and the globalisation.
<seg>A “therapy of shock” in the style of the Mrs
<seg>Thatcher for two decades could have forged a new one brings back to consciousness political, but slowness in reaching the consensuses to approve the reforms allowed that the French live in a world and think about another one.
<seg>This is one of the fundamental reasons that they explain the political cataclysm that exploded during the past presidential campaign, when the leader of the extreme right, Jean Marie Le Pen, arrived at the second round in the elections
<seg>The ascent of the extreme left, that obtained 10% of the voting in that presidential campaign, also is test of the political failure.
<seg>France needs a political revolution, than economic, if it wants to reconcile with the reality, a part which is more that the “French deterioration” is a fear that the own French have created.
<seg>The value of the European values
<seg>The European leaders have revived the constitutional talks that were interrupted in December last because of a dispute through the voting rights.
<seg>By all means, those disputes are subject to adjustments, that probably will be reached.
<seg>What still it is necessary to establish is a clear understanding than it looks for that the constitution obtains.
<seg>Two fundamental principles have propped up European integration: solidarity and the subsidiarity.
<seg>Both principles are in the crossing of the philosophy, the policy, the economy, sociology and the right.
<seg>They have been present during years in the legal and institutional marks of the European Union - in treaties, the Fundamental Bill of rights (it mentions that them in its introduction), and in the recent rough draft for the Constitution.
<seg>In summary, they comprise of the history and the ideals of the EU.
<seg>But, what really mean solidarity and subsidiarity?
<seg>We consider the solidarity, that is open to at least two interpretations: the static solidarity, that it only has to do with the distribution of the entrance and the wealth, and the amplest concept of dynamic solidarity, that also talks about to the production of entrance and wealth.
<seg>In the history of postwar period of European integration, dynamic solidarity as much had force in the first period (the one of the European Community of the Coal and the Steel) in its strategy of economic development (the reconstruction) like in treaties, in particular the Treaty of Rome.
<seg>That does not mean that dynamic solidarity was suppressed later: the European Monetary Union, for example, is another one of its expressions.
<seg>Thus, although some countries did not benefit immediately with the Euro accepted, it of all ways because they were convinced that in the long run it would have positive effects.
<seg>In other words, dynamic solidarity means to favor policies that promote the investment, the innovation, the economic growth and the use.
<seg>Nevertheless, as it indicates the growth of the GIP in the EU, dynamic solidarity has been debilitated in the last decade.
<seg>Most worrisome it is the delay in investigation.
<seg>The fulfillment of the call strategy of Lisbon, that the EU adopted in 2000, and which it promised to create the most competitive economy of the world is threatened by an increasing emphasis in the static solidarity, that is reflected in the high costs of the social security and in the lifted taxes that are needed to finance it.
<seg>The predominance of static solidarity must to a population that ages, that, combined to a slower growth, has generated fiscal imbalances structural.
<seg>One of the majors challenges for the future of the EU is to approach the superiority of directed static solidarity towards greater people on the dynamic solidarity that benefits the young people.
<seg>After all, the Union cannot allow that the consumption continues surpassing the investment necessary to guarantee the future prosperity.
<seg>The subsidiarity is similar to the concept of the solidarity in which also it has two interpretations: the vertical subsidiarity and the horizontal subsidiarity.
<seg>The vertical subsidiarity is related to the distribution of the power between the different levels of government and sovereignty: the national EU, States, the regions and the municipalities.
<seg>The most well-known application of this principle is federalism.
<seg>In European treaties we can find a clear expression of the vertical subsidiarity.
<seg>But, perhaps it is sufficient to give capacity to the institutional and constitutional adjustments that are emerging in the Union?
<seg>The horizontal subsidiarity has to do with the responsibility and the freedom of the human being, and the social and economic forces.
<seg>It includes the relations between the State, the society and the market.
<seg>But the society and the market have their own right and sovereignties, that are not granted by the State.
<seg>Thus, the problem is in guaranteeing the autonomy of each scope.
<seg>An example of horizontal subsidiarity is the European internal market, that created a new type of economic freedom and increased to the competition between companies when eliminating the protection that to them the national governments offered.
<seg>The horizontal subsidiarity means that, as much in the social thing as in the economic thing, the State cannot violate the individual freedom and the responsibility, that must be respected to the greatest possible extent.
<seg>Also it means that a “power superior” must support when the individual freedom and the responsibility are not sufficient to reach necessary means after the human dignity.
<seg>Nevertheless, that support is due to implement so that it promotes the natural potential of the individuals, the society and the market.
<seg>But that is only possible when the paper of the horizontal subsidiarity clearly is defined, which does not happen in European treaties, the Fundamental Bill of rights or the works of the European Convention.
<seg>Summary, solidarity has become redistribution instead of growth (that is the way in which the present generation expresses its solidarity with the future generations more), whereas the subsidiarity has gotten to mean the distribution of the political power, than a careful boundary of the borders between State, civil society and the market.
<seg>Nowadays, the definitions of both values favor to the State.
<seg>Indeed, to focus in the growth based on the market is identified frequently with the semi-other people's values of the United States.
<seg>But those values are deeply ingrained in Europe, and is necessary to remove them in the light of new.
<seg>The EU must restore its economic vitality by means of a solidarity model and subsidiarity that is more balanced in favor of the market and society, and that reduces the socio-economic influence of the State.
<seg>The institutions of the State must provide public goods (like defense, justice and monetary fiscal policy and), the society must offer to corporate properties (like culture, education and attendance to the needed ones) and the market must provide economic goods (that are related to the gains, the growth and the use).
<seg>In the 21st century, Europe must reconsider the value of both principles (solidarity and the subsidiarity) if it wants to reach the historical goal of integration: the freedom and the well-being necessary to surpass the political differences and divisions that brought about the tragedies of century XX.
<seg>That is the spirit with whom the European Constitution is due to write up.
<seg>The policy of the values
<seg>The debate on the American elections has not lessened.
<seg>How managed President George W. Bush to obtain three million votes more than the Senator John Kerry and, in addition, an elect republican majority in both cameras of the Congress?
<seg>There is no agreement in the answers, but two subjects are repeated in many of the explanations.
<seg>One is the personality.
<seg>In the days of uncertainty and it threatens, the people had more confidence in the president who knew that in the candidate who had still not put itself on approval.
<seg>The second subject is the values.
<seg>People voted more by a value group than by specific policies.
<seg>Indeed, some (it is said) were in agreement with the policies of Kerry, but anyway they gave its vote him to Bush because they felt “to taste” with its general attitude.
<seg>It is clear that the United States at the moment deeply is divided in electoral terms.
<seg>An arc of blue states (democratic) in the east, north and the west surrounds an enormous red area in center (republican) and the south.
<seg>Still more, the divisions reproduce at local level.
<seg>No longer it is necessary to draw up the limits of the electoral districts to benefit in particular to some political party.
<seg>People in fact tend mudar to zones where the majority shares its values, or are republican or democratic.
<seg>Which are exactly those values?
<seg>They have to do, or that is what we listened, with “God, arms and gays”.
<seg>The religion plays a role, including the literal truth of the bible concerning the history of the creation.
<seg>The possession of a weapon is the last test of individualism, and to use arms in wars is not loathsome.
<seg>“The modern” practices gay and another practices are rejected by excessive.
<seg>As Andrew raised the political scientist recently Hacker: “the candidacy of Bush was elaborated to reach a majority being given him to about 60 million people the opportunity to feel well with themselves”.
<seg>Perhaps is all this a American phenomenon, or has similar tendencies in other parts?
<seg>An answer is that like American phenomenon, the policy of values can have majority now, but of no way is general.
<seg>Europe and other parts of the world equal of are divided.
<seg>The personality without a doubt matters, and below the political differences also abiertas it can have questions of values that have not arisen to the surface.
<seg>But the political differences traditional cradles in the discord on fundamental values play a decreasing role in the elections.
<seg>For example, Prime minister Tony Blair, the next important leader that he will face elections uses the argument of the personality and speech of policies, but he mainly represents a value group of middle-class.
<seg>When it speaks of “modernization” or “to take the things to the 21st century”, it manages to insinuate a strange but attractive mixture of change and stability.
<seg>That has left to the preservative opposition without an effective answer.
<seg>Even subjects as the fiscal cuts and stricter laws of asylum do not get to reach fibers of the values that the Republican Party of the United States has managed to touch.
<seg>The panorama is similar in Germany, where the abierta influence of the policy of S-values still smaller.
<seg>The German debate continues being to a great extent a debate of policies.
<seg>When the opposition offers to the government talks more recently on the reform of the health system or on the combat to unemployment, the underlying competition is on capacities, more than on values.
<seg>Nevertheless, below the battlefields common of the political debate in England and Germany and other places of Europe the shocks of values roam.
<seg>The parties fight by those to those who it is possible to be caused that “they feel well with themselves”, perhaps but they do not realize totally of which this only partly is question of policies.
<seg>It is not probable that the religion becomes a central factor of the European policy; the surveys show that the religious observance is one of the few great differences between European Americans and.
<seg>The arms also have a different place in the European mind; what the European consider important is its absence.
<seg>Also a gust of wind of pacifist values in the continent is unmistakable.
<seg>But the subject of the politically correct thing (“gays”) also plays until now an underestimated role.
<seg>Most important it is than same Europe divides to the European, as the “national question” arises in each State of the continent.
<seg>It is a subject of values, inspired by the fear.
<seg>People want to know to where she belongs, and in that process they become against the United States and towards Europe or against Europe and towards its country.
<seg>Anyway, we left the scope of the policies, and of the policy and even entered to the turbid dominions of the symbols and myths.
<seg>This, in any case, it is the main risk that the democratic countries face, since the policy of the S-values something dangerous.
<seg>It reintroduces fundamental divisions in societies whose greater democratic profit was indeed to eradicate the fundamentalism of the policy.
<seg>An illustrated public debate must be a dispute on policies framed in a community of values.
<seg>Therefore, to insist on it is a primary target of the policy of the freedom.
<seg>The era of the interests comes near
<seg>One swallow doesn't make spring, and a month of normal growth of the use and the prices in the United States does not mean that the Federal Reserve no longer is worried about the economic malaises and deflation.
<seg>But the day will arrive in which the world-wide interest rates begin to raise, as the central bankers prepare themselves to resist the slow tendency to the rise of the inflation.
<seg>When that day arrives - or it is the next autumn, in 2005 or 2006 or United 2007-State and the global economy will face financial vulnerabilities product of the success that in the last three years has had the monetary stimulation to stop reductions in the production and to moderate unemployment.
<seg>The short term interest rates are amazingly low: of as soon as 2% in the zone of the Euro, 1% in the EU and zero in Japan.
<seg>The expansionistic monetary policy has been successful, but only in which it is called on to reduce the interest rates to historically low levels - and to convince the investors that the costs of the credits will stay at their present levels during a long time.
<seg>The main result of the monetary stimuli has been to lift the prices of the fixed assets: any thing that produces yields, dividends or rents is much more attractive - and by the same, much more valuable in terms of money - when the interest rates are very low and it hopes that they follow thus.
<seg>That explains the great breaches that exist between the present prices of real estate in the EU, the actions in New York, London and Frankfurt, and bonds in the long term everywhere, and what one would consider normally that they are his fundamental values.
<seg>What will happen when the banks begin to lift the interest rates?
<seg>In 1994, the increases in the short term rates brought about increases in those of long term - and fallen in the prices of bonds in length term-of at least the double than the common models they predicted then.
<seg>In addition, the interest rates in the developing peripheral economies grew much more that those of the advanced industrial nucleus.
<seg>Thus, the first danger about which is to worry in future about 2005 - when it is more probable that the interest rates elevate-are another wave of financial crises of the emergent markets.
<seg>For countries like Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the file of the Nineties demonstrates that the differentials of the interest rates can be extended and the capital flows can be reverted extraordinarily fast, without mattering that the civil servants of the IMF and the analyses of the most important banks see with good eyes the policies of a country.
<seg>The differentials of the interest rates of the emergent markets nowadays are abnormally low.
<seg>The international flows of capital - without including those that arrive at the USA-still they are not at the level that is associated with the “irrational exuberance”, but still is time so that happens before the interest rates begin to raise.
<seg>This is an alarming perspective, because the lesson that the ninety left us was that nobody must overestimate the stability of international the financial flows.
<seg>The second danger is derived from the lifted value of the goods in the advanced industrial nucleus.
<seg>The current of dominant thought in the Federal Reserve - with which I am of agreement-seems to be that the computer science-technological revolution follows, that the rate of growth of the potential production in the EU still is very accelerated and that, therefore, the production breach is relatively ample.
<seg>It implies that, in fact, it will be necessary that the interest rates remain low during a considerable period.
<seg>In addition, the confidence in the Federal Reserve is high and the last vestiges of the premiums of inflationary risk have been extracted of the interest rates.
<seg>Like result, after the production levels even return to their potential, the interest rates will continue being low in agreement with the standards of the eighty and the ninety.
<seg>All that, by all means, they are the good news for those who own assets like long term bonds, action and real estate.
<seg>Indeed, to lift the long term prices of the goods was exactly the objective to reduce the interest rates: after all, to make to the possesors of bonds and mainly to the proprietors of real estate richer is a stimulus for the cost.
<seg>But the bad thing is that even if hopes that the interest rates remain low during a time, they will not stay so low indefinitely.
<seg>The case is that when the interest rates rise, the value of the goods will fall.
<seg>In those periods - particularly when the value of the assets falls of fast way and substantial-we can realize ability exactly of our central bankers to fulfill its main work: to reduce financial volatileness and to promote the economic stability.
<seg>Also at those times we noticed of the amount of people who have long term bonds, real estate or action not because they consider that the present prices are attractive in relation to the economic foundations but because their prices have been increasing years in the last.
<seg>That is a crucial question for the designers of policies, because that they acquired goods of long term due to which it seemed to be a permanent increase of the prices are the same that will be to sell as soon as the prices give samples to be backing down.
<seg>In particular, the commercial deficit of the EU glimpses like an enormous source of instability if the prices of the long term goods fall of significant way.
<seg>Certainly the challenges to that the designers of economic policy of the world will face during the next years will be different from which has faced from the collapse of the bubble of NASDAQ.
<seg>Perhaps the risks associated with the inflation are less dangerous than those than generate the fall of the production and the threat of deflation.
<seg>But, as we learned in the ninety, that does not mean that the future challenges are going to be easier to handle.
<seg>The opposed futures of the United States
<seg>Recently I knew something interesting: the American economists of international finances and the oriented American macroeconomists to the local analysis of EE.UU have very different visions (in fact, opposed) on the probable consequences of the enormous deficit of current account of EE.UU.
<seg>The economists of finances internments see probable that in the United States it happens a financial crisis, followed of a perhaps prolonged painful recession and.
<seg>The macroeconomists oriented to the local analysis, in resistance, see the imminent fall of the value of the dollar not like a crisis, but like an opportunity to accelerate the growth.
<seg>In general terms, they see the situation of the following way: in some point of the future, the foreign central banks less will be prepared to continue buying great amounts of values denominated in dollars with the purpose of to prop up paper money.
<seg>When their programs of purchase of dollars in great scale finish, the value of the dollar will fall… and fall strong.
<seg>Nevertheless, according to this vision, as declines the value of the dollar the American exports they will be become more attractive for the foreigners, the use will be fortified and manpower to the exporting sector will be reincorporated, that will live a new stage on height.
<seg>It will be like which it happened in England after it left the anchorage of his type of change and allowed that the pound was depreciated with respect to the German mark, or what it happened in the United States by the end of years 80, when the dollar was depreciated in front of the pound, the German mark and (what is more important) the Japanese yen.
<seg>The economists of the international finances see a shady future much more.
<seg>They see that the aim of the programs of purchase of dollars in great scale of the central banks will mean not only a declivity of the dollar, but also a rise in the interest rates of long term of EE.UU., that will restrain the cost of consumption immediately and will drown the cost of investment after a small retardation.
<seg>Doubt that does not fit the economists of the international finances also see that the American exports will benefit as the value of the dollar lowers, but the retardations in the demand are after the loss in the cost of such that the exporting impulse will happen a year or two consumption and investment.
<seg>Eight to ten million people will have to change of use, happening of the sector services and the construction to the sectors related to the exports and the goods that compete with the imports, which implies that it will increase unemployment structural.
<seg>Still more, it can have a financial panic: the great financial institutions with debts of short term and assets of long term will be seen in difficulties against a great increase of the denominated interest rates of long term in dollars.
<seg>This disparity can cause to financial tensions and bankruptcies of as easy way as the debts of short term in dollars and the assets in local currency of caused them to the banks during the Mexican crises and of the Asian east in years 90, and the Argentine crisis in the present decade.
<seg>When the economists of the international finances describe this scene, the macroeconomists oriented to the local analysis of EE.UU respond that she sounds to a case of incompetent monetary policy.
<seg>Why the Federal Reserve would have to allow that the interest rates of long term only had a great rise because other central banks have finalized their programs of purchase of dollars?
<seg>It would not have to that way take part and to replace them with its own treasury bond purchases of EE.UU., maintaining the interest rates of long term in a level that leads to the total use?
<seg>To this, the economists of the international finances respond that the Federal Reserve does not have the power to make such thing.
<seg>If one commits them to choose between the total use and the stability of the prices, the economists of the international finances say that the Federal Reserve will choose the stability of the prices, since its institutional memory of years 70, when the inflation went to clouds, continues being very strong.
<seg>Therefore, since a fall in the value of the dollar increases the prices of the imports and  it works like a negative blow next to the supply in the economy, the Federal Reserve will have to lift, not to fall, the interest rates and to sell bonds instead of to buy them.
<seg>In both sides of this debate there are serious economists to those who respect enormously.
<seg>I am not sufficiently wise as to say which is the correct side, but certainly know which I hope that it is been mistaken.
<seg>The gudgeons of Europe
<seg>In the United States, the states that they have inadequate fiscal policies face a punishment.
<seg>Their bonds are sold with a discount in relation to those of the states better administered.
<seg>The lifted service more of the debt that they must pay works --in certain degree-- as a form of discipline against the temptation to spend now and to pay later.
<seg>By all means, the discipline of the market is not perfect: the bond market to a great extent “does not see” implicit future liabilities (like the payments promised by pensions).
<seg>Nevertheless, this forced fiscal discipline, along with the own budgetary procedures interns of each state, has avoided that on a large scale occurs a fiscal crisis at state level in the EU from the Great Depression.
<seg>We see the case of Europe now.
<seg>Before the adoption of the Euro there were many fiscal crises in the States nation of the south of the continent, that produced swelling of high inflation.
<seg>But with the establishment of the unique currency the way for the solution of the financial crises by means of the inflation was closed, since now the European Central bank (BCE) watches the monetary policy.
<seg>However, even though the States nation no longer can resort to the inflation to solve their financial imbalances, the unique currency allows them to use the indebtedness capacity that properly belongs to him to other members of the European Union to prolong its adventures of cost and to pospone the surrender of political accounts by its periods of laissez them bons temps roulés.
<seg>In order to avoid this possibility, the EU created the Pact of Stability and Growth: the governmental deficits had to be smaller to 3% of the GIP.
<seg>The last week, the government of Germany --that sometimes it was the Member State of the most prudent and disciplined EU-- it broke the rules of the pact on fiscal discipline by fifth consecutive year, it did and it without (great) excuses.
<seg>The minister of finances, Peer Steinbrueck, indicated that he hoped that the European Commission imposed some penalty to Germany. It said that if some measurement were not taken, the credibility of the pact would be in risk.
<seg>Therefore, Germany would not block the sanctions in this occasion, it did since it two year and a half ago.
<seg>Pero Steinbrueck also made clear that it hoped that the sanctions in response to the anticipated fiscal deficit of Germany of the 3,4% of the GIP were to a great extent symbolic, and nonpunishments that cost to their government or his economy great thing to him.
<seg>The Pact of Stability and Growth is not working --or at least not still-- nor remotely as it were tried it did that it.
<seg>And the discipline of the market?
<seg>Is limited the will of the German government to emit more debt and perhaps to have deficits majors because the market recognizes and punishes to the States nation that allow that their fiscal positions are debilitated?
<seg>In a word, no.
<seg>The interest rates of the denominated sovereign debt in Euros of the twelve governments of eurozona are very similar.
<seg>For this reason, to the market it seems not to matter to him that the countries have different potentials to generate exports that finance the financial flows necessary to pay the debt, or different relations debt present and anticipated - the GIP.
<seg>Willem Buiter of the University of Amsterdam and Ana Sibert of the University of London thinks that it has been the disposition of the BCE to accept, indeed, all the debt of eurozona like guarantee which has undermined the disposition of the market to act like in charge to cause that there is fiscal prudence.
<seg>While a marginal part of the German debt is used as guarantee for a loan of short term or as the base in an agreement of repurchase to obtain liquidity, it is much more probable that its value is determined by the terms in that the BCE accepts the guarantees that by its foundations.
<seg>The treatment that now gives the BCE all to those debts as powerful sources of reserve liquidity ruin any analysis of the differences of the sovereign risk of long term.
<seg>In the long run, that is dangerous.
<seg>As much the discipline of the market as the fiscal administration is necessary to create a reasonable opportunity to obtain stability of prices in the long term.
<seg>If the punishments of the market for a behavior are omitted that can be returned reckless or the institutional handles that give voice to the future generations, run serious risks --perhaps not today or tomorrow, but someday and by the rest of our lives.
<seg>As the time happens, the arrival of the unique currency and the form in which the Euro has been implemented are generating more and more restlessness.
<seg>The policy as a whole in all the eurozona is too deflationary.
<seg>The transferences are not becoming necessary so that the common currency is bearable in the regions that leave losing and that already are in recession when the BCE makes the policy more restrictive.
<seg>The institutional foundations of a stable fiscal policy of long term are eroding.
<seg>And now, Buiter and Sibert argue of convincing way, the BCE is giving to the market less margin del than it would have to have to award to which they save and to punish to that they waste.
<seg>Still there are no ground movements, and there will be no them during some time.
<seg>But the Earth under the Euro could begin to shake if the things do not change.
<seg>Milosevic and Hussein: the farce like judgment
<seg>The judgments of the criminals military used to be a serious subject.
<seg>We remember the photographies of Herman seated, taciturn Goering and Rudolf Hess, in the bench in Nuremberg.
<seg>Some Nazi leaders were even hung after relatively short but right judgments.
<seg>At the moment, the legal processes against the evilest leaders of the world have become a farce.
<seg>The judgment of Saddam Hussein and its partisans of the Ba'ath party are an interminable series of shames.
<seg>The defendant use one treta after another one and Hussein shows his scorn of all the possible forms.
<seg>It is difficult to wait for a result that is legitimate to eyes of the Iraqians or the world.
<seg>Meanwhile, the judgment of Slobodan Milosevic became funeral after four years of boring testimonies and a cost of more than 200 million dollars.
<seg>In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government have been almost ten years titubeando on the form to take in opinion to the surviving members of the Khmer Rouge.
<seg>The assassins of masses that took the power in century twenty were condemned to die in popular revolts or to that she judged herself to them by his crimes -- that is to say, if they did not die in the position.
<seg>To whom he can be proud to him that the last communist head of Rumania, Nicolai Ceaucescu, and their wife would be executed without at least the smaller appearance of a judgment just?
<seg>The formalities of a real court always seem better than instantaneous justice, although the final result also is the death.
<seg>At the moment there are two forms possible to act against a demoted tyrant.
<seg>A nation can take in opinion to its own ex- leaders, since the Argentineans in 1980 with the generals responsible for the disappearance did of more than 5.000 for their fellow citizens.
<seg>At international level, the model of Nuremberg still is available to generate judgments additional, although under the ambiguous conditions whereupon the winning powers sometimes they assign the responsibility of the crimes, as in the case of the “crimes against the humanity”, that properly were not defined at the moment which they were committed.
<seg>There was a time in which the advantages of the national judgments as of the international could be seen as much.
<seg>The internal judgments allowed the local community to alleviate their sadness when participating close by in the process.
<seg>Like judges and jury, the compatriots of the defendant also could exert major sensitivity when evaluating the fault because they realized condition hard in which a demoted dictator had made his decisions.
<seg>The judgment of the generals in Argentina was a successful ritual in the painful transition of the military junta to the democracy, but at the end of the experience there were many doubts.
<seg>Even after the sentences, the generals were sufficiently powerful to manage that the judgments finished and later to obtain the pardon of the incoming president.
<seg>The policy of Argentina follows romped in the legal consequences of those judgments of 20 years ago.
<seg>At international level, the decision of the Security Council of the United Nations to establish the Penal Court the International for the ex- Yugoslavia (ICTY by its abbreviations in English) also was received with great confidence.
<seg>The ICTY made indeed several original decisions under the leadership from Antonio Cassese.
<seg>But later, the judges had the misfortune of which its yearned for dream was fulfilled to them more -- to judge in its court to the archivillano Slobodan Milosevic.
<seg>Now it is not clear how they would have handled the Serbs to Milosevic in a local judgment.
<seg>It would have depended much on the political party that the court controlled.
<seg>At international level, the fear was not that there was too much policy but too much straight.
<seg>The judgment of Milosevic had to be more than just; it had to be an emblem of the justice of the UN.
<seg>For that reason it was allowed Milosevic to defend itself to itself --a great error in terms of the duration and efficiency of the judgment.
<seg>A limit to the number of witnesses was not put who the public prosecutors called to render testimony on the same frightful histories of the aggression and Serbian brutality.
<seg>It will take many months to determine what was what left bad and why the judgment lasted four years, which is a scandal.
<seg>My hunch is that the well-meaning civil servants of the court let themselves influence too much by the Commission for La Paz and the Reconciliation of South Africa, a model announced in the schools of right like the alternative wished to the punishment justice.
<seg>In the South African processes the most important subject was not the future of the defendant but the past of the victims.
<seg>It was encouraged to all the victims to that they counted its history and the defendant listened.
<seg>In the case of the massacres that occurred in century XX, these narrations can take decades.
<seg>To encourage to the victims to speak and to give later to the defendant the right to obstruct the process proclaiming its merits as political leader is equivalent to a formula for the infinite postponement.
<seg>A lesson that we have learned of the judgments of Milosevic and Hussein is that it is not due to take in to opinion to O-Men women with the purpose of to end his attractive charismatic one.
<seg>They will upset the judgment --mainly if it is allowed to defend itself them to themselves-- and they will use the court to vindicate its races.
<seg>To the tyrants it is only necessary to judge them after clearly they have been defeated.
<seg>Ironically, it was an advantage for you cut of Nuremberg to be composed by representatives of the winning powers.
<seg>They were a constant reminder for Goering, Hess and his partisans of which the allies had the control and of which the Nazis irreversibly were defeated.
<seg>The clear objective of the judgment always went to punish to the guilty, not to decide the form in which history would be written.
<seg>The tragedy in the cases of Milosevic and Hussein is that history still did not finish being written and it was being judged to same history.
<seg>The resulting indecision of that they were to position gave rise to procedures --international as as much national-- that they facilitated the fantasies of vindication and return.
<seg>In the case of Hussein, that fantasy still can become reality.
<seg>The economic division of Iraq
<seg>Who watch Iraq see a nation divided between Shiite communities, Sunnite and Kurd.
<seg>But the increasing breach between rich and the poor men in Iraq are an equally fundamental division, that it has contributed to the continuous insurrection as much as the sectarian fights and the opposition to the occupation headed by the United States.
<seg>When Iraq was released, the majority of people, mainly the poor men, began to have hopes from which a charismatic leader arrived rescued who them of the bitter reality of the daily life.
<seg>To the bred salary with fear, they did not have idea of how the democracy to its society could be applied and how the defending groups of the human rights and other civic organizations could help to conform the future.
<seg>In a moment Iraq faced a new social division.
<seg>Of a side they were the people who understood how to work in a democracy, how to reach the power and to fulfill their ambitions.
<seg>They learned to speak the language of the democracy and in the process they obtained money and influences and recruited independent organizations to defend its rights and privileges.
<seg>Nevertheless, across it is the enormous population of Iraqians without being able, including the divorced and left widows and women that does not have who becomes position of them and their children.
<seg>For these people the democracy and the human rights do not mean anything.
<seg>They are ignorant, poor and they are ill.
<seg>They are victims of an educative system who collapse for more than one decade and have been having few abilities that allow to find use them in the ruined economy of Iraq.
<seg>During the regime of Saddam efforts were not made to elevate the standards of life of the poor men.
<seg>I have visited the extensive slums of Iraq and have found families who live in houses that as soon as they have ceiling, that is infested of insects and to which strain black waters to them below the doors.
<seg>By day and at night they live in the dark.
<seg>These families, who do not need more than foods, a decent house and the possibility of having a use, wait for the death oyendo the terrible shouts of their children who starve.
<seg>When I met with the women who live in those houses, they flooded to me with questions: perhaps the democracy will give to foods and houses us?
<seg>He will avoid that the men strike their spouses?
<seg>It will give the citizenship him to our children?
<seg>It will give the right us to divorce to us of the husbands who leave to us?
<seg>My answer to all those questions was “yes”.
<seg>Yes, the democracy will give the right them to live in a decent house, to learn and to work and it will give the citizenship him to its children and it will make equals to the men.
<seg>But they must work hard and deliver all the attacks possible to demand its rights.
<seg>They answered: “Saddam taught to us during 35 years to be unemployed, quiet and afraid.
<seg>What we can do now? “
<seg>In these zones destitutes where the majority lives on the Iraqians, people are imprisoned of the bitter temptations.
<seg>Many are beyond the reach of the political leaders and government.
<seg>They fall easily in the violence, the robbery and the sabotage.
<seg>The poverty takes some to receive money in exchange for realising violence acts, incited by the attractiveness of a false heroism that could not put in practice during the long regime of Saddam.
<seg>The poverty has exacerbated the trauma of the violent history of wars and atrocities of Iraq that has caused that people become insensible to the fact to kill.
<seg>Although the present conditions of Iraq take to many young people to the violence, I am convinced that the unique thing that there is to make to save them is to give them to uses and decent houses.
<seg>The uses in particular will help the young people to create new lives by means of a serious work.
<seg>We do not have to use uses where one does not work to disguise an army of unemployed.
<seg>We must give to people uses that allow them to contribute to the reconstruction of the country.
<seg>By nature, each individual looks for to demonstrate that she is a useful person for his society.
<seg>But the culture that Saddam created convinced the Iraqians that the unique form to obtain authority, money and knowledge is through political contacts.
<seg>To surpass those ideas will take time and an active economy, which means that the new Iraqian government must have a limited power that allows the private sector to grow and that at the same time allows to a generalized understanding of the democracy and the human rights.
<seg>The religious groups are prepared to contribute to that process.
<seg>Also, we can rehabilitate the technocrats who worked in the government of Saddam so that they also have the opportunity to serve their country.
<seg>Finally, but for that reason less nonimportant, we must facilitate credits to the families to help to construct a life them respectable.
<seg>Mainly, the government does not have to scrimp efforts to convince to the poor Iraqians of the value of the democracy and the freedom, and of the importance of the constitution to fulfill his aspirations of a life better.
<seg>It will not be easy to obtain that in a country in which many people consider that to break the law it is a heroism act.
<seg>But we Iraqian them also have learned that the power does not have to be concentrate in a few hands and that to establish justice it demands to fight against the corruption in all forms.
<seg>So that the constitution works like guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, the poor Iraqians must learn to make hers that fight.
<seg>The Islamic identity
<seg>At the moment, to where it is that we turn around, is used to the Islam (and one abuses him) like political force.
<seg>To some they use it Muslims like call to act; many in the West (and other places perceive) it like a “other” which there is to contain and to exclude.
<seg>Like Turk, I directly undergo both sides of that debate.
<seg>The reason by that the Islam seems to eyes of western a religion of the “other” is that in the West a systematic desinstitucionalización of the religion has occurred.
<seg>By all means, it is not the religion which has disappeared of the western modern life, but what they can make the religious institutions on the individual behavior.
<seg>The religion in the modern world is a personal and much more spiritual experience that never.
<seg>Nevertheless, also in the Islam a process of desinstitucionalización of the religious experience is occurring.
<seg>The politicalization of the Islam is replacing the authority of the religious class, ulema.
<seg>Like in the West, the Islamic religious experience is becoming more personal.
<seg>One of the results is the interpretation of political, in a personal view intellectual the religious texts that the Muslims are doing, including a militant and women.
<seg>Another one, is the vulgarization of the religious knowledge, that abuses the lessons of the Corán and them context extraction to support political aims.
<seg>Who decides now what is legitimate and what he is illicit in the Islam?
<seg>Who has the authority to interpret religious texts?
<seg>Who can emit one “fatwa” or declare “jihad”?
<seg>Nowadays, the activism and the terrorism offer, or rather they impose, a new source of legitimacy.
<seg>Thus, they are legos who decide what means and what not the Islam, without the authority of the religious schools and of a specialized formation.
<seg>Indeed, to the Islam one at the moment interprets through political actors and cultural movements to him and not of religious institutions.
<seg>The desinstitucionalización has allowed that the Islam happens to be a local bow social and national to everywhere forge imaginary bonds between all the displaced Muslims who feel pressed or.
<seg>Of that way, the Islam can unite to followers who before deeply were divided: the spiritual Muslims sufíes and the canonized ones of the Shariat; the Shiite Muslims and the Sunnite; the Saudi Arabia conservative and the Iran revolutionary.
<seg>At the same time, the Islam is moving, with the believers who are leaving the countryside to go to the cities, including those of the West.
<seg>Many see this movement like something negative, and emphasize the fact that those people are uprooted socially, which takes to the distraction and, to some, to the terrorism.
<seg>But social mobility also is a precondition to create a modern vision.
<seg>By all means, through the migration, the Muslims undergo a spacing sensation, if he is not that of total breaking, of his social origins.
<seg>Thus, its religious experience is of a new type, prevailed of theological, communitarian institutions or of State.
<seg>The religious experience becomes a form of social imagination, within which they reconstruct a sensation of property to the Islam in new and strange surroundings.
<seg>It is not the distance of the modern life, but the proximity to her what triggers a return to the religious identity.
<seg>Indeed, the majority of the radicalismos arises in groups that, by their experiences of mobility and displacement, know political the thought secular and the western urban life.
<seg>Disoriented its new surroundings, the Islam becomes its anchor.
<seg>But so that anchor works, it is necessary to release to the Islam of its traditional servile, passive and docile position before modernity.
<seg>When using a veil or the beard, when protesting the right to take places for the oration in the work or the school and when demanding special foods, the Muslims is identified abiertamente like such.
<seg>They are saying to him to surrounds which them that they are more jealous and meticulous in its religious observance that those that limits their religiousness the private life.
<seg>For example, the nonMuslim ones consider generally to the veil as a sign of degradation and inferiority for the Muslim woman.
<seg>Nevertheless, of being a stigma, for the Muslims one has become a sign of its positive affirmation of the Islamic identity.
<seg>The young Muslim women in Europe illustrate this transformation perfectly.
<seg>The girls who adopt the pañoleta in the head in the French and German schools are nearer in many aspects (that is to say, the youthful culture, the fashion and the language) their classmates who to their mothers, without education and which remain in house.
<seg>When using the pañoleta in the European public scope, these girls are involuntarily altering to the symbol and the paper of the Muslim women.
<seg>This tendency goes beyond pañoletas.
<seg>All the western Muslims have a felt double of property, a cultural capital doubles.
<seg>They are defined to themselves through its religiousness, but also they have acquired universal secular knowledge.
<seg>Since they have a cultural capital doubles, different activities and spaces can circulate with relative freedom between (the youthful home, school, associations and the urban places of relaxation).
<seg>To be Muslim and to be Islamic is not the same.
<seg>What we are being present at the moment is a displacement of a Muslim identity towards an Islamic identity.
<seg>The religious being for the Muslim is moving of the deprived land to the public.
<seg>The question for all is if the search of the identity can satisfy with pañoletas and an ample public acceptance with the Islamic religious practices, or if the positive affirmation of the Islam demands one more a more essential resignation of modernity.
<seg>A new one was for Islamic sciences?
<seg>During some hundreds of years, when sciences and the mathematics happened through a period of great inventions, a region of the world stood out.
<seg>There one venerated the teachers of those disciplines, the medicine advanced quickly and people common were interested in the form in that the nature worked.
<seg>He is not surprising that this region was respected world-wide.
<seg>In the other half of the well-known world it was punished and even one killed the scientists.
<seg>The mathematics were prohibited because they were considered other people's to the religion and later were subordinate to this one.
<seg>The standards of life were low.
<seg>The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, whereas an ignorant Europe remained in the poverty.
<seg>Both regions had religious governments (the historians against this background do not agree on the paper and the nature of the religions) but sciences bloomed in only one of them.
<seg>Now, by all means, the papers of the Islamic Middle East and the West have interchanged.
<seg>From World War II, the United States has been the unquestionable leader in scientific questions.
<seg>Throughout this period, the most shining students have left their mother countries attracted by better opportunities and universities and institutions of investigation.
<seg>Until recently, more than half of the withdrawn ones in the fields of the mathematics, sciences and engineering in the United States they had been born abroad.
<seg>Many of these talents remained as much after their graduation and the industry as they took advantage of it to the government.
<seg>Meanwhile, the Islamic cultures entered an historical stage in which sciences are compared with a western influence and they are avoided.
<seg>Even in those countries where the oil income could impel an important amount of investigations, the Arab governors do not foment those investments, and as result their societies have not prospered everything what they could.
<seg>Recently, a desire to obtain a greater political respect has encouraged to the Islamic nations to invest in technology. Where note that is more in the nuclear ambitions of Pakistan and Iran.
<seg>But well those arms have political weight, the scientific concepts in which they lean are old and worldly.
<seg>The respect is more significant than it is derived to incubate ideas, that the one that is come off products of previous discoveries.
<seg>We imagine the influence that would be generated if a Pakistani institute were the world-wide leader in investigations on the cancer.
<seg>It would change the political rhetoric if the investigators of Omán discovered the key to eliminate AIDS?
<seg>This is an opportunity that is not profiteer.
<seg>But another one exists, and not solely for the Islamic societies.
<seg>The United States has committed serious errors recently.
<seg>The “questions of faith” have replaced sciences in all the government, beginning by the president.
<seg>Political civil servants have changed information of important investigators when the facts contradict the official thought.
<seg>Impelled by an administration influenced by the religion, the educative systems are changing their approach of sciences to the “values”.
<seg>From the terrorist attacks of September of 2001, the visas are littler and difficult to obtain, which is handicapped the flow of young talent to the American universities.
<seg>The important scientific organizations have protested, without obtaining results.
<seg>At the same time, the fiscal laws have modified to make the short term investors richer, which discourages the long term investments in investigation.
<seg>In the war of Iraq trillion has been spent half of dollars, approximately equal amount to which it was dedicated to in the last support all the basic investigation thousand years.
<seg>If the United States even gets rid of a fundamentalist average age, clearly they run the risk of losing his world-wide predominance in the matter of investigation.
<seg>Japan recognized the bond between the political influence and sciences in the decade of the 1980.
<seg>The main industrialist of Japan, Akio Morita, president of Sony and the politician of right Shintaro Ishihara pronounced a series of speeches that were compiled and published in 1986 in a titled book The Japan that Dog Say Not (Japan that can say not).
<seg>They outlined a national strategy in which it was understood that the world-wide influence derived from the scientific leadership.
<seg>The central idea was that the military power could become obsolete if other nations controlled the “nutritional chain” of the military technologies.
<seg>The title of the book talks about the plan of Japan “to say not” to the military influence of the United States once Japan controlled military technologies nails.
<seg>To construct to an economy based on the knowledge using the oil wealth is clearly possible.
<seg>For example, Texas, like the majority of the states of the south of the United States, sometimes was economically poor and was in decay.
<seg>Although it had oil income, the flow of dollars to an economy by itself does not increase the prosperity as much as it could think.
<seg>For that reason Texas decided to dedicate its originating money of petroleum to an educative bottom.
<seg>At the moment that bottom is approximately equal to the one of the University of Harvard and it is distributed between 15 universities.
<seg>The effect has been impressive: the aerospace manufactures almost have disappeared of California but they are in the heat of height in Texas.
<seg>A multitude of centers and partnerships of telecommunications have changed themselves to Texas, even of the Canadian giant of the Nortel telecommunications.
<seg>Although the manufacturing sector is in crisis in the United States, Texas has one of the manufacturing economies more forts of the world.
<seg>There is no reason for which the same result in the Middle East could not be obtained.
<seg>But first, the Islamic world must redescubrir and adopt an inheritance of which it must be proud.
<seg>The debate of Iran on Iraq
<seg>No country of the Near East is pending of the events of the postwar period in Iraq that Iran.
<seg>The geographic proximity, an intense and bloody history of conflicts with the religious and emotional Iraq de Saddam Hussein, connections with Shiite Iraq and the preoccupations about the United States and their policies in the region is all bows that unite to Iran with their western neighbor.
<seg>Given the present tensions with the USA, Iran particularly is worried about the probability that the Americans settle down themselves of permanent way in the neighboring nation, as well as by the dominant paper of the USA in the determination of the future of Iraq pos-Saddam.
<seg>To those who are abroad can be to them difficult to follow internal the debates Iranian, but these exist and are intense, although not always they are visible for the international public more general.
<seg>There are three general approaches that can be recognized in the present Iranian debate about Iraq pos-Saddam.
<seg>Pragmatic the Iranians argue that inevitably Iran will have to cooperate with the USA, at least to assure the rights the Shiite Iraqian population.
<seg>Therefore, Iran would have to obtain securities of which a new leadership in Iraq would not be to him hostile, and would have to look for friendly bilateral relations.
<seg>Other vital considerations for the pragmatic ones are the preservation of the territorial integrity of Iraq and the repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqian refugees who live in Iran.
<seg>These moderate ones think that the government of Iran would have to press to the USA to obtain the extradition of the members of the Organization Mujahdin-e Khalq (MKO) that have their base in Iraq, as well as the total dismantling of this group.
<seg>In exchange for it, the government of Iran would have to support his to the securing of La Paz, the stability and the security in Iraq.
<seg>To sum up, the pragmatic ones would limit the treatments between Iran and the USA, having maintained them trims in a program that would mainly reflect the internal preoccupations of Iran.
<seg>The Iranian preservative forces support mainly this position.
<seg>Another position seeks a more active and cooperating paper of Iran in the reconstruction of Iraq.
<seg>Those in favor of this vision argue that Iran is in a good position to cause that the reconstruction is easier, due to its established good infrastructure of personal and institutional bows in Iraq.
<seg>Sooner or later, they argue, the USA and the international community they will recognize the value of the Iranian cooperation.
<seg>The Iranian cooperation would be due to pay with the dismantling of the infrastructure of the MKO in Iraq, perhaps together with the Iranian commitment to increase its efforts to end any activity of the Qaeda, as well as to expel from Iran to its members.
<seg>What is more important, Iran would have to press so that the USA gives the security him of which its cooperation will have like reciprocal element the American guarantee of which Iran will not be the objective of a military action of the USA in the future.
<seg>To sum up, those in favor of the cooperation request an open and explicit negotiation: the support from Iran to the stability during the present phase of transition in Iraq, as well as its commitment with maintaining relations of cooperation with the permanent government who arises in Iraq, anyone is their sign, in exchange for an improvement of the regional and international position of Iran.
<seg>This vision is very popular between the Iranian reformists (as much inside as outside the government) and the technocratic and commercial class with more international mentality.
<seg>Finally, for the Iranian radicals, the possibility of establishing relations of cooperation with the USA is a pure fantasy.
<seg>They think that the USA is determined to mine the security of Iran and to damage their national interests.
<seg>From the point of view of the radicals, less than the USA it hopes is to dictate changes of spread in the Iranian foreign policy.
<seg>And what the Americans set out, argue more, is to press by a change of regime in Iran.
<seg>The USA will undertake initiatives against the knowledge acquisition and nuclear power on the part of Iran, and can even try to debilitate the Iranian general military capacity.
<seg>These radicals see the invasion from the USA Iraq as the reflection of American desire to surround to Iran.
<seg>In answer, they think that Iran must defend its interests of active way, forming strategic alliances with regional Russia and other powers and using the influence of Iran in Iraq to prevent that in Baghdad emerges a proAmerican and Iranian government.
<seg>The radicals of all the factions support this vision.
<seg>To overthrow the regime of Saddam was the easy part of crisi Iraqian.
<seg>Now the difficult thing comes: to strengthen La Paz and the security, to win the war against the terrorism and to convince to the Muslim masses of which the USA does not have the intention to occupy Iraq, to seize of their petroleum and to remodelar the Near East to their image and similarity.
<seg>Meanwhile, it is probable that it increases the opposition to the USA, expressed in suicidal explosions and other forms of terrorism.
<seg>Iran is destined to continue playing a regional role of first importance, because their political dynamism and its Muslim identity resonate widely in the Muslim world.
<seg>What it happens in Iraq will have implicancias of first importance for Iran, and the USA is well advised as far as looking for ways to recognize this fact.
<seg>The American threats, or the speculations on another war, inflame the flames of the resentment and the frustration in Iran, fortifying to the most radical forces.
<seg>If the USA wishes to avoid this result, must consider to limit the influence of their own radicals, being recognized that the American interests in Iraq benefit with a greater cooperation with Iran.
<seg>The exit of Iraq
<seg>Finally it has been arrived at the point in which in Iraq tode the world obviously wants the same: the exit of the country of the forces of the coalition.
<seg>The recent filtration of a document of the British Ministry of Defense on the withdrawal puts of relief that desire.
<seg>The unique question is how to satisfy it.
<seg>While the forces of the Coalition follow there, it is probable that the violence increases.
<seg>But they leave, also will increase, but more express.
<seg>Thus, the true question is how to reach the point where Iraq counts on a police and an army to which the maintenance of the law and of the order can also be trusted.
<seg>Much is due to advance at least to approach.
<seg>In spite of the value of the many Iraqians who enter to the army or the police, it does not have to surprise that some can have reasons that are not so pure.
<seg>In the north of Iraq old woman accounts are being settled and an ethnic segregation de facto in zones like Irbil has been introduced that traditionally were diverse.
<seg>In other areas the law of sharia has been introduced by the force.
<seg>Then, how can Iraq create uniformed services to which the application of the law of efficient and impartial way without ethnic considerations can be trusted, religious or of sort?
<seg>The traditional answer is to recruit, to train and to instill the “correct values”.
<seg>But there is no sufficient time for that.
<seg>Other methods are needed.
<seg>In the absence of a deeply ingrained system of values, Iraq needs organizations the civil society who cause that the police and the army render accounts.
<seg>They could take different forms, but the important thing is that really they are incluyentes at local level and that they receive support of the structures of being able distritales, regional and national when they indicate that there are abuses.
<seg>If there is a local scrutiny and the reinforcement and national recognition of the value of that scrutiny, then it is probable that the majority of the members of the uniformed forces behaves of appropriate way --and that can be identified to them and be punished more easily if they do not do it.
<seg>This could seem too optimistic, but in Afghanistan, a country similar to Iraq in many aspects, are groups that are working to obtain that goal.
<seg>The Cooperation for La Paz and Unidad (CPAU) offer a model of the form in which this can be done.
<seg>In Afghanistan, like in Iraq, the priority of common people has been to obtain a reduction of the violence.
<seg>The CPAU worked in all the country during last the three years to establish Committees of Peace at distrital level, supported by Advice of Peace satellite in the towns.
<seg>The initiative faces a culture in which the violence is so ingrained that sometimes the children learned Arithmetic counting the number of died Soviet soldiers.
<seg>Therefore, the Committees look for that all the sectors of the community --including teachers, tribal and religious leaders, women, police, soldiers, judges and industralists-- they work together to design nonviolent forms to solve conflicts.
<seg>Although supervision not has be part formal of paper of committees until now (it is anticipated that it is it in the future), the simple fact that the police, the army and the judicial power comprises of to these puts them committees in contact with the rest of the community, it offers feedback and it begins to create confidence.
<seg>Some results are remarkable.
<seg>In a factory, the local military commandant attended a pair of hours by courtesy and ended up remaining all the week.
<seg>In the end one apologized by its violent past and it was committed to disarm its deprived army of 2.000 members.
<seg>Now it visits regularly the offices of the Committee.
<seg>In Iraq, projects as the Center of Humanitarian Connection in Kirkuk is beginning to act a as of supervision when offering to the local, diverse population in the ethnic thing, the opportunity to make their complaints and to receive aid to solve them.
<seg>But with too much frequency, even when a judicial failure occurs, this one is not applied because of the intimidation.
<seg>The American and British forces already have done much work positive to fortify the civil society.
<seg>It is not heard speak of the factories to qualify to the women or the successful organization of elections of small scale in all the country.
<seg>But to mobilize the civil society is an enormous challenge, mainly when, as in the case of Iraq, it is needed to do quickly and on a large scale.
<seg>The troops continues being necessary, but also they are it the incentives to lay down the arms, including perspective of economic opportunities that are more lucrative than the crime and extortion.
<seg>Luckyly, to create capacity for the civil society is as cheap as important.
<seg>The Center of Humanitarian Connection hardly takes care of all Kirkuk to an annual cost of 75.000 dollars.
<seg>With 10 million dollars those centers could be talked back 100 times --and it would exceed enough.
<seg>The challenge is to commit itself with that approach, to reinforce and to support total to the brave people who face the challenge to request accounts to the power.
<seg>Of another form, it is little probable that the Iraqian town obtains the security that, after so many years of suffering, needs with urgency.
<seg>Democracy in the Nile?
<seg>The surprise decision of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to propose a constitutional amendment that would allow to celebrate direct and competitive presidential elections can be a gigantic step for the democracy in Egypt and the Arab world.
<seg>To western, the customary ones to the plural democracy, it can be difficult to understand the enormity to them of the potential change that this can mean in a customary country to the military government for more than 50 years.
<seg>Under the present system, the Egyptian citizens only can appear the day of a presidential referendum every six years and pronounce themselves to favor or against the unique name that appears in the problem.
<seg>This explains why somebody as Mubarak always obtained more from 90% of the votes, although has been with an indifferent participation.
<seg>To the leaders of Syria and Iraq it has gone to them even better with this system, without a doubt because they demanded that the names and directions of the voters appeared to it wears of each vote.
<seg>Many have argued for a long time that the democratization of the Middle East will not advance much until Egypt is committed totally with the process.
<seg>Egypt could not truly undertake the way of the democratization without reforming first its constitution --in order to reduce the pharaonic powers of its president and to put limits to its period of government.
<seg>After all, Mubarak already has been 24 years like president.
<seg>For this reason, the announcement of which it wants competitive presidential elections is important a first step.
<seg>The regime can suppose that it will manage to use the process for his benefit, but perhaps the events are not so easy to control when the town begins to feel that it must be able.
<seg>The genius of the democracy already left the lamp.
<seg>In any case, Egypt is not the unique country of this afflicted region that undertakes the footpath of the democracy.
<seg>Turkey, of a side of the Middle East, and Morocco of the other, already go quite advanced.
<seg>This time the real impulse seems to come from the proximity and the positive results of the recent elections in Iraq, Palestine and to a lesser extent Saudi Arabia.
<seg>The manifestations without precedents against the Syria occupation in Lebanon after the murder of their ex- prime minister, Rafiq al-Hariri, do not signal to calm.
<seg>Also the Egyptian groups of opposition have carried out more and more audacious marches and other forms of civil disobedience in the last weeks.
<seg>The catalyst of its fury was the arrest of the ill leader of the opposition Ayman Nour at the end of January.
<seg>The hard conduct of hand of the government revitalized to the local movement “Kifaya” (Coarse), that has demanded the aim of the regime of Mubarak.
<seg>Suddenly, the popular conception of which the Egyptians are afraid liabilities and to act seems not to be certain.
<seg>An alliance of local, regional and international forces is forming against the “tyranny of always” of the shores of the Nile.
<seg>The recent big wave of popular pressure seems to have shaken to the regime.
<seg>Hardly a month ago, Mubarak rejected the exigencies of constitutional reforms describing them as vain.
<seg>But whatever it has been the combination of elements took that it to change of opinion, is necessary to receive with affability the initiative for the elections.
<seg>It is a first necessary step --but insufficient-- in order to redesign the suspended political system of Egypt.
<seg>Egyptian already reforms are distrustful of symbolic in the style of those of Tunisia, where president Zine the Abidin Bin Ali, by far time in the power, created a cartoon of constitutional amendment that seemed abrir the doors to the competitive elections, later to create an electoral farce with some “opponents” chosen by him.
<seg>In referéndums presidential previous, Bin Ali normally received 99% of the voting. This time obtained 96%.
<seg>We hope that Mubarak takes serious more in the electoral reform.
<seg>As sincerity sample, must order the immediate liberation of Ayman Nour and take steps to end the Emergency situation that prevails for 24 years and that it prevents in the cause that are carried out presidential campaigns.
<seg>Mubarak also must support a limit of not more than two consecutive periods of five years for any president.
<seg>The measures of confidence creation are equally necessary and include the open and equitable access to the means, that now are controlled by the State.
<seg>I have announced that I have the intention to dispute the next presidential elections as she forms abrir the debate on these essential reforms.
<seg>But with taste citizen life would return once free and open elections in autumn are guaranteed.
<seg>If they are applied seriously, those measures will transform the legacy of Mubarak.
<seg>Along with the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine, can well inaugurate one spring Arab of freedom that must long ago have arrived.
<seg>An historical election in Egypt?
<seg>The Egyptians will pass through the ballot boxes the 7 of September to choose to a president among ten candidates, including whom it has been during 24 years, Hosni Mubarak.
<seg>Although few doubt that the result will be the re-election of this last one, many are following enthusiastically the process.
<seg>About 6,000 national observers have received qualification for those elections and hundreds of foreign correspondents are converging in the country this week.
<seg>Although all the formal details of a true electoral fight are present,  important aspects of authenticity shine by their absence.
<seg>In spite of the promises done in opposite sense, the playground is of being equal for all.
<seg>Mubarak continues counting on out of proportion assets: recognition of the name, a virtual monopoly of electronic mass media controlled by the State and the 85 percent, approximately, of printed mass media.
<seg>One week before the elections, some candidates of the opposition not yet have been able to present/display an electoral announcement in the Egyptian television.
<seg>All the members of the Commission of the Presidential Elections have been named by Mubarak and the new electoral norms have eliminated all the independent candidates.
<seg>From the year 2000, the 8,000 judges of Egypt must supervise and certify the electoral results, according to a resolution of the Supreme Court.
<seg>It was an important passage with a view to the celebration of righter elections, because the Professional Association of the Magistrature has continued counting on enough independence, in spite of the attempts  of  executive authority to be overcome it throughout half century.
<seg>So that the regime of Mubarak has had to resort to diverse stratagems to neutralize to the Association of the Magistrature.
<seg>One was the one to extend the definition of “judicature” to include to thousands of loyal employees of the Government who have titles of lawyers in Right, but judicial nonexperience, which leaves disarmed the true judges, then, if they protest boycotting his functions of supervision, the task will fall once again to the police of the infamous Ministry of Interior.
<seg>Thus, in the past the Association of the Magistrature it used to say amen, with foreseeable results.
<seg>In the parliamentary elections of 2000, whereas the divided governor of Mubarak received the 38 percent, approximately, of the popular vote in the districts supervised by the true judges, that percentage less happened to be nothing than the 86 percent there where the supervision was the responsibility of the cuasijueces.
<seg>This year it seems that it is going to be very different.
<seg>In the spring the judges celebrated a national assembly and decided that, unless the regime granted to total independence and the exclusive supervision to them of the voting process, they would not supervise the next presidential elections (or parliamentarians).
<seg>The 2 of September presented/displayed their final exigencies: to allow that groups of the civil society observe the voting process, to end the interferences in the definition of the legitimate judges with a view to the elections and to accede to the permanent presence of a legitimate judge in front of each one of the ballot boxes until it is had counted, certificate and official notice its content.
<seg>Until now, it is probable that the situation is the one of an impasse, because the President of the Electoral Commission has declared publicly in the Egyptian television that rejects the supervision of the electoral process on the part of all the citizens.
<seg>Another interesting newness on the eve of the elections is an aggravated public debate on if to vote or to boycott the presidential elections.
<seg>Diverse opposition parties have asked to their members that do not participate: in order to protest against restrictive electoral norms that favor enormously to Mubarak.
<seg>On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers, considered the group of opposition more hard of Egypt, are insisting to their followers to go to vote and to do it in it brings back to consciousness, but not to support to no “despotic and corrupt” governor.
<seg>One is clearly, although an implicit one, repudio of Mubarak, the unique governor in 24 years.
<seg>Thirty and four organizations of the civil society are preparing to thousands of Egyptian young people so that they observe the elections, in spite of the repeated governmental objections.
<seg>These groups maintain that, if the regime does not set out to fix the electoral results, the presence of national and foreign observers of the electoral process does not have to be a problem.
<seg>The answer of the regime is the one of which any outer supervision is a violation of the Egyptian sovereignty and the national observers are an insult to the integrity of the judges.
<seg>That argument was quickly invalidated when the Association of the Magistrature announced that it supported the presence of observers of the civil society.
<seg>Or that the regime of Mubarak is scared before the inner exigencies and outer in increase so that it celebrates free elections and right or that it is, simply, incapable to purify the party of their natural tendency to the swindle, the present signals are not a good augury for the elections that will be celebrated the next Wednesday.
<seg>Meanwhile, the Egyptians are undergoing the emotion for the first time to defy to the tyranny and to enjoy a space just shortage for the freedom.
<seg>The envy of Europe towards the dollar
<seg>The currencies can be turned into the center not only of commercial transactions, but of diplomatic and political disputes.
<seg>When this happens, the commercial transactions become more difficult and are subject to a greater uncertainty.
<seg>The politicalization of the money during the depression of inter-war was economically devastating.
<seg>But there have been more recent cases of perverse fights of currencies.
<seg>60 years international the monetary order became in the center of a political guerrilla.
<seg>Each side had different theories and explanations good about which it happened.
<seg>The European (in particular, the French) complained than General Charles de Gaulle it called the “exorbitant privilege” of the American dollar.
<seg>The General and his monetary gurú, Jacques Rueff, argued that the USA used estatus of the dollar as the main currency of reserve originated by the regime of type of fixed change of Bretton Woods to have deficits and to pay their military adventures abroad (at that time, Vietnam).
<seg>France made calls to a monetary reform that ended the peculiar paper of the dollar and tried to revivir the gold standard, by then very discredited.
<seg>The European initiated one long discussion about the advantages of the monetary union, profit that would allow them to watch the expensive dollar to face.
<seg>But, from the American point of view, the international paper of dollar was a trap.
<seg>Other countries could change their types of change and this gave to major competitiveness to its exports.
<seg>The government of the USA was impotent in front of a devaluated yen, which fed the belief that the rest of the world used the dollar to attack the manufacturing base of the USA.
<seg>The administration Nixon reached the conclusion that the unique way to save the American economy was the monetary unilateralism: so radical a monetary expansion that other countries were forced to fit their types of change.
<seg>These battles, long forgotten, have suddenly become very present.
<seg>The world no longer has a regime of type of fixed change, but the dollar continues being the main currency of reserve, a spice of floating Bretton Woods.
<seg>For the Americans the paper of reserve of the dollar is a potential threat, whereas for the rest of the world it is another example of the neoimperialistic hegemonic ambition of the USA.
<seg>In this decade, China has occupied the place of Japan in the 60, maintaining its type of low change to stimulate the growth of its exports.
<seg>Consequently, it is the target of the complaints of the USA by disloyal competition and their efforts to force an adjustment of the type of change that causes that the Americans stop buying toys, apparatuses and clothes of Chinese manufacture.
<seg>The manufacturers of the USA have decided that the Chinese underclothes constitute a threat in the style of American life.
<seg>Meanwhile, the European (especially the French) complain about the great deficits of the USA and again the argument of de Gaulle is fashionable of which the rest of the world is paying the wars of the USA.
<seg>Some European suggest them Asian central banks must have a greater part of their reserves in Euros, which is an echo on the failed attempt of the general to force to that the USA sold dollars and received gold.
<seg>The 60 finished in breaks of the “system” and in an important financial turbulence, accompanied by an inflationary increase of the prices of basic products.
<seg>All were wounded, and the paper of the USA in the world-wide subjects received an important blow.
<seg>If it happened now, a similar collapse probably would have a different effect.
<seg>The system of present floating type is more solid and the costs of the adjustments are distributed of different way.
<seg>The majority of the Americans does not undergo too much by the strong fall of the dollar, since the salesmen of foreign goods must fit their prices for the market of the USA.
<seg>The Asian economies are growing vigorously and their central banks are accumulating titles of debt of the USA.
<seg>It is possible that they follow with this policy, since the alternative would be a sudden backward movement of the competividad of its exporting sectors in the most important American market.
<seg>This gives to the USA more time to face a deficit of current account that, in the long term, is untenable.
<seg>The economically dynamic regions of the world, North America and Asia, are then ligatures by a pact that will assure the continuity the central paper of the American dollar.
<seg>The Americans will continue accumulating debt, since therefore they love the Asians to it.
<seg>To break the pact would go against the interests of both parts.
<seg>This is not American unilateralism, since it means to work with Asia.
<seg>But for European, that is excluded from the pact, this it is seen like a monetary and economic unilateralism.
<seg>Meanwhile, the rise of the Euro in front of the dollar creates important shortages for the exporter of European manufactures.
<seg>Nevertheless, Europe cannot make much to alleviate this situation.
<seg>In fact, the main one harmed of the new monetary fights will be.
<seg>The answers that considered no longer in the 60 (to revive the gold standard, or the invention of a common currency European) seem to be very useful.
<seg>To have a unique currency has not provided a substantial protection.
<seg>The old version of the European answer, which the sicólogos would call “envy of the dollar”, will not do more than to become serious itself.
<seg>It will have called to structural and demographic the European Central bank so that it extends its base monetary, as if to imitate to the dollar the answer to all the industrial problems went, that affect Europe.
<seg>But a little while of reflection it must remember to us that probelmas of Europe cannot be solved by means of the monetary manipulation.
<seg>It is necessary to see the protests against the new version of the exorbitant privilege of the USA like which they are: a way to resist the fundamental lack to be able of Europe.
<seg>So that the envy of the dollar arrived to remain, and it will become still greater as the international value of green tickets is falling, without appreciable adverse effects on the people print who them and use.
<seg>A policy epidemic
<seg>The Americans, like the citizens of many other countries of the world, have gotten to accept that the policy plays an important role in the appointment of some officials government.
<seg>Few it surprises to us (although to some it disappoints) that grants a position of federal judge or of diplomat of high level a candidate to them that passes tests of loyalty over principles that are important for the party of the president or prime minister.
<seg>But almost everybody agrees in which sciences are another thing, and this, the United States is becoming an instructive example for the rest of the world.
<seg>The scientific appointments would have to be based on criteria objectives of formation, capacity and performance.
<seg>Obvious, he is legitimate to interrogate to a future Secretary of Health and Servicios Humanos (SSH) on its position as far as the abortion.
<seg>But to put to the test of political loyalty to those who has been named to participate in scientific consultative committees is totally out of place.
<seg>In the same way, the membership in the organs that carry certainly out the revision of the scientific proposals of their pairs (process that is fundamental for the scientific advance) would have to be free of barriers that are not related to the professional aptitude.
<seg>Unfortunately, the scientists of the EU are being more and more with barriers of that type.
<seg>The last autumn, the Science magazine published several articles regarding this subject.
<seg>One narrated the massive substitution of the members of the consultative committee of the National Center for the Environmental Health, that comprises of the Centers for the Control and the Prevention of Diseases (CDC by its abbreviations in English), without consulting the director of the center.
<seg>Other similar cases happened in the Consultative Committee on Envenenamiento by Lead and its Prevention, the Consultative Committee on Protections in the Human Investigation and the Consultative Committee on Genetic Tests.
<seg>The epidemic of present ideology, in which they are closed or the consultative committees are reconstituted with new members and it is put under the candidates to loyalty tests does not have anything for some observers again.
<seg>Civil servants of the SSH say that it is “a quite common practice”.
<seg>Or, it is not a practice common in the United States - or it at least did not use to be it.
<seg>In any case, which is truly worrisome is not that the administration Bush examines the candidates to see if they are compatible with his “values”.
<seg>Most alarming it is the depth that has reached the inquiries on ideology, which they are invading areas that sometimes were immune to this class of manipulation.
<seg>Indeed, perhaps the most revealing case of the increasing political epidemic was the change of personnel of the section of studies of the National Institute for the Security and the Labor Health, that evaluates the scholarships to study the injuries in the work place.
<seg>It can be that the consultative committees have been vulnerable in the past to occasional maneuvers of this type.
<seg>After all, they are the one who recommend lineamientos that the politicians can or not to take into account.
<seg>But, the study sections?
<seg>In October of 2002, Science published an editorial signed by David Michaels and a group of colleagues.
<seg>Several were ex- distinguished officials government who had participated in some of the committees at issue, and offered a valuable perspective on the subject, cradle in their personal experiences.
<seg>The article in itself was interesting, but what happened next it was it still more.
<seg>It triggered a letter avalanche of scientists who related similar experiences.
<seg>A candidate to comprise of the Coordinating Committee of the Investigations on Dystrophy Muscular, pertaining to the National Institutes, told that a member of the personnel of House interrogated the White it.
<seg>After answering several questions on its opinions as far as diverse policies of the administration Bush, no of them related to the work of the committee, was asked to him if it supported the policy of the president on embryonic cells mother.
<seg>In another letter, a distinguished professor of psychiatry and psychology narrated that he had received a call of the White House about his nomination to participate in the National Council on Narcotic Abuse.
<seg>The person who telephoned to him informed to him that she had to investigate it for “determining if had points of view that could be embarrassing for the president”.
<seg>According to the professor, the civil servant of the White House made several questions and took the account to him.
<seg>An example: “You Take two of three; the president is against to the interchanges of needles (for the intravenous drug users) by reasons morals, without concerning the result”.
<seg>Later, the interchange gave a more chilling turn.
<seg>The civil servant asked to him the name one if he had voted by Bush, and when hearing that no, he asked: “Why you to the president did not support”
<seg>That happens in the dictatorships, not in the democracies.
<seg>The objective of a scientific consultative committee is to give to advice average balances and for the process of political decisions.
<seg>Nothing gains much - and lose-when the policy result is put ahead that is desired.
<seg>For that reason it is that the decisions exceed what investigation projects will be had to always support have been taken with base in studies on the part of pairs, not of politicians.
<seg>In fact, the applicable statute for this - the Federal Law of Committees Consultative-demands specifically that the committees are balances and that “are not influenced illegally by the authority named that them”.
<seg>The Human Secretary of Health and Services of the EU, Tommy Thompson, and the Office of Personnel of the White House would have to give an example to the rest of the world.
<seg>They can do very easily: fulfilling the law.
<seg>A murder in Moscow
<seg>It is hour to end the fiction of which the “dictatorship of the right” of Putin did that Russia post-Communist was less anarchical.
<seg>The murder of Ana Politkovskaya, one of the best and braver journalists of Russia, a woman who dared to set out the brutales murders committed by the Russian troops in Chechenia, is the final test that president Putin did not do more than to offer a common and current dictatorship, with the habitual scorn by the law.
<seg>He is opportune that the world, particularly Europe, considers this acceptance.
<seg>The Ministry of Outer Relations of Germany is elaborating a political one on German the Russian relations/that cult to the indifference against the illegality will do of Putin in the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.
<seg>But the indifference becomes pacification when it encourages to Putin to implement his anarchical modality in the international sand, like in its present campaign asphyxiating to the economy of Georgia.
<seg>The murder of Politkovskaya generated a dreadful sensation of déjà vu: like in the apogee of the KGB, people simply it disappears in Russia de Putin.
<seg>The murder of Politkovskaya is the third death with political borders in three weeks.
<seg>Enver Ziganshin, main engineer of BP Russia, was assassinated with a firearm in Irkutsk the 30 of September.
<seg>Andrei Kozlov, the lieutenant governor of the central bank of Russia that led a campaign against the financial fraud, was assassinated the 14 of September.
<seg>The fact that the public prosecutor of Russia, general Yuri Chaika, would become position of the investigation of the murder of Politkovskaya, he did since it with the homicide of Kozlov, he does not generate hopes, since a participation at so high level in any real democracy would do.
<seg>In fact, the participation of the highest level of the government of Russia is almost one guarantee of which never it will be the assassins.
<seg>The murder of Politkovskaya is a particularly dismal augury if one considers that was an energetic critic of the president of Russia.
<seg>In its articles for one of the few independent newspapers that are in Moscow, Novaya Gazeta, and in their books “Putin's Russia: Life in a Failing Democracy” (Russia de Putin: The life in a democracy in crisis) and “To Dirty War: To Russian Reporter in Chechnya” (a dirty war: A Russian reporter in Chechenia), Politkovskaya wrote on the dissipation of the liberties that is the mark of identification of the presidency of Putin.
<seg>As it is demonstrated by I exile of the ex- mediatic industralists Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinky, and the imprisonment of the oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, three destinies wait the enemies of Putin: I exile, the jail or the tomb.
<seg>I am not accusing the government of Putin of the murder on salary of Politkovskaya.
<seg>After all, as investigation journalist infuriated to many people besides Putin, between which she is, nothing less, than present checheno prime minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, to that she accused to implement a policy of extorsivos kidnappings.
<seg>But still if the partners of Vladimir Putin did not have anything to do in center with the murder of Politkovskaya in the elevator of their department of Moscow, the scorn of the president by the law gave rise to the climate in which the homicide was perpetrated.
<seg>As the murder of the archbishop Thomas Beckett in its Cathedral of Canterbury many centuries ago, the crime were committed in the clear conviction that it would please the king.
<seg>Against which it represented Politkovskaya -- the responsibility of a democratic press to question to the Kremlin and its policies, the government must have assured that nothing bad happened to him.
<seg>Russia de Putin already lost 12 prestigious journalists who were assassinated six years in the last.
<seg>No of these crimes has been solved, which would not be the case if the “dictatorship of the right” of Putin were something more than a strategy of public relations.
<seg>The period of six years since Vladimir Putin arrived at the Kremlin has been a time of deeply opposed signals.
<seg>On the one hand, the world sees a young and educated leader that promises to modernize to Russia, particularly in terms of aligning its judicial practices and of fulfillment of the law with the international norms.
<seg>On the other hand, the president observes in silence while their ex- colleagues in the service of security FSB of Russia (the ex- KGB) do not offer any security to him to the assassinated ones and send a series of well-known causes of espionage against environmental journalists, scientists and activists.
<seg>Between these “neon spy” they appear the journalist Gregory Pasko, the expert in control of arms Igor Sutyagin, the diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, the physicist Valentin Danilov and others.
<seg>The supposedly civilizadora influence of being a western partner -- when presiding a summit of the G-8 in Saint Petersburg, by example seems to have dissipated in the intrigue of the Kremlin de Putin.
<seg>Once again, the exhibition to the western values generated another Potemkin City; Russia presents/displays a facade of laws and democratic institutions, but behind the cardboard scenery they govern the same arbitrary beasts.
<seg>The danger for the world is that the anarchy of Putin is being exported.
<seg>In all the outside near Russia, a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root.
<seg>We analyze the attempt of Putin fraudulently to manipulate previous the presidential elections of the Ukraine and the presented/displayed intermittent criminal positions against the leader of the opposition Yuliya Tymoshenko.
<seg>We analyze the separatist regions in Moldova and Georgia that only exist thanks to the endorsement of the Kremlin.
<seg>We analyze the way in which the Kremlin tries to chantajear to its neighbors threatening interrupting its provision of energy.
<seg>All police knows that when the criminal behavior is unknown, the criminals become more intrepid.
<seg>It is hour of which the world recognizes Vladimir Putin reason why it is: a man who is pring-date to Russia in the shades.
<seg>So that the world today must consider the old principle in Latin qui tacet consentere videtur -- silence implies consent and to ask itself if he is intelligent to allow in silence the construction that makes Putin of a superpower energetics without law.
<seg>The Russian pipeline towards the empire
<seg>Gerhard Schroeder, who until less than a month ago was Chancellor of Germany, accepted to be president of the company that is constructing a pipeline from Russia, through the Baltic Sea to Germany, and from there to Western Europe.
<seg>In many countries, Schroeder it would be blamed to him now of the crime of conflict of interests.
<seg>Its apparent lack of ethics grows because at this precise Russia moment it is threatening interrupting the supplying from gas to the Ukraine if that country does not yield to the demands of prices of the giant of the gas property of the Kremlin, Gazprom.
<seg>The strategic assignment of Russia is obvious: to interrupt the supplying from gas to the Ukraine also means to interrupt great part from the gas to Europe, because some of their greater pipelines happen through the Ukraine.
<seg>When avoiding the Ukraine, Poland, and by all means, the Baltic countries, the new pipeline promises to give major influences to the Kremlin in its eagerness to replace itself regionally.
<seg>President Vladimir Putin and his administration of clones of the ex- KGB soon will not have to worry about Western Europe when they are deciding what so hard to press the postcommunist neighbors of Russia.
<seg>Would have Europe to really grant to Putin this new imperial weapon?
<seg>Or worse, could Russia use this weapon against the addict European Union to the energy?
<seg>The fact that an ex- German chancellor is going to manage the company that can give to Russia the average ones to manipulate the economy of the European Union it is testimony of the dangerous complacencia of Europe facing the neoimperialistic ambitions of Putin.
<seg>Certainly, the Russian mass media are conscientious of the increasing dependency of Europe of the Russian energy.
<seg>Indeed, they delight with her: after we integrate and we increase our business common of gas, the Russian editorialistas write, Europe will keep silence on the human rights.
<seg>Putin expresses this position of more oblique way with its commitment to carry out which the flame a “independent policy”.
<seg>What means with that is that Russia must be “independent” of the preoccupations morals and human rights of the western democracies.
<seg>Perhaps some European leaders really create that maintaining the comfortable prosperity of the Union justifies to shut up in the matter of human rights and other subjects to us that bother to the Kremlin.
<seg>By all means, we can say what we thought, briefly, on “commercial” subjects like the expropriation of Yukos, but the Kremlin puts a price to him to our values or critics to the lack committed by Russia -- in, for example, the stained Chechenia of blood the European seem to be arranged to shut up the mouth not to face the possibility that there is a rise in the prices of the power ones, or even a blockade like the one that the Ukraine faces now.
<seg>As Putin rearranges its cut, subordinating to the Duma to their will, the hopes of the European Union of a greater Europeanization of Russia would have to give in.
<seg>The Russia that Putin is constructing has changed of the postSoviet hopes of freedom to a bastion of gas and petroleum for its new elite ex- KGB.
<seg>Indeed, Matthias Warnig, the main executive of the partnership of the pipeline that Schroeder will preside, is friend of long time of Putin.
<seg>Wall Street Journal informed earlier this year that Warnig, that directs the Russian branch of Dresdner Bank, agent of the Stasi, the secret police of Eastern Germany, and knew Putin at the end of years 1980 when the Russian president was in Eastern Germany like spy of the KGB.
<seg>The fact that the Russians tolerate a government of ex- members of the KGB, for those who the lack of compassion and the intolerance to the dissent are the norm, it reflects its exhaustion of the uproar of last the twenty years.
<seg>Now the Kremlin seems to think that what is good for the common Russians is good for the independent countries also: to the small and weak countries compassion will not be had to them once Russia obtains the tools to intimidate them, to isolate them and to threaten them the possibility of a blockade power.
<seg>Like ex- Chief of State of just independent Lithuania, frequently I had to support those threats.
<seg>The European Union has signed numerous agreements with Russia including one of “common space” for the freedom and justice.
<seg>The Kremlin is very good to pretend that idealismo.
<seg>Its control on Eastern Europe always prevailed on the treaty base “of friendship”, and the Soviet invasions to Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were “brotherly” missions.
<seg>But it is necessary to see how Putin abuses that “common” space: the brutal treatment to the chechenos, the industralist Mikhail Khodorkovsky in prison, the harassment to the ONG's, the false accusations against the colideresa of the Revolution Orange of the last year, Yuliya Tymoshenko, on the part of Russian military solicitors.
<seg>If the European seriously take their common space for the human rights and the freedom, must recognize that those values are not shared by the calculating civil servants of the Kremlin de Putin.
<seg>The same happens when it is considered to Russia as an ally in the fight against the terrorism.
<seg>It is in conceivable truth that the Earth of the “red terror”, with countless crimes without punishment of the Soviet era, and which takes blood signs from Lithuania to the Caucasus, it will offer a reliable aid to stop the threats to the world of Iran and North Korea?
<seg>It seems more probable that the cold minds of the Kremlin simply will operate each crisis as an opportunity to increase to their destructive power and its influence.
<seg>During decades, my region of Europe was left at the mercy of the evil.
<seg>For this reason, I cannot remain been silent while Europe encounters blindly towards a new pacification.
<seg>We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have learned by our legacy that behind each diplomatic act of Russia hides an imperial ambition.
<seg>European the western ones, that has gotten rid of this legacy, would have to listen to our warnings.
<seg>The dependency of Russia - if its present face is the one of “the supposedly charismatic one” Gerhard Schroeder- only will even take to the abyss.
<seg>The bullets and the votes of Iraq
<seg>When the war of Iraq began in 2003, the administration Bush had very ambitious plans: like in Germany and the Japan of after 1945, a long and pacific occupation was anticipated, during which the increasing petroleum production would assure an increasing prosperity as the democratic structures were constructed one to one.
<seg>The base would be a liberal constitution, even posmoderna, yet and the guarantee of a 25% of curules of the parliament for the women.
<seg>In Iraq of today there is peace nor no prosperity.
<seg>The constitution that will be put under voting the 15 of October includes that rule of 25%, but by the others it is much of being liberal.
<seg>The key disposition (article 2) of which no law can contradict “the unquestionable rules of the Islam” violates the basic principle of the parliamentary sovereignty and will prevent that the legislation it fulfills the international standards.
<seg>For example, the age for the sexual consent cannot be fixed by above of the nine years, because same Mahoma had a wife of nine years.
<seg>one follows there that the children of nine years are also adult according to the penal law and are subject to the maximum pain by, we say, to become to another religion.
<seg>Of ampler way, the Shia can use that disposition to put to their Ayatolas over the elect parliament, like in Iran, because only they are authorized to determine the “rules” of the Islam.
<seg>To the liberal foreigners and the few Iraqians this Islamic disposition worries to them mainly, but the opposition generalized of the Sunnite to the constitution is directed to other dispositions: the exclusion of the “Party Ba'ath Sadamista” of the political life and the government and the dispositions federalists that give autonomy to the 18 Iraqian provinces and allow them to be combined to train regional governments.
<seg>The rule of the exclusion is a personal question for the elite of the Sunnite --including a thousands of industralists, profesionistas, even artists-- because, with few exceptions, all were member of the Ba'ath.
<seg>In theory, the constitutional prohibition could be interpreted like applicable only to future.
<seg>But actually, now administrative rules are being applied to exclude the member calls “of high rank” of the Ba'ath of any type of governmental use and thousands have been affected.
<seg>Perhaps the Sunnite would accept the dispositions federalist if they were applicable only to the Kurds.
<seg>They know that the alternative is not a return to the centralism, but the secession of the three provinces of Kurd majority of Dahuk, Arbil and As Sulaymaniyah to form an independent Kurdistán, with its own property, army (the Pesh Merga) and oil production around Kirkuk --that it has the second place in reserves of Iraq.
<seg>The Sunnite reject the same federalism for the Shia because they consider brothers Arab that always have accepted the Sunnite government in the past and they will return it to accept --unless they have his own government.
<seg>That is what the new constitution would allow, because the provinces of Shiite majority in the South --where it is most of the oil reserves of Iraq-- they could train its own regional government.
<seg>To the usual style of the Middle East, the Sunnite leaders disappointed and displeasures with the constitution threaten the violence now.
<seg>But federalism is not the reason for which the Sunnite islamists that preach the supremacy mount their mortal attacks.
<seg>Its opposition is more elementary: they do not accept the democratic principle of government of the majority.
<seg>Instead of it they look for to restore the government of the Sunnite minority.
<seg>For the islamists, anyway the Shia deserve the death, by apostates.
<seg>A Shiite leader, Moqtada Sadr, also are against firmly federalism.
<seg>Their followers are the Shia, illiterates in their majority, poorer and violent of the slums of Baghdad and other places whose “Mahdi militia” fought against the American troops in 2004, even though these were protecting the Shia of the attacks of the Sunnite.
<seg>Like very young priest who derives his authority from his dead father --an Ayatola Populist--the alive Ayatolas of Iraq, who despise their ignorance and violence, are against Sadr.
<seg>Sadr cannot compete of any way with them as far as religious authority, reason why it often adopts an Arab nationalistic position against them, remembering who highest Shiite priest, Ayatola Sistani, is Persian, nonArab.
<seg>Of similar way, it remembers its followers to him who the Hakim, who head the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq and their militia “Badr” was exiled subsidized in Iran --and many of them fought of the side of Iran in the long and bitter Iran-Iraq war-- until the Americans brought “them of return”.
<seg>Sadr is against federalism because a Shiite regional government would obey to his enemies, Sistani and the Supreme Council and, he maintains, would fall under the Iranian influence.
<seg>In order to emphasize its message, Sadr sent to its men to attack the Badr militia, successfully in Baghdad, where the Mahdi is numerous, but without him in Najaf, where it is hated to Sadr by the destruction that brought about the past year --until the Americans massacreed their men.
<seg>He was already bad to deal with Sadr like bandit; the simple political Arithmetic says now that it will be probably the central figure to decide the result of the vote that will be carried out in October on the constitution.
<seg>In order to reject it and to force to new elections for a constituent assembly, the opponents need a majority two third parts in at least three provinces.
<seg>It is probable that the Sunnite only win in two provinces, but Sadr orders its followers to him of the slums of Baghdad that vote “not” along with the local Sunnite, it could cause that they gained in the capital those who are against the constitution, which would assure his defeat.
<seg>Like political rowdy, Sadr by all means is arranged to be sold.
<seg>The past year looked for to him by murder.
<seg>Now it wants money, recognition like statesman and the humiliation, at least implicit, of Sistani and the Supreme Council.
<seg>It could receive supplies and perhaps the negotiations already have begun.
<seg>But some Shia whom he attacks with words and bullets have to thousand of followers armed and think that only him bullets would be due to offer.
<seg>The fall of the secret police
<seg>As it could verify prime minister of Hungary, Ferenc Gyurcsany, when an recorded confession of which his government was lying urged disturbances, directness in the government is not something that arises easily in the new democracies of East Europe.
<seg>Like Hungary, Rumania post-Communist has fought to sometimes increase to the transparency and the honesty in which she was one of the closed societies more of the world.
<seg>While we fought, the continuous secret gave rise to a corruption explosion and abuse authority.
<seg>Nevertheless, finally there was a real progress towards the directness, recognized by the European Union when it gave to Rumania green light him to add itself to the EU at the beginning of 2007.
<seg>Besides reaching what the EU today considers a “market economy in operation”, there were fundamental political and legal changes, that I myself I supervised like minister of Justice, that go from a greater transparency and control of the financing of the political parties to a shock of the judicial power.
<seg>The judicial reforms, as well, are helping to exile the corruption.
<seg>Rejections against ex- ministers of cabinet and ministers in functions, members of the Parliament, judges, public prosecutors, lawyers, police and customs inspectors, and other officials government, as well as directors of private companies were emitted.
<seg>Also, new forms standardized for the declarations of assets were introduced and I interest financiers from whatever it has an official position in the government, Parliament, the public and local administration and the judicial system.
<seg>The new declarations are most detailed in Europe and, more important still, they become public.
<seg>The progress of Rumania is confirmed by a report spread at the beginning of this month, where sample that the access of the citizens to the information of the government in East Europe today is equivalent to the one of the established democracies.
<seg>In fact, the report, Transparency and silence, realised by the Pro-Justice Initiative of the Open Society (available in www.justiceinitiative.org) indicate that, somehow, the old woman democracies have something to learn of the new ones: certain governmental agencies in Rumania were more sensible to the orders of information of the citizens who other comparable agencies in France and Spain.
<seg>Specifically, in Rumania it was responded to 60% of the presented/displayed orders, compared with 31% in France and 24% in Spain.
<seg>Other countries that have a good performance are Peru and Mexico, where laws of freedom of information in 2002, shortly after that were adopted in Rumania.
<seg>However, to obtain access to sensible information in democracies in transition not always is easier, and I can give account of it by my previous work like lawyer of human rights for the Helsinki Committee of Rumania.
<seg>Often we had to resort to the court to force a revelation of information, appealing to the Law of Freedom of Information of 2001 of Rumania.
<seg>For example, even when we gained a case that he had to do with the access the registries of monitoring of telephone calls authorized by the general solicitor, the solicitor simply ignored the judicial order.
<seg>We presented/displayed a civil action against the solicitor and the judge imposed a fine by every day that retained the information.
<seg>But just when we captured the attention of means was that the data were disclosed -- that they detailed the amount of monitoring of telephone calls authorized in the 10 previous years, against whom and inasmuch as time.
<seg>With its publication, Rumania began to move away of its past dominated by the Securitate.
<seg>Nowadays, within the government, I am conscious that sharing information with the public sometimes it is difficult.
<seg>But when it is necessary to implement painful reforms, there is no alternative.
<seg>We could not have implemented the economic and political reforms that were worth an entrance to us like member to the EU if we had not put under our policies the scrutiny public, and accepted public the participation major in the decision making that inevitably goes of the hand of this directness.
<seg>It is more, this has become sine qua non one of the democratic government anywhere in the world.
<seg>When the United States adopted their Law of Freedom of Information in 1996, it was added to the exclusive company of Sweden and Finland.
<seg>Today there are almost 65 countries that count on this type of laws.
<seg>In Rumania, who fought by a law of freedom of information made a total use of her.
<seg>As it leaves from the study of Pro-Justice Initiative, to those who asked for information of the government of Rumania voluntarily offered the type to them of information that would have been unthinkable to hardly disclose few years before.
<seg>The Rumanian Ministry of Defense, by case, revealed the amount of personnel of the Armed Forces that died in 2003, as well as the causes of death (among them 13 suicides, two shootings and two deaths in combat in Afghanistan).
<seg>In the same way, it was requested to him to the court of Bucharest that informed on the amount of judges disciplined since the beginning of 2000, even the arguments for any applied sanction.
<seg>The Court transferred the ask the Council Superior of the Magistrature, that offered a complete answer: a list of four pages of all the sanctioned judges, with details of the reasons and the sanctions.
<seg>This type of information is as much a product as a motor of the continuous reform.
<seg>Not always he was comfortable for those who are in the government, and still exists a critical reluctance on sensible documents.
<seg>But, in the ex- communist block, the benefits that implied the transparency have been undeniable.
<seg>At the same time, the experience of Rumania demonstrates that the official secret continues being a threat for the medullary values of the democratic gobernancia, and that only the constant monitoring, as much in the democracies established as in the young people, can prevent that their limits are transferred.
<seg>To save the trees of the life
<seg>Nobody can spend a day without using a product that comes from a forest.
<seg>More than the majority of people account, the paper occurs on which we wrote, the water that leaves our faucets, the medicines that heal to us, the wood that constructs to our houses and furniture, all are originated in forests.
<seg>The forests produce the fresh air that we breathed and are the habitats of species in danger.
<seg>Also they provide recreational opportunities to us, more and more important in our complex world.
<seg>Approximately 1.5 billions of the poor men who live in countryside of the world depend on the forests for basic needs like food and firewood.
<seg>Nevertheless, the deforestation continues.
<seg>Every year we lose 14.6 million hectares (145,000 km. squared) of forests, an area almost four times the size of Switzerland.
<seg>The irresponsible forest handling, accentuated by the bad regulation and application of the laws on the part of the governments, and the markets that award the illegal cutting are conspiring to end the most valuable and threatened forests of the world.
<seg>Once the forests begin to disappear, generally a evils set takes place environmental, social and economic somehow affects that us to all.
<seg>The island of Sumatra, in Indonesia, is a good example.
<seg>The producing companies of pulp and paper are carrying out a rampante and illegal destruction of forests that contain the richest diversity of plants of the world.
<seg>It is probable that in the way plants still disappear to discover, as well as species in danger like the rhino and the elephant of Sumatra, and the orang-outang.
<seg>When the forests of Sumatra disappear, complete communities of people will be with a little suitable place to live and without a decent way to gain the life.
<seg>Still more, the distortion of the global markets caused by the produced product commerce of cheap and illegal way produces disadvantages for the companies that demonstrate social responsibility.
<seg>The developing countries are losing 15 billions of dollars to the year of income by taxes, due to the illegal cutting.
<seg>To make matters worse, the demand of wood for the reconstruction after tsunami of the past year is intensifying already the untenable demand that exists on the forests of Sumatra.
<seg>Threats similar to the forests are evident in the Amazon and the River basin of the Congo.
<seg>The recent Evaluation of Ecosystems for Milenio (EEM) of the UN sample that the forests of some regions of critical importance are in frank declivity due to the evil handling, and that will continue disappearing unless serious measures are taken.
<seg>The information disclosed by the government of Brazil indicates that the deforestation of the irreplaceable forests of the Amazon, due to factors like the conversion to agricultural earth, reached the 2.6 million hectares (near 26,000 km. squared) the last year, taking the deforested area total from the Amazon to a 17%.
<seg>But the battle against the deforestation is not lost.
<seg>Diverse organizations, environmentalists and companies worried about the state of the forests of the world are uniting forces to revert the reforestation and to improve the handling of the forests.
<seg>For example, the World-wide Bottom for Naturaleza (WWF) and the World Bank have helped the government of Brazil to begin an initiative that created more than 17 million hectares (179,000 km. squared) of new protected forest areas, such as national parks.
<seg>The alliance between the WWF and the World Bank also motivated to the associates to this initiative to create a fiduciary fund to administer to perpetuity these protected areas.
<seg>Of similar way, a meeting summit between the governors of the countries of the River basin of the Congo had as result an extraordinary cross-border cooperation on conservation and handling responsible for the forests.
<seg>As well, this produced an initiative of 53 million dollars of the Department of State of EE.UU to promote the forest conservation of the Congo.
<seg>Ever since the governors met for the first time in 1999, 3.5 million hectares (more than 33,700 km. squared) of new protected areas they have been created in the River basin of the Congo.
<seg>However, given the effects of tsunami Asian of December, the weight of the evidence provided by the EEM and the statistical ones on deforestation in wooded regions of key importance, our efforts must continue.
<seg>The World Bank and the WWF recently were committed to be united in a effort to help to reduce the rate of global deforestation in a 10% for year 2010, and to work with other institutions of the sectors public and prevailed for the profit of ambitious objectives of forest conservation.
<seg>The studies of the WWF demonstrate that if the forests of the world are divided in a combination of uses and types (what includes protected areas, commercial forests handled of responsible way and reclaimed wooded landscapes) we can give answer to the world-wide forest product needs, while we conserved important environmental and social resources for the future foreseeable.
<seg>The leaders of businesses, the governments and the organizations of the civil society must play their role to make reality this vision.
<seg>Are fanatical the saudíes?
<seg>The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have caused that many not only question the perspective of survival of the governing House of the Sauds, but they are asked if the kingdom is essentially dysfunctional and destructive.
<seg>Of some way, it seems that the Saudi society has produced a torrent of violent fanaticism that is inspired by extreme the religious Orthodoxy.
<seg>The fact that 15 of the 19 kidnappers of the attacks of the 11 of September of 2001 in EE.UU would be saudíes it crystallized a vision of long data that considers to the kingdom like a bastion of the authoritarianism and the intolerance.
<seg>In some aspects, this perception is exact, but it is not possible to be applied general to the Saudi public.
<seg>On the contrary, it would be a serious error to suppose that fanatical Islam completely defines the saudíes attitudes towards the religion.
<seg>Between 2001 and 2003, I comprised of an equipment that an ample study of the values realised in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and Jordan.
<seg>Our results surprising offer a clarified image of the saudíes attitudes.
<seg>In comparison with the survey ones of other countries of the Middle East, the saudíes were generally less monks, and their attitudes towards the democracy and the marriages agreed also indicate an underlying moderate current.
<seg>It is clear that in the four countries religiousness is a generalized phenomenon: more of 90% of the survey ones it says to believe in God, in the life after the death, and in the sky and hell.
<seg>But the saudíes seem to be less religious than their companions of Muslim faith.
<seg>The sixty and two percent of the saudíes are described like monks, in comparison with 82% of the Iranians, 85% of the Jordanians and 98% of the Egyptians.
<seg>The Americans also seem to be much more religious that the saudíes, with a 81% of them describing itself like so.
<seg>Part of this variation can be explained by the differences between nations as far as which it means to be religious.
<seg>For example, the Americans can define the religiousness of way different that the inhabitants from the Middle East, with perhaps a smaller adhesion to the religious beliefs that the habitual thing in the Islamic countries.
<seg>This also could partly explain the differences between the Muslim countries.
<seg>But the breach between which the saudíes define as religiousness, on the one hand, and the definition of Iranian, Jordanian and the Egyptians, on the other, are so great that it puts in prohibition the predominant perception of which Saudi Arabia is a religious and highly preservative society.
<seg>In fact, the actions speak more than the words: only 28% of the saudíes said to participate in the weekly religious services, comparison with 27% of the Iranians, 44% of the Jordanians, 42% of Egyptian and 45% of the Americans.
<seg>These results, although they lay for a direction opposed of the popular perceptions about the Saudi culture, are less surprising of those than they seem.
<seg>For the sociologists of the religion they have argued much that, in a monolithic religious atmosphere or when the religious institutions are closely tie to the state, it declines the general religiousness of the public.
<seg>She has sense to think that when the state authorities make strict codes obligatory of conduct, people tend to rebel themselves and to move away officially of the sanctioned religious institutions.
<seg>Therefore, not it is to surprise that Egyptian and Jordanian, that lives in countries where the state does not force to exert the mercy, are more religious than Iranian or the saudíes ones, that must do against “virtuous” a local policy endorsed by the state.
<seg>In the subject of the marriage many saudíes even expressed liberal visions surprising.
<seg>The survey ones were divided almost by equal parts in the question on the agreed marriages, with near half supporting the idea that the marriage is due to base on the consent of the parents, while a 48% preferred to the love as the base of the marriage.
<seg>Given to the ingrained segregation by sort and the dominion of the parents, this result seems to reveal a fort desire of a greater freedom of individual option in which traditionally it has been a decision that takes the family.
<seg>Finally, the saudíes turn out to be enthusiastic those in favor of the democracy, contradicting again the popular image of Saudi conservatism.
<seg>Of the survey saudíes, a 58% considered to the democracy as the best form of government, a 23% did not agree, and a 18% did not express opinion.
<seg>The majority support to the democracy in a country that does not have a secular and nationalistic previous history seems something in opposition to which it would be possible to be intuited.
<seg>In fact, the endorsement to the democracy corresponds with a series of other liberal attitudes that we found in Saudi Arabia.
<seg>Those in favor of the democracy tend to be less religious, more secular, more tolerant towards the others, critics of the performance of the public sector and to be more worried more about the western cultural invasion.
<seg>Beyond the data of the study, the history has shown that the liberal ideas become more popular when a despotic monarch weathervane to the town in alliance with “establishment” religious.
<seg>At the end of century nineteen a strong liberal current arose in Ottoman Syria, in response to the religious despotism of the Sultán Abdulhamid.
<seg>At the same time, it appeared in Iran a secular and anticlerical movement in favor of the constitucionalismo, a reaction to the absolutist alliance between the Shahs Quajar and the religious institutionality.
<seg>In view of the present similarities between these historical precedents and conditions in Saudi Arabia, we would not have to discard the possibility of a reform.
<seg>Now the data of the studies suggest also would not be strange to see the saudíes demanding political a more transparency and a less interventionist religion.
<seg>The European museum
<seg>By the end of century XIX, Europe basically saw Asia like a source of inspiration for its artists or a center of imperial ambition.
<seg>The Asians, on the other hand, saw Europe like a model of modernity, in Japan Meiji, or a barometer of decay, like in China.
<seg>A century later, the Japanese economic miracle had transformed the image of at least a small part from Asia to the European eyes into a place of fast technological and industrial progress.
<seg>Now, in the first years of the 21st century, the perception of Europe in Asia and Asia in Europe is changing drastically, in a while in which the economies of Asia are in height whereas the European Union is gotten bogged down in a crisis of identity and confidence.
<seg>Several prominent Asians, like the ex- leader of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, today are noticing the European that if follows with their present course, Europe quickly will become irrelevant for everything except for the tourism and the exclusive properties.
<seg>A prominent Chinese industralist who divides his time between Hong Kong and London was still more specific.
<seg>In a deprived encounter of high leaders industralists and politicians in Paris weeks ago, it said: “You European them are becoming a country of the Third World, spend time to debate mistaken subjects -- the constitution, the beneficient state, the crisis of the pensions and, systematically, offer the erroneous answers to the questions that raise”.
<seg>The visions that have the European of Asia generally, and of China in particular, are more complex and oscillate between the gracious adaptation to a competitor new and respected and the pure ideological rejection.
<seg>In May of 1968, in France, the students -- or some of them, by less than took the streets to invent a new world dreamed about maoísta China, a China in means of the brutal Cultural Revolution and without sense.
<seg>Its absurd obsession and barroca were as much the product of the ignorance of the crimes of Mao like the result of the boredom in a prosperous society where unemployment practically did not exist.
<seg>Today, however, their heirs criticize the Asian capitalist model abiertamente.
<seg>Yesterday, China was a anticapitalist north for the utopian revolutionaries; today one has become a ultraliberal Nemesis for a new generation of utopian reactionaries -- the defenders of the status quo in Europe.
<seg>The students who declared in the streets of Paris recently do not want to become like Chinese or the Indians; they reject the logic of the globalisation and they refuse to resign to social guarantees that as much cost to win.
<seg>The European economic elites perceive to China and the India of very different way.
<seg>Today they are totally conscious that his slightly nostalgic post-colonial vision of these countries as great markets of export and deep reservorios of cheap manpower are expired.
<seg>China and India became genuine competitors who deserve respect, if nonsimple admiration.
<seg>The quality, the costs and the times of delivery in the automotive industry, about case, are reaching the European level.
<seg>Europe conserves an advantage in terms of pure science, like in the pharmaceutical industry, but the companies of world-wide class that are arising, particularly in India, every time are in better conditions for contracting withdrawn of the MIT and Harvard, maintaining, at the same time, the low costs of manpower and, therefore, the global competitiveness.
<seg>Unfortunately, although the European leaders recognize the Asian challenge, they did not know to also use it like a test of reality in the irresistible process of globalisation and like a call to the arms in social and economic terms.
<seg>To tell the truth, he would be right to say that the European politicians, with some exceptions, like Tony Blair, took in fitting their visions of the world in agreement with the revolutionary rate of the change in Asia.
<seg>Catched between their lack of strategic vision in the long term and its obsession by the short term interests, the political leaders of Europe to a great extent did not manage to gain the respect of their Asian pairs, unlike the European companies, to which he goes to them far better to the Asian eyes.
<seg>By all means, in a continent that could not bury its past and practically close the door to them to the nationalistic ghosts, the European Union often is seen by the Asians like a model of reconciliation, peace and prosperity.
<seg>But the performance of Europe would continue decaying, would survive this perception?
<seg>Perhaps the Asians would get to consider the European model like a political version of Venice -- a place to almost visit with nostalgia by its glory past and admiration by its quality of museum.
<seg>Red and the blue ones
<seg>The change of Condoleezza Rice by Colin Powell in the Secretariat of State of State of the EU demonstrates that the recent presidential election of that country continues having strong repercussions.
<seg>But to understand what is what it says to us the election on the United States is important not only for the Americans but for the world.
<seg>The presidential voting of this year is test that the American democracy enjoys good health, but that some things could improve.
<seg>Unlike which he happened in the elections of 2000, when President Bush lost the popular voting and as soon as he gained the voting in the Electoral School, this time prevailed by 3,5 million votes.
<seg>Although some democrats follow suffered, cannot seriously be questioned the legitimacy of the victory of Bush.
<seg>The United States follows divided in red states (republican) and blue states very (democratic).
<seg>If 100.000 votes had been different in the red state from Ohio, John Kerry would be the president (although with minority popular voting).
<seg>The Electoral School was included in the constitution of the United States to protect to the small states in a federal system, but now it means that the political campaigns concentrate mainly in a dozen of states where the public opinion is very divided.
<seg>At a more fundamental level, to choose presidents without a popular majority has something of indecoroso.
<seg>For this reason, it is time to celebrate a serious debate to amend the constitution in order to abolish the Electoral School.
<seg>Some observers also complain the rhetoric and the divisive propaganda that characterized to the campaign.
<seg>But that must be seen from an historical perspective.
<seg>At the time of the Founding fathers, the newspapers were extremely partial and to George Washington him consternaba the hardness of the political language.
<seg>During great part of his first years --not to speak of the Civil War and Reconstruction country so it was divided as now and the aggravated thing of the campaign rhetoric reflected the closed thing of the competition.
<seg>At the same time, in spite of the negative propaganda in both sides, the three debates televised at national level raised important subjects in a serious format and had a great hearing.
<seg>Generally, it is probable that a president with an increasing economy is reelecto.
<seg>In that sense, the surprising thing in the case of Bush was the little thing who was its majority.
<seg>To a large extent that had to the unpopularity of the war of Iraq.
<seg>Kerry tried to do of the war, of the low rate of creation of uses, of the inadequate attention to the health and of the reduction of taxes of Bush to the groups of high income the central subjects of his campaign, but some observers felt that never constituted a message clearly.
<seg>Bush talked back with preoccupations on the security against the terrorism and cultural Populism in subjects as the marriage between homosexuals and the right to the abortion.
<seg>In the end, the security and cultural Populism won to economic Populism.
<seg>The interpretation of the election been has influenced by the exit surveys in which it was asked to them the voters (after to have voted) what subjects concerned more to them.
<seg>The majority (22%) responded that the “values morals”, in comparison with 20% that talked about the economy and 19% that the terrorism mentioned.
<seg>The social conservatives interpret this because they were who gained the election for Bush and who its agenda must predominate in the next period of the President.
<seg>But a survey of Pew raised one week after the election indicated that the category “values morals” included an ample range of subjects besides the right to the abortion and the marriage between homosexuals.
<seg>In fact, the surveys show that 25% of the population support the marriage between homosexuals and 35% are in favor of legal civil unions for pairs of homosexuals (the position whom Kerry defended).
<seg>However, for 37% that is against those marriages, mainly in center red of the country, the subject helped to mobilize those in favor of Bush to go to vote.
<seg>One more a more important question is if the EU is divided irremediably.
<seg>The electoral map of red and blue has given rise to jokes and cartoons in Internet on the secession of the two blue coasts of the red center of the country.
<seg>Some call “Costopía to him”.
<seg>But the division is not so clear.
<seg>Many states in both sides gained by little margins, and if the map concerning counties and not of states reddens, great part of the country is seen quite mulberry.
<seg>Cities against suburbs and countryside are one better description than coasts against center.
<seg>Indeed, the opinion surveys indicate that the majority of the Americans is concentrated in center moderate of the political phantom and not in both extreme.
<seg>But the political elites, like the militants of parties and the members of the Congress, usually are more extremist than the public.
<seg>At the outset that seems amazing, because they must have incentives to move to the rich center in votes.
<seg>But many members of the Congress represent districts that are safe for their parties and the threat to its re-election is in the primary ones, dominated by the wings more activists and extremists of the parties.
<seg>This tendency is reinforced by the growth of the television by cable, that attracts the viewers by means of controversiales programs of “infotenimiento” and bloggers of Internet that establish ferocious controversies without no publishing filter.
<seg>A reform to change the borders of the electoral districts in order to make them more competitive would help to alleviate the problem, but few of the congressmen in functions would vote to make modifications that could increase their risk of defeat.
<seg>The closed thing of the result indicates that Bush gained a mandate for the change smaller than he seems to believe.
<seg>Before the difficult problems of foreign policy, fiscal and social that one faces, it would do or in turning around towards the center instead of to conciliate to its preservative base, but still it is not clearly if there will be to reign the policy of the convictions or the one of pragmatism.
<seg>How to get rid of the habit of petroleum
<seg>The chancellor Angela Merkel turned the treatment of the climatic change into a high priority in the agenda of Germany for his presidencies of the EU and the G8, that begin in January.
<seg>There am a concrete proposal here, sufficiently general so that leaders consider the world-wide it they accept and it, and sufficiently clear so that other governments and understand it to companies: nothing else that to determine a date, in the next summit of the G8, from which the cars fed petroleum no longer can circulate more in the main industrialized countries.
<seg>A decision of this nature would have highly positive an economic and geopolitical impact.
<seg>The true cause of the preoccupations of today in the matter of energy is not the fall of the world-wide petroleum reserves, but rather that petroleum the internal production of the great consumers - Europe, the United States and China will decay at the precise moment in that the increasing Asian demand saturates the market.
<seg>The reserves available will be concentrated more and more in the Middle East, simply because the supply in the rest of the regions will be run out before.
<seg>It is more, the main petroleum exporter are not arranged to subordinate its policies of investment to the requirements of the market.
<seg>Saudi Arabia tries to handle its oil production of independent way, whereas Iran scares to the investing potentials with its bureaucratic obstacles and their corruption.
<seg>Iraq suffers a lack of security and the foreign investors in Russia find impediments to each step.
<seg>Those four states lodge half of the oil reserves verified of the world and the two third parts than potentially it would be possible to be exported.
<seg>All this, not them production costs, is the central reason of the high prices of petroleum and the fights of closing oil contracts in central Asia and Africa.
<seg>To think that the high prices of petroleum are good because they serve the environment is to ignore some initial datas of the international policy.
<seg>First, in many of the African and Asian countries more poor men, the petroleum imports represent a significantly greater portion of the national cost that in the industrialized countries, which implies that the economic growth and the social development are in danger, at the same time as they watch new crises of debt.
<seg>The rents of the petroleum production make difficult the reforms in the main exporting countries.
<seg>Thanks to his lubricated financial strength, regimes as those of Venezuela and Iran every time feel less restricted by the international rules.
<seg>Just arrived at the universe of the consuming nations, as it is the case of China, they imitate the old habits of the industrialized West, with its historial length to ignore the abuses of the human rights in order to be able to assure lucrative agreements with authoritarian and rich regimes in petroleum.
<seg>Only the political and economic heavy weights of the world, the main industrialized countries that continue being, by far, the consuming hydrocarbon majors, can initiate a change at global level.
<seg>The change must begin by the sector of the transport, that represents more than half of the present petroleum consumption -- a proportion that probably increases in the future.
<seg>Therefore, the countries of the G8 would have to be put in agreement to prevent that all automobile fed petroleum of the 2025 circulates in future.
<seg>This decision would not aim against individual mobility, but against the dissipation of a limited resource that is needed with more urgency to produce synthetic materials.
<seg>The political leaders would not have to privilege any technology in particular.
<seg>It is more, would have to offer to the automotive industry incentives to him to develop alternative technologies that are based on biomass fuel, hydrogen and until natural gas during a period of transition.
<seg>The countries leaders from a political point of view will offer to them to the internal industries, as a benefit collateral, a position of leadership in the matter of technology energetics, assuring future markets.
<seg>In this eventuality, the awaited significant reduction of the carbon dioxide emissions could bring prepared the necessary point of flexion in the international policies in the matter of climate.
<seg>But also the economic development enters game: to cure our “addiction” to petroleum would leave more petroleum him to the poorest countries, less developed and recently industrialized, at the same time as it would force the fall of the prices and would alleviate the geopolitical competition by the energy.
<seg>From a geopolitical point of view, the benefits would be equally obvious, since the capacity of the main petroleum exporter would be reduced markedly from chantajear to the industrialized countries.
<seg>This could increase the power of negotiation of the international community in the Middle East, and could fortify to the social forces in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia that seriously wish to promote the political and economic reform from inside.
<seg>For being a technologically advanced country and one of the main producers of automobiles, Germany can to propose an initiative of this nature.
<seg>Merkel, that has a doctorate in physics and initiated its political race being minister of Environment (presiding in 1995 the first conference of the Marco Convention of the United Nations on the Climatic Change), can have more credibility at the time of approaching this question that anyone of its colleagues of the EU and the G8.
<seg>The hour arrived from a brave sample of leadership.
<seg>The myth of the commerce and the aid
<seg>The commerce and the aid have become words fashionable at international level.
<seg>A greater attendance (including the forgiving of the debt) and a greater access to the markets of the rich countries for products of the poor countries seem to be in the first place of the global agenda.
<seg>Indeed, the debate nowadays is not envelope what to do but how much to make and what so fast.
<seg>In all this the clear lessons of last the five decades of economic development are lost.
<seg>Between most important it emphasizes that the economic development is to a great extent in the hands of the same poor nations.
<seg>The countries that have been the past recent successful in it have obtained by means of their own effort.
<seg>The aid and the access to the market rarely have played a role critical.
<seg>We consider a country that has free and preferential access to the markets of its greater neighbor, than in addition is the most powerful economy of the world.
<seg>We suppose on the other hand that country can send to million its citizens to work across of the border, that receives an immense volume of investment and that totally is integrated to the international chains of production.
<seg>In addition, to the banking system of the country it supports the disposition demonstrated by its rich neighbor to serve like moneylender of last resource.
<seg>The globalisation cannot be better, certain?
<seg>Now we consider a second country.
<seg>This one faces a commercial embargo in the greatest market of the world, it does not receive foreign aid nor no type of attendance of the West, is excluded from international organizations as the WTO and is prevented him to request loans of the IMF and the World Bank.
<seg>In case those external disadvantages were not sufficiently debilitadoras, this economy also maintains its own obstacles lifted to the international trade (as commerce of State, tariffs of import and quantitative restrictions).
<seg>As the reader guesses, he is real countries: Mexico and Vietnam.
<seg>Mexico shares a border of 3.000 kilometers with the United States, which gives not only access him privileged to the markets labor and of goods, but also the facility to resort to the bottoms of the Treasure of the EU (as it were demonstrated in the crisis of the weight of 1995).
<seg>In resistance, the United States maintained a commercial embargo against Vietnam until 1994, established diplomatic relations until 1995 and during years after that more it did not give treatment of favored nation to the imports of that country.
<seg>Vietnam follows outside the WTO.
<seg>Now we consider its performance economic.
<seg>Ever since the TLCAN in December of 1992 was signed, the economy of Mexico has grown to a rate annual average of as soon as 1% in terms per capita.
<seg>This not only is very below the rates of the economic superstars of Asia; also it is a fraction of the own growth of Mexico during the decades that they preceded to the crisis of the 1982 debt (3,6% annual between 1960 and 1981).
<seg>Nevertheless, Vietnam grew per capita to an annual rate of 5,6% between the beginning of its economic reforms in 1988 and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the EU in 1995, and since then it has continued growing an accelerated rate of the 4,5%.
<seg>In Vietnam a dramatic diminution of the poverty occurred, whereas in Mexico the real wages fell.
<seg>Both countries underwent noticeable increases in international trade and foreign investment, but the situation is completely different in which it matters more: to elevate the standards of life, mainly those of the poor men.
<seg>What these examples demonstrate is that the internal efforts prevail on any thing to determine the economic fortune of a country.
<seg>All the opportunities that the market of the EU gave Mexico could not resist the consequences of the errors of political intern, mainly the incapacity to revert the real appreciation of the type of change of the weight and to extend to the rest of the economy the improvements in the productivity reached in a limited range of export activities.
<seg>What it matters more is if a country adopts the correct strategy of growth.
<seg>Without no of the advantages of Mexico, Vietnam applied a strategy concentrated in diversifying its economy and improving the productive capacity of its internal suppliers.
<seg>The amplest experiences of the postwar period support the conclusion that the political interns are most important.
<seg>South Korea took off at the beginning of the decade of 1960, not when the external aid was in its apogee, but when it was retiring gradually.
<seg>Taiwan did not receive external aid nor preferential access to the markets.
<seg>China and India, the two economic superstars of today, has prospered to a great extent by means of efforts sui generis of reform.
<seg>It turns out tempting to attribute the rare African successes --Bostwana and Mauritius-- to the outer demand by his exports (diamonds and dresses, respectively), but that it is only part of history.
<seg>Obvious both countries would be considerably more poor men without access to the foreign markets.
<seg>But, like in other cases of successful development, distinguishes which them are not the external advantages that they own, but its capacity to operate them.
<seg>One sees what other countries have done with their natural resources.
<seg>The word “makes shine like diamonds hardly” evokes images of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.
<seg>Of similar way, few of the manufacturing zones of exports that proliferate in the world have reached the results that are observed in Mauritius.
<seg>Nothing of the previous thing acquits to the rich countries of its responsibility to help.
<seg>They can cause that the world is less cosy for the corrupt dictators --for example, sharing more financial information and not recognizing the international contracts that sign.
<seg>Also, to increase the number of workers of poor countries to which it is allowed to work in rich countries and to give to a greater margin for the policies oriented to the growth by means of the relaxation of the rules of the WTO and the conditions of the EU would produce a greater impact of development in the long term.
<seg>It is not clear that to extend the access to the markets and to increase the aid they constitute the most productive use of valuable political capital in the North.
<seg>The development is due to concentrate not in the commerce and the aid but in improving the atmosphere of policy in the poor countries.
<seg>And now who is employee?
<seg>If the great Argentine economist Raul Prebisch lived at the moment, without a doubt she would be asked if the world is the other way around.
<seg>Its theory of the “dependency”, that had a great influence, argued that if the poor countries depended too much on the primary product export never they would reach the industrial depth necessary to sustain an accelerated growth.
<seg>They would be flooded, however, in a cycle of decreasing prices of the raw materials at global level and a decreasing participation of the income.
<seg>The answer of favorite policy of Prebisch, protectionism, was disastrous for the many Latin American and African countries that did case to him.
<seg>But the fact is that during many years, Prebisch rightly seemed to have predicted the long term tendencies of the prices of primary products.
<seg>The implacable advances in the agriculture and the extraction of resources pressed to the loss the prices of the raw materials, mainly during the Eighties and ninety.
<seg>With few exceptions, the countries that were concentrated in the export of those products had very poor performances, whereas many Asian countries with few resources went ahead.
<seg>Nevertheless, nowadays, as the Asian giants, India and China, are united to the global economy, the prices of petroleum, the gold, the wheat and almost all the other raw materials are increasing of explosive way.
<seg>Although there will always be cycles --for example, the prices of petroleum probably will fall before they return to begin to rise-- the tendency of long term of many primary products will stay clearly to the rise during some time.
<seg>What many commercial negotiators and another person in charge of the design of policies seem still not to have recognized, although Prebisch would have realized, is immediately that these dramatic events have great implications for the global balance of the power.
<seg>Indeed, perhaps no other aspect of the economic globalisation will have to raise challenges majors to the world-wide leaders in the next decades.
<seg>There are many questions.
<seg>Are preparations the rich countries of today for an era of codependency in which they need so much the raw materials as the developing countries need the industrial imports and the technology?
<seg>They are preparations for the inevitable flow of being able and influences towards the producers of raw materials as these are made rich much more?
<seg>How will face the two superpowers of the world, China and the United States, to the fact that there are exporting important primary product regions in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia that are full of States nation badly formed?
<seg>Some autoconsagrados prophets describe the problem like one of finite natural resources in which the world is remaining without raw materials critics to an alarming rate.
<seg>Nowadays, many endorse the theory of the “tip of Hubbert” on the oil production, that maintains that we have arrived at the upper limits from the capacity from production, the wells are being dried and everything will get worse from now on.
<seg>Nevertheless, as it indicates the outstanding historian of petroleum, Dan Yergin, the prophets of the misfortune already has declared at least four times that the world is remaining without petroleum.
<seg>Every time, the threat evaporated due to radical improvements in the technology.
<seg>At the end of century XIX, the extraction of petroleum implied to dredge with mules.
<seg>At the moment nobody is surprised of the perforations 3.000 meters under the marine bottom.
<seg>There have been similar improvements in all the sectors of the metal mining and agriculture.
<seg>No, the world is not on the verge of remaining without raw materials.
<seg>What happens, however, is that the integration of 2,5 billions of people (nothing else China and India) to the global economy are producing a change in the demand that surely will exert much greater pressure to the rise on the prices of the raw materials of which any technological advance can compensate.
<seg>Thus, at least during next the 50 to 75 years, and perhaps until the humans at some time begin mining Mars operations of the coming centuries, the prices of many natural resources will rise.
<seg>Will be destabilized the world-wide policy by the re-balancing of the global economic power that is come off it?
<seg>World War I, by all means, exploded partly by the German preoccupation of which the other colonial powers had a very high proportion of the world-wide provision of petroleum and raw materials.
<seg>Also, in Japan World War II it feared for the stability of its foreign petroleum supply and other natural resources.
<seg>Will arise similar tensions between China, with their deficiency of resources (and where the water shortage is even probema) and the West?
<seg>Luckyly this does not seem probable at the moment, mainly given the sober and pragmatic approach of the Chinese leaders as far as its problems of resources.
<seg>The Chinese are watching towards regions like Africa with the hope to find stable commercial partners.
<seg>They do not share the political proselytism of the Americans, who not only want to deal with the exporter of raw materials but also to turn them.
<seg>On the other hand, also they are the American leaders who speak to cause that the United States is self-sufficient in their power supply.
<seg>But that is in essence a joke: obliging with they themselves, perhaps, but self-sufficient, never.
<seg>He is comprehensible that great part of the Arab world considers the invasion of Iraq as the angular stone of the true strategy of the United States to make sure a stable provision power.
<seg>If they are in the correct thing, only we have left to hope that the United States has a plan B.
<seg>Meanwhile, the prices of the raw materials will continue rising and at the moment the petroleum exporter are the majors responsible for the enormous commercial deficit of the United States.
<seg>Perhaps the American strategy of today is to deal with having to the exporting countries of raw materials as much that these must depend on which the United States is contented.
<seg>That is something that Prebisch never would have anticipated.
<seg>The option of hard line of Iran
<seg>It is probable that the election of the mayor of hard line of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to be the next president of Iran makes worse the relations with the West and the international isolation of the country.
<seg>Nevertheless, in internal terms, it is probable that to the Islamic regime it goes to him better than with if had been a more moderate result.
<seg>It is clear that Ahmadinejad has a base of real support.
<seg>But that has appeared like a Populist, who has spoken to help the poor men, that he has condemned the operation of the government and who has acted almost as opposition candidate is irrelevant: he was the chosen one of the regime and in the end he received official aid even against other candidates of hard line.
<seg>The regime played its cards of shining way.
<seg>It turned to Hashemi Rafsanjani, slightly more pragmatic and than it was not in agreement with certain present policies, in the figure of the “system” and to its own man in the rebel.
<seg>Thus, the government used the feelings against the system to revitalize his control.
<seg>The fact that last president, Muhammad Khatami, supported the reformist movement --although of timid way and in the end he did not obtain anything-- simply he emphasizes the so absolute form in that the governors turned around the political situation.
<seg>Ahmadinejad is a representative of the youngest activists of the revolution against the Shah of a quarter ago of century.
<seg>Directly it was involved in the capture of the American hostages in Iran, although to what degree is something debatable.
<seg>Most worrisome of everything it is that he is near both main groups that represent the most extremist elements of Iran: the Body of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard and the Basij organization.
<seg>First it is a parallel army in favor of the regime; second she is an organization who intimidates the opponents and those who look for one more a more open society.
<seg>Nevertheless, the preoccupations from which a still more radical leadership has taken the reins in Iran mitigate by two factors.
<seg>First, it is probable that Ahmadinejad is concentrated in internal subjects, to try --with it is not clear what success degree-- to improve the standards of life of Iranian the more poor men.
<seg>Secondly, the same group that has had the control from the revolution will continue taking care of outer the ideological policy and.
<seg>The president has less powers than it seems, eclipsed in particular by Supreme Guía, the Ayatola Ali Khamenei.
<seg>However, the election of Ahmadinejad dazzling clarifies the challenge that Iran raises to the western policy and the stability of the Middle East.
<seg>First of all, se�a sends to one a the most extremist elements of Iran and to the terrorist clients of the country --Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas and the Islamic Jihad in peque�os Palestine and several groups that operate against Arab Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other countries-- of which they have green light to mount attacks.
<seg>It is probable that they suppose that Iran will support any thing that does.
<seg>Outwards Iran often has been relatively cautious, but at concealed level it has been sponsoring the most important one of the terrorism at world-wide level.
<seg>Sometimes certain Iranian civil servants can have acted by their account when ordering and to coordinate specific operations. Now they will feel that they have more freedom to do it.
<seg>In addition, Ahmadinejad supports the program of Iran abiertamente to obtain nuclear weapons.
<seg>The majority of the Iranian politicians --at least those to which the government allows them to operate abiertamente-- they support the program, but they incline by a more discreet and cautious approach.
<seg>Rafsanjani, for example, preferred to construct better economic relations with the West that to advance in the nuclear front.
<seg>If Ahmadinejad is president of a nuclear Iran it is more probable that it uses the arms of ventured way.
<seg>That does not mean it would detonate that them rather but would use that them with aims of diplomatic blackmail, taking the threats concerning crisis.
<seg>Since leaders Iraqian proclaim on a daily basis his desire to erase to Israel of map and to fight against the EU (Ahmadinejad trampling a photography of the American flag when he went to vote), the risk of a confrontation has increased.
<seg>Finally, it is probable that Ahmadinejad is more determined to subvert the stability of Iraq and its victory will encourage to the civil servants and Iranian radical extremists who are in this country.
<seg>Iran already is sending many agents to Iraq and supporting clients who want to turn it into a clone.
<seg>The Iraqians, including the Shiite Muslims --that the Iranians practice the same version of the Islam that-- they reject that interference generally.
<seg>It is probable that one more a more militant position of Iran increases the frictions with Iraq and generates more antiAmerican violence in that place.
<seg>In summary, the electoral result of Iran is dangerous, although what so destabilizing is it will depend on the actions of Ahmadinejad and the degree of power that Khamenei gives him.
<seg>In addition, to deal with an Iran so abiertamente extremist --radical even for the landlords of hard line of the regime-- it will be a challenge not only for the EU but also for Europe.
<seg>will �Intentarán the European countries to pretend that the militant rhetoric and the provocations of Ahmadinejad do not matter and that a diplomatic solution to the nuclear ambitions of Iran can be found?
<seg>With Rafsanjani it would have been easy to maintain an agreement or a farce of cooperation true.
<seg>But with Ahmadinejad a high level will be needed pacification so that the smaller diplomatic process even can continue.
<seg>Some Iranian exiled reformists and are glad of the election of Ahmadinejad, because they allege that its administration will let see the real face of the regime and will erase the western hopes to reach an agreement.
<seg>Nevertheless, also it can represent the success of the regime in co-opting the dissatisfaction with a quarter of century of Islamic government.
<seg>Whatever result, for the West the triumph of Ahmadinejad means that everything what has to do with Iran will be had to claentar still more.
<seg>To clear the poor men to give the rich ones
<seg>President Bush seems certain to ruin the budget of the USA for the next years.
<seg>When Bush assumed the position, it was possible to anticipate a future of practically uninterrupted budgetary surpluses.
<seg>Today, by means of a combination of reductions of taxes impelled by the republicans, an economy in deceleration, deflates of the bubble of the shareholding market and a massive increase in the cost of defense, the fiscal horizon is dominated by enormous deficits.
<seg>Worse things come, since the Administration Bush and the Congress dominated by the republicans are preparing a deepening of the fiscal chaos.
<seg>The damage that will probably do will debilitate to the USA and will add instability to the world-wide economy.
<seg>Traditionally, the American Republican Party preferred budgets balances.
<seg>This changed with the Administration Reagan, when the preservative republicans favored the reductions of taxes, even at the cost of the sprouting of great budgetary deficits.
<seg>President Reagan said to him to the American town that he could enjoy reductions of taxes, a military increase and the continuation of his favorite programs of cost, all at the same time.
<seg>It is not to surprise that the result was a series of vast budgetary deficits that took years to repair.
<seg>As much President George Bush father as Bill Clinton had to increase the taxes to fix to the chaos of the era Reagan.
<seg>These tax rises probably contributed to the defeat of President Bush father at the hands of Bill Clinton in 1992.
<seg>And nevertheless Clinton decided, bravely, to complete the process to restore the fiscal balance, partly to protect the financing of long term of the program of retirement of the Social Security.
<seg>When Clinton left the position in the year 2000, the budgetary situation was the best one in decades.
<seg>Then President George Bush Jr came to again play the role that Reagan played: great reductions of taxes, a great increase of the military cost and a continuation or even expansion of the popular programs of cost.
<seg>The result was predictable.
<seg>In January of 2001, one projected that the accumulated budgetary result for years 2002-2011 would have a surplus of $5,6 trillions of dollars.
<seg>In the middle of 2002, these projected surpluses had vanished.
<seg>In view of the change in the economic conditions and the shade of a war in Iraq, it would be possible to be hoped that the Administration Bush and the Congress dominated by the republicans would be cautious at the time of proposing new reductions of taxes.
<seg>But no, its greater priority is to put in use new tax reductions that will benefit mainly to the rich ones.
<seg>At the same time, the Administration is proposing great increases in the military cost.
<seg>With the presidential election of November of 2004 in the horizon, we can be sure that it will not have you cut important in the cost programs nonmilitary man.
<seg>Thus it is that it seems that the massive budgetary deficits arrived to remain.
<seg>If the internal cost simply stays constant like a fraction of the national entrance, the accumulated budgetary result for next the ten years will be a combined deficit of $1,5 trillions.
<seg>Perhaps but this number is optimistic, since probably it does not include suitably the costs of a possible war in Iraq, or another round of reductions of taxes, or the risks of majors interest rates in the next years.
<seg>Why to the republicans worries to them so little all this chaos?
<seg>To some republicans it matters to them plus whom the taxes of the rich ones stoop which almost any other thing.
<seg>Others in this way think that the deficits will force to make important cuts in the internal cost of government, reducing the size of the state, which is its wanted desire more.
<seg>The problem with this last point of view is that to the majority of those who pays taxes they like the internal programs and they will not very easily support the application of important cuts in the cost.
<seg>One more a more worrisome question is why the Americans vote by such policies, when they would have to know that they will only cause problems.
<seg>An answer is that many voters do not see the imminent budgetary problems.
<seg>One better answer is than the majority of the Americans did not vote in fact by these policies.
<seg>The participation in the elections of 2002 was of only a 40%, of which only half supported the republicans, or near 20% of the permissible voters.
<seg>By all means, the perspective do not have why to be so black.
<seg>The war in Iraq can be avoided.
<seg>The propose reductions of taxes can be rejected or be left.
<seg>But I inside predict great budgetary deficits in the coming years and an increasing sensation of disquiet and outside the USA about its macroeconomic situation.
<seg>The foreign investors can decide to stop financing the budget of the USA and the deficits of current account in favorable terms.
<seg>The dollar can be debilitated and can intensify the preoccupations about the inflation.
<seg>All this can do that who design the policies of the USA they have less confidence and are less flexible in its answers to the “economic shocks”.
<seg>It is probable that the poor men, inside and outside the USA, undergo the worse part, when President Bush and the Congress say to him to the American town and the world that, due to the great budgetary deficits, is money no to face the problems of poverty, health and education.
<seg>Unless the common and current Americans take brings back to consciousness about these fiscal risks, the rich ones could be with another gift of thousands of million dollars, while the country and the world undergo the sad consequences during many of the coming years.
<seg>Lessons of the fiscal imprudence of the United States
<seg>George W. Bush has contributed more to the ruin of the economic policy of the USA that no other president of American history, even surpassing its mentor, Ronald Reagan.
<seg>In three years in the power, it has hardly destroyed a fragile political consensus for whose construction one decade had been necessary, and that it could take another decade to reconstruct.
<seg>When doing it, Bush has put in risk the social stability and the economic solidity of long term of the United States.
<seg>Since the budgetary challenges of long term that the USA is handling of so bad way are not exclusive, the fiscal errors of the USA provide important lessons for other countries.
<seg>The main problem with the fiscal policy is that the politicians can be made popular when reducing the taxes and be temporarily increased the cost public, generating an enormous national debt and leaving its payment for the future.
<seg>This trick can last a few years, but more early than behind schedule défitits budgetary and the increasing national debt will force to take painful one step backs in this policy.
<seg>However, a cynical politician can manage his re-election and already to perhaps be distant when the crisis explodes.
<seg>One could be imagined that, after hundreds of similar episodes of fiscal irresponsibility anywhere in the world in the last decades, the voters would be allergic to tricks like these.
<seg>And, nevertheless, it is doing it to Bush again, buying popularity when distributing massive reductions of taxes, while simultaneously it increases the cost military and it even lifts the cost of education and health.
<seg>The result is a budgetary deficit equivalent to more of 5% of the GGP.
<seg>What is worse is than the budgetary perspective of long term of the United States already were problematic before Bush began its irresponsible policies.
<seg>The population of the USA is aging, so that there will be a radical increase of the costs of public health and the systems of pensions.
<seg>A careful calculation sample that is probable that the future income under the policies favored by Bush are insufficient in several tens of trillions of dollars to finance the costs of the public pensions, the attention of health and other fiscal expenses waited for by the public.
<seg>In some point of the future it will be necessary, therefore, to radically increase the collection of taxes, to drastically reduce the public cost, or both, to correct the actions of Bush.
<seg>Then, why support the public these policies?
<seg>Because it understands or these consequences of long term worry to him little, even if finally they end up damaging to the majority of the Americans.
<seg>Of assumptions, the richest contributors are in favor happy because they received the main part of the reductions of taxes.
<seg>Incredibly, richer 5% of the American contributors almost received half of the tax reductions, and clearly these rich contributors hope that the other 95% (the middle-class and the poor men) most of support to the cuts in the cost and the increases of the taxes that there are to apply in the future.
<seg>Meanwhile, Bush has convinced many poor voters and of middle-class that must be happy also, without saying that they will have to pay to them its small reductions of taxes with you cut to much majors in the future governmental services, if the policies of their administration persist in the long term.
<seg>If the Americans had political memory, would understand that already they were in this “fiscal hunting” once in the pasts 20 years.
<seg>Ronald Reagan also arrived at the power promising great reductions from taxes and important increases in the military cost.
<seg>The result was an enormous budgetary deficit in the middle of the 80.
<seg>The reductions of taxes enormously made Reagan popular they helped and it to gain the re-election in 1984.
<seg>It was necessary more than one decade (beginning by the second period of Reagan, and following in the periods of George Bush father and Bill Clinton) to be able to return to a budgetary surplus.
<seg>By all means, this meant to approve new increases tax, which cost the re-election to him to George Bush father and lead to the polarized political atmosphere of the 90.
<seg>It is almost certainly history will be repeated.
<seg>Some ideologists of right of the administration Bush think that the present fiscal deficits finally will force to drastically reduce the social cost of the government.
<seg>They hope to dismantle programs like the Social Security and Medicare.
<seg>But the American public supports these social programs firmly.
<seg>So that the rightist strategy to reduce taxes first to force to realise you cut in the social programs later it will not work, and sooner or later it will be necessary to increase the taxes.
<seg>Others in the administration Bush argue that the reductions of taxes are important to remove to the USA from the recession.
<seg>This argument also is mistaken.
<seg>The economy of the USA could have been recovered without the reductions of taxes, and perhaps of still more solid way.
<seg>In any case, it is a great error basing tax policies of long term on the commercial cycle of short term.
<seg>There are two vital lessons for other countries.
<seg>First it is that the increasing budgetary deficits of the USA sooner or later will limit the international power of the United States.
<seg>The Americans only supported the war of Iraq because they did not have to pay it with an increase in the taxes.
<seg>When it is put to them before the dilemma to choose between adventures and majors abroad imposed, it is much less probable that they support expensive combat operations in the outside.
<seg>In fact, the USA will be divided deeply when the public must face the fiscal chaos left by Bush.
<seg>The second lesson is that the countries would have to plan their budgets taking into account the increase of the fiscal costs of a population that ages.
<seg>The budgetary conditions of long term rarely are clear for the contributors or the parliament.
<seg>One would be due to demand the governments who present/display budgetary evaluations of long term along with their annual budgetary proposals, with the purpose of to reduce the tendency to the political manipulation of short term in the budget.
<seg>The USA can serve like early warning for other countries.
<seg>The White House would have to give the other the same warning that the magicians give the viewers: “They do not try this in its houses”.
<seg>The policy in the stock market
<seg>Many economic and financial analysts complain which the governments of the emergent countries often manipulate too much their shareholding markets and that these are politicians than economic more.
<seg>The tacit assumption apparently, on the contrary, some pristine force of the economic nature directs the stock markets in the advanced countries, and that, therefore, to foretell their performance are like foretelling the growth of the trees.
<seg>That description of the shareholding markets of the emergent countries is not erroneous, but only partial, because also it is applied to the markets of the advanced countries.
<seg>Indeed, the best analysts know that to foretell the performance of the stock market of any country she to a great extent means to foretell how much she loves the government that prospers the investors in the political atmosphere of the moment.
<seg>We see the shareholding market of the United States, the major of the world by much.
<seg>The general perception is that the government leaves the companies peacefully and that the dividends that turn out to invest in the shareholding market reflect the fundamental forces of robust a capitalist economy.
<seg>This is one of the reasons for which the EU is a magnet for the investors worldwide.
<seg>But the dividends that make so attractive to the shareholding markets of the EU reflect a delicate political balance.
<seg>In particular, the tax rates that affect the actions have varied with time as they change the political pressures.
<seg>For example, during World War II, the political support to the great fortunes fell and the government considerably increased the taxes to the gains of the capital, to the dividends and the high income generally.
<seg>When World War II produced a solid recovery of the Great Depression of the thirty, President Roosevelt and the congress added a tax to the excessive gains to guarantee that the shareholders did not benefit too much.
<seg>In resistance, in 1980, when there was no war but the shareholding market walked loose, the American voters chose Ronald Reagan, a man to whom many considered too much rightist to be president.
<seg>It asked - and obtain-you trim to the taxes on the gains of the capital, the dividends and the entrance.
<seg>The political interference in the stock market is not limited the taxes on the gains of the capital, the dividends and the entrance.
<seg>The taxes on the property, the consumption, the imports and the sales - all which pay the corporations to them direct or indirect-can have an effect extended on the corporative gains and, for this reason, on the shareholding market.
<seg>It is not chance that in all the places where the stock markets bloom, the governments are careful of which the taxes do not destroy the net corporative gains.
<seg>Indeed, the policy in the shareholding markets does not finish with the taxes.
<seg>On the contrary, almost any activity of the government has an impact on the corporative gains and, as well, on the stock market.
<seg>After the collapse of the shareholding market of 1929, the government of the EU suspended the antitrust activities, to allow that the companies obtained a monopolistic power that lifted its value.
<seg>That policy delayed the recovery of enormous unemployment, but not even that was able to control to the political forces ready in favor of the support to the stock market.
<seg>Of similar way, one of the most important things that he did President Reagan was to destroy great part of the power that they had left to the American unions, which compete by his portion of the corporative gains.
<seg>The defeat that inflicted Reagan to the strike of the air controllers in 1981 was parteaguas for the American union movement - and the stock market, that its dramatic bullish tendency in 1982 initiated.
<seg>The government of the EU has been particularly aggressive in supporting to the stock market from the climax of the bubble of the prices of the actions in 2000, mainly trimming the interest rates in repeated occasions.
<seg>By all means, that policy was justified in terms of stimulating to the economy, not to support to the shareholding market.
<seg>But the one that perceived that one of the fundamental factors that they weighed on the economy was the price to the loss of the actions is an eloquent sample of the importance of the shareholding market of the EU.
<seg>Indeed, the answer of the authorities was not limited the monetary stimuli.
<seg>Cuentas National of Entrance and Product of the EU show that the effective rate of taxes to the corporative gains (the percentage of the gains that in fact is pleased to the government via taxes) arrived at a top of the 33,7% in the first trimester of 2000 - the apogee of the stock market and the economy in general-and fell to the 20,2% in the fourth trimester of 2003, when the market was low.
<seg>Great part of that declivity reflects the explicit measures of fiscal support that approved the congress, as well as the perception between the corporations of which in present the economic and political atmosphere they can be more aggressive in the evasion of taxes.
<seg>In addition, after the collapse of the stock market, the maximum tax on the dividends of the actions was reduced from 35% to 15%, which gave a substantial advantage to the long term investors and reinforced the composed effect to reinvert the net dividends.
<seg>Again, this tax cut was justified in terms of stimulating the economy, which, by all means, can be said of almost any directed measurement to support the stock market.
<seg>But what determines that justification is credible it is the balance of the political forces.
<seg>It could say that, during last the 200 years, the same variables, including the hostility towards the high taxes and a weak union movement, have operated in the EU - and that therefore is to hope that they continue operating in the future, producing high dividends in the shareholding market and attracting enormous flows of foreign investment.
<seg>Those that thinks that the investments in the stock market of the EU will maintain a strong tendency of good growth during decades could be right.
<seg>But it is necessary to know what is what it is being foretold.
<seg>Essentially, not only predictions are becoming on economy, but also on the policies - and perhaps on the values cultural-that give form to the strategies and to the economic performance.
<seg>The global house
<seg>The houses are the local, ingrained investments in a place determined like a tree, and, therefore, growing or marchitando themselves in response to the local economic conditions.
<seg>Everybody happens like a lightning through the screens of our televisions, but the market of our houses, constituted almost in its totality by local fans, follows planted there, in our own back patio.
<seg>Soon, nevertheless, all this could change.
<seg>From now until a month, stock-market Mercantile of Chicago (CME), in collaboration with my company, MacroMarkets, and also with Fiserv and Standard & Poor's, will send to contracts of futures and options on the real estate prices in ten cities of the United States.
<seg>The contracts will remember on the Indices of Real estate Prices of S&P/Case-Shiller, that was generated from the academic work that my colleague Karl CASE and I initiated almost twenty years ago.
<seg>During many years, we have been campaigning in favor of the future ones on the house, but, until now, no stock market wanted to use this type of indices to create a market of futures.
<seg>The markets of future on the prices of the house will allow investors worldwide to indirectly invest in properties in the United States, buying interests in them through these markets.
<seg>An investor in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo will be able to invest in houses occupied by his owners in New York, Los Angeles and Fertile valleys.
<seg>A fundamental principle of the financial theory -- “diversification” or “distribution of risk” - the interest in new contracts suggests will be high.
<seg>The individuals and the companies in New York, for example, are exhibited to their local real estate risks, so that they would have to reduce this risk selling future on the prices of the house in New York.
<seg>People in Tokyo will assume part of this risk buying future on the prices of the house in New York if the price is appropriate.
<seg>The New Yorkers will continue living in their own houses, but now they will have distributed the risk of the investment to world-wide level.
<seg>A genuine market of futures has not been tried on single-family houses from 1991, when stock-market of Futures and Options of London (that today is part of Euronext.liffe) failed in its attempt to send a similar market in Great Britain.
<seg>That attempt never generated much volume of transactions.
<seg>Stock-market organized a celebration and nobody came.
<seg>The British markets of investments in margins (spread-betting), and some retail markets online, never did not represent much either.
<seg>Will be different this time?
<seg>Without a doubt, to send a new market always is an uncertain proposal: people want to only go to celebrations if much people go; if there is nobody, she does not want to go.
<seg>In the same way, in the markets without many investors, sufficient operations like generating the returns cannot be executed necessary they attract that them.
<seg>As usually it happens to the great celebrations, a mystery can be how they take the new substantial markets, but we know that, from time to time, it happens.
<seg>The initial indicators suggest an increasing interest in the operations with future on the prices of the house, mainly because the fact that it is spoken as much of “real estate bubble” emphasizes the importance of diversifying the risk.
<seg>After the announcement of CME, one of its competitors, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, it said that it has glided to create contracts of futures and options in the main North American regions, that will be based on the real estate price half published by the National Association of Real estate agents.
<seg>Nevertheless, beyond the strong public interest in investing in house and taking shelter of the risks that this entails, another critical question must be solved so that the markets of futures are successful: the prices must be revealed and the investors must understand what means these prices.
<seg>I believe that there are very good possibilities that many of these markets of futures soon foretell falls of substantial prices in some North American cities in the next year.
<seg>They will be in which the operators call “backwardation” (inverted market): the future price in the market today is minor who the present price of a house.
<seg>Perhaps this phenomenon does not take place the first day in which the future ones are commercialized on the house, but is good probabilities that this happens in a matter of months.
<seg>Perhaps we need “backwardation” in some these markets if they are going to act its as.
<seg>It is known that there were a gigantic real estate explosion in many of these cities (and other parts of the world) in the last years.
<seg>It is probable that the international investors do not want to invest in these cities unless the expectations of a fall of the prices are based on the markets of futures, as the people of Tokyo from her own ominous experience know well.
<seg>But the phenomenon of “backwardation” is sufficiently strong, until the investors who think that the North American real estate market goes way to a fall still will be able to wait for a good return of the future ones on the prices of the house, because they are already obtaining a lower price in the market of futures.
<seg>However, some adjustments will be necessary so that the New Yorkers who want to protect their own real estate investments sell contracts of futures that have a built-in fall of prices.
<seg>They will have to be accustomed to the idea that the market already waits for the fall and that they can be protected only by that margin of possible losses of future prices that they exceed this expectation.
<seg>Perhaps to tell the truth, this type of adjustments in our way to think takes place when really we see the prices of the market of futures.
<seg>Until now, the future course of the prices of real estate was simply a question of diverse opinions.
<seg>When the markets anywhere in the world create an international consensus on the future price of the house in cities, we will be better preparations to control the risks that face these cities and, thus, of stabilizing its economies -- and our own lives.
<seg>What the news move the markets?
<seg>The stock markets to a large extent of the world have registered marked cumulative falls from approximately the 10 of May. Generally, the losses took place in a period of two weeks until around the 23 of May, but the prices continued falling in average since then.
<seg>The problems in the stock markets of the world are translated in problems for the world-wide economy?
<seg>We analyze the fallen majors.
<seg>Of the indices of the main countries, the most important landslide took place in India, where the prices of the actions fell 16.9% between the 10 and the 22 of May.
<seg>The fiasco in the other side of the globe was almost so important and the tips and simas happened a day or two after those of India: in Argentina, the prices of the actions fell 16.1%; in Brazil, 14.7%, and in Mexico, 13.8%.
<seg>The European markets also suffered great losses.
<seg>In Sweden, the prices of the actions fell 15.2% between the 9 and the 22 of May; approximately in the same period, the prices fell 9.7% in Germany, 9.4% in France and Great Britain and 9.3% in Italy.
<seg>In the same way, in Asia, the prices of the actions fell 11.5% in Korea, 9.3% in Hong Kong and 8% in Japan, in approximately the same period.
<seg>Many analysts try to tie these facts with the happened thing in the United States.
<seg>But the prices of the actions fell there as soon as 5.2% between the 9 and the 24 of May.
<seg>China either does not seem to be behind the global fall, since the prices of the actions there, in fact, increased during this period.
<seg>The current explanation of the economists turns around the monetary policy.
<seg>Immediately after the great fear of 2003 deflation, the central banks worldwide lowered their interest rates, which as much untied a speculative bud in the stock market like in the real estate one.
<seg>But now, according to this vision, the interest rates in rise are beginning to feel, which foretells future falls in the prices of the assets.
<seg>This argument, in fact, really has an important quota.
<seg>The Federal Reserve of the United States indeed increased to the rates the 10 of May and his president, Ben Bernanke, indicated then that perhaps there were others you raise of rates in the future.
<seg>The 17 of May occurred to know discouraging data on the inflation in the United States, which suggests is in folder a future monetary adjustment.
<seg>To the economists they like to think that the world is logical and manageable, which implies that they understand what she is happening.
<seg>But, when doing it, usually they exaggerate the paper of the central banks.
<seg>In fact, the increase of the rate in the United States was only one in a series of you raise of rates -- the sixteenth consecutive one.
<seg>No other important central bank increased the rates after the falls of the stock markets between May and the 7-8 of June began, when they did it to several (the European Central bank, India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).
<seg>Another factor is the price of the petroleum, that increased to 24% between the 22 of March and the 2 of May, marking records all along.
<seg>Without a doubt, this one was an important fact that possibly it affected the stock markets anywhere in the world.
<seg>The increases in the price of petroleum have been responsible practically for all the economic recessions from World War II.
<seg>Even so, the increases in the price of petroleum do not correspond with the period in the middle of May in which the indices of the stock markets fell more resoundingly.
<seg>To say that the increases in the price of petroleum caused the falls in the stock markets estimates a period of delay of several weeks.
<seg>But the stock markets are not very logical, and could have an answer delayed to the shocks of the price of petroleum.
<seg>As it happens to any other price in the financial markets, one raises to flame the attention.
<seg>When the prices of petroleum raise quickly, people watch the tie news to the prices of petroleum and speak a more on the prices of petroleum, creating therefore greater sensitivity to these news.
<seg>The crisis in the Middle East is tie to the prices of petroleum and dominated the news in the month of May.
<seg>The increases of the price of petroleum possibly amplified in the mind of the investors the ominous signals and the strong language used by several political figures.
<seg>The 8 of May, in response to the hostile declarations of the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, vice Israeli prime minister, Shimon Peres, said that “the president of Iran would have to remember that to Iran also it is possible to be erased of the map”.
<seg>In the same way, almost the beginning of the landslide of the stock markets of May, Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia, the country more colonising with the world with a Muslim majority, and the 13 of May newspapers published that the students of two of the most prestigious universities of had ovacionado it to the country standing up.
<seg>This history could be interpreted like a test that bravuconería of Ahmadinejad on the nuclear question was redituando to him politically, which feeds the perception of which the tense situation in the Middle East could derive in still more high prices of petroleum.
<seg>These news can seem remote much more of the stock market that the monetary policy.
<seg>But how the public in front of them reacts, along with the recent increases of the price of petroleum, it can well be responsible to a great extent for the change in the market psychology.
<seg>The attitudes against the risk change all along, and episodes as the declarations of Ahmedinejad and Peres can precipitate this type of changes.
<seg>In this way, while these things happen of ways difficult to quantify, perhaps the analysts would have to pay equal attention to him to the words of Ahmadinejad that to those of Bernanke when they try to understand the direction which they take the stock markets of the world.
<seg>Perhaps to the economists they do not like to concentrate itself in the public opinion and how it interacts with the changes of prices, the news worldwide and speculative dynamics.
<seg>After all, to do implies it that the economic facts they are less predictable (and the economists, less omniscient) than to them likes to think.
<seg>But this approach has sense in which to intuition respecta.
<seg>What happens, really, by the mind of the investors?
<seg>Ahmadinejad is a charismatic figure; Bernanke, no.
<seg>Ahmadinejad is embarking in an adventure; Bernanke no.
<seg>And, perhaps most important, Ahmadinejad is a destabilizing influence; Bernanke, no.
<seg>In fact, whichever it is their fundamental cause, the falls of half-full of May in the prices of the actions anywhere in the world indicate a psychology of unstable market.
<seg>Hill to think that they were related solely to opinions on a possible monetary policy and not with more important and deeper questions, like the energy and the political tension, that prop up the performance of the world-wide economy.
<seg>Why to pay more by fairness?
<seg>Marks & Spencer, a chain of supermarkets and clothes with 400 stores in all Great Britain, announced recently that it is turning all their branch of coffee and tea, with a total of 38 lines, to Fairtrade, a marketing symbol that represents a “ethical production”.
<seg>The chain already sells only tea and Fairtrade coffee in its 200 cafeterias Revive Coffee.
<seg>Also it is fomenting the purchase of shirts and other products made with Fairtrade cotton.
<seg>The announcement took place during “Fairtrade Fortnight”, a promotion of two weeks of Fairtrade products that included tours where agriculturists of developing countries told the British how Fairtrade attends its communities.
<seg>The movement towards a more ethical consumption also made important advances in the United States, since the consumers incline, more and more, by organic foods locally produced and eggs of hens that are not locked up in cages.
<seg>In Great Britain, a survey determined that half of the people whom was to them the Fairtrade symbol recognized it and understood that it talks about products that represent better conditions for the agriculturists of the Third World.
<seg>A comparable investigation in the United States, but from related data does not exist, and of discussions with my own students, it is inferred that the number would be much smaller.
<seg>The retailers who look for a Fairtrade certification must pay to the producers a price that covers the costs with a viable production and offers a wage that allows them to live.
<seg>For example, the minimum price for the coffee is of 1.26 dollars by 450 grams, does not matter how much the price of market can have fallen.
<seg>If the price of market raises over that number, the price of Fairtrade will increase so that it continues costing five cents more by each 450 grams.
<seg>To the small agriculturists, on the other hand, it is demanded to them to organize in cooperatives or other groups that allow the democratic participation.
<seg>The plantations and the factories can use the Fairtrade label if decent wages pay to them to their employees, if they fulfill the norms of health, security and environment, if they allow them to organize unions or other forms of associations of workers, if they offer a worthy house to the workers who do not live in their own house and if they do not use infantile manpower or forced manpower.
<seg>All are not in agreement with Fairtrade.
<seg>Brink Lindsey, director of the Center for Studies of Commercial Policies of the promercadista Cato Institute, thinks that the campaign of the Fairtrade coffee is “a well-meaning impasse”.
<seg>With certain justification, it maintains that the real cause of the fall of the prices of the coffee was not the monopolizing of the multinationals, but the great increases in the production of coffee in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with new techniques that do possible to work coffee with less manpower and, therefore, with smaller costs.
<seg>According to the opinion of Lindsey, if we want to help the cultivators of coffee, we would have to encourage them to leave the coffee and to produce more profitable cultures -- and here it indicates, pertinently, the commercial barriers and the subsidies of the rich countries like obstacles that must desmantelarse- or happen to products of greater value, like special coffees, that have higher prices.
<seg>The peculiar thing on the argument of Lindsey, nevertheless, is that it would be possible to be said that the campaign of Fairtrade coffee is doing exactly what it recommends -- it encourages to the cultivators of coffee to produce a special coffee with a lifted value more.
<seg>The economists pro-market do not object that the corporations appeal flagrantly to the snobbishness to promote their products.
<seg>If people want to pay 48 dollars by 450 grams of coffee Blue Mountain of Jamaica because that is what James Bond prefers, the economists do not object that the market is being distorted.
<seg>Then, for which being critics when the consumers choose to pay 12 dollars by 450 grams of coffee that, know, was cultivated without toxic chemical substances, under trees that favor the survival of the birds, by agriculturists who can allow themselves to feed and to educate their children?
<seg>The economists could respond that, if one wants to help people to feed and to educate its children, she can pay 10 dollars by 450 grams of coffee that is not Fairtrade but that has the same taste and to give the 2 dollars him that save to a charity organization that gives to food and education him to the poor boys.
<seg>It is a possible strategy, but Fairtrade has its advantages.
<seg>The cultivators know that they must offer a product that they like the consumers, as much by his flavor as by the way in which is cultivated it.
<seg>If its product is sold well, can be proud of to have produced something that people look for anywhere in the world.
<seg>From the point of view of the cultivators, he is preferable to receive an advantage to sell a Fairtrade product that to receive a charity donation which they would receive from all ways, they worked or no, and without concerning the quality than they produce.
<seg>To pay by a Fairtrade label is not more “anti-market” than to pay more by a Gucci label, and more reflects better ethical priorities.
<seg>Fairtrade is not a governmental subsidy.
<seg>Its success depends on the demand of the market, not of the political lobby.
<seg>Luckyly, in Europe, that demand of market is growing quickly.
<seg>It is to hope that soon it reaches similar levels anywhere in the world developed, and where people can choose which are their discretionary expenses.
<seg>Pigs, calves and the American democracy
<seg>In the middle of all the holders who spoke of which the democrats had obtained the control of the Congress of the United States, an electoral result important almost inadvertent step.
<seg>Although it emphasized the defects of the American political system, it gave back the faith to me in the compassion of the common and current Americans.
<seg>In Arizona, the citizens can put under a project of law the direct popular vote if they reunite a sufficient number of companies.
<seg>This year, one of the subjects that appeared in the ticket was a law to prohibit that it was tied or it bordered to a pregnant sow or a bred calf for meat so that prevented the animal to occur him returned freely, to lie down and to extend its extremities completely.
<seg>Those that knows little on the modern young industrial can be asked why it would be necessary that legislation.
<seg>Under the young methods that were universal 50 years ago and that continue being at the moment common in some countries, all the animal have space to occur returned and to stretch their extremities.
<seg>Nevertheless, nowadays around 90% of the young sows -- the mothers of the pigs that grow up and kill to obtain meat, bacon and ham-pass their lives locked up in approximately 60 cages most of that measure cms. by 2,2 meters.
<seg>They cannot occur returned, lie down with its completely extended legs or give more of a step forwards or backwards.
<seg>To other sows to them one stays tied with short cords that also they prevent to occur them returned.
<seg>To the calves it is locked in to them of similar way during all their life in stables that do not allow to occur them returned, to lie down or to stretch their extremities.
<seg>These methods are essentially resources to save work -- they facilitate the handling of the animal and allow the farms that have thousands or tens of thousands of animal to less contract a reduced number of described workers.
<seg>Also they prevent that the animal waste energy moving and fighting.
<seg>Several years ago, after the protests of the organizations of protection of the animal, the European Union ordered to its Veterinary Scientific Committee a report on these methods.
<seg>The Committee stated that the animal suffer when not being able to move with freedom and when not having absolutely anything to do in all the day.
<seg>By all means, the common sense would have taken to the same conclusion.
<seg>As a result of the report, the EU determined dates after which it would be prohibited to border thus to those animal.
<seg>In the case of the calves, the date, 1 of January of 2007, already almost it has arrived.
<seg>The individual stables for sows, that already are illegal in the United Kingdom and Sweden, will be prohibited in all the EU as of 2013.
<seg>Also they are being adopted gradually measured to improve the well-being of the laying hens, to which one stays jammed generally in cages of wire without space to extend its wings.
<seg>In the United States any national measurement of that type is not anticipated.
<seg>Before, when my European friendly asked why the United States so is delayed with respect to Europe in the matter of well-being of the animal, I to me I did not have an answer.
<seg>If they pressed to me, had to admit that the explanation could be that the Americans worry less about the animal than the European.
<seg>Then, in 2002 the defenders of the well-being of the animal included in the electoral tickets of Florida a proposal to prohibit the stables for the sows.
<seg>For surprise of many, it obtained the approval of 55% of the voters.
<seg>The month last in Arizona, in spite of a financed good opposition of the agro-industrial sector, the prohibition of the small cages for sows and calves also was approved with a support of 62%.
<seg>Neither Florida nor Arizona are particularly progressive states -- both voted by George W. Bush and not by John Kerry in 2004.
<seg>For that reason the results indicate firmly that if to all the Americans the opportunity occurred them to vote on the confinement of pregnant sows and calves in so small places, the majority would vote against.
<seg>It seems that to the Americans the well-being of the animal concerns so much to them as to the European.
<seg>For that reason, to explain the difference between Europe and the United States in the matter of well-being of the animal, we must pay attention to the political systems.
<seg>In Europe, the preoccupations of the electing ones on the well-being of the animal have been able to influence the members of the national parliaments and the members of the European Parliament, which has given like result national legislations and directives of the EU that respond to those preoccupations.
<seg>In resistance, in the United States the similar preoccupations have not had an observable effect on the members of the Congress.
<seg>There is no federal legislation on the well-being of the farm animal -- and very few state legislations.
<seg>That, I create, must to that the agro-industrial sector gives tens of millions of dollars to the representatives of the Congress whom they look for to reelect itself.
<seg>The movement by the well-being of the animal, in spite of the ample popular support, has not been able to compete in the sphere of the political lobbying and the donations to the campaigns.
<seg>In the American policy the money counts more than the opinion of the voters.
<seg>The partisan discipline is weak and the representatives must reunite to they themselves the majority of the bottoms that need for their re-election, and that happens every two years in the case of the members of the House of Representatives.
<seg>In Europe, where the partisan discipline is rigid and the parties, not them candidates, are the one who finance the campaigns, the money plays a smaller role.
<seg>In the United States, a nation that is proud of its democratic traditions, not only leaves losing the sows and the calves.
<seg>What has again in the New Afghan Army?
<seg>The multitudinal murder of the Minister of Aviation of Afghanistan (perhaps urged by members of the own temporary administration of Afghanistan) sample that the Afghan society continues being deeply fisurada.
<seg>The first reforms of the Afghan army will only make those divisions ampler.
<seg>The Minister of the Defense of the temporary administration of Hamid Karzai in Kabul already appointed the highest officials of that new army.
<seg>The minister, general Mohammed Fahim, is tayik of the Panjshir district in the north of the country that three months ago assumed the commando of the forces of the Alliance of the North which they captured Kabul after the American bombers clarified the way to them.
<seg>Altogether, their appointments raise a direct challenge to the objective that has Mr. Karzai to reunify to the country.
<seg>Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic nation, being pashtun the biggest group, with two fifth parts of the total.
<seg>Hazara and tayik constitutes everyone near a fifth part of the population.
<seg>Of treintaiocho officials lifted to the general grade by Mr. Fahim, treintaisiete are tayik and the other uzbek.
<seg>If some of the fifteen to seventeen million of pashtun of the country is recruited like soldier, will serve almost under a structure of commando formed in its totality by tayiks.
<seg>The language of pashtun, nevertheless, is so different from tayik as the Spanish of the English and million of pashtun in age to serve in the militia know only a blowing of tayik, in the best one of the cases.
<seg>The geographic profile of the new military leadership is as narrow as its ethnic constitution.
<seg>Treintaicinco of treintaiocho officials of more high rank come from a small area to the north of Kabul, constituted by the Parwan province (in which the airport of Bagram is located) and by the Panjshir valley, that by long time was the fortress of the Alliance of the North.
<seg>Position of another way, the potential leaders of twenty-seven of the twenty-nine provinces of Afghanistan were excluídos of the new military elite of the country.
<seg>Perhaps a group with a base of so little variety could not give the impression that their members conform a hermetic gang if they represented an ample crossed section of the twelve or more divided politicians of the country.
<seg>But that is not the case.
<seg>Eighteen from treintaiocho high commanders come from a party, the Jamiat-e-Islami, the headed Islamic faction for much by the mule and exprofesor of Burhanuddin theology Rabbani.
<seg>This it was the party that governed Kabul in the middle of the decade of 1990, originating the bloodshed and the chaos that caused that the majority of the afghans gave the welcome to the Talibán.
<seg>Almost equaling the amount of members of the Jamiat in the military rank, they are the Communists.
<seg>Sixteen of treintaiocho have been long time aligned with that party, whose stratagems of end of the Seventies took to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89, the one that cost two million and average of Afghan lives.
<seg>Nowadays the majority of the afghans sees the Communists with the same affection that the Czechs or the Poles reserve for the Nazi ones of Hitler.
<seg>Certain, people in Afghanistan, like everywhere, were united to the Communist Party for diverse reasons and of ningua way was all those in favor of the strict ideologies.
<seg>But in the case of the generals of general Fahim six they were used professional of the Communist Party and continued working for him after the invasion of the Red Army.
<seg>The six, besides other three Communists who served like officials of the Afghan army, collaborated actively during the decade of Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
<seg>We imagine how the French would have reacted if a quarter of the existing officer corps in France in the postwar period would have taken the side from the Wehrmacht when it occupied his country.
<seg>In Afghanistan the news travel fast of mouth in mouth.
<seg>The Afghan nationalists (between whom all the afghans count themselves almost) will soon discover the political antecedents of the members of the internal circle of general Fahim, if they do not know them already.
<seg>This sobrecogeedora evidence of unipartidismo and predisposition in the formation of the high commando of the new army could even be neutralized if the generals offered to professionalism and commitment to the patriotic values of true national Armed Forces through their work.
<seg>Unfortunately, the only ten of treintaiocho military promoted by Fahim have acted like professional military officials.
<seg>Eleventh it served like pilot.
<seg>In resistance, twenty-four of the total (the antecedents of rest four are not known) come of the civil society, with any professions, or of the offices of the Communist Party or, in one of the cases, to make race like mule.
<seg>What mean all those statistics in terms of the daily reality?
<seg>They mean that when the American commanders of the international forces for La Paz in Afghanistan, as well as military and diplomats, know Minister Asistende of the Defense of Afghanistan they will find with Abdul Rashid Dostum, a remarkably brutal and corrupt military commandant and communist who stays still in good condition in contact with old woman friendly of the Red Army in Moscow.
<seg>It means that the Head of the Afghan Armed Forces, as well as the Head of Operations and the Head of Military intelligence, are also communist, men whose loyalty is uncertain and of those who distrust the majority of the afghans.
<seg>Is that an equipment that would have the possibility of unifying to the Afghanistan fragmented by the war?
<seg>Will inspire the presence by Kabul of so dudable crew, confidence in the three quarters of the population of Afghanistan that have been excluídos of the high commando of the army?
<seg>Or it is that list, rather, harvests of an approach to the governability of the type “everything for the winner” who is destined (in some future position) to trigger another bloody national reverse into the hands of those whose legitimate interests cynically have been run over?
<seg>The Americans, European and people of the United Nations in charge of the definition of policies would have to weigh those questionings before allowing themselves to allow a ruthless taking of being able in charge of a small and unpopular minority.
<seg>A recognition to the irrational
<seg>My applause for the new Nobel prizes of economy: Daniel Kahneman, of the University of Princeton and Vernon Smith, of the University George Mason of Virginia.
<seg>Like many other Nobel prizes, these awards are a recognition not only to the señero work realised by Kahneman and Smith, but also to the schools of thought that helped to lead.
<seg>Kahneman, that is sicólogo, has demonstrated how the people behave systematically of ways less rational than what the orthodox economists create.
<seg>Its investigation shows not only that the people sometimes act of way different from which predict the economic theories standard, they do but it of way to regulate and systematics, and in forms that can be included/understood and be interpreted by means of alternative hypotheses that they compete with the used ones by the orthodox economists.
<seg>For all the participants of the market (and, in fact, for the common and current observers) this does not seem to be a great newness.
<seg>The agents of Wall s$street who on sale put actions that knew that they did not go merit nothing operated the irrationality that Kahneman and the Smiths have exposed.
<seg>Great part of the fever that lead to the bubble economy based on the operation of the sicología of the investors.
<seg>In fact, this irrationality is not a newness either for the profession of the economists.
<seg>Long ago John Maynard the Keyneses described to the stock market like something based not on rational people who fight to reveal the fundamental rules of the market, but like a contest of beauty in which he wins who guesses the verdict of the judges.
<seg>The Nobel prize of this year is a recognition to the critic to a simplistic market economy, as it made the award the year past (of which I was one of the three winners).
<seg>The awarded ones of the past year put emphasis in which the different participants from the market have different (and imperfect) information, and in that these asymmetries in the information have a deep impact in how works the economy.
<seg>In particular, the awarded ones of the past year implied that the markets were not efficient generally, and that the government had to play an important role.
<seg>The invisible hand of Adam Smith (the idea that the markets take to the efficiency as if handled an invisible hand to them) is invisible, at least partly, because it is not there.
<seg>This is not either newness for those who works day to day in the market (and they do his fortunes taking advantage of and saving the asymmetries in the information).
<seg>For more than twenty years economists have been fascinated by thus calls models of “expectations rational”, that supposed that all the participants have the same (if not perfect) information and that act perfectly of rational way, that the markets are perfectly efficient, that unemployment never exists (except when it is caused by the avarice of the unions or the minimum wages of the governments), and in that never is a rationing of the credit.
<seg>The one that these models have predominated, especially in the American universities, in spite of the evidence in opposite sense, is a testimony of the triumph of the ideology on science.
<seg>Unfortunately, the students of these university programs are the one who now the policies of many countries design, and are trying to implement programs based on the ideas that have come in calling market fundamentalism.
<seg>That not me malentienda: the rational models of expectations made an important contribution to the economy; the rigor that their those in favor imposed to the economic thought helped to put in evidence the weaknesses of many underlying hypotheses.
<seg>Good science recognizes its limitations, but the prophets of the rational expectations have often not shown this modesty.
<seg>Vernon Smith is a leader in the development of the experimental economy, the idea that it is possible to prove several economic proposals in a laboratory environment.
<seg>One of the reasons that the economy is a so difficult subject, and of why there are so many discordances between economists, is the fact that these cannot realise controlled experiments.
<seg>The nature offers natural experiments to us, but in almost all the circumstances so many things change so quickly that often it is difficult to unravel what caused what thing.
<seg>In principle, in a laboratory we can realise controlled experiments and, therefore, make inferences more reliable.
<seg>To the critics of the experimental economy it worries to them that the subjects take to the experimental situations originated ways of thought outside the experiment and, therefore, that the experiment is not so clear and that the inferences not so defined as in physical sciences.
<seg>Nevertheless, the economic experiments provide perspective for an amount of important problems, such as the best design of the auctions.
<seg>What is more important, the irrationality of the participants of the market, that was the center of the work of Kahneman, it has been verified repeatedly in laboratory contexts.
<seg>Between the results funnier than they have arisen from the experimental economy are related to the altruism and the egoism.
<seg>It seems that (at least in experimental situations) the subjects of the experiments are not as egoistic as the economists in their hypotheses have raised it, except in the case of a group: the same economists.
<seg>This must that the economy as disciplines attracts people who are more egoistic by nature or to that the economy helps to form the individuals, doing them more egoistic?
<seg>With certainty the answer is almost a little both things.
<seg>Probably, the future experimental investigation will help to solve the question on the relative importance of these two hypotheses.
<seg>The Nobel prize stresses the important thing that it is to study to the people and the economy as they are, not as we want that they are.
<seg>If we only include/understand better real the human behavior we can hope to design policies that cause that our economies work better also.
<seg>The bad faith of the political energetics of Bush
<seg>In one of the most surrealistic sessions of World-wide the Economic Forum of Davos of this year, the experts of the industry of the petroleum explained how the melting of the polar ice layer -- that it is happening more express than nobody had anticipated represents not only a problem, but also an opportunity: perhaps now it facilitates the access to vast amounts of petroleum.
<seg>Of similar way, these experts grant that the fact that the United States has not signed the Convention of the Sea, the international treaty that determines who has marine access to overseas petroleum and other mineral rights, presents/displays a risk of international conflict.
<seg>But also they indicate the side advantageous: the industry of petroleum, in its incessant search of more reserves, does not need to request the Congress so that it gives the right him to expoliar Alaska.
<seg>President George W. Bush has a strange ability of not seeing the greater message.
<seg>Per years, it has become more and more evident that its political energetics enough is missed.
<seg>Following the dictations of the industry of petroleum, even member of its own party they talked about to a law previous energetics like which “it did not leave any unsatisfied lobbista”.
<seg>While he praises the virtues of the free market, enormous Bush has not done more than to give to prebandage to the industry energetics, even in times that the country faces highest deficits.
<seg>There is a fault of the market concerning the energy, but the intervention of the government would have to go in direction indeed opposed of which the administration proposes Bush.
<seg>The fact that the Americans do not pay to all the price of the resulting contamination of their wasteful use of the energy - especially the enormous amounts of gases that cause to the greenhouse effect it means that this one is subestimated, which maintains an excessive consumption as well.
<seg>The government must stimulate the conservation, and take part in the system of prices - to traverse of taxes to the energy it is an efficient way to do it.
<seg>Nevertheless, instead of to stimulate the conservation, Bush it has impelled a policy “to drain to the United States first”, left to EE.UU more employee of external petroleum in the future.
<seg>It does not concern that the high demand makes increase the prices of petroleum, creating a rain of money for many of the actors of the Middle East who are not indeed friendly of EE.UU.
<seg>Today, to more than four years of the terrorist attacks of September of 2001, Bush seems to have waked up finally to the reality of the increasing dependency of EE.UU.; with the great increase of the prices of petroleum, it will be difficult to him not to notice the consequences.
<seg>However, almost with complete certainty the vacillating measures of their administration will make worse the things in the future immediate.
<seg>Bush still refuses to make any thing with respect to the conservation, and has supported with very little money its constant cantinela of which the technology is what it has to us to save.
<seg>Then, what can be thought of their recent declaration of a commitment to cause that EE.UU is a 75% less employee of the petroleum of the Middle East within 25 years?
<seg>For the investors, the message is clear: not to invest more in the development of reserves in the Middle East, that is by far the cheapest world-wide petroleum source.
<seg>Nevertheless, without new investments for the development of reserves in the Middle East, the debocado growth of the power consumption in the United States, China and the rest of the world implies that the rate of the demand will surpass the one of the supply.
<seg>In case that was not sufficient, the threat of Bush to apply sanctions against Iran poses the risk of which interruptions in the provision of one of the producing majors of the world happen.
<seg>At moments that the oil production of the world approaches its total capacity and the prices are already more of the double of their level previous to the War of Iraq, the future it lets still glimpse prices and utilities majors for the industry of petroleum, the unique clear winner of the policy of Bush in the Middle East.
<seg>It is clear that Bush would not be due to accuse of, at least and finally, to have recognized who exists a problem.
<seg>But, as always, one more a more detailed glance to which it proposes suggests another trick of hands on the part of its administration.
<seg>Besides refusing to recognize the importance of the global heating, to stimulate the conservation or to dedicate sufficient bottoms to investigation to make a difference real, the grandiloquent promise of Bush to obtain a reduction of the dependency of the petroleum of the Middle East means less than what it seems.
<seg>Since only 20% of the petroleum used in EE.UU come from the Middle East, its goal could be obtained with a modest change of acquisition of this resource from other sources.
<seg>Nevertheless - one could think without a doubt that the administration Bush realizes of which petroleum is dealt in a world-wide market.
<seg>Even if EE.UU was 100% independent one of the petroleum of the Middle East, a reduction in the provision coming from this region would have devastating effects on the world-wide price and the American economy.
<seg>As it quite often happens with the administration Bush, the explanation of the official policy is not very flattering.
<seg>Is Bush playing to make when urging on the feeling political anti-Iranian anti-Arab and in EE.UU.?
<seg>Or it is only another example more of incompetence and disorder?
<seg>Reason why we have seen five years in the last, the correct answer probably contains more than something of bad faith and pure ineptitude.
<seg>The trip ticket of China
<seg>China is on the verge of adopting his eleventh quinquennial plan, fixing the scene for the continuation of probably the most remarkable economic transformation of history, while it almost improves the material situation of a quarter of the world-wide population.
<seg>Before the world had never seen a growth that sharp; before there has never been a level so of reduction of the poverty.
<seg>Part of the prolonged success of China has been its almost unique combination of pragmatism and vision.
<seg>While great part of the developing world, following the directives of the Consensus of Washington, has been oriented to a quixotic one crossed by the greater GGP, once again China has left in clear that it looks for viable and more equitable increases in the real standards of life.
<seg>China realizes of which it has entered a phase of economic development that is meaning enormous -- and untenable exigencies on the environment.
<seg>Unless there is a course change, the life standards will end up seeing itself affected.
<seg>Therefore, the new plan of five years puts great emphasis on the environment.
<seg>Several of the slowst zones of China have been growing to a rate that would be prodigious, if not outside because some parts of the country are growing even more express.
<seg>Although this has reduced the poverty, it has increased the inequality, with every time majors disparities between the rural and urban areas, and between the coastal zones and the interior.
<seg>The Report of Development of the World Bank of this year explains why the inequality - and not only the poverty must be a preoccupation, and the eleventh quinquennial plan of China attacks the problem front.
<seg>By several years the government has spoken of one more a more harmonious society, and the plan describes ambitious programs to obtain it.
<seg>In addition, China recognizes that what separates less to the developed countries of the developed ones is not only one breach in the income, but also a breach in the knowledge.
<seg>So that it has designed an audacious plan not only to reduce it, but in addition to create a base for the independent innovation.
<seg>The paper of China in the world and the world-wide economy has changed, and the plan reflects also it.
<seg>Its future growth will have to be based more on the internal demand that in the exports, which will demand an increase of the consumption.
<seg>In fact, China has a common problem little: a level of excessive saving.
<seg>People save partly due to the weakness of the programs of social security of the government; the fortification of the social security (pensions) and the public health simultaneously will reduce the social inequalities, will increase the sensation of well-being of the citizens and will promote the present consumption.
<seg>If they are successful (and until now China has surpassed even its own expectations), these adjustments can mean enormous pressures on a global economic system that already is decompensated due to the enormous fiscal and commercial imbalances of EE.UU.
<seg>If China saves less -- and if, since has announced their authorities, it looks for to carry out one more a diversified policy of investment of his reserves, who will finance more than $2 billion newspapers of commercial deficit of EE.UU.?
<seg>One is a subject for another occasion, perhaps but that day it is not very far.
<seg>With a vision that clear on the future, the challenge will be to implement it.
<seg>China is a great country, and it could not have achieved the success that it has had without a generalized decentralization.
<seg>But the decentralizations pose their own problems.
<seg>For example, the greenhouse gases are global problems.
<seg>While EE.UU says that it is not possible to be allowed to do nothing on the matter, the high authorities of China have acted of more responsible way.
<seg>Within the month subsequent to the adoption of the plan, new environmental taxes prevailed on the forest automobiles, gasoline and products. China used mechanisms based on the market to approach the problems half environmental global his and.
<seg>Nevertheless, the pressures on the authorities of the local governments so that they create economic growth and uses will be enormous.
<seg>They will see very attemped adduce that if EE.UU cannot produce of a way that preserves the planet, how could do it they?
<seg>In order to translate his vision to action, the Chinese government will need solid policies, like the half environmental taxes that finish applying.
<seg>When advancing towards a market economy, China has developed some of the problems that have affected repeatedly the developed countries: I interest individuals that disguise their egoistic arguments after a tenuous veil of market ideology.
<seg>Some will argue in favor of the economy of the chorreo: we do not worry about the poor men, since finally all will end up benefitting from the growth.
<seg>And some will be against to the political ones on competition and the existence of solid laws on the handling of the corporations: we let act the law of the darwiniana survival.
<seg>Arguments will consider trims in the growth to be against to the existence of solid social policies and average environmental: for example, one will say that “if the taxes raise the gasoline, that will mean the asphyxia of our rising automotive industry”.
<seg>These supposed political pro-growth not only would not create it, but they can threaten the same vision of the future of China.
<seg>There is a single way to avoid it: a abierto debate of the economic policies, with the purpose of to put in the open the deceits and to give space so that creative solutions to the many challenges arise that China faces nowadays.
<seg>George W. Bush has demonstrated the dangers of an excessive excessive secrecy and to limit the decision making a close circle of followers.
<seg>The majority of people outside China does not appreciate until degree their leaders, in resistance, have become jumbled in long deliberations and ample consultations (even with foreigners) in their efforts to solve the enormous problems that face.
<seg>The market economies are not regulated by themselves.
<seg>They are not possible simply to be left in autopilot, especially if one wants to make sure that all enjoy the benefits.
<seg>Nevertheless, it is not easy to administer a market economy.
<seg>Like a juggler, one is due to respond constantly to balance the economic changes.
<seg>The eleventh quinquennial plan of China gives a trip ticket for that answer.
<seg>The world observes with astonishment and hope as the lives of 1.3 billions of people continue becoming.
<seg>The lessons of Tocqueville on the democracy
<seg>It seems appropriate that, due to the war in Iraq, that the world is debating the nature of the democracy to two hundred years of the birth of Alexis de Tocqueville.
<seg>Tocqueville is deservedly famous to reject reactionary nostalgia and to consider the triumph of the democracy as our destiny, whereas it warned of the dangers that the democracy for the freedom entails.
<seg>We must continue sharing its preoccupations?
<seg>Tocqueville conceived to the democracy not only like a political regime but, mainly, like an intellectual regime that form gives to the customs of the society generally, and that way it gave a psychological and sociological dimension him.
<seg>Tocqueville argued that the democratic regimes determine our thoughts, desires and passions.
<seg>As well as there was a Renaissance man and, in century XX, homo sovieticus, “the democratic man” is a variety of the human being.
<seg>For Tocqueville, the systemic effects of the democracy could take to the citizens to deprive themselves of their reasoned thought.
<seg>They only could pretend that they judged the events and the single values in case; in fact, merely they copied the coarse and simplified opinions of the masses.
<seg>Indeed, which Tocqueville called the dominion of the “social power” on the opinion is probably more fort in the democratic regimes - point of view that predicts the growth of the demagoguery at the modern time and the manipulation of mass media.
<seg>Tocqueville thought that this tendency did not have effective limitations of long term.
<seg>Neither the local democracies, nor the small societies, nor the governmental controls and balances, nor the civil rights can prevent the decay with the critical thought that the democracy seems to cause.
<seg>The schools little have the power of being more than enclaves in the middle of the corrosive force of the social influences on the operation of the mind.
<seg>Of equal way, although Tocqueville thought that to look for the virtue since were made in the antiquity or have a religious belief sometimes it could lift the soul, also entered about conflict with the democratic ideal if it were prescribed officially in the public life.
<seg>In this sense, the intellectual heirs of Tocqueville include the neoMarxist theoreticians of the School of Frankfurt, as well as to Hannah Arendt. All of them feared mainly to the disintegration of the reason in the modern societies.
<seg>Indeed, the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet entitled a recent book the democracy against itself.
<seg>The democratic style of life, as these writers argue, tends to destroy the original thought and to suppress “the high” culture, which gives like result a mediocrity that does to the vulnerable citizens before the enemies of the democracy.
<seg>But, whereas history is filled with regimes assassins praised by intimidated and deceived masses, the great risk for the democratic countries is that their citizens fall in the apathy and the vision of short term for the sake of the immediate satisfaction.
<seg>The past - to weighing of the rituals that they look for to commemorate historical moments flock due to the new addiction by and the recent thing.
<seg>Even, the supposedly well mannered class leader is subject to this enchantment.
<seg>The essential problem of the democratic mind is its lack of brings back to consciousness historical.
<seg>The defects of the democracy, really mean, as Tocqueville argued, that the resigned pesimism is the unique way - realistic but untenable that we have?
<seg>I do not create it.
<seg>There are ways to fight against which the increasing “democratic stupidity” of today could be called.
<seg>The first defense is to press by an educative system that really forms minds critics, that is to say, by means of the matters neglected to a great extent (at the moment) of Literature, history and the philosophy.
<seg>If it is wanted to form to the informed citizenship and critical that the democracy needs, our schools must stop folding themselves to the more recent fleeting fashions and beginning to improve the analytical capacities of the students.
<seg>The greatest impediment for that education is the massive means of communication, with their tendency to cultivate the superficiality and the diversion.
<seg>At the moment much people pass more time of her life seeing the television that in the halls class.
<seg>The passivity that foments means is the opposed pole of the active participation that the democratic citizens need.
<seg>But it is difficult to imagine that the massive means of communication (with the exception of quality newspapers) become, by its own will, in instruments of an education that fortifies the capacities critics of the citizens.
<seg>This preoccupation on massive means of communication is not mere elitist scorn towards the popular culture.
<seg>The question is not only of popularity - later of everything, Mozart was popular in his times and the theater works of Shakespeare attracted so much the poor men as to the rich ones but of the rejection of the massive culture to defy and to cause.
<seg>The result of that failure is a generalized indifference and a passivity of the public.
<seg>Indeed, during long time it has been in height a globalised culture of the means that is incapable to instill the capacity of the critical thought or to create high feelings.
<seg>It is a culture that, due to its negligence, threatens the democratic freedom because it cannot create any sense of having - to the society, to history, the community.
<seg>It is very behind schedule for doing something about a culture that extinguishes so much the spirit?
<seg>Tocqueville despised to the elites of its time by its complacencia facing the force of uprooting of the massive democracy.
<seg>Perhaps it will serve also the myopia as our leaders like agent of its disquieting prophecy?
<seg>A Europe for all
<seg>Today, members that long ago belong to European Union seem to doubt the future the same, but in the Ukraine we see with hope and admiration it.
<seg>To unite us to the development of the EU is the basic objective of our foreign policy, since the Ukraine is shortage that to be a nation is not an aim, but a beginning.
<seg>Indeed, the European unit is indivisible: when a nation is the condemned to the ostracism, no of them is free.
<seg>We European them comprised cannot be waived of one close network, interlaces in a single weave that represents our destiny.
<seg>Each aspect of our common culture, when not the last century of shared suffering, confirms it to us.
<seg>Everything what affects a European directly indirectly affects, us to all.
<seg>We never can more allow us to live with one close notion of two Europe, of privileged and destitutes, of known and foreign.
<seg>Nobody that lives within the European continent can (nor in fact it must) be considered other people's to its Union.
<seg>On it the great European Pax and the Pan-European prosperity of today depend.
<seg>By all means, some people murmur that the Ukraine is not Europe.
<seg>That they come to Kiev and they speak with people, young as as much greater, with the workers of the factories, the spouses of the agriculturists, the lawyers, doctors and professors who remained of on foot, supporting during weeks the cold and the snow the last winter to defend its liberties.
<seg>They are not united by a bond with those who remained next to General de Gaulle in the French Resistance?
<seg>They are not it with those who died fighting by the Spanish Republic in the years 30, with those who released Budapest in 1956 and with those who put full stop to fascism in Spain and Portugal in years 70?
<seg>They are not animated by the same spirit who gave to forces to the movement Solidarity in Poland and to the pacific masses that carried out the Velvet Revolution of the Prague in 1989?
<seg>That is the true European spirit, and no doubt can collapse it.
<seg>To that they say that the Ukraine too much is delayed like belonging to the EU, I say to them: Also, that comes country and sees the mothers who at night remain in their places of work teaching to their children to use their computers.
<seg>That they come to see the lessons of languages in each town and city where the young people are preparing themselves for Europe, learning French, German and English.
<seg>Who doubt the European vocation of the Ukraine they must include/understand that Europe is not a subject of machineries and superfreeways; it is the inextinguishable desire of freedom, prosperity and solidarity.
<seg>I believe that our future is as promising as shining it is the past of Europe, and that our destiny is not to be a forgotten border country a region in problems, but a constructor and creator of La Paz and the unit of Europe.
<seg>The self-determination no longer means isolation, since to obtain national independence nowadays it means only to return to the world-wide scene with new estatus.
<seg>The new nations can create with their old occupants the same type of fruitful relation that France has developed with Germany, a relation based on the equality and the mutual interests.
<seg>This it is the type of relation that my government looks for with Russia, and to obtain it is the way as we can extend the zone of peace of Europe.
<seg>By all means, he is premature to make another thing that to indicate the great interest whereupon we see the perspective of being member of the EU.
<seg>We know that our part in that great building will not be constructed overnight.
<seg>We know that the great works of the European unification are not in documents nor declarations, but in innovating actions designed to improve the lives and to guarantee the security of all the European.
<seg>To construct the Ukraine worthy to be member of the EU will not be easy, nor cheap fast.
<seg>Nevertheless, like the same Union, it is a company that will be obtained.
<seg>We know that the challenge is great, but the prize is worth the effort, and Europe must know that this is our goal.
<seg>Part of the task of renewing the Ukraine is a creative battle to end a century of nightmare in which fascism and the Comunism, ideologies born in the heart of Europe, fought by the total power.
<seg>Only months ago, in the cities of all Ukraine, our children and their parents they faced armed troops, threatening dogs, or even the death.
<seg>Hardly years ago, a young journalist, Georgi Gongadze, when dealing with to inform the public about the corruption the old regime, was tortured and beheaded by his minions.
<seg>Nevertheless, our Revolution Orange of the past winter demonstrated that the town of the Ukraine prevailed.
<seg>So that, in spite of the doubts and difficulties of today, I maintain an unshakeable faith in Europe.
<seg>I refuse myself to accept the frustration like final answer to the ambiguities and horrors of the history of the Ukraine.
<seg>I refuse myself to accept the vision of which the Ukraine is so tragically united to the opaque midnight of the inheritance of the Comunism that never will be able to see the dawn of peace and truth of the European unit.
<seg>When the citizens of the EU heft the place of the Ukraine in Europe, they must see simultaneously more far and more near which there is at first.
<seg>They must see beyond the knocked down deserts that the Comunism left, beyond the poverty and the social divisions by means of which our ex- governors, today lazy side, dealed with to prolong their anarchy one.
<seg>Instead of it, they would have to watch close by the face of our president, Viktor Yushchenko, deformed by the poison during the electoral campaign of the past year and to remember the words of the great French André Malraux, for whom “the most beautiful faces are those than they have been hurt”.
<seg>The civil war of the Muslims
<seg>It is today the division between chiíes and suníes in the Near East deeper than the antagonism between Israel and the Arabs?
<seg>That could be thought, given the answer of some Arab governments to the decision of Hizbulah to attack Israel.
<seg>Even at moments that the Israeli pumps fell on Beirut and Tiro, Saudi Arabia, perhaps the Muslim Arab country more conservative of all, abiertamente condemned the actions of Hizbulah, that are a shií organization, to incite the conflict with Israel.
<seg>Before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict a state that considers leader of the Arab Muslim towns had never endorsed to Israel so abiertamente.
<seg>Still more, it breaks of Saudi Arabia with Hizbulah is not something isolated.
<seg>Egypt and Jordan also have condemned categorically to Hizbulah and its leader, sheik Hassan Nasrallah, by their lack of responsibility.
<seg>What has behind this surprising attitude?
<seg>We are being present at a fundamental change in the relations between the Arab nationalism and the Islamic sectarianism?
<seg>It is worried and frightened Saudi Arabia more before the chií Islam that the Arab unit and the Palestine cause jeopardize with?
<seg>The accusations of the Arabs against Hizbulah suggest it sectarian division between the Muslims, already evident in the daily violence in Iraq, it is being deepened and making more intense in the Near East.
<seg>The desire of President George W. Bush of remecer the immovable societies of the Arab world had the intention to raise the forces of the modernization against the traditional elements of the Arab and Islamic societies.
<seg>Instead of it, it seems to have untied the most atavic forces of the region.
<seg>Abrir this Box of Pandora can have given beginning to a new and bitterer era of generalized violence, that can perhaps only be called a “Muslim civil War”.
<seg>The division between chiíes and suníes has existed from the origins of the Islam, but the geographic and ethnic isolation of nonArab chií Iran, along with the dominion of the Arab countries suníes on its minorities chiíes, to a great extent maintained this rivalry in background.
<seg>These tensions still more backed down with the tide islamist created by the Iranian revolution, since after her the Arab sectarian identity even lost more weight as a generalized “Islamic” identification arose.
<seg>All that changed when To the Qaeda, a suní terrorist force that strongly is based on the ideology of the Saudi wahabíes and its people, mounted its attacks on the United States in September of 2001.
<seg>Now there was a specifically suní arm of militant Islam.
<seg>When the United States gave to beginning to their wars against talibanes suníes of Afghanistan and the suní regime of Iraq, this new radical suní current was still fortified more.
<seg>The Arabs suníes of the region, with their new determination, perceive that Israel and the West are only one of the threats, while the other is thus called “Increasing chií”, the earth arc that extends from the Lebanon to Iran, happening through Syria and Iraq, inhabited by supposedly heretical chiíes.
<seg>The governors of Saudi Arabia, like guardians of the most sacred places of the Muslim faith in Mecca and Medina, so time are most inclined to feel this threat.
<seg>To eyes of suníes, chiíes not only dominates petroleum the rich areas of Iran, Iraq and the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia, but -- through the actions of Hizbulah- they are trying to usurp “the protector” paper of the central dream of all the Arabs, the Palestine cause.
<seg>The Saudi Kingdom has become against Hizbulah due to the fact that the Saudi real family it derives his legitimacy from a strict form of suní Islam and doubt of the loyalty of his chií population.
<seg>Ironically, the United States, the traditional protector of Saudi Arabia, is the one who has made the fortification possible of chiíes, when overthrowing to Saddam Hussein and to take to the parties chiíes to the power in Iraq.
<seg>The administration Bush seems to recognize what it has done; as the chií arc grows in the east of the Muslim Arab world, EE.UU tries to fortify their protection of the suní arc (Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia) in the west of the region.
<seg>Israel, once the implacable enemy of the Arab cause, now seems to have been integrated to this defensive structure.
<seg>Nevertheless, a defensive position with these characteristics is destined to being unstable, due to the feelings panárabes.
<seg>Today, the common and current Saudi citizens follow the events of Gaza and the south of the Lebanon through The Jazeera and other networks of TV by satellite.
<seg>They see that Arab blood is spilled (nonchií), and that only Hizbolah responds to the attacks.
<seg>To its eyes, Hizbolah has become a heroic model of resistance.
<seg>This is causing that the Saudi state deepens the schism between suníes and chiíes.
<seg>After the official accusations of the Kingdom against Hizbulah, the Saudi state summoned its official wahabíes clergymen to emit fatuas being condemned to Hazbolah like a schismatic organization of herejes and chiíes.
<seg>This type of sentences cannot do more than to worsen the divisions between Saudi Arabia and the region.
<seg>As these antagonisms are deepened,they will get to believe the regimes suníes that they need his own Hizbulah in his corner the world?
<seg>If they reach that conclusion, they do not have to look for much, since those militiamen already have been trained… by The Qaeda.
<seg>Georgia in the mind of Europe
<seg>The time which Europe could trust EE.UU to wage the war, to obtain La Paz and to create the democracy in its own back patio finished.
<seg>As it recently demonstrated the crisis to it of the Russian gas, with the extension of the EU the back patio now includes not only the Ukraine, but also to Georgia.
<seg>In fact, like the Ukraine, Georgia faces a test its democracy that Europe cannot be allowed to ignore.
<seg>Georgia was the first country post-Soviet in initiating a “revolution of colors” and in demonstrating, with dignity and maturity, the European option of its town by the democracy and values.
<seg>The flags of the European Union that since then have waved in all the buildings public of Georgia are a signal of that natural and as old adhesion as the history of a country that stops old the Greeks was integral part of the well-known world.
<seg>Prometheus, Medea, the Amazon and, in the Armenia neighbor, the Coffer of Noah… the Europe of our myths begins here.
<seg>With its history, its culture and its traditions (including its critical, independent and even rebellious spirit within the ex- Soviet Union), Georgia would seem an ideal candidate for a successful democratization.
<seg>By the same, he is much more worrisome the one that is sinking.
<seg>Everything sufficiently seemed to have begun well.
<seg>There were no resistance to the political reforms, the privatizations, the measures anti-corruption, the search of new leaders nonstained with adjustments with the old regime, and the implementation of a pro-european foreign policy.
<seg>Nevertheless, since then a totalitarian mentality in leaders has reappeared who, with the pretext to represent the will of the majority, take control more and more of being able.
<seg>Like the Hidra of old the Greeks, the political elite of Georgia seems to never finish dying and appearing again.
<seg>The same people and methods of government who tried to defeat the “pink Revolution” of November of 2003 have reappeared to the center of the power, by means of the use of their networks of relations, that they extend beyond the limits of the country, as well as their tremendous in tune wealth and its good abilities of manipulation and political intrigue.
<seg>All this has little common with the essence of the democracy, that does not consist merely of ballot boxes, but in the separation of powers.
<seg>The government is inmiscuye in the subjects of the parliament, the one that as well tries to control the details of the executive… what in my case he included the appointment of the ambassadors and its daily routines!
<seg>Finally, and what is more serious, the judicial power not yet is independent, which undermines the empire of the law and prevents the private investments that as much are needed.
<seg>The democracy of Georgia exists in its head, but not still in its body: the citizens still despise the policy like a dirty business, leaving it to those who they must long ago have rejoiced.
<seg>However, the hope of the democracy follows taken root strongly in the town, the civic organizations and mass media.
<seg>Now it is the moment which Europe makes sure that this hope is not extinguished.
<seg>The United States already has done everything what it has been able to support the political stability in Georgia, from their independence.
<seg>There is no doubt that the stability not always was equivalent to democracy during the government of Eduard Shevardnadze, the ex- Secretary of State of the old Soviet Union that was removed from the power during the Pink Revolution.
<seg>Nevertheless, the Americans invested generously to support the democratic survival of the ideas and leaders.
<seg>Although the foundation endorsed by the financista George Soros did not make the Pink Revolution, as they affirm the Russian nationalists, certainly nourished, stimulated and supported the preconditions of the democracy.
<seg>Nevertheless, to help to consolidate its democracy, Georgia it now needs a support a different nature, that Europe is in better conditions for offering.
<seg>The models of balance of powers, operation of the judicial power and local democracy are due to inspire by the European forms, nearer the Georgian reality that the Anglo-Saxon models of the American type.
<seg>If Europe does not assume east challenge, would betray its fundamental duties in a place (small, Mediterranean, flexible, with old historical traditions) where the democracy has many more possibilities of success than in the Ukraine, that is enormous and where still a Soviet mentality predominates, not to mention to Central Asia.
<seg>In fact, not to support the rising democracy of Georgia probably would delay the democratic progress in the Ukraine, Belarus and even the same Russia.
<seg>Clearly, this increases what is in game.
<seg>Although Russia never has resigned to its dreams and imperial instruments of domination, it was being resigned to the inevitability of the democracy, at least in its margins.
<seg>But this obstinate acceptance of a certain normality in its relations with its neighbors always has been vulnerable to a sudden eruption of famous irrational “derzhava” Russian: ethos aggressive that glorify to the state and affirm their force by means of the oppression of the weak ones.
<seg>This is the key to include/understand the recent crisis of the Russian gas.
<seg>He is equal of certainly any signal of backward movement of the democracy in Georgia and other states post-Soviets it will not do more than to give impulse to the Russian neoimperial ambitions.
<seg>It is responsibility of Europe to convince to Russia that there are hopes of a no return to the past.
<seg>Europe must assume this role not only to assure future independence its provision of energy, but also to demonstrate that the European values of freedom, democracy and justice between the towns have a real force.
<seg>In order to obtain it, it must be equipped with the necessary instruments: a great semi-public foundation to promote Europe and to support the political reforms, a university to form to the executive futures of the rising democracies, a force of police and a set of judges and magistrates to give life to the models that we wished to emulate.
<seg>Mainly, Europe needs conviction.
<seg>If the Europe of today cannot be convinced that it has a vital interest in the future of his neighbors, who will believe tomorrow in Europe?
