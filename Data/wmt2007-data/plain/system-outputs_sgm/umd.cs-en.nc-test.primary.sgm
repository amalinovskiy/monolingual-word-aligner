A Racially Divided Europe
In fact, the extreme right is its racism and that is using the immigration issue in its political benefits.
Italy's Lega Nord, Dutch Vlaams Bloc, the French Le Penova Front National -- all are examples of parties or movements from common aversion to immigrants and a simplistic view on how to address the issue of immigration.
While Individua like Jörg Haider or Jean-Marie Le Pen, and never not enough (before) retire, the question of race and racism of European policy is not just disappear.
A growing racial in European countries, two factors: an aging population and the boundaries.
Right-wing and left-wing parties concentrated around the political center before the problem head in the sand, hope despite everything, that the issue of immigration once it disappears.
But it will not, as they knew America's racial history.
Relations between the race is in the United States for decades in the center of political debate, and until the extent that the racial divisions are as important as income, and often also specify the political preferences and attitudes.
A first step toward a takeover of racial policy is to understand the consequences and racial intolerance, even if that should mean that it became clear home truths.
In the United States about this for large-scale economic, psychological and sociological, Politologické surveys.
Comes of them, that people of different races each other much less trust that all White only to support social spending, because they are seen as aid minorities, and that racially fragmented Community are much less effective governance, corruption is rampant in them, and crime, and is in them less productive public goods on the one tax dollars.
It certainly does not mean that the solution is to eliminate all variety and build a racially homogenous community, but that we could start to build solid public policy on relations between different race, we must first of all to acknowledge the existence of these problems.
Of course, neither the Americans are not in this direction United.
Some have a positive discrimination that minorities admits preferences in hiring to work, in high school and in allocating public procurement.
This policy is seen as not just for historical grievances, but also as a way of creating positive examples of human and curb the continuing, and perhaps unconscious discrimination.
But it is even less people who rail against positive discrimination and who says that to create jobs for minorities and to black families remained together, it requires only quality "Rasoslepá" policy, in combination with policies of the free market and promoting family values.
Support for family values is crucial in any policy, for all the main cause of poverty in the US is the huge number of households with one parents (read: to free the mother) within the framework of the black community.
Solutions have, but here it is mainly about the fact that American policy to the racial issue at least ranking positions.
Minorities here, of course, a move on the road to integration and economic success.
In the 1950s blacks must not sit in the front part of the bus; today, two blacks are moving to the top US foreign policy.
Right-wing American politicians, of course, even now Takticky use racial issue as a political tool.
For example, Patrick Buchanan, a former aide to President Nixon and Reagan, who in the last US presidential election he ran as an independent.
It recently with the success of a book entitled "The dying of the West" about how population and the invasion of immigrants threaten America and Western civilization.
For every one such book but it is now ten other that America's racial question addresses serious analysis.
In Europe but political analysis and debate about the relations between different race significantly is lagging.
In the best case about this issue is quite freely, in terms of immigration quotas and restrictions on the border, and not in terms of social problems and opportunities that a racially mixed Europe offers.
To stop the rise in illegal immigrants, of course, is a clear immigration policy.
The but this does not: America's racial policies also, it really does not control on the US-Mexican border!
Europe is rich and older. The Europeans, protected generous social programs, refusing to do a "dirty work" in agriculture or to be in industry.
The increase in immigration is therefore inevitable.
The Europeans, but never leave missed an opportunity to criticize America as any failure in its policy on minorities or for any manifestations of racism on the other side of the Atlantic.
When into the European press, cannot be to see a superiority complex to the United States on the racial policies: they, the Americans, have problems with racism, we, Europeans, we are immune to it, perhaps up to neo-Nazis and their like.
But that, for what in recent weeks came from Paris to Amsterdam, shows that racial problems in Europe is much deeper and that as well as in the US derived from the sad truth that relations between the race is the nature of the complex and that confidence and cooperation between the human race is not always obvious and simple.
If the European political parties in all of the stature and sincerity to invest in understanding of racial tensions in Europe, and if the racial issue one of its main priorities, lies that individuals Le Penova type will be delayed, with this vacuum to fulfill their hate message.
Fighting with the French Exception
The attention of Europe is now rightly focused on enlargement and the European constitution, which currently EU Member States.
For the fate of new and enlarged Europe, however, be just as the most important result of the few French squabbles with the European Commission.
France decided to unilaterally that it will ignore the Stability and Growth Pact, because its expected budget deficit high above the 3% of GDP.
The French like boasts the most rational and hard-headed thinking, but if it is about budgets, then Descartes was replaced by confusion terms.
When the Irish government in 2000 to reduce its budget surplus of 4% of GDP of only half a percent, were leading France to its critics.
The stability pact which violate and other countries, but France is the first who do so with and outright defiance.
This should come as no surprise.
France simply he applies to the rules of the EU its own culture rooted habit seen as an exceptional.
The French, for example, have to veto the reform of the common agricultural policy the EU.
But even children know that this policy is a very pleasant and unearned gift from the rich European (and especially the French) farmers are struggling at the expense of farmers in developing countries and consumers in the EU.
France also seek to return to the old policy of the non-profit private companies based on the brink of bankruptcy for taxpayers' money.
EU commissioner for competition Mario Monti, in a battle cannot dismiss: needs the support of those who believe in free market and equal conditions for all.
The story is simple.
The French government planned to save the company Alstom, which has developed a number of high-technological products including a French TGV train, but recently it declared bankruptcy.
The government claims that the plan to rescue Alstomu never give up; that is led by well known motives: maintaining employment, protection of investors, etc.
Because Alstom is, moreover, the technological companies, extract the French government also card research and development, and argue that investments in research and development support growth.
The Alstomu nationalization is clearly wrong.
The company consists of many different parts, some of which are profitable and other: it would be so obvious firms divided.
Profitable parts, such as the TGV, easy to find buyers, while the non-profit facilities should be closed.
French taxpayers' money would be more efficiently spent on temporary support of the dismissed employees than on subsidies that will keep alive unprofitable factories.
It is important that the European Commission to allow France, on the issue of competition in the peace special rules, as has apparently going on on budget deficits.
The Commission must state aid from the French private companies, as well as from subsidies in any other EU members.
In this field by the Commission to achieve some success, in particular if force Germany to eliminating government guarantees on the state-owned banks.
France as a whole and firm Alstom especially should not be an exception and should keep the same standards.
If the Commission will act, the EU will still look more like the playing field for the French state officials.
France already took the lead role in EU foreign policy, where Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin increasingly looks and acts as secretary of state of Europe.
At the same time France violated the rules of the common economic policy and state aid private companies.
The rest of the European Commission will lose its credibility and will eventually to the smaller of the Paris districts?
Defeat in the case Alstomu would have deep consequences for Europe -- and not only on competition policy.
The War for Oil
For decades America through Democratic and Republican presidential administration to in the oil policy a straightforward objective: to maintain world oil prices stable on what level; what limit domestic consumption of oil; to reduce the dependence on imports from abroad; to diversify sources of oil imports.
While, so it may seem, none of these goals during the Bush administration did not change.
Many observers believe that Bush to give a new direction, because it seems that the invasion of Iraq completely contrary to these goals.
A substantial increase in production in Iraq is likely to increase the US dependence on oil compared to other energy sources, because in terms of new reserves to oil prices fall.
This will mean in the wake of the increase in the US dependence on oil imports, particularly from the Middle East.
Ironically, however, is that the US had over Iraqi oil sector much more power during the pre-war agenda of the UN "oil for food" (in which the rather than Saddam Hussein, but UN determines the level of sales of Iraqi oil abroad) than it should in future democratic Iraq.
If the Bush administration was it a lasting, secure, varied and cheap supply of oil, simply cannot lift the embargo on Libya, Iran, Iraq and Sudan and oil would only.
American interests for Iraqi oil but was not motivated by neither economic nor energy policy.
The Bush administration to understand that the Iraqi oil is especially critical geopolitical asset.
Who controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq.
Saddam's power means that control of the world's second largest oil reserves.
The role of the oil in its power, to perform very well aware.
When Saddam was forced to face the possibility of invasion and defeat, he was enthusiastic Iraqi oil fields.
Much of the subsequent and plunder oil facilities and pipelines in the country reflected the widespread perception that the oil means to control Iraq.
At a time when the US invasion, planned to become a major priority security fields.
The goal was to boost oil supplies and reduce its prices for the Americans, but Saddam from power and a establish and consolidate the new Iraqi government.
The future of Iraq directly depends on the fate of Iraq's oil production.
But the vagaries of oil industry, especially in this unstable conditions, it is difficult to predict how much will be in the next few years the Bush administration in Iraq to fulfill their goals.
The logic is simple.
The US must use oil revenues to the American tax payers Sejmuly burden of financing for regime change in Iraq.
All reconstruction plans rely in the long run to Iraq to export large volume of oil.
If Iraq Oil-price, then President Bush cannot honor their promises to the Iraqi and American people and the world community.
Before the invasion of Iraq's capacity of oil production reached three million barrels per day.
During the period that is required to set the Iraqi government, Iraq will not be able to increase production at that level.
Any increase in Iraqi oil production will take its reserves to develop, so big investment, the legitimate representative government and political stability.
Early fulfilling these requirements expected nor the Bush administration.
Political stability is the main to increase production capacity.
Historical experience from Iran, Kuwait, Russia, and even from the Iraq indicate that from rebuild the political stability is needed about three years than capacity rises significantly, and a new, higher levels stay.
Iraq needs a few years to write a new constitution, a legitimate democratic government, agreed the distribution of income from oil between individual regions, to adopt new investment laws and make its economy attractive for foreigners.
It also needs a time for negotiations with international oil companies and neighboring countries, of providing a technical analyses and studies and applicability become more important for reconstruction, modernization and survey of its oil deposits.
As optimistic, and seems even a time frame, which assumes that during this deadline will end the occupation and Iraqis form their own democratic government and that will be achieved political stability.
The situation, of course, can develop very different.
Tensions may continue for years.
No one would also have surprised even that, if even under a democratic government of Iraqi oil production suddenly stopped.
History suggests that workers' strikes and similar shocks that can stop oil production, are more threatened than in democratic in democratic countries.
If Iraq fails in the next few years its production capacity greatly increased, it will be a barrier to both foreign and the US energy policy.
How will the US long-term reconstruction of Iraq to fund?
Who pays for efforts to protect Iraq's fragile democracy?
For the US occupation will be sustainable if the Iraqi people be able to provide food, health care and other basic services?
It is a difficult questions that are in principle to the than in Iraq will be stable, democratic regime capable of controlling and guarantee the uninterrupted flow of oil exports.
Let the Murderers be Alert to the Human Rights
If this was not so deeply depressing, the report could be jokes Millennium: Libya was elected the country's presidential commission on human rights in the UN!
When Caligula elected to the Senate his horse had his horse least out of the blood.
Progress was of course, completely illegal: presidency each year is shifting from one of the region to another.
This year proposed the chair of Africa and Nominovala Libya.
Only voted against the US and Canada.
To their eternal shame European countries delay the vote.
It is a telling comment to address the moral bankruptcy of the UN, that this decision comes at a moment for organization and delicate.
President Bush has called on the UN to has made clear that takes seriously its own binding decisions regarding Iraq: could the otherwise famously captured as well as society of nations, which in the 1930s occurred as ineffective when they face aggressive political approach Nazi Germany and fascist Italy.
Elected here and now Libya to chair the UN body, which is responsible for human rights, they will help strengthen the legitimacy and moral authority of the world organisation.
Recall: Libya is an authoritarian tyranny. Its leader, Muammar Qadaffi, enriching their sometimes erratic behaviour of extremist political approaches and promotes world dictators.
Heads the one of the repressive regime of the world, where the election pretend nothing and dissident to go after the neck.
Under his rule Libya helped terrorist organizations from around the world -- from the IRA to various Palestinian extremist groups.
So far is under UN sanctions because of the role of the ten years ago played in the bombings on the plane over Lockerbie society Panama.
In the past decade, the UN position as a symbol of peace ideals of the world society continues to deteriorate.
The organization occurred as completely unable to stop the war in the Balkans. But in at least one case -- in Srebrenica -- Dutch UN peacekeeping force backed by and watch the worst massacre in post-war Europe, when Bosnian Serbs by around six thousand defenseless Muslim men.
Dutch investigative commission later acknowledged that their battalion were on the UN war crimes complicity.
At a time when the genocide in Rwanda, UN officials responsible for peacekeeping operations ordered evacuation of UN troops from the country and leave the field completely open bloody genocidal massacre since World War II.
The leaders of the UN is the name of Kofi Annan.
It is a pressing and a poor record in history that the UN to -- probably to no avail -- undone by in the Iraq crisis figures as the voice of reason and the international legitimacy.
But at a time when UN inspections in Iraq remind Salvation Army Vyslanou Odpravit group gangster, boost Libya to chair the commission on human rights can to be remembered as the eventual failure organization, which began life with so many expectations.
The usually die -- and certainly is every reason for it to ensure that the UN will Kulhat further.
But it will only a shadow of what it should and could be.
The United Nations no longer hypocrisy.
At the Gate
Last me judges Indonesian court in central Jakarta sentenced to one year imprisonment.
As editor of news weekly rate I according to the court guilty of against business tycoon in the name of the Winata by I indirectly suggested their possible share of the conflagration textile market for Southeast Asia in Jakarta and that I spread lies to encourage riots.
It is my case and his similar cases of the end of the other short-term experiment with democracy in Indonesia?
"The riots," to which I encourage allegedly took place in May last year, with almost two hundreds of signaling a Winatovy supporters invaded office weekly rate, threatening to buildings, employees and been hurt one reporters.
In an effort to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the situation I have to be convinced to act on the central police station in Jakarta, but to their abhorrence I found that the station check the leaders of these gangs.
They beat me and dig, while police look elsewhere.
Fortunately, US to help many journalists Diktafony and cameras.
Their broadcasts have aroused public outrage that forced parliament organizing public hearings.
It is national and police chief and leader of the gangs were on the basis of a strong public pressure charged with crimes.
Winata itself but police investigations of the escape, and it only on the basis of public statements that his supporters to act without his prior knowledge and consent.
Winata then submit their own criminal announcement on Ahmed Taufika that an article he wrote, Teuku Iskandar Ali, which he Editoval, and to me.
proceedings then noted a number of suspects arrives at that virtually Winatu.
So mainly include legal action by police and state prosecutor and a flagrant way falsified documents that the police accused two of their own officers.
The court but refused our request to delay proceedings until the account for Právoplatnost state by action.
The officers implicated in vote rigging apparently lead to lost.
One of them even be promoted to commander of the newly established (and the United States funded) anti-terrorist forces in Jakarta.
The second, was allegedly sent them to the police academy, where attended advanced training.
The sixth month conducting action was presidency fails in Senate suddenly graduate to Speaker of the city court in the city an hour away down from Jakarta.
One of our lawyers noted that for 35 years of practice in the courts still hasn't to be sacked from presidency fails judges has been an ongoing case.
, despite the elevation continue to chair the court in another case the current in the same building.
On the one released by judges, which took place in the previous civil lawsuit against decided against the pace.
And finally the Winata committed during the testimony when denied that it would do with him the pace of talks.
Before the court was records of telephone conversation, the court heard testimony reporters, who led the talks, and two editors who were among the witnesses, as proof of the existence of call was made official record telephone companies and professional witness concluded that the voice on Nahrávce really belongs Tomymu Winatovi.
But the judges rejected the request of the pace to Winata was arrested and tried for, and told us that we have announced to the police, which we did.
After judges rejected my request for postponement of the court's decision to resolve the case Winatova.
Given the flawed management is my conviction and punishment conditional surprise.
But they are losing hope that eventually won when they heard the court of appeals of last resort.
Indonesia's higher courts are cleaner and chairman of the Supreme Court is to advocate democracy and press freedom. The case of the weekly rate could become memorable victory for our democracy, just as he became famous decision of the US Supreme Court case in New York Times in Sullivan.
By raising the bar for action for was to ensure that American journalists can invites public officials accountable.
No country knows better than Indonesia, that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are the best indicator of the democratic development and that Kriminalizace journalists is early symptoms of authoritarianism.
In the 1950s was Indonesia liberal democracy, until in 1956 launched President Sukarno in support of the army campaign against the press.
of critical voices facilitate consolidation their unchecked power and in June 1959 Sukarno declared the beginning of "managed democracy".
During the first few years after the fall of the in 1966 were all the benefits of real democracy including press freedom restored (for the communists but not).
The regime of President Suharto, however, in the early 1970's launched another strong measures against the press, which lead to the various media and imprisonment of many journalists.
When he came under the control of the press, which was quickly and other political rights and Indonesia's democracy again collapsed.
After fall in 1998, Indonesia has become the third largest democratic countries in the world and the most democratic of the Muslim community in its history.
Two parliamentary elections and two direct presidential elections -- including the recent second round of the presidential race -- were free, fair and peaceful, which prove that Islam and democracy can co-exist.
Enemies of democracy but never slept.
Radical Islamist groups to carry out the mindless bombings, while the group with strong authoritarian inclinations they go to a close circle around President Megawati Sukarnoputri.
President Megawati but it has suffered defeat in their quest for re-election.
Will the newly elected President Susilo continued persecution of journalists?
It is my conviction, as well as the trial and conviction of other journalists, means the beginning of the end of the hard-won third democracy in Indonesia?
The answer lies in the question of what support can Indonesian fighters for democracy won at home and abroad.
The loss of Indonesia -- the potential hope for all fighters for democracy in the global Muslim communities, would be terrible defeat.
Morálnost Death Penalty
The United States are often criticized for refusal to lift the death penalty.
Many people now argue that the lifting of the death penalty is a necessary element in the developed system of criminal law.
The Nobel laureate Gary Becker disagree with this view.
European governments are adamantly opposed to the death penalty -- the European Union him even explicitly bars -- and some Europeans regard their application in the United States as barbaric.
Many European intellectuals argue that not only the death penalty, but generally any punishment cannot deter criminals.
But while the Europeans, on which the crime in the last half-century was far below the level of the long power for most crimes to relatively "soft" attitude during the past years, 20 years, they recorded a sharp increase in crime.
The American crime by contrast, has declined, partly thanks to the wider use of the punishment.
Among them include the death penalty.
I support execution people convicted of murder, because-and only for this reason, I believe that it prevented other murders.
If it did not believe playing I against penalty because of revenge and other possible motives should not serve as the basis of public policy.
Serious empirical research death penalty in the US began the pioneering studies Isaaca Ehrlich, published in 1975 in the American economic review.
Some subsequent studies revealed much weaker deterrence payoff effect, while others to reach the conclusion that the effect is far stronger.
Available data but are rather limited, so no one would have its own conclusions based solely on the econometric evidence.
Public policy in the region any penalty, can wait until will have the perfect evidence.
Even in limited availability of quantitative evidence, however, there are good reasons to believe that the death penalty is deterrence payoff effect.
Most people -- and especially murderers -- a fear of death, especially when comes quickly and with high likely after a murder.
As in the discussion of suicide said philosopher David Hume, "No people never kick life until he was behind the it live.
Or that is our natural horror of death ... "Similarly, Schopenhauer believed that" once the horrors of life to reach the stage in which the horror of death, people will end his life.
The death but place considerable resistance ... "
Opponents of the death penalty often declare that the state has no moral right to take some life, even if it were a guilty.
For anyone who believes that the death penalty deters, but it is completely wrong conclusions.
To understand the reason to assume that for every murderers, who is executed (and that is not, therefore, for example, life sentence), the number of murders cut by three, which is much lower numbers than in their estimates of deterrence payoff, Ehrlich and some others.
This means that for every the murderer would die three innocent victims.
If the government uses the death penalty, indirectly, by "musters" many human lives.
The three innocent lives as each of the executed man appears to be very tempting to trade, and even two to the preserved on the lives of execution are convincing the costs and yields punishment.
Admittedly, that the falling number to the preserved lives per execution this argument in favor of the death penalty to lose Pádnosti.
But even if every executions save only one human life, would still be the "trade" desirable in the case, that he would be to the preserved life better than the life of core samples, which would usually.
Many people have objected to comparison to the preserved the quality of life and death.
But I see the way to avoid such comparisons.
Consider "career criminals" who and murdered victims, who led the respectable life, leaving behind several children and husband or wife.
And to assume that the execution of criminals would be to save the life of a single victim.
According to me it is obvious that the life of such victims must have more weight than the end of life.
Not all the cases are of course, this unequivocal but examining the quality of individuals must form part of any sensible social policy.
This helps explain why they should be the death penalty only for the killings, and not for less serious crimes.
If we should measure human lives and property, for example, reducing criminal activity, it is the argument in favor of mild punishment much stronger.
And although a grave harm to health, including some ugly incidents of rape can its importance near some of the murders and could possibly call for heavy punishment, I support their application in these cases.
A strong argument for restrictions on the death penalty solely on the murder is the so-called "ultimate deterrence."
If, for example, assault punish executions, they would be the perpetrators to its victims to kill in order to avoid getting caught (which is an important reason why they penalty should fit the crime).
One of the complications associated with the punishment can mark the fact that the murderers will stubbornly defend getting caught, which could lead to further deaths.
The marginal deterrence here while plays an important role, but I believe the resistance against the murderer of getting caught, some at the cost of losing their life is in fact direct evidence that criminals have of the death penalty is fear.
Of course, we fear the risks that will be executed innocent people.
My support for the death penalty would greatly breaks down, if the percentage of the execution of innocent people is really high, as many claims.
I believe, however, that the case on appeal process in the US has great protection -- perhaps not so much against unjust conviction as against unjust executions -- so that cases of killing innocent people there are very few, if any.
This process, extremely helped development identification by DNA.
And so cannot be repeated, that the debate on the death penalty is basically a debate about its deterrence payoff effect (which can reduce the lengthy appeals).
Can see that some people to build these record skeptical even when they personally I believe that at this point are wrong and that against them on this issue, and sound common sense.
Take someone life is very worrying, even if this was the life of murderers, but sometimes it is necessary to take a very unpleasant and steps to prevent even worse behavior that thwarting the lives of innocent victims.
The People Versus Putin
In the search for successor first democratically elected Russian President Boris Yeltsin would help with the selection of Vladimir Putin.
Given that Russia now control structures on the edge of the KGB and the mafia and the same structure of manipulating the judicial system, it is that Yeltsin wanted to it because of his successor, to avoid the eventual prosecution.
But US who are Putin choose, we were charged with the search for someone who would protect Yeltsin and his family, but someone who would continue its reforms.
Yeltsin really should not fear and seek their own survival, but for the survival of the democratic ideas, which put it into Russia.
Yet this idea is now in danger because of the successor, for which we decided to.
Deny its responsibility for the support of Putin.
We have close friends, but we are cooperating in critical situations and I never doubt his sincerity.
Putin act in accordance with their beliefs.
The trouble is that their beliefs -- including the view that Russia can prosper only if it controls the only source of power -- are flawed.
This fundamental mistake led Russia to political crash.
Of course, no one hold high office, without doing mistakes even fundamental mistakes, which is particularly true in turbulent times.
Yeltsin was no exception, but admit its mistakes.
For example, when the Silvestra 1999 go into retirement, asked for forgiveness for not starting a war in Chechnya.
Putin, on the contrary, it seems to understand and acknowledge their mistake and insists on a policy long after the its failure to be clear to the world.
One of Yeltsin's mistake was that at the forefront of his program of reform can impose moral priorities.
Russia should be Kát under Stalinism and gulag system.
The nation without exception, should show remorse, as it since 1945 have Germans.
This failure is important, because Putin's unconditional faith in the central power has resulted in the re-capture of the state security forces.
Indeed, a direct result of the National for era gulag should be the prohibition of the Communist Party and the disqualification of the KGB for political functions.
Although in the post-communist societies where hunting and collaboration were so widespread -- and the border between them often sharp -- are such political lustration process complicated find reasonable solutions are possible as in the Czech Republic.
The subject of the Russian security structures without damaging capable political return, which it is managed.
A resurgence of political structures of the KGB during Putin's administration and their efforts to dissident has once again to Russia in the country.
It is impossible to silence independent policies and independent media, if not an independent source of money, which is why Putin's Kremlin focused its attacks on so-called "oligarchs".
This is why it is organizing the arrest and trial of Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
Security forces that dominate the Kremlin, hope that the removal of independent sources of money in Russia will destroy an independent political life.
Without independent belief bases is Uchytávat a climate of fear.
Fear not only the humiliating; it also allows the bad management of state.
Yeltsin intuitively understand that fear and orchestrated, centralized decision-making is the right choice for the management of a modern country, and because they insisted on reforming the relations between citizens and the state.
Putin still cannot understand that centralized political system now cannot understand the mistakes and fixing is, as it was the Soviet era.
Putin, not well educated men, with total and a deep sincerity led Russia to the same degradation which accompanied the collapse of the Soviet state.
That is what people are beginning to.
Understand that Putin's desire to build a strong and effective modern state cannot be implemented, because the modern state is not controlled from above, but well-informed electorates that representatives of the state forced to admit its mistakes and remedied.
Putin appears to the inability of his regime also fears.
This is one reason why Russia began to behave so aggressively to its neighbors, Ukraine and Georgia, and why he sought to maintain military presence in places like Transdneister, region of Moldova.
The Kremlin thinks that shoulders in the near Russian neighborhood can Russians at home to convince his omnipotence.
Given the debate in Russia and the Kremlin's ability to manipulate the elections, the only option that is those who want to maintain democratic in Russia, the idea is regime change.
Holding onto their ugly heads all aid.
Those who oppose Putin, it must Rozmyslet what they want, and declared that if the regime to ensure observance of the constitution, they have the right to push him all the necessary resources.
On the issue can now in Russia cannot be decided only at the ballot box.
As in Ukraine, Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan about it will be taken in the streets.
Danit and spend (please)
Excessive taxation can Otupit incentives and hamper growth.
Too low taxation but can lead to the same.
The government is meager income from taxes to provide the basic public goods.
Even worse is that the low tax revenues in poor countries often come from a lack of a system of collecting taxes (rather than the low tax rates), which including support productive business.
The importance of well-designed tax system demonstrates India.
In Bangalore, high tech companies to build the site on the world level, full lawn and high speed networks for remote transmission of data.
Outside the compound but lies open Stoky, no one Odpadky and roads in shape.
Although the society of new technologies in every moment terabyte convey information to distant continent, local transport is almost medieval speed.
Businesses in Bangalore because running their own bus service, hire private supplier of drinking water and Generátory to protect against with supplies of electricity.
The state of this mess can fix, because it is for broke.
India's state debt exceeds 70% of GDP, so that more than half of tax revenues go to payments of interest.
Debt but did not create due to excessive spending in the past.
The Indian government spending are about 15% of GDP, with average in the OECD is about 40% of GDP.
India's financial problems are more of the ill-designed and administered the tax system.
Rates and the rules of the personal income tax and legal persons, according to international standards to.
Nevertheless, the Indian government has an income tax of only about 3% of GDP, or about half compared to South Korea and other Asian Tigers.
In India roughly a quarter of GDP accounts for agriculture, but not wealthy farmers pay taxes.
Export-oriented companies operating in the software industry and other areas are on their profits tax holidays, although their workers must pay income taxes.
Despite the reasonable rates remain widespread tax evasion.
To is because the government to invest in staff not to tax systems, who rarely is way behind bars, and if caught, often with the help of bribes to avoid problems.
In the detailed view is that trying to avoid "direct" tax revenues and profits reflect confusion in the system, "indirect" tax imposed on production and consumption.
Over 60% of indirect taxes, which have the same share of total tax income up in India consumption taxes.
The consumption tax was set to 16% of the value of output of the company.
There is also a host of relief, liberation and premium attached.
For example, to category as food products, cotton, have and computers is imposed "ATTENTION-rate tax" of 8%.
Some products, including Polyesterová freed, automobiles, Kondicionéry and Pneumatiky are burdened by a "special additional consumer tax" (SED) of 8%.
"goods on a special significance" imposed "added consumer tax" (AED, soft on differences from SED).
Relief from consumption tax are numerous and complicated and related, including at firms with total annual sales to 10 million and on firms in certain disadvantaged and underdeveloped areas.
Overall, the Liberation of the share to 70 broad categories, to 259 lines, 52, and 7 lists, each of which contains the amount of data.
Tax relief, they say about abuse.
Lower officials, who enjoy considerable flexibility in implementation of the conditions can be for a price to believe, is considered favorable way.
Goods tax-free high rate (for example,) sells goods as after-tax rate low (for example,).
Shunning the consumption tax is infectious than avoiding tax on profits and revenue.
If a firm consumer taxes ever and the tax rate is compared with after-tax profit margins in the industry high, its competitors must also cheat, has only to preserve.
As tax evasion spread, the government introduce a "additional" and "special" taxes, thereby encouraging to another flight.
The selection of direct taxes are too.
Bribes taxes under favorable classification, the difference between the value of and and reporting lower than the actual revenue creates a "black" funds, which cannot be cited to tax returns.
Insider plans to bypass indirect taxes weakens the state's ability to provide basic public goods, but also discourage companies from the productive technology, which require procedures including a plant in large.
Given that direct taxes can be easily escape of many small organizations instead of one large, cannot be achieved savings economies of scale.
Noteworthy is that in the software industry, where they are from indirect tax free all the troops, at Indian society effective size.
India could emulate the example of China where rationalization indirect taxes in 1994 to prepare the way for a boom?
Or the coalition government democracy are not capable of such reforms?
Last year Indian government led by BJP party unveiled legislation suffered from a budget deficit reduction.
Then established a working group that had the task to formulate the necessary changes in tax and spending policies.
This year in July the group proposed a tax increases rather than (spending), including through the removal of most of the liberation from indirect taxes.
It seems that the new Indian government led by the Congress is also in favor of proposals.
If Congress and opposition parties carry things by the end of the largest piece of work, they do to sustain economic growth and for the countries of the view that democracy can do what is needed to stimulate development.
What is wrong with the Turkey?
On December face a Istanbul court one of the famous Turkish Orhan Pamuk writers to face charges of "a national identity," which supposedly committed by, for open discussion on Turkish genocide a million Armenians between 1915 and 1916.
Pamukovi now face a three-way prison.
Turkey's efforts to fine and close down to jail those who adhere to the official line, leads me to believe that I acted correctly when I opposed the start of accession negotiations of this country with the European Union.
In December 1999 to grant Turkey candidate status of the European Council of EU countries, of which logically indicate that Turkey closer to a pre-specified date join the Union.
The Council then asked the European Commission to the October 2004 to decide whether Turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria of membership, including democracy, rule of law and respect for rights of ethnic minorities.
It was a one of the decisions the Commission Romano Prodi, which I was a member.
Thirty of the commission members are 29 stated that Turkey fulfills the criteria sufficiently, and negotiations so they can continue.
The only I agrees.
My decision, shaped by the report by the Commission, which deprived Günter Verheugen, the Commissioner for EU enlargement.
The report mentioned that in 2003 made in EU Member States request for asylum 21 370 Turks and 2 127 and was taken.
And government of the EU itself in other words to acknowledge that the Turkish government in 2003 Perzekvovala more than two thousands of citizens.
Meanwhile, the Commission publish a regular report on Turkey, in which admitted that the slightly Islamisticky-oriented cabinet of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's continues in the reforms, even though the slow pace.
Even this report but also mentioned: serious violations of human rights violations including torture continued, the influence of the army was still too high, freedom of speech, follow the general, Muslim religious and cultural minorities with face discrimination and violence in the women was not sufficiently strongly defended.
Since the start of accession talks this year in October, many changes.
Aside from the current criminal prosecution Orhana Pamuka it only filled with other cases of acceptable behaviour.
In March 2005, the police violence emptied demonstrations to celebrate International Women's Day.
In May was banned activities that the biggest unions, teachers, as to promote education 14 million of Turkish Kurds in their own language.
Intolerance, runs until top Turkish government.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül recently in Copenhagen decisively abolished press conference, when in audiences Kurdish journalist, whose after Danes rejected guide.
Such actions and attitudes of our disagreement in October 2004 enough to warrant.
But even if these deficiencies removed Turkey would still should not be admitted into the EU, because this is not the European countries.
Christianity, feudalism, Renaissance, enlightenment, democracy and industrialization has of us Europeans who we are, but have not made the Turks what they are.
I am not therefore believe that the reforms that were established in Turkey at the insistence of the European Commission, would continue even after its entry.
Rather, I suspect that will is cooling.
Turkey's admission would also inevitably led to the accession of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova -- and perhaps even Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The first three of these countries are certainly European than Turkey.
And even if left three Kavkazské Republic Party, but included successor states of former Yugoslavia, this would mean the creation of the EU, about thirty-five members.
What this would be for the Union?
The EU is simply no club friends.
It is based on freedom of movement of goods, services, capital, and citizens.
The Commission as guardian of the Union's Treaties must protect these four fundamental freedoms, which means that sometimes must encourage member countries and in the necessary cases and force them to change laws.
Protialkoholová policy in Sweden, the Volkswagen law in Germany and discrimination against foreign investment funds in France are cases that have made Commission unpopular.
But it is necessary.
At a time when I left the Commission, I sit on stoh fifteen hundred such management.
EU membership in short, entails the need to take strong measures, which have a profound impact on the internal affairs of the state.
This will not be possible if members of the Union become so disparate countries.
The EU would then be victim of what the historian Paul Kennedy calls "imperial outreach."
The Union would had become more reasonable.
Therefore, the former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing feared that Turkish accession will lead to the EU, and because the former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: "Turkey's admission would be more than the EU can bear."
A strong incentive against Turkey's entry but it is a genuinely democratic: the majority of the EU, it simply does not.
Bolivia's Crisis, Latin America Failure
Bolivia is not by any standards typical Latin American countries.
With the exception of Haiti is the poorest countries in the western hemisphere and in terms of stability is even worse, because here since independence happened more than two hundreds of coups.
In the region with a strong indigenous past, but scattered and isolated by Bolivia, Guatemala is perhaps the only Latin American countries where the indigenous peoples are the majority of the population.
Its Topografie and ethnic gives rise to, and even forces that threaten national unity is crucial than elsewhere.
And, of course, is Bolivia and Paraguay in this subcontinent also the only state that has no sea.
It would be so very wise to extend the current Bolivia's crisis on the rest of Latin America.
is too easy: elsewhere are institutions stronger poverty -- and especially the extreme poverty -- is declining and the battle for natural resources have been largely settled.
Even in places like Venezuela, which has huge reserves of oil and traditionally based nationalist government, survived the status quo to allow foreign investment in energy resources almost eight years of government of President Hugo Chavez.
The existence of indigenous movement while a reality in many countries -- from Chiapas through "Araucaniu" and Amazonia to Ayacucho -- but anywhere in Latin America is not a real threat to the national integrity.
Bolivia's crisis is worrying example and neither the hoary "domino theory," which Bolivia hold Lyndon Johnson and Che Guevara, there seem to be valid or if only semi-sensible.
Yet the current Bolivia's crisis shows on the "democratic deficit", which suffers from today's Latin America.
In Bolivia, Ecuador and Haiti have died of this or that reason, elected leaders.
Cuba, in Mexico and Nicaragua is democracy either imperfect or none at all and in Venezuela and Colombia is in turn of this or that reason in danger.
None of these cases is not identical with another; all contain varying degrees of risks of damage or reconciliation.
The question is what can be done with this state of affairs, which compares with an encouraging prospect, which are just a few years ago to prevail.
At the last conference of the Organization of American States (in Fort Lauderdale in Florida havens) took a delegation of the United States from the other a good idea and then him its support for basically sink.
The story began a few years ago, when they were then Argentina's Foreign Minister Dante Caputo and teams of the UN Development Program charged with drafting a report on the state of democracy in Latin America.
They have concluded that early warning systems democratic crisis in the region would help to intervene, before the situation out of control, as it is now in Bolivia.
Caputo and convince the UN team after Chile's President Ricardo Lagos to take the initiative, along with several colleagues, it began to enforce.
Lagos, have done so, but the initiative to get too far.
Report on the state of democracy in Latin America accounts in 2004 about it in fact, hardly mentioned.
The US and the new secretary-general, Jose Miguel Insulza Chilan havens, the plan during the conference havens in Florida, but eventually it sink rational concerns of the Latin American leaders that the idea is directed against Venezuela, as they joined the anachronistic Latin Americans fear of violation of the sacred principle of non-interference by.
Although the continent's failure to agree on this idea, the concept of an early warning system is notable.
The current situation in Bolivia this community of western hemisphere many do, but this situation is dangerous for all.
Evo Morales, leader of the opposition and of the coca growers, it may be honest, if somewhat disoriented Democratic leader, but are really in their supporters authoritarian desires?
Hugo Chavez may finance Morales and other Bolivian dissidents, but Venezuela and Cuba do not feel the temptation of intervening in the affairs of the country, where before almost 40 years ago died Che Guevara, when he be guerilla war?
The business community of Santa Cruz may carry out its threat of separation, but really will be about oil and gas reserves in the region to share with the indigenous mountain peoples than Brazilian industrialists of São Paulo?
Than events reach these excess, it might be irrelevant if they began to engage pockets (rather than the US).
The region will continue to need this engagement -- in time, on securing either and the proper democratic platform, which will be different from traditional intervention from the US and the traditional indifference of Latin America.
The decline of France?
The French are notorious for its sensitivity -- if not austerity, the status of France in the world.
The French state to invest huge financial sums to promoting French language and culture, but still, the French painfully aware that the status of their country in the world is not such that have been used.
No surprise because the news of the European Commission, under which the level of the French economy in comparison with other European countries has fallen in ten years from third to tenth place in a time of the last presidential election and a controversy. Before long, President Jacques Chirac has accused his rival Lionel Jospin that produced "The decline of France."
The OECD and Eurostat -- the European body for these data fits -- thought that this aspect of the debate ended when have shown that France, Germany, Italy, and the UK are roughly the same average living standards of people.
The broader dispute by but were not eliminated.
Ustarané discussions about "the decline of France" has re-emerge in the context of this year's protests against pension reform, with a growing controversy over fiscal policy towards the European Commission and the wrangling, with the United States on the war in Iraq.
The Top-selling Book Literature Fact in France is Now Polemic Nicolas Bavereze Called La France Qui Tombe (France). Declining
The book is Citacemi de Gaullea and Napoleon.
Recent spectacular successes achieved France according to author in the 1970s, when the operation was launched Rychlovlaku TGV and the Airbus plane.
Baverez also denounces the Mitterrand and Chirac for their "common talent won not changing the election and France in the outsiders."
The success of the book is itself a sign of certain problems.
What are, however, species?
Baverezovy arguments about the decline is not as powerful as the author believes.
As a flagrant evidence of the French, for example, as the fall of the loss of jobs in industry.
De-industrialisation but there is a common phenomenon in all developed countries.
France, in this respect is even better than most of its rivals from the rich countries and unlike Germany, Britain or the US, France in the industrial sector to maintain the same share of the global market, which should in the early 1970's.
Also according to an accurate measure of competitiveness, which are the foreign investment, France is doing very well.
According to a recent report by the Council for Economic Analysis' direct investment in France in 2001 to 60 billion euros, which is almost twice as much as in Germany.
In the past three decades, also Nákladová has improved the competitiveness of France (20%), with higher productivity compensating for the rapid growth of wages.
At the heart of the long-term economic problems of France, this is a fear of job losses in the industrial sector.
France remains a strong industrial powers in the traditional areas such as automotive and aviation industry, but behind on the market with innovation, where small firms to develop new technologies.
On research and development in the area of high technology such as France spends just 30 billion dollars per year, compared to 51 billion in Germany, 98 billion in Japan and 265 billion in the US.
Baverezova analysis in short, shows in the wrong direction.
In the last two decades passed France of vital reforms: economic and financial liberalization, lifting control prices and exchange rate of credit restrictions, European liberalization, a decrease in inflation and trade deficits, the euro's launch and forced the globalization of domestic firms.
France's problems with any of these reforms have to do.
The problem of France is the fact that it cannot take on the knowledge of the new world, which has become part of itself.
The French state capitalism is dead and France with his demise only hard balance.
It certainly is the only country whose prime minister, Lionel Jospin -- felt obliged to explain away with just days after the television said that "the state is not an all-powerful."
For the French schizophrenia there are many causes, but it is certain that the key reason has to do with political games in the past 20 years.
Until 1981 led in France clear dividing line between right and left.
Since then, but Mitterandova and Chirac's administration reduces their ideological, are to undergo the process of adjusting to Europe and the globalization.
One of the "shock therapy" on the way of Margaret Thatcher 20 years ago could trigger a new political awareness.
The consensual direction from the reforms but the French to live in one of the world and to think in another.
This is a key reason for political disaster, which came during the last presidential campaign, when the far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen came in second round of presidential elections at the expense of the Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
Also the rise of extreme left, which in this presidential election received 10% of the vote, suggests a political failure.
France needs more political than economic revolution, to deal with reality, whose form part of the recognition that "the decline of France" is the fear that the French are themselves.
The Value of European Values
EU leaders resume talks on the constitution, which last December fail because of the controversy over voting rights.
Similar disputes, of course, to make compromises that will probably be found.
Still, however, a clear understanding of what the constitution has actually achieved.
European integration holds up the Amazon's two basic principles: solidarity and subsidiarity.
The two principles lies at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, economics, sociology and law.
For years were present in legal and institutional framework of the European Union -- in the Treaty, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which is in the preamble to quotes) and in a recent draft constitution.
In short, they wrote into the history and ideals of the EU.
But what solidarity and subsidiarity really mean?
To the first Solidarity, which is open at least two interpretation: static solidarity is only in the redistribution of income and wealth, while a broader concept of a dynamic solidarity includes their creation.
In post-war history of European integration was dynamic strong solidarity in the first period -- in an era of the European Coal and Steel Community -- and both in the strategy of economic development (Renewal), and in the Treaties, particularly in the Treaty of Rome.
But this does not mean that was later suppressed dynamic solidarity: it represents, for example, is the European Monetary Union.
So although some countries have of the euro for immediate, yet it is put in place, because they were convinced that this in the long run will have a positive effect.
Dynamic solidarity in other words means policy that promotes investment, innovation, economic growth and employment.
But as shows GDP growth in the EU, was in the past decade dynamic solidarity undermined.
Particularly worrying is lagging in the field of research and development.
Implementing the so-called Lisbon strategy, the EU adopted in 2000 with the promise of creating a competitive economy in the world, threatened by increasing emphasis on the attempts of solidarity which is reflected in the high cost of social security and high taxes needed to its financing.
The dominance of static solidarity is due to aging populations who, with slow growth led and leads to a structural fiscal imbalances.
One of the greatest task for the future of the EU is addressing today's from a static solidarity aimed at the old people over the dynamic solidarity young people.
The Union after all, cannot afford to continue to allow, to the current consumption prevail over the investment needed to secure the future prosperity.
The concept of subsidiarity, solidarity is similar to that, he has two interpretation: vertical subsidiarity and red horizontal subsidiarity.
Vertical subsidiarity lies in the separation of powers on different levels of government and sovereignty: the EU, the national States, regions and possible government community.
Most famous of applying this principle is federalism.
In the European treaties are clear expression of vertical subsidiarity.
But this is not enough to institutional and constitutional arrangements of the Union?
Red horizontal subsidiarity lies in the responsibility and freedom of the people, as well as in social and economic power.
It includes relations between the state, society and market.
The company and the market but they have their own rights and sovereignty, which he states lend.
So the problem lies in ensuring the autonomy of each of these spheres.
Example red horizontal subsidiarity is internal European market, which produced a new kind of economic freedom and increased competition among companies that eliminate the protection that they provided the national governments.
Red horizontal subsidiarity means that in society or in the economic sphere state cannot disrupt freedom and responsibility of the individual, that must be respected in the highest possible degree.
Also, this means that wherever freedom and responsibility of the individual not sufficient to fulfill the necessary for human dignity must provide support for a "supreme power."
This support would, however, should be implemented in ways that encourage natural potential of the individual, society and market.
But this is possible only if that is the role of the red horizontal subsidiarity clearly formulated, which is not the case of the European Treaties of the charter of fundamental rights nor of the European Convention.
In short, the solidarity means more redistribution than growth (which is the way today's generation expresses solidarity with the next generation), while the subsidiarity means more redistribution of political power than careful borders between the state, civil society and the market.
Today, both values defined in ways that favor state.
Concentration in the market-oriented growth is often associated with half-values of America.
These values are deeply entrenched but also in Europe, and they should be made once again to light.
The EU should restore its economic vitality of the drive for such a model of solidarity and subsidiarity, which would be balanced in favor of the market and society and which would reduce the influence of the state.
State institutions should provide the public goods (such as defense, justice, fiscal and monetary policy), the society should provide goods social (such as culture, education and help the people) and the market should provide economic goods (which are related to the profits growth and employment).
In the 21st century Europe must reconsider the value of both these principles, solidarity and subsidiarity -- to achieve the historic objective of integration: freedom and welfare needed to overcome differences and political divisions that in the 20th century fueled a tragedy.
Such is the spirit in which the European constitution must be written.
Politics of Values
The debate on the US elections has stopped.
As President George W. Bush was able to win about three million votes more than Senator John Kerry and Návdavkem achieve majority representation of Republicans in both houses of Congress?
In the answers about the agreement, but many explanations cited on the same two issues.
One of them is the question of personalities.
At the time of uncertainty and insecurity have people greater confidence in President who know, than in the candidate who is.
The second issue are values.
People voted for orchards values rather than for any concrete policies.
Some say (how) may agree to Kerry's policies but nonetheless gave Bush the vote, because it is his general attitude of a sense of calm.
If it is a way of voting, are now the United States clearly deeply divided.
Oblouk blue (Democratic) states to the east, north and west countries spans a huge red (Republican) in the region and in the south.
What's more, these divisions, to create and on the local level.
Instrumental division of constituencies so that they should benefit from a political party, which is not necessary.
The people they tend to move to areas where the majority share their values, whether Republican or Democratic.
It is precisely what values?
Of those that, as say -- dealt with "God, arms and gay."
Its role in them a religion, including a literalist biblical truth, if it is a story of creation.
Holding weapons is the ultimate test of individualism and use of weapons in the war is reprehensible.
Homosexuality and other "modern" practices are dismissed as fixed.
As recently said political scientist Andrew hacker, "Bush's candidacy was aimed to gain majority vote by provided roughly 60 million people have a chance of the good feeling."
This is all the American phenomenon, or similar trends are there and elsewhere?
One answer is that the policy of values as the American phenomenon may now represent the majority, but in no case is not universal.
Europe and other parts of the world are divided as much.
On the personality undoubtedly matters and under external political differences can hide also questions of values, who still come to the fore.
The traditional political divisions based on the dispute over the fundamental values but play in the elections still smaller role.
For example, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, other senior officials that lies ahead for elections, while a personality card and talk about political strategies, but in fact, above all represent value orchards of the middle class.
When talking about "modernization," about "things into the 21st century," he has Sugerovat strange, but the temptation of change and stability.
The conservative opposition is without effective answers.
Even questions such as tax cuts or tougher asylum rules play quite a streak of values, which have affected the Republican side in the US.
A similar picture exists in Germany, where is external influence value policy even lower.
The German debate is still largely debate about political strategies.
When the opposition to government talks about reforming the health or the new fighting unemployment, the hidden competition concerns rather than Kompetentnosti values.
Under the usual battlefield political debate in Britain, Germany and elsewhere in Europe, but hide value clashes.
Parties are fighting for those that can be sent to "from should feel good", but perhaps it is fully aware that this is only part of the question of politics.
Religion is likely to become an important factor in European politics; public opinion polls show that religious practices represent one of the few big differences between Americans and Europeans.
The weapons are in the minds of Europeans different jobs; the majority of Europeans regarded as an important their absence.
It is also in Europe unmistakable and some features of pacifism.
So far an underestimated role but there is also the question of political correctness (homosexuals).
The most important of all, however, is the fact that Europeans divides Europe itself, because in any European state a "national issues."
It is a matter of values-inspired fear.
People want to know where they belong, and turning against the US and toward Europe or against Europe and towards their country.
Either way, are removed empire political strategy, and even policies and enter the Kalné sphere symbols and myth.
This is in any case the risk that democratic countries face, because the politics of values is a dangerous development.
Again, bringing the fundamental divisions in society, whose biggest democratic success is eliminating fundamentalism from politics.
Enlightened public debate must be a dispute over the political strategy in the community of values.
To insist, therefore, is the main goal of the policy of freedom.
There Has Never been a Time of Service
One Spring to do and one month of a normal growth number of jobs and rising prices in the United States does not mean that the central bank continues to fear economic worries and deflation.
But a time when the world interest rates will rise, because the central bankers will be preparing to fight rising inflation.
Whatever the moment will come at any time -- this autumn, in 2005, in 2006 or 2007 -- will, America and the global economy face financial vulnerabilities, which reflects the success of monetary stimulus in the slowdown in production, and reining in unemployment in the past three years.
Short-term interest rates are amazingly low: only 2% in the euro area, only 1% in the US and zero in Japan.
An expansionary monetary policy was successful, but only in the fact that pushed interest rates at historic lows -- and that convinced investors that the cost of borrowing will remain at current levels even a long time.
The main result of the monetary stimulus was an increase in asset prices: if interest rates very low and that they remain very low, then everything is a dividend yields, or rents, becoming attractive -- and hence in the currency of valuable.
This explains the big differences among current real estate prices in the US, stocks in New York, London and Frankfurt and long-term bonds around the world with what one would normally regarded as their fundamental value.
So what will happen when the central bank will raise interest rates?
In 1994, rising short-term rates also growth rates of long-term -- and the decline in prices of long-term securities -- who was at least doubled compared to what at the time, predicting a standard models.
Interest rates from emerging economies of the world, grew much faster than the rates in the advanced industrial core.
The first danger that we should fear for 2005, as well as in the future, when the rise of the world's interest rates likely to come about, is therefore another wave of financial crisis in the so-called new economy.
In countries like Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the balance of the 1990s shows that the rising interest rates can spread and capital flows are remarkably quickly reversed, regardless of how they see favorable economic policies of each country leaders of the IMF and the analysis of big banks.
Rising interest rates in the new economy is now abnormally low.
The international money flows -- aside from the flow of cash resources to the US -- even to achieve a level that when we speak of "irrational exuberance", but still occur before the opening of rising interest rates.
But this is the alarming prospect because if in the 1990s is a lesson, it is in recognition that no one should not overestimate the stability of the international financial flows.
A second danger stems from a high asset prices within the first of the industrial core.
In the US central bank clearly predominant view-that I agree-that the information-technology revolution continues, the growth rate of potential performance in the US remains very high, and performance gap is thus relatively wide.
This implies that interest rates may not have to remain low for a long time.
Confidence in the central bank is, moreover, the high and the rest of the premium for inflation risks from the 1970s have been of interest rates.
As a result, interest rates remain on the circumstances of the 1980's and 1990's low even after the performance will return to their potential.
All this is obviously good news for those who own assets as long-term bonds, stocks and real estate.
Increases in prices of long-term assets, indeed, the real reason for reducing interest rates: enrich holders of bonds and, above all, real estate owners after all, to stimulate their spending.
The bad news is that although the assumption is that interest rates remain low, even for a stay so low indefinitely.
The nature of is that, the rise in interest rates will be the fall of the asset prices.
It is in such periods -- particularly if asset prices more quickly and sharply -- will show how well our central bankers fulfills its main task: reducing financial and support for economic stability.
In such periods also see how many owners of long-term securities, real estate or stocks is a not so that they take their existing prices for attractive relative to the underlying prices, but simply because their prices in the past few years increase.
This is the key issue for economic strategy, because those who are long-term assets to buy because their prices at the time, seemingly invariably dramatically, is to sell immediately after the price trend will turn.
Particularly the US trade deficit in the future is a potential source of great instability in case of a decline in long-term asset price.
Problems with which they will be key strategists world economy over the next few years of struggle, will certainly different from problems faced in the aftermath of a bubble Nasdaq.
Risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than the risks resulting from the collapse of the performance and the threat of deflation.
However, as we learned in the 1990s, all this does not mean that the coming challenges will manage more easily.
Opposing America's Future
I recently discovered something interesting: American economists of international finance and American economists on domestic-oriented economy have very different -- and contradictory -- likely consequences of the US views on current-account deficit.
Economists of International Finance as the most likely see the financial crisis, after which will be followed by a painful and perhaps the protracted recession in the United States.
Macroeconomists focusing on the domestic economy on the contrary view the looming collapse of the dollar as the crisis, but as an opportunity to accelerating growth.
Macroeconomists domestic-oriented economy sees the situation about this: at some point in the future foreign central banks will be less willing to continue to buy enormous amounts of dollar-denominated securities and reinforce the US currency.
To end its massive programs purchase dollars, the dollar will fall, and will fall sharply.
According to this view, however, when the value of the dollar will be permanently for foreigners will be more attractive American export goods and in the US unemployment will rise, with the labor force will be direct to the newly as well as renewed export sector.
It will be a type of what happened in Britain after leaving the exchange rate peg and let the pound devalued in relation to the German mark, or of what occurred in the US in the late 1980s, when the dollar's devaluation against the pound, the Deutsche mark and, above all, the Japanese yen.
Economists see the future of international finance much.
Are convinced that the end of a comprehensive program of the central bank to buy the dollar will not only in the dollar, but also to a sharp increase in long-term US interest rates, which immediately curb consumer spending and with little late outlet investment spending.
Of course, an economist of international finance also understand that reducing the value of the dollar will benefit the export of the US, but Prodlevy demand are such that the increase in exports came to a year or two after a decline in consumption and investment spending.
Eight to ten million people will have to change jobs and move of services and construction in the export of goods and goods into competing private imports, which means that rises structural unemployment.
Moreover, can a financial panic: the large financial institutions with short-term liabilities and long-term assets has experienced a difficult time, and will have to deal with large dollar rise in long-term interest rates.
This inappropriate connection can trigger financial strains and bankruptcy just as easily as in the Mexican and East Asian crisis in the 1990s and during Argentina's crisis in the current decade has assets of banks in local currency and liabilities in dollars.
When the international finance have sketched this scenario, macroeconomists focusing on the domestic economy are responding that this is as a competent monetary policy.
Why should the Federal Reserve to afford to long-term interest rates ratios soaring just because other central banks to put an end to their programs purchase dollars?
Should the Fed act and replace them their purchases of long-term government bonds the US, which would maintain long-term interest rates at the level of allowing full employment?
The economists of international finance to, that is not in the Fed can do so.
If the Fed forced to choose between full employment and price stability, international finance economists say that decide to price stability, for his institutional memory of the 1970s, when inflation spin out of control, it is still very much alive.
Therefore, given that the decline in the value of the dollar increases import prices and functions so as negative shock for the supply side of the economy, the Fed will have to raise interest rates, not reduced, and bonds to sell, not to buy.
On either cap this debate, is strongly views serious economists, who is highly respected.
I am not are wise enough to demonstrate to say who is right, but certainly I know who I hope that is wrong.
Black Passengers Europe
In the United States must the individual countries that pursue sound fiscal policies, paying a tax.
Compared to well-governed states to sell their bonds at their discount windows.
Higher debt servicing, which must provide serves -- to some extent, as a form of measures against the temptation to spend now and pay up to next.
Of course, market discipline is not perfect, the bond market too well "to see the" implicit future commitments (to be paying pensions).
Nevertheless, this forced fiscal discipline, together with internal budget procedures of individual States, from the US since the Great Depression of large-scale fiscal crisis at the level of state.
Now look to Europe.
Before the advent of the euro in the individual national states in southern Europe there were many fiscal crises that sparked a wave of high inflation.
After the introduction of the single currency, however, to address the fiscal crisis through inflation closed because of monetary policy now hold Rangers the European Central Bank (ECB).
But while no longer national states cannot in a balanced solution to their finance rely on inflation, the single currency it allows for extending an expenditure and to political responsibility for the period of laissez Le Temps bons Roulés use debt capacity that properly's other members of the European Union.
To this possibility to prevent, the EU had created the stability and growth pact: government deficits should be lower than 3% of GDP.
Last week the government in Germany -- once fiscal-prudent and disciplined EU countries -- violated the rules of the pact on fiscal discipline for the fifth year in a row and did so without (many) apologies.
Finance Minister peer Steinbrück suggested that is expected that the European Commission applies to Germany some sanctions, if not taken any steps, he said, the credibility of the pact will be at risk.
Germany thus this time will not block the sanctions, as it made over two and a half years.
Steinbrück but also made it clear that it is expected that sanctions response to the estimated Germany's fiscal deficit of 3% of GDP will be largely symbolic, that it is on, for which would make the government or economy paid a major price.
The Stability and Growth Pact worked -- at least for now, as had originally been intended.
And as it has with market discipline?
The German government is the willingness to create another debt and run with larger deficits limited because market comprehends and fine national states that allow to their fiscal position of weakness?
In one word, not.
Interest rates for sovereign debt in the 12 euro-zone governments are all very similar.
So it seems that the markets sustain this, that individual countries have different potential produce exports and covered so financial flows needed to pay off debt or different, and an estimated debt/GDP ratio.
Willem Buiter from Amsterodamské universities and Anne Sibertová of London University are convinced that this was the willingness of the ECB's policy in the nature of the euro-zone debt as secure what own willingness markets served as fiscal prudence.
If part of the German debt used as a guarantee for short-term loans or as the main point of the Treaty on procurement to obtain liquidity of its value will be much more determined according to the conditions under which the ECB as a guarantee it will accept than according to the crucial indicators.
The ECB's access to all such debt as a solid liquidity reserve resources now wins over every been points of difference in the long-term sovereign risk.
This is dangerous in the long term.
To create a reasonable chance of long-term price stability is needed as market discipline and prudent fiscal management.
Vynechte either on the market for behaviour that can afflicted what makes or institutional leverage that giving the voice of future generations, and would seriously risk -- may not today or tomorrow, but only once and for the rest of life.
How is the time, the single currency and the way the euro was launched, it is still more unrest.
Overall, the policy of the euro too deflationary.
Without the necessary transfer that would a common currency have made unbearable for the region, which and are already in recession when the ECB tightened policy.
The institutional underpinnings of a stable long-term fiscal policies are being eroded.
And in this Buiter and Sibertová compelling argue that the ECB gives the market of compensation and punishing the extravagant less space than it should.
This does not mean Sesuv land, and even some time.
But if nothing has changed, underlies under the euro may give the move.
Milosevic and Hussein: the Trial as a Farce
The trial of war criminals were once serious enterprise.
Recall photographs and called Göringa Herman Hesse, as sit in the dock at Nuremberg.
Some of the Nazi leaders were even after a relatively short, but a fair trial.
Today, the judicial proceedings against "rogue" world leaders turned into a farce.
The trial of Saddam Hussein and his Baathist brings continuous sequence of.
Defendants one second and Hussein has flaunted all possible forms of contempt, except Zadek hard to judge.
Hardly expect results, which will, in the eyes of Iraqis and the world appear legitimate.
The trial of Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, after four years after a statement to mark a boring and depletion of more than 200 million dollars on spending into a funeral.
In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government has almost a decade negotiated to get to trial of surviving Khmer Rouge.
The mass murderers, who came to power in the twentieth century, condemned the fact that they will either killed in the popular rebellion, or being tried for their crimes -- if we die in power.
Who can be proud that the last communist leader Romania Nikolae and his wife were shot and killed without even the appearance of a fair trial?
Formal real dangers court appear always better than quick justice, even if the result was also death.
Now there are two viable way to be dropped against Baghdad.
Its former leader could before the court held the nation itself, as in the 1980's did Argentines general responsible for the disappearance of more than 5,000 people.
At the international level remains for the start of the other hand the Nuremberg trials after model, while for dubious conditions, with the victorious powers sometimes introduce a responsibility for the crimes, such as "crimes against humanity," which were not at the time of their a properly defined.
Were times when we could see the benefits of both national and international judicial processes.
Domestic trials to allow the local community, to close participation to its fire.
As judges and each judge chooses to compatriot defendants demonstrated greater sensitivity to the assessment of the blame, because they were aware of the tough conditions under which dictator as their decisions.
Argentina's process with the generals was successful ritual in painful transition from military junta to democracy, experience but ended lack of free.
Even after the conviction of generals were so powerful that it forced an end to the processes and then mercy from president.
Argentina's policy is the legal consequences of the process of the 20 years ago still involved.
At the international level was the decision of the UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also welcomed with great confidence.
The ICTY, led by as Casseseho made several major decisions.
But then had the judges here -- that they fulfill their greatest dream -- to try to his Justice Arcilumpa Slobodan Milosevic.
It is not clear how the process to deal with Milosevic in the local Serbs.
Much will depend on how that political party would dominate the court.
At the international level there is no fear of too much politics, but from too much rights.
Milosevic's trial to be more than a fair to be Emblémem justice of the UN.
Because Milosevic was allowed to defend itself -- which was given the length and the effectiveness of the court a huge mistake.
It was not even a limited number of witnesses -- that prosecutors to testimony about one and the same gruesome history Serbian aggression and brutality.
Take many months before it is stated what went wrong and why the process had scandal four years.
My suspect is such that judicial officials with good intentions too affect South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a model of on the law faculty as desirable alternative to a justice.
In the South African negotiations was the most important question of the future of the defendants, but the victims.
All the victims were conducted to tell their story and defendants listened.
In the case of massacres in the twentieth century would such story story may take decades.
Encouraged victims to speak, and then gives defendants the right to obstruct negotiations of merit in a position of the political leader is a recipe for an indefinite delay.
One lesson that we, of processes with Milosevic and Hussein took is that is not well built man or woman to trial because to do away with their charismatic appeal.
Defendants process bent -- especially if the possibility of defending itself -- and courtroom used to justifying their careers.
Tyrants should be tried only when they are clearly beaten.
It is ironic that the advantages of the Nuremberg tribunal is their fill the representative of the victorious powers.
Those were Göringovi, Hess and their constant reminder that control have in the hands of the allies and that the Nazis were yet beaten.
A clear goal process will always be the culprit, not the way they will write history.
The tragedy of Milosevic and Husajnova process is that the details of history has yet to settle down and on trial the state history.
The hesitation of responsible persons to the creation of the procedures -- both international and national -- that stokes a strip of guilt and return.
In the case of Hussein, this imagination can still has not materialized.
Economic Division of Iraq
Anyone who look at Iraq, they will see state divided communities on the Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds.
As the fundamental partition, that to the ongoing insurgency contributed as much as sectarian tit and resistance to the US-led military occupation, but it is the growing divide between rich and poor Iraqis.
After the liberation of Iraq began to most people, especially those of the poor, hoping for a charismatic leader who would be saved from the bitter reality of everyday life.
These people were bred in fear, and should not because of how to apply their society democracy or how could they groups to protect human rights and civil organisations help shape the future.
Iraq and will soon face a new social division.
On the one hand, with people who understand how work in a democracy, to gain power and to implement their ambitions.
Learned to speak the language of democracy, they have money to influence and ensure that their rights and privileges defended independent organizations.
On the other hand, but remains a huge population helpless Iraqis including the widow and or left women who do not have anyone who would care for them and their children.
For these people democracy and human rights means nothing.
They are informed, the poor and sick.
They have become victims of the education system, which is more than a decade ago collapsed, and are less qualified to the broken Iraqi economy found jobs.
In Saddam's government was not made no effort to increase the vital level of the poor.
I visited Iraq's huge slums and found there families living in homes that have barely homes are riddled with ubiquitous Hmyzem and under the door they be seeping through.
In the day and night live in darkness.
Although need nothing other than food, decent housing and to get jobs, for these families to death and scares the cry of their hungry children.
When I met with women, which in these homes live covered me questions: give US democracy food and houses?
To prevent democracy to men beat their wives?
To give our children citizenship?
Give us the right Rozvést with husband that I leave?
My answer to all these questions was "yes".
Yes, democracy, you can live a decent rights in the House, the rights of learn and work, will give your children citizenship and prosecute you to the status of your men.
But we must work hard and make all possible efforts to require their rights.
Women replied: "Saddam US 35 years taught as unemployed, and not remain silent for.
What now we can do? "
In these poor areas, where a majority of Iraqis, people are becoming prey for bitter temptation.
Many of them live beyond the reach of political and government leaders.
To letting the drive to violence, theft and sabotage.
Poverty drives some of them to accept money for violent acts, Ponoukáni ploy by false heroism, which in Saddam's long rule could not be stopping.
Poverty also trauma of Iraq's violent past war and atrocities, which has made people less sensitive to the killings.
Although the conditions today in Iraq to attract many young men to violence, I believe that it is not enough to provide a decent job and housing, to be saved.
Particularly employment will help young people based new lives through serious work.
Jobs, we must not create artificially only to Zamaskovali army of unemployed people.
We need to give people a work that would allow them to contribute to the reconstruction of the country.
Each individual to by its nature prove to be a useful members of society.
Culture created by Saddam but Iraqis believe that the only way is to get the authority, power and knowledge, are political connections.
To overcome such sentiments will need time and prosperous economy, which means that the new Iraqi government must have limited power, to allow private-sector growth and nourish the general understanding of democracy and human rights.
Religious groups are prepared to help this process.
We can also rehabilitated technocrats who served under Saddam, so that they get the chance to serve their country.
And last but not least, we must provide loans for poor families to help them establish life.
Above all is, however, the government must, of all forces tried to convince poor Iraqis about the value of democracy and freedom and about how to implement their desire for better life important constitution.
In a country where many people, violations of law in a speech heroism, this will produce easily.
We are Iraqis but also learned that power should not be concentrated in few hands and that the establishment of justice requires fighting all forms of corruption.
If the constitution work as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, the poor Iraqis must learn to take this fight for their.
Islámistická Identity
Anywhere now see, is Islam used (and) not used as a political force.
Some Muslims use him as a call to action; many people in the west (elsewhere) him, seen as "something else" and asking for its restrictions and refusal.
We as the Turks can directly to both sides of this debate.
The reason why the Islam in Western eyes, look like religion "other" is the fact that the West is now witnessing a systematic Deinstitucionalizace religion.
The West of modern life, of course, will not in religion, but rather claims that can religious institutions to put the lives of the individual.
Religion in the modern world is much more than at any time and personal spiritual experience.
The process of Deinstitucionalizace religious experience, but also taking place within the framework of Islam.
The politicization of Islam is weakening the authority of the Islamic religious classes, the so-called Ulema.
As in the Western, Islamic religious experience is personal.
One of the results is the interpretation of religious texts and the Muslims, including political radicals, intellectuals and women.
The second is the Vulgarizace religious knowledge, abuse of teaching the Koran and particular a passage in the context to promote political aims.
Who now to determine what is legitimate in Islam, and what illegal?
Who has the authority considered religious texts?
Who can go "Fatvu" or declared a "Jihad"?
Activism and terrorism now provide -- or rather the on-the new source of legitimacy.
About what Islam means and does not mean, so they Laik without authority of religious schools and specialized training.
Islam is now considered largely political officials and cultural movement, not religious institutions.
This Deinstitucionalizace to Islam ceased to be only local and national social Pojivem and began to participate in shaping imaginary bonds among all the Muslims, who are everywhere feel oppressed or expelled.
Islámismus now can unite followers, among which previously there were deep divisions: the spiritual Sufie and supporters of sharia, Shiites and Sunnis, a conservative Saudi Arabia and the revolutionary Iran.
At the same time, is the Islam on the move, because his religious believers are removed in rural areas and goes to the cities, including the cities in the West.
Many people consider the movement for something wrong and highlight the fact that the Muslims are socially eradicate, leading to estrangement and in some cases, to terrorism.
Social mobility but is also a precondition for creating a modern worldview.
Muslims through migration, of course, are experiencing some sense of the, if not separate from its social origin.
Their religious experience and gaining new character, deprived of theological, social or state institutions.
Becomes a form of social imagination, in which the push to build a sense of belonging to Muslims to Islam in the new foreign and environment.
A return to the religious identity is not, therefore, encourage isolation from modern life, but its proximity.
Most of radicalism emerges within the groups that the experience of mobility and move into a new environment witnessed the secular political thinking and urban life of the West.
In the environment, move, and their anchor are becoming Islam.
But for this anchor work must be Islam in the face of modernity freed from their traditionally humbled, passive and obey positions.
Wearing veils of or Plnovousu, pushing the right to Modlitebny in employment or in schools and special food with Muslims on identified as Muslims.
Telling everyone around them, that are in their religious gushing and than those who its religiosity limit to private life.
Non-Muslims, for example, found in the wearing of the act of humiliation and Muslim women.
For the Muslims but in this former stigma has become a positive confirmation of the Islamic identity.
This transformation perfectly illustrates the young Muslims.
Girls, who in the French and German schools wear the headscarf have in many ways (notably in culture, youth of fashion or language) closer to its than to its educated mothers.
Wearing headscarves in European public sphere of these girls inadvertently changing symbol and the role of Muslim women.
This tendency but runs deeper than the headscarf.
All Western Muslims today feel double identification, double the cultural capital.
Define themselves through their religiosity, but it is a universal, secular knowledge.
And because they have double cultural capital, they may move relatively freely between the various activities and environment-home, schools, youth alliances or urban centers for leisure time.
To be a Muslim and Islámistou is not the same.
Currently we see a shift away from the Muslim identity to identity Islámistické.
Religious US with individual Muslims move from the private sphere into the public sphere.
For all the question remains whether this search for identity can satisfy the headscarf and by adopting religious practice wide public support, or whether the positive confirmation of Islam requires fundamental surrender of modernity.
The new era for Islamic science?
When natural science and mathematics period enjoyed great inventions, one area of the world over all others.
All this discipline here were worshipped, medicine were making rapid development and the average citizen preoccupied with how nature works.
No wonder that this region reap around the world respect.
In the second half has Poznané planet so far, scientists were punished, or even killed.
The mathematics was based outside the law, the godless and Cizorodá discipline and later served religious purposes.
The standard of living was low.
The booming region was Islamic Middle East, while Europe remained ignorant of the poor.
Both the religiously - (historians in this context in view of the role and nature of religion), but science flourished only in one of them.
Today, the role of the Middle East and West reversed.
After World War II, disputed the tip of the field of science to become the United States.
During this period of leave bright students from their countries, because it is to attract better research universities and opportunities.
Until recently, account for more than half graduate students mathematics, natural sciences and engineering in the US people born overseas.
Many of these talent after the completion of study in the United States will remain, of which benefit industry and public administration.
Islamic culture, meanwhile, joined the historic phase in which it asked equation between science and Western influence, and society, thus science avoid.
Even in countries where the oil revenues could support the huge volume of research, Arab rulers similar to stimulate investment, as a result of which their societies thrive as May.
The desire for greater political recognition in recent times encourages Islamic states to invest in technology, which is visibly reflected in the nuclear ambitions Pakistan and Iran.
Nuclear weapons may have a certain political weight, but their scientific basis for it uninspiring and old.
Major is recognition that more of Kultivace institutional ideas than products from the earlier findings.
Imagine what influence would receive the Pakistani Institute, which would be set to head the world's cancer research.
And, if the political rhetoric of some kind of shift if scientists discover key to curbing AIDS?
This is one unused opportunities.
But there is another, not only for the Islamic society.
The US has in recent times there were so deep mistakes.
At the level of the government from the president further down, replaced science "issues of faith."
Political operatives changing reports, top scientists, if the facts get into conflict with the official religion.
Also, encourage religious schools affected by the administration move at the heart of its activities from science to "values".
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 are entry visas ups and difficult, when, which weakens the flow of young talent to US universities.
Major Scientific Organization against this protest no avail.
At the same time were tax laws amended so that investors were becoming richer in the short run, which is discouraged from long-term investment in research.
On the war in Iraq was spent half a trillion dollars, which is the amount that is roughly equal to the support of the basic research in the last thousand years.
Even if the US to avoid a fundamentalist years, in any case, they risk losing the global domination in the field of research.
Japan to understand the connection between political influence and science in the 1980's last century.
The main Japanese industrialists and chairman of the board of Sony Akio Morita society then, together with right-wing politician put forward a series of speeches, which in 1986 published in book entitled Japan that can say no.
Outlined the basic features of the national strategy that recognized that global influence stems from a leading role in the fields of science.
The key idea had been that military force can became obsolete, "if the food chain" of military technology to other states.
A book is a reference to Japan's plan "say no" America's military influence, once Japan gained control of key military technology.
Knowledge economy is clearly a also using the oil wealth.
For example, Texas was once as most of the southern States economically poor and declining.
And while he was already then oil revenues, the flow of dollars in the economy itself will not so much prosperity, as may seem.
So the Texas decided to invest money from oil production to educational foundation.
Today, the foundation of roughly equal Foundation of Harvard University and includes 15 universities.
The result is astonishing: the manufacture of aircraft almost disappeared from California, but in Texas is experiencing boom.
Also research centers of the telecom companies and the consortium, has moved to Texas, which is even the Canadian telecom giant Nortel.
And although industrial production in the US is in crisis, Texas is one of the strongest productive economy in the world.
There is no reason why should the outcome of the same to achieve in the Middle East.
First, however, the Islamic world must redefine its proud heritage and maintained to him.
Iran's Debate over Iraq
None of the countries of the Middle East Watch post-war developments in Iraq closely than Iran.
Geographical proximity, sharply perceived bloody history of confrontation with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, religious and emotional ties to the Shia of Iraq and fears from the United States and its political approaches to the region is for that Iran for its western neighbor linked.
Given the ongoing tensions in the relationship with America worries about Iran in particular the ongoing presence of the US as Humny countries as well as America's dominant role in shaping the future in post-Saddam Iraq --.
For foreigners may be difficult to monitor the debate. But this exist and are living, although from a broader international public are not always seen.
In developing a discussion about post-Saddam Iraq -- can be discerned three general approaches.
Iran's pragmatists claims that Iran's cooperation with the US in post-Saddam Iraq -- is inevitable, even if only to ensure the rights of Iraq's Shiite population.
For this reason should Iran obtain assurance that the new leadership of Iraq are hostile to it, and will seek friendly bilateral relations.
Another fundamental considerations pragmatists include maintaining territorial integrity of Iraq and repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.
The moderates win of this type thinks that an Iranian government should press for America because the members of the Organization chalk sitting in Iraq and due to its full removal.
The Iranian government should in turn offered support for bringing peace, stability and security in Iraq.
In short, pragmatists would Iran-Iraq negotiations to narrow the focus is on the agenda, which largely reflects Iran's domestic concerns.
In summary, a conservative forces in Iran supports this approach.
The vision of other approach is active role and active cooperation of Iran in the reconstruction of Iraq.
Advocates of this position argue that Iran is because of their well-functioning network of personal and institutional ties to Iraq in a advantageous position from which can facilitate the reconstruction.
They say that the US and the international community will appreciate the value of Iran's cooperation.
The gratitude for Iranian cooperation should be the removal of infrastructure chalk in Iraq, possibly in connection with Iran's commitment to act against the al Qaeda and expel its members from Iran.
It is important to Iran from the US demanded assurances that their cooperation will reciprocate US guarantee that Iran in the future will happen to US military action.
Advocates of cooperation in short, the call for open and clear: Iran's agreement to help with maintaining stability during the transition in Iraq and commitment to maintain relations in a spirit of cooperation with any permanent government, which in Iraq will, for improved regional and international position of Iran.
This view is widely held between Iranian reformers -- both in government, and outside -- and between dissident technocratic and business class.
Finally, for the Iranian radicals is the possibility of relations based on cooperation with the US of pure fantasy.
They are convinced that America is only to could undermine the security of Iran and betray their national interests.
According to view the radicals, the US will at least try to dictate a fundamental change in Iran's foreign policy.
If the worst, says the radicals, America will actively promote change in Iran's regime.
It will actively campaign against to Iran to use nuclear fuel and gained the atomic energy, and might even try to weaken Iran's military capabilities at all.
These radicals see US invasion of Iraq as a reflection of the desire of the US Iran.
In response to this are convinced that Iran must to defend our interests, create a strategic alliance with Russia and other regional powers and use of Iran's influence in Iraq to avoid in Baghdad to prevent the creation of a pro-American, anti-Iranian government.
This approach supports the supporters of the hard-line from all factions.
The overthrow of Saddam's regime was the easy part of the Iraq crisis.
Now comes the more difficult part: establishment of peace and security, victory in the war against terrorism and the guidelines of Muslim people that America does not occupy Iraq, its oil and transformed the Middle East to its image.
Meanwhile, the most likely will not escalate the resistance against the US expressed by suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism.
Iran is destined to play the role of a regional player, for his political dynamism and Muslim identity widely rings with the Muslim world.
What happens in Iraq will have a significant impact on Iran and the United States cannot be than recommended to find a way to understand this fact.
The American threats or talk of another war in Iran fuel to the fire of resentment and frustration and supplied the strength of the radical forces.
If it is in the interest of the US to avoid such consequences must consider how to limit the influence of their own radicals, and recognize that American interests in Iraq will benefit more greater cooperation with Iran.
Way out of Iraq
In Iraq was finally reached the stage in which, all apparently want the same thing: the departure of coalition forces from the country.
The recent disclosure of an internal document of the British Department of Defense for the withdrawal of troops this desire only.
The only question is how to satisfy.
If the coalition forces remain in Iraq, violence is likely to Eskalovat.
If, however, will leave, violence Eskalovat also only faster.
Because the real question is how to move to phase in which will have Iraq police forces and the army, which will be possible to believe that in the country to maintain law and order.
This is a need for offending long way.
Notwithstanding the many Iraqis who enter the army or the police would have surprised anyone, that to do so, some are not entirely clean motives.
In northern Iraq, old accounts, and in traditionally most ethnically diverse areas such as, there is a de facto ethnic segregation.
In other areas, forcibly introduced Islamic law Sharia.
So how can Iraq create credible Uniformované components that will enforce the law effectively, fair and regardless of ethnicity, religion and sex?
The answer is to recruit, train and "right values."
In such a thing but it is not enough time.
We need to find other ways.
Given the lack of deep-rooted value system needs Iraq active civil society organizations that are called the police and military accountable.
These organizations can have many different forms, but it is important to their activities really engage citizens at a local level and to get the support of the county, regional and national power structures, whenever revealed the abuse of power.
If there is no control on the local level and support and recognition of the value of the controls at national level, then, most of forces likely to behave appropriately -- and in the other case, can be easily identified and punished.
Perhaps that appears overly optimistic, but in Afghanistan -- the country in many ways near Iraq -- there are groups that work on this goal.
A model example of how this can be achieved, a cooperation for peace and unity (Cpau).
In Afghanistan as well as in Iraq is top priority of ordinary people on the violence.
Cpau in the past three years, throughout the country and based in the peace committees at the county level, which are in individual villages support satellite peace council.
The initiative is in culture, where violence is so deeply rooted here that the children once taught arithmetic so that the dead included Soviet soldiers.
The Commission therefore seeks to unite all sectors of society -- including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, policemen, soldiers, judges and businessmen -- and find ways to solve conflicts non-violent way.
Although monitoring until a formal part of the role of such committees (in the future, however, to plan), the very fact that it represented the police, army and judicial corps is brings into contact with the rest of the society provides feedback and begins to build mutual confidence.
Some of the results are remarkable.
One of the workshop visited of civility local military commanders to two hours and eventually, the delay for weeks.
In conclusion, excused for its violent past and vowed to disarm its private army.
Now regularly attends offices committee.
In Iraq are projects as humanitarian centre in Kirkuk to monitoring function by offering the ethnically diverse population opportunity tell their difficulties and use aid in their resolution.
Too often, but there is a fact that even when it is a judicial decisions, as a result of intimidation, rigorously.
Many good work already in strengthening civil society do US and British troops.
Heard about workshop for the better the status of women and of the successful organizing small local elections throughout the country.
The mobilization of civil society but is extremely difficult task, especially when it is to it as in the case of Iraq needed to move quickly and in a wide scale.
Military force is still necessary, but neither are necessary and the implications for disarmament, including the economic opportunities that are more productive than crime and blackmail.
Fortunately, is building a functioning civil society not only important, but also the cheap.
Humanitarian centers are in the Kirkuk in annual cost just 75 5,000 dollars.
For 10 million dollars could be the number of these centers Zestonásobit -- and was still a lot of money left.
The task is committed to such access, expand the circle of the jurisdiction of and support to Nadoraz brave people who took on its commitment to lead the power to responsibility.
Otherwise, it is unlikely to receive Iraqis security that after many years suffering so badly need.
Democracy in the Nile Valley?
Surprising decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's proposed constitutional change that would allow direct and competitive presidential elections, could become a huge step toward democracy in Egypt and in the Arab world.
For Westerners, for whom it is obvious pluralistic democracy may be difficult to understand how a potentially great shift is in the country Uvyklé for more than 50 years on the military government.
Under the current system of Egyptian citizens can come only once in six years in the day of the presidential referendum and say their yes or no one has followed the presidential candidate.
This explains why someone like Mubarak regularly receive over 90% of the vote, while at the low turnout.
The Syrian and Iraqi caudillo, with this system done even better, and no doubt because the demand to Vespodu every ballot papers was the name and address voting.
Many observers have long argued that democratization in the Middle East, and not as long as the process to fully involve Egypt.
Egypt have for a true path of democratisation, without first change its constitution -- should be reduced Faraonské powers of the president and to restrict its tenure of office.
Indeed, Mubarak is president for 24 years.
A statement that he wanted the presidential elections so it is an important first step.
The regime may believe that can process to their advantage, but what is so easy to control, when people feel their power.
Democratic genie has been let out of the bottle.
In any case Egypt is not the only country in this troubled region, which is on a path of democracy.
Already successfully advancing from one side of the Middle East Turkey and Morocco in the second.
This time, however, it seems that real initiative comes from a close and positive results of the recent elections in Iraq, Palestine and a smaller rate also in Saudi Arabia.
The unprecedented demonstrations against Syrian occupation of Lebanon following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq and appears to.
Egyptian opposition groups also in the last few weeks staged increasingly bold marches and other forms of civil disobedience.
Catalyst for their outrage at the end of January, the state's arrest and imprisonment of Churavého opposition leader Ajmána Núra.
Hard over the government revived domestic "Kifaya Movement" (enough), which demands the end of Mubarak's regime.
Suddenly, it became clear that its is losing a general view that the Egyptians are passive and they fear the act.
On the shores of the Nile Valley against the ingrained tyranny being formed an alliance of local, regional and international forces.
The current wave of popular pressure, it seems, rocked the regime.
A month before Mubarak's demands for constitutional reform rejected as "unnecessary".
But whatever change its position stems from any sequence of events, voter initiative must be welcomed.
It is a necessary -- if insufficient -- step towards the reconstruction of stagnant political system in Egypt.
The Egyptians are already wary of symbolic reforms à la Tunisia, where long-time President and Ben Ali a caricature, a constitutional amendment that seemingly open the door to compete a presidential election, but then pursue fraudulent window with a few selected "adversaries."
In earlier Tunisia's presidential he Ben Ali regularly receive 99% of the vote; now has 96%.
Let us hope that Mubarak are electoral reform seriously.
Is the need to get the sincerity shown to the order of the immediate release Ajmána Núra and to take steps to end the 24-year-old state of that effectively prevents the actions of political campaigns.
Mubarak should also be approved by the limit of two consecutive five-year term president.
Equally important is confidence measures, including an open and equal access to the media, which now controls the state.
I announced his intention to attend the upcoming presidential election to begin debate on these fundamental reforms.
The enjoyment I but was returned to the private lives a simple citizen, once this autumn, to ensure free and open elections.
If these steps implemented properly, will Mubarak's legacy.
Together with the developments in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine could become the first Arab beam the dawn of freedom, has long overdue.
The historic elections in Egypt?
The seventh 11, the Egyptians go to the polls to elect new president. It will of the ten candidates, among whom there or the incumbent President Hosni Mubarak, that this function held for 24 years.
And although there is little doubt that the election result will be his re-election, many people this process intensively monitors.
The elections, prepares the 6000 domestic electoral observers, and this week, to the country hundreds of foreign reporters.
But while the process lacks all formal signs real electoral race, some important elements authenticity here were missing.
Despite promises for all is not far from the same rules.
Mubarak still holds in the hands of the excessive benefits: it has known the name of, an effective monopoly on state controlled the electronic media, and about 85% of the print media.
Weeks before the vote was some opposition candidates for broadcast in the Egyptian TV even one election spot.
All members of the presidential electoral commission appointed Mubarak and the new electoral rules specifically exclude the participation of all independent candidates.
The Supreme Court in 2000 decided that in the election result must keep an eye and is 8 5,000 Egyptian judges.
This was an important step towards fair elections, because the judges' union, during the last half-century of the hijacking of the executive power to maintain a certain independence.
Mubarak's regime must therefore used various tricks to neutralize the judges' union.
One of them was the expansion of the definition of "the judiciary," so as to include even thousands of loyal state employees who have legal education, but zero experience for the papacy. This is the real judges forced a dead end because, in a protest boycott of their duty given to this task and this time which falls under the police's notorious Ministry of Interior.
And so should the judges' union in the past tend to submit to -- with unpredictable results.
In the parliamentary elections in 2000 received Mubarak's ruling party in districts where the elections a real judges, approximately 38% of the vote, but in the districts under the supervision of this% a mystery on 86%.
This year, the promise of profound change.
In the spring have held the judges of the National Assembly and Usnesli that, unless they regime to acknowledge the full independence and exclusive control over the voting process is at the forthcoming presidential (parliamentary) election or electoral oversight.
Second, then he broke with the ultimate demands: to monitor the voting process groups from the civil society, to put an end to interventions in the definition of the judges for the elections and agreed to be in all the ballot box the present legitimate judges, as long as, verified and; its content.
So far the most likely looks to stalemate, as chairman of the presidential election commissions in the Egyptian television publicly declared that rejects any monitoring of the electoral process citizens.
Another interesting developments on the eve of elections, including the public debate, whether they have the voters in the presidential election, or is boycotted the vote.
Several opposition parties called on its members to take part in elections in protest against the electoral rules, which strongly fancied Mubarak.
By contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood, which is considered the largest opposition groups in Egypt, urged their supporters to cast ballots in the box and voted on their conscience, but to support any "despotic, corrupt rulers."
It is obvious, even an implicit rejection of Mubarak, the only ruler in the country over the past 24 years.
Despite repeated government preparing reservations about 34 groups from the civil society thousands of young Egyptians to monitor elections.
These groups argue that if the regime has no plan manipulated elections, the domestic or foreign monitoring voting process should not pose a problem.
The response of the regime is a statement that any external monitoring is intervention in Egypt's sovereignty and that domestic observers insulted the integrity of the judges.
This argument has been undermined, but soon when the judges' union announced that observers from the civil society supports.
Whatever is Mubarak's regime of fear because of growing pressure from within and outside, to hold free and fair elections, or is simply unable to get rid of party fraud as a way of life, the current indications portend a voting no good.
The Egyptians so far for the first time experienced exciting feeling of resistance against the tyranny and, newly acquired space of freedom.
Dollar Complex of Europe
Currency become the focal point not only trade transactions, but also a diplomatic and political tit.
Whenever that happens, the business transactions are more complicated and surrounds is greater uncertainty.
The politicization of money during the interwar depression was economically devastating.
But there are much more cases currency war.
In the 1960's, the focus of political tug-of-war has become the international monetary system.
Each side had another theory and otherwise, explain the events.
Europeans -- particularly the French-complained on what General Charles de Gaulle, called a "Nehorázné privileges" US dollar.
General and his monetary guru Jacques Rueff argued that the US-dollar reserve currency status as the main architects of the Bretton Woods regime fixed exchange rate to help deficits resulting from its foreign military adventure (this time in Vietnam).
France to respond to challenges of monetary reform that would end with that strange the role of the dollar, and sought to revive the deeply discredited the gold standard.
Europeans began a long discussion about the benefits of monetary union, whose achieving them should look to the dollar in the face.
From the US, but the international role of the dollar was traps.
Other countries could change their exchange rates and this is more to maintain export competitiveness.
The US government was powerless undervalued against the yen, which maintained the belief that the rest of the world use the dollar to attack on US manufacturing base.
The Nixon administration concluded that the only way to help the American economy, is practiced by monetary unilateralism -- monetary expansion so dramatic to other countries to force a revision of the exchange rate.
These long forgotten battle is suddenly seemed to be back within reach.
The world has a fixed exchange rate regime, but the dollar remains the main reserve currency; this is a floating Bretton Woods system.
According to the Americans a reserve role of the dollar potential threats, while for it is another example of the American imperial struggle for hegemony.
China in this decade took the role of Japan 6 years and hold their exchange rate at low levels, to promote export growth.
Became the object of complaints because the US on unfair competition and efforts to implement such a revision of the exchange rate, which would discourage Americans from buying Chinese toys, and clothing.
Producers in the US decide that Podprsenky Chinese production represents a threat to the American way of life.
Europeans (particularly the French) they complain of big US deficits and fashionable again brought de argument that the world are financing the American war.
Some Europeans propose to Asian central banks, the greater part of its reserves in the euro; this is a backlash Generálova failed attempt diminish America but by selling dollars for gold.
1960s ended crash "system" and large financial turbulence, aided by sharp inflation growth commodity prices.
To the detriment of their all and the American role in world affairs will be undermined.
A similar collapse will now likely to have different consequences.
Today's system of floating rate is fixed and the cost of its intervention are differently non-decomposed.
Most Americans by a collapse of the dollar significantly will suffer because foreign salesmen are forced to adjust their prices for the US market.
Asian economies grow vigorously and their central banks gradually are widening claims in the US.
In this policy likely to persist, for the alternative would be a sudden fall in the competitiveness of their export sectors on the American market.
This gives us more time to address trade deficit, which is long-term sustainable.
Economically dynamic regions of the world -- North America and Asia -- brings together some of the pact, which provide for the continuing role of the US dollar.
Americans will continue to increase its debt, for this for them it reminds Asians want.
The lifting of the pact would be against the interests of both parties concerned.
They are not American unilateralism, because it is a cooperation with Asia.
But the Europeans, who are excluded from the pact, in the monetary and economic unilateralism on.
The euro's rise against the dollar is also on the watch Trn European manufacturers.
But Europe cannot do much for their relief.
Indeed, in the new currency of Europe will be the losers.
The solution, which was lauded in the 1960s -- the revival of the gold standard or creating a common European currency -- already appear to be very useful.
The single currency has proved measures that it does not provide greater protection.
The old form of European responses -- who would psychologists could be called the "complex" dollar-yen gains on the urgency.
There are calls to the European Central Bank to expand its currency basis, as if imitation of the dollar was the answer to all the industrial, structural and demographic problems Europe.
But a moment's reflection, we should remember is that Europe's problems cannot be removed currency manipulation.
Protests against a new form of Nehorázného the privileges of the US we should see: it is a way of compensating the real European helplessness.
Dollar complex so thin, and even will widen, because international value dollar notes will fall without this made visible negative effects on those who are printing and use.
The Epidemic Policy
The Americans, as well as citizens of other countries around the world, for they are used to that, in the selection of some public officials play important role of policy.
Few surprised (though it is perhaps some disappointed) is to the federal judicial office or at the top diplomatic post appointed candidates who passed a test of loyalty to certain principles, which is vital for the Premiérovu or party.
But science is different, everyone agrees-and here the United States are stands out as a warning example to the outside world.
The appointment to the scientific positions should be based on the objective criteria of education, skills and achievements.
Is of course a legitimate question the future minister of health and social services to his views about abortion.
But it is completely improper when tests are political loyalty bend candidates into scientific advisory committees.
Similarly, membership in bodies undertaking peer assessing (peer review) scientific proposals -- it is a process of fundamental importance to scientific progress -- would be should not reduce barriers, which is linked to the technical expertise.
Scientists in the US on such obstacles, we face increasingly.
The journal Science on the issue last autumn published several contributions.
One concerned an exchange of members of the Consultative Committee of the National Centre for sanitation, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), without who is director of the centers to consult.
Similar cases in the framework of the CDC also touched Consultative Committee for lead poisoning and its prevention, consultative committee for national defense of human resources in research and advisory committee for genetic testing.
The current epidemic of ideology, during which close advisory committees and then re-mounted with new members and when the candidates are subjecting the test of loyalty, with some observers seems like the old well-known songs.
Officials of the ministry of health and social services it called "all the usual practice."
In America this is not the usual practice is not -- or at least were.
Worrying news in any case, it is not that the Bush administration is exploring relations candidates to its "values".
Most fearsome is how deep this ideological lustration process runs. affects, areas that against this kind of manipulation were immune.
Perhaps the most impressive case stem political members of the infection was a version of the research division of the National Institute of security and protection of health at work, which identify grants in the area of study hurt in the workplace.
The consultative committees, perhaps in the past to occasional allied souls were vulnerable.
Ultimately it is they who they are policies that the politicians want to, or want to take up.
But the research division?
In October 2002, the journal Science published an editorials David Michaelse groups and his colleagues.
Some of them were former senior civil servants, who in several of these committees, and bring to this issue alone valuable view based on personal experience.
Their contribution was in itself, but the discovery of what followed was even more interesting.
Sparked a flood of letters in which the scientists to with similar experiences.
The proposed list to the Coordinating Committee for Research muscle Dystrofie National Institutes of Health told that it was re-examined by the White House.
First was interviewed on their different views about the Bush administration's policy, none of whom there were the work committee, and then to ask whether it is a follower of the president's stance on embryonic stem cells.
Other writers had seen, a prominent professor of psychiatry and psychology, a testimony to the fact that, from the White House Telefonovali over his nomination in the National Council for the illegal drug use.
Speaker argued that it is compulsory to detail, "to determine whether hold some views that the president could be difficult."
According to words followed a number of questions, with officials of the White House to scores.
One example: "So this is two to three; the president is against needle exchanges for intravenous drug users [] for moral reasons, regardless of the consequences."
Talks with in even a chilling scene.
Officials of the candidates were asked whether Bush's choice, and when they learned that not, asked: "Why you are President support?"
This is the nature of the dictatorship, not democracy.
The point of the scientific advisory committees, is on a balanced and well-thought-out of the Council to involve the formation of policy.
If a a political outcome, profits is zero -- and huge losses.
The decisions that the research projects will get support, it is therefore never be a matter of policy, but peer assessing.
After all, the law, which the attending, the federal law on advisory boards, explicitly requires that the committee is a balanced and to "were not adequately influence organ."
US Secretary of Health and Social Services Tommy Thompson and personal separation of the White House should be an example.
This could prove very easily: observance of the law.
The Murder in Moscow
It is time to end illusory idea that the "dictatorship of law" Vladimir Putin if only advance declined lawlessness in the post-communist Russia.
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of the brave and the best journalist Russia, women, which had the courage to reveal the brutal murder by Russian troops in Chechnya, is the ultimate proof that President Putin will bring nothing more than Tuctovou dictatorship with the usual contempt law.
This recognition comes for the world and especially for Europe in the appropriate time.
German foreign ministry denies policy US-Russian relations, which indifference to Putin's legitimacy because it is supposedly in the national interest strong member of the European Union.
Indifference but's intransigence by Putin to maintain their illegal methods to promote and on the international scene, as evidenced by its current efforts at economic stifling of Georgia.
The murder of Politkovskaya has sense of déjà vu: in Putin's Russia, as well as for the golden days of the KGB, simply out of the people.
The murder of journalist is the third politically tinted murder in the past three weeks ago.
The 1930's, was in the Irkutsk shoot Enver, chief engineer of Russia's isolated BP.
And 14 September was assassinated Andrei Kozlova, Viceguvernéra Russian central bank, who fought against financial fraud.
The fact that the investigations into the murder of Politkovskaya, as well as in the case of assassination Kozlova took Russia's Prosecutor General Yuri, does not inspire hope, what is shaping as senior jobs in a true democracy inspire.
Engagement top Russian government is on the contrary, almost guarantee that the murderer is never Vypátráni.
The murder of Politkovskaya is an extremely grim marks, taking into account that the woman was a strong Russian president.
In their articles for one of the few remaining independent Moscow newspaper Novaja Gazeta, as well as in his books "Putin's Russia: life in declining democracy" and "Dirty War: Russia's Reportérka in Chechnya," wrote Politkovská about vanishing freedoms that are the hallmark of Putin's presidency.
As demonstrated by exile former media tycoon Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky and the holding of oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, on Putin's three possible fates: enemies ahead, prison or the grave.
Accuse Putin's government, that the murder of Politkovskaya order.
As a committed an investigative journalist after all, but Putin also alienated many more people, not least the and the current Chechen Prime Minister Ramzana Kadyrova whose accused of abduction policy motivated desire for.
But even if associates of Vladimir Putin had a shot in his home in the center of Politkovskaya Moscow nothing to do, his contempt for the law in any case have created an atmosphere in which this murder was committed.
As well as the assassination of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in Canterburské Katedrále before many of the century, and this crime had been clear in the belief that King please.
Given what Politkovská -- the responsibility of the democratic press questioning the Kremlin and his policies -- should the government to ensure that it's nothing bad happened.
In Putin's Russia was in the past six years which killed 12 leading journalists.
None of these crimes are solved, which would be done, if it was Putin's "dictatorship of law" something more than a PR strategy.
A six-year period since the arrival of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin was recently strongly, signs.
On the one hand, sees the world of young and well-educated leader, who has vowed to Russia -- particularly by adapted to their forces and judicial practice international norms.
On the other hand President silently watch as his former colleagues from the Russian security services FSB (ex-KGB) provide later murdered people any kind of security and the unleashing of the notorious spy affair against journalists, scientists and environmental activists.
Among these "" include journalist Pasko, Gregorij weapons expert Igor, physicist Valentin Danilov, the diplomat Valentin Mojsejev and others.
It seems that Putin's Kremlin clique missed the alleged influence stemming from the partnership with the West -- such as in the form of even the holding of the G-8 in St. Petersburg.
Confrontation with Western values, and this time just another village; Russia to maintain the facade observance of the law and democratic institutions, but for these to rule still severely arbitrary Surovci.
The danger in the world, is currently the exports of Putin's legitimacy.
Around the "near abroad" Russia's growing roots a form of Kriminalizované diplomacy.
Just look at Putin's effort twisted by the previous presidential elections in Ukraine and to constantly and again Stahovaná criminal charges brought by opposition to a leader of Bosnia Juliji Tymoshenko.
Just look at the regions in Moldávii and in Georgia, that there are only with the support of the Kremlin.
And just to see how the Kremlin to with its neighbors that threaten their supplies of energy.
Everyone knows that when the police criminal behavior have gone unheeded, criminals are increasingly bold.
It is high time in the world to see Vladimir Putin, who they really are: the man drives back into the shadow of Russia.
The world, therefore must now consider the old Latin saying qui Tacet Consentere Videtur -- silence means approval-and to ask the question of whether it is wise quietly approve of Putin's building illegal energy superpower.
Russia's Pipeline to Empire
Gerhard Schroeder, who was even before the month German Chancellor, kowtow to that will become chairman of society that building a pipeline from Russia through the Baltic Sea to Germany and also to western Europe.
In many countries today, Schroeder was charged with illegal conflict of interest.
The obvious moral failings are compounded by the fact that it is now Russia threatened to cut off Ukraine's gas supplies, if Ukraine surrender to the price to the requirements of the Kremlin state gas Behemota Gazprom.
Russia's strategic intention is clear: Ukraine's gas supplies also means most of the European gas, because some of the greatest European gas pipeline goes through Ukraine.
By the new pipeline around Ukraine, Poland and, of course, the Baltic countries, to the Kremlin more power in an attempt to once again, regionally through.
President Vladimir Putin and his administration made up of a clone of the former KGB, has must fail to western Europe in determining how strongly squeeze postcommunist neighbors Russia.
Europe should Putin really arm the New Imperial weapons?
What is worse, could Russia this weapons turn against the EU, which is dependent on energy?
The fact that the company, which Russia could provide the means to manipulate the EU economy, will lead the former German chancellor is a testament dangerous satisfied indifference of Europe in the face of Putin's neo-imperial ambitions.
The Russian media are clearly aware of Europe's growing dependence on Russian energy.
And revel in it: to integrate and strengthen our mutual trade with gas, wrote the authors of the Russian, Europe will keep silent about human rights.
Putin expressed this position takes place in his determination to pursue what it calls the "independent policy."
This means that Russia is to be "independent" on moral and human rights issues of Western democracies.
Perhaps are some European leaders really believe that to maintain the comfortable prosperity Union justifies that on the issue of human rights and other issues that the Kremlin, to force the silence.
Of course, speak may up, albeit short of the "business" causes such as expropriation of Yukos, but once the Kremlin cost-responds to our values or to criticism of Russian crimes -- such as blood Zbroceném Chechnya -- Europeans are apparently willing to Sklapnout rather than to face the possibility of higher energy prices, or even blockades, like that, before which now faces the Ukraine.
Given how Putin his entourage to its will to the Duma, the EU should forget about its hopes for an "really" European Russia.
Russia, which Putin is building, mutated from post-Soviet hope for freedom in the oil and gas a bulwark for his new Vzornou elite members of the former KGB.
Indeed, Matthias Warnig, the director general of the consortium pipeline, which will be chaired by Schroeder, is Putin's long-time friend.
The newspaper the Wall Street Journal this year's report that the Warnig, who is leading the Russian branch of Dresdner Bank, was commander of the East German secret police Stasi, and that in the late 1980s met with Putin when he was the current president of Russia in East Germany had used as a KGB spy.
The fact that Russians condone government of former members of the KGB, for which is Nemilosrdnost and enmity against the opposition's standard, reflects their fatigue, the turmoil of the past 20 years.
Now it seems that the Kremlin believe that what is good for ordinary Russians, is also good for an independent state: When Russia given the tools to intimidation, and threatening the prospect of energy blockade will be in the small and weak countries used without.
As a former head of state a newly-independent Lithuania I was repeatedly forced to endure such threats.
The EU with Russia has signed many agreements, including the treaty "joint space" for freedom and justice.
The Kremlin very good at such Idealismus faked.
Its domination over eastern Europe is always impose on the basis of the "Convention of friendship" and Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 were "fraternal" mission.
Just look how Putin this "common" space efforts, but the goes Barbarsky, businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky is imprisoned, foreign non-governmental organizations pursue and one of a leader of Bosnia last year's Orange Revolution, Juliji Tymoshenko, impeach Russian military prosecutors of manufactured crimes.
If Europeans the common space for human rights and freedom seriously, it must recognize that self-serving the Kremlin's Dosazenci share these values.
The same goes for looking to Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.
They can be really imagine that just "red terror" with numerous crimes of the Soviet era, blood from Lithuania to the Caucasus, will provide a reliable aid in order to prevent Iran and North Korea in endangering world?
As seems likely that the calm of the Kremlin only every crisis use as an opportunity to strengthen its destructive power and influence.
The area of Europe, from which the coming decades, was issued at the mercy of evil.
So we just so quietly sit back and watch as Europe blindly to the new appeasement.
We, the new democracies of eastern Europe, we move from its heritage to learn that behind every diplomatic actions Russia lie imperial ambitions.
West Europeans, who were the legacy of our warnings, should pay attention.
Dependence on Russia -- although her today, is reportedly "charismatic" Gerhard Schroeder -- will only abyss.
Iraq's Bullet and Elections
When in 2003, the war in Iraq began, the Bush administration had a very ambitious plans, as in the case of Germany and Japan after 1945, the envisaged long and peaceful occupation, during which ensure prosperity increasing oil production, and will build after parts of the democratic structures.
The basis should be liberal, and directly post-modern constitution containing a 25% of parliamentary seats for women.
In today's Iraq is not peace or prosperity.
The constitution, which will vote on October 15, while the Zakotvuje rules, but otherwise is far from liberal.
The key provisions of Article (2), according to which no law shall be in violation of the disputed "rules of Islam," it violates basic principles of parliamentary sovereignty and will defend the legislation to meet international standards.
For example, the sexual Zletilosti girls cannot be set at more than nine years, because he was nine-year Mohammed wife.
This implies that the nine-year girls are Zletilé and in terms of criminal law and can be against them applied the death penalty -- say, for it, that he joins on other religions.
In a wider scale can then Shia this provision used to put above their Ayatollah over the elected parliament, as it is in Iran, because only they are entitled to set the "rules of Islam."
People from outside and a few Iraqi liberals worrying mainly because of the Islamic provisions, but widespread Sunni opposition to the constitution is directed against another article: against exclusion "Saddámistické party" from political life and the government and against federalist provisions that accept autonomy 18 Iraqi provinces, allowing them to integrate the regional governments.
The rules of exclusion is for the elite Sunnis -- including thousands of businessmen, professionals, and even artists -- personal affairs, because only a few exceptions, all members of the Baath party.
In theory can be the constitutional prohibition decision so that it applies only in the future.
In practice, but now the administrative rules operate so that rules out so-called "high-ranking Baathists from any form of" public employment, which affects thousands of people.
Federalist provisions would likely accept the Sunnis, if extended only to the Kurds.
They know that the alternative is not a return to Centralismu, but of the three provinces in Kurdish-majority Dahúk, and -- and the creation of an independent Kurdistan, with its own financial service, army (Merga) and oil production in the vicinity of Kirkuk, where are the second largest sites in Iraq.
For the Shia, Sunnis the same federal structure reject, because it is considered Arab brothers, who in the past always accept Sunni government and it will do so again -- if the government will not have their own.
This would allow them, the new constitution, because the province with the Shiite majority in the south -- where a greater part of the Iraqi oil reserves -- could create its own regional government.
So the disappointed Sunni leaders who are unhappy with the constitution, now in the Middle East-style threatening violence.
Federalism but is not the only reason why Hlasatelé Sunni superiority and Islamists to carry out murderous attacks.
Their opposition to accept the principle is fundamental: the governments of the democratic majority.
Instead, trying to restore the rule of the Sunni minority.
According to the Islamists, as well as all the deserve death.
Also a Shiite leader Sadr Muktada, vehemently opposed to federalism.
Its adherents are mostly illiterate, the poorest and violent Shiites from Baghdad and other slums, whose "militia" being waged in 2004 to fight US troops, although the Americans to protect Shiites from Sunni bombers.
As a young priest who his authority derived from the late father, Ayatollah and also populists -- the state Sadr in opposition to an Iraqi ayatollah, who is abhorrent in their ignorance and.
Sadr, he cannot possibly compete in the issue of religious authorities, and so of resistance ranks and positions, with often reminded that the top Shiite clerics, Ayatollah, are Arabs, but.
In a similar spirit to his followers suggests that, who heads the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), and their "Badrovské" militias were low-paid exile in Iran -- and many of them fought long and bitter war in Iraq on the side of Iran -- as long as the Americans "bring back."
Sadr opposes federalism because Shi'ite regional government would listen to his enemies, Sistani and SCIRI, and in his words would fall to the Iranian influence.
To its position on stressed Sadr sent their men into attack on a militias -- in Baghdad where many, met with success, but encountered in where hate because of the devastation that there last year, inflicted before his men Zmasakrovali Americans.
With the Sadr as bandits was something wrong; simple political arithmetic now shows that he is likely to become a key figure in the, which would decide on the outcome of the October vote on the constitution.
To the constitution rejected and forced the new elections to the constituent assembly, the need of its two-thirds Indian opponents of the majority of at least three provinces.
The Sunnis appears only wins in two provinces, but without their Sadr partisans in Baghdad slums to, together with local Sunnis voted "no," probably it will put weight on the side of the constitution Pan and ensure that its refusal.
As a political bandits Sadr is, of course, willing to be bought.
Last year, he was a reward for the killing.
Now wants recognition as a statesman, money, and at least indirect humiliation Sistani and SCIRI.
It could get a supply and it is possible that by cutting already began.
Some Shia, to which Sadr are words and bullets, but have thousands of armed and believe that the only offer for him should be once again the bullets.
The Fall of the Secret Cop
As it has discovered the Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány, when Nahrávka with its admission that the government lied, off street riots, openness, government, in the new eastern European democracies introduce easily.
Also of the post-communist Romania, like Hungary struggled to increase transparency and fairness in society that once belonged to the closed in the world.
Continuing secretiveness, however, despite our fight to explosion of corruption and abuse of official powers.
But it finally came to the real shift toward openness -- acknowledging the progress and the European Union, when Romania has the green light to join in 2007.
Aside from achieving what the EU now considered a "functioning market economy," occurred and key political and legal change, to which I as Secretary of Justice to keep an eye: from greater transparency and better control the financing of political parties to the far-reaching changes in the judiciary.
Judicial Reform in turn help eradicate corruption.
Charges have been made against former and current cabinet ministers, MPs, judges, state representatives, lawyers, police and customs officers and other public officials, as well as director of private firms.
Moreover, have been implemented new standard Tiskopisy for disclosure of property and financial conditions for all of the interests of people, held by the official function in government, parliament, public and the local administration and judiciary.
The new property returns are detailed in Europe and, which is even more important, moreover, are released.
Romania's progress and proves the report released by early October, according to which is now approach the citizens of eastern European countries to the government's information on the same level as in established democracies.
The report, transparency and silence that initiative for justice to the Open Society Foundation (it can be found on the WWW), even suggests that in certain ways can old democracy from new tricks: some government bodies in Romania are to do citizens about the sensitive information than comparable bodies in France and Spain.
In particular, was in Romania positively settle 60% submitted the request, while in France it was 31% and Spain 24%.
Among other countries that have better results include Peru and Mexico, which adopted its laws on freedom of information in the same way in 2002, shortly after the Romania.
To gain access to sensitive information in emerging markets but democracy is not always easy, as I convinced during his early years in the role of human rights for Romanian Helsinki Committee.
Often we had to turn up to the court to be on the basis of the Romanian law on freedom of information in 2001 forced disclosure of certain information.
Although, for example, we win the dispute regarding access to a record of eavesdropping enacted by the general prosecutor, prosecutor court orders simply ignored.
We filed the civil lawsuit against him and judge him fines for each day of the information.
Yet the information -- containing data on the number of eavesdropping approved during the previous 10 years, against whom and for how long -- were published only after it was my case gained media attention.
Their published, Romania began from the past, which dominated Securitate.
Today I alone I sit in government and I realize that the share information with the public is sometimes difficult.
When they are necessary but painful reforms, there is no alternative.
Economic and political reforms that we now entitled to EU membership would be achieved if exposed to political decisions public control and accepting with greater public participation in the decision-making process, which such openness inevitably hand.
Today, of openness has become part and parcel of the democratic governance everywhere.
When in 1966 adopted its own law on freedom of information, the United States, to join the exclusive society comprising then only Sweden and Finland.
Today is such a law about 65 countries.
Those who fought for the law on freedom of information in Romania, it now fully use.
The study of the initiative for justice, who in its framework demanded after the Romanian government information, were reluctant to provide such data and that the ago a few years ago was inconceivable.
The Romanian Ministry of Defense, for example, reported the number of members of the armed forces, who died in 2003, including the causes of their deaths (including was about 13 suicides, the two shooting and two deaths in combat in Afghanistan).
Bucharest, the court was told about the data on the number of judges since the beginning of the year 2000, including reasons these forms of punitive measures.
The court to refer the request of top judicial council, which in the full breadth of: list of all judges including in those reasons and the punishment.
This information is the result and at the same time the engine continued reforms.
For people in the government is not always enjoyable and because of sensitive documents from always arise tug-of-war.
In the former communist bloc but are the advantages of transparency undeniable.
Romania's experience also shows that the official secrecy remains a threat to the basic values and democratic government that the only constant vigilance in the established and young democracies can prevent their spread.
Save the Trees of Life
None of us had a single day, without the use of products coming from the forest.
On paper, who wrote, water, that we from a drug that US, timber, from which to build homes and furniture, all of this has its origins in the forest, and that much more funds than the majority of people aware of.
Forests provide as fresh air to breathe and home to endangered species.
We provide recreational opportunities that are in our complex world of increasingly important.
About 1.5 billion poor people living in the countryside around the world depend on forests about their basic needs, such as food and fuel wood.
Deforestation still continues.
Year after year, lost 1 million acres of forests -- a territory four times greater than Switzerland.
Their sinister influence irresponsible forest management, bad government regulations and poor law enforcement, and markets that reward illegal timber extraction, Unisono and valuable and endangered forests of the world.
When will begin disappearing forests, usually follows a number of environmental, social and economic problems, that would somehow affecting us all.
Indonesia's Sumatra island is a good example.
A plant Celulózu paper and encourage unbridled and illegal destruction of forests, where lies the rich diversity of plants in the world.
It is likely that they become extinct even discovered plants and threatened animal species, such as, Slon and orangutan.
Sumatra to lose their forests, whole societies people find themselves without proper jobs for life and without the possibility of properly to make a living.
Distorting global markets caused trade with legal, inexpensive expressed products, leading to those enterprises that act as responsible citizens of the world.
Developing countries because of illegal timber extraction comes a year by 15 billion dollars in tax revenues.
To this was not less, unsustainable demands posed on Sumaterské forests still keeps up demand for timber in rebuilding after last year the tsunamis.
Such threats are clear and dolphins, and in the Congo Basin.
A recent report Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) shows that in these and other important areas are due to mismanagement to degradation of forests, which will decline if it is to take proper measures.
The information reported by the Brazilian government indicate that deforestation irreplaceable dolphins, forests, caused by factors such as conversion forests in agricultural land, intervene in the past year 2.6 million acres, which slope Amazonia grown to 17%.
The battle against deforestation but we still lost.
Diverse organizations, environmentalist and associations that state of the world's forests about link its forces to reverse the deforestation and improve managing forests.
For example, the world's Fund (WWF) conservation and the World Bank helped the Brazilian government launched the initiative, in which the there were more than 17 million acres of new protected forest land, such as national parks.
WWF Alliance and the World Bank also motivating its partners to establish trust fund that these protected slopes will forever be governed.
The summit of leaders of Congo Basin countries also result in extraordinary cross-border cooperation in the protection of forests and responsible for managing them.
It led to the initiative subsidized 53 millions of dollars from the State Department of the United States to support the protection of forests around the Congo.
Since the first meeting of leaders in 1999 was still in eastern basin based newly protected land area of 3.5 million acres.
Nevertheless, given the impact of the Asian tsunami from last December, Pádnosti evidence presented MEA and statistics pictures of deforestation in key regions must continue our efforts.
The World Bank and the WWF recently committed themselves to joint efforts to reduce global deforestation rates by 10% by 2010 and that they will cooperate with other institutions of public and private sector to implement ambitious objectives aimed at protecting the forests.
WWF studies show that if they were the world's forests divided on a mixture of different uses, and types, including protected territory, responsibly administered commercial forests and renewed landscape -- we can to satisfy world demand for forest products, and also in the foreseeable future to protect environmental and social values.
Its role in implementing this vision must play leaders trade organizations, governments and civil society.
They are fanatics?
The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia led many not only to challenge the ruling Al-Saud dynasty of survival, but also to the question of whether the kingdom is deeply inefficient and destructive.
It seems that the Saudi company gave way of violent fanaticism, who draw their inspiration from extreme religious orthodoxy.
The fact that 15 of Devatenácti airline hijackers who attacked the September 11, 2001, the United States were Saudis, a loose recent view of the kingdom as a stronghold of authoritarianism and intolerance.
In some ways, this view is correct, but he cannot be enforced on broad Saudi public.
On the contrary, it would be a grave mistake to believe that the Saudi attitude to religion is fully in fanatical Islámismu.
Between 2001 and 2003, I was a member of the team that conducted extensive surveys of values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and Jordan.
Our results provide a picture Saudi views.
Compared to respondents from other countries of the Middle East are Saudis generally less religious and their attitudes toward democracy and arranged marriages also point to moderate tendencies.
Of course, in all four countries is piety widespread -- over 90% of respondents together claim to believe in God, afterlife and heaven and hell.
But they seem to be less religious than their Muslim species.
For the pious saying 62% of the Saudis, but 82% of the Iranians, 85% of the Jordanians and Egyptians 98%.
As a pious than they appear and Americans who are themselves call from 81%.
To some extent differences can be explained by the differences in how the different peoples explain what that means to be pious.
For example, the Americans can piety define other than those in the Middle East, with their definition will probably hang on to religious belief less than in Islamic countries.
This may in part explain and differences among Muslim countries.
But the gap between domestic definition of piety among Saudis on the one hand and the Iranians, Jordanians and Egyptians on the other is so large that challenges the prevailing view in Saudi Arabia as a highly conservative and pious society.
After all, actions speak louder than words, compared to 27% of the Iranians, 44% of the Jordanians, 42% of Egyptian and 45% of Americans, only 28% of the Saudis said that each week in services.
These findings, although contradictory to generally widespread opinion on the Saudi culture, are more surprising than it seems.
Sociologists religion has long claimed that in a rigid religious environment or in an environment where they are religious institutions closely closely linked with the state, General piety public has declined.
It is justified, I believe that when the authorities cannot enforce strict norms negotiations, people tend to the revolt and divert gas from officially religious institutions.
It is not surprising that the Egyptians and Jordanians, who live in countries where state power of faith to promote are pious than Iranians and Saudis, who must face local "morality" the police, backed up the state.
Even in relation to the marriage of express Saudis unexpectedly liberal views.
Respondents were on an arbitrary almost evenly divided marriages because half of it had taken the view that marriage should be based on the approval of parents, while 48% of those could be as the basis of an illegitimate relationship merits of love.
Given the underlying segregation of women and men and Otcovské dominance of the findings appear to be the discovery of a strong desire for greater individual choice in the matter, which has traditionally decide family.
Finally, the Saudis is projected strong advocates of democracy, which also oppose the widespread idea about the Saudi conservatism.
Democracy for the best form of government saying 58% of all of those Saudis, with 23% agree and 18% of their views expressed.
The majority support for democracy in the country without first secular and national history seemingly contradicts logic.
In fact, support for democracy is the number of other liberal attitudes that we are in Saudi Arabia have found.
Supporters of democracy are less religious, secular, tolerant towards others, critical of the conduct of public sector and are more concerned with their cultural invasion of the West.
But data from the survey, also history shows that liberal views are gaining in popularity, if the people's despotic ruler in conjunction with the religious establishment.
In response to the religious despotism Sultan Abdülhamida at the end of the nineteenth century, the strong currents of liberalism in Ottoman Syria.
In the same period, in Iran made, secular movement for the government according to the constitution -- in response to absolutist alliance between Shah and religious institutions.
In the knowledge similarities between these historical precedents and current conditions in Saudi Arabia is the possibility of reforms should not exclusive.
The survey results now also suggest they could start demanding transparent policies and less religion.
The Museum
At the end of the nineteenth century Europe regard Asia mainly as a source of inspiration for their artists, or for the imperial ambitions.
It reminds Asians, see Europe either for a model of modernity, such as in Japan during the Meiji, or a Barometr decline, for example, in China.
One hundred years later Japan's economic miracle made in the eyes of Europeans look at least part of Asia in place to rapid technological and industrial progress.
Today, in the early years of the twenty-first century, the perception of Europe in Asia and Asia in Europe dramatically changes, as Asian economies have boom, while the European Union to sink into a crisis of identity and self-confidence.
It reminds Asians every Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan, such as former Yew, now the Europeans warn that if they continue the current direction, Europe has quickly become irrelevant in all but the tourism and luxury real estate.
Prominent Chinese traders, who shared their time between Hong Kong and London, was more specific.
A few weeks ago on the private meeting of top business and political leaders in Paris said: "you Europeans are beginning to become third world countries, spend time in the wrong subject -- the constitution, the welfare state, the pension crisis -- and systematically wrong replies to questions that the place."
Views of Europeans to Asia in general and on China in particular are complex and varied from a sober adaptation to new and respected competitor to purely ideological refusal.
In May 1968 student in France -- or at least their part -- who have been to the streets to invented the new world, dream of Maoist China, the country in the middle of the brutal and senseless cultural revolution.
Their absurd and was how the fruit of knowledge of Mao's crimes, so the result of youth in a society where there are virtually unemployment.
Their heir today by contrast, openly criticised Asian capitalist model.
Yesterday, China was Protikapitalistickou banner star utopian revolutionaries; now the turn in scourge in the eyes of a new generation of utopian -- defenders of the status quo in Europe.
Student demonstrators in the streets of Paris in recent times do not want to Chinese or Indians; spurn the logic of globalization and refuse to give up its hard-won social security.
The European economic elites look to China and India very differently.
It is now fully aware that their somewhat nostalgic post-colonial view of these countries as a large export markets and huge cheap labor will survive.
China and India have become real competitors who deserve respect, if not directly surprises.
Quality, costs and add deadline in the automotive manufacturing, for example, at European level.
Europe it maintains advantage in the realm of pure science, for example, in the pharmaceutical industry, but emerging society world standards, particularly in India, are increasingly able to hire graduates MIT and Harvard and also maintain lower wage costs, and thus global competitiveness.
Unfortunately, although European leaders of the Asian challenge respecting failed to use it as a litmus test of reality into inevitable globalization process even as a call to arms in the social and economic affairs.
Indeed, can fairly say that European politicians, only a few exceptions, such as Tony Blair, are too slow and have their view of the world reconciled with a revolutionary change pace in Asia.
Jailed between lack of long-term strategic vision and obsession with short-term interests, European politicians have so far from a part of the quest for respect of their Asian counterparts, unlike European companies, which is in the Asian eyes are much better.
Of course, it reminds Asians on the continent, which largely failed to bury its history and Zabouchnout doors for nationalist scarecrow, often the EU is also a model of reconciliation, peace and prosperity.
But if the European performance continues to deteriorate, holds this view?
Perhaps that would then it reminds Asians to the European model as the political equivalent of Venice -- instead of that is worth visit with nostalgia for their former glory and with admiration for his nature.
The Red and Blue
In exchange for Colin Powell Condoleezzu rice as US Secretary of State, shows that America's recent presidential elections are still strong echoed.
To understand what we call the election of America, but it is important not only for Americans, but for the world.
This year's presidential race shows that American democracy is not healthy, but that some things could be better.
Compared to the elections in 2000, when President Bush a popular majority and is unlikely to win electoral college, this time Bush won about 3.5 million votes.
While some Democrats are still, serious questioning of the legitimacy of Bush's victory appears only rarely.
America remains just on the red (Republican) states divided and blue (Democratic) states.
If 100,000 votes in red state of Ohio has otherwise, the president would John Kerry (even if he would be a minority of popular support).
An electoral college was established in the US constitution to protect the small countries in the federal system, but now means that the political campaign largely focused on battle in about a dozen states where public opinion just separated.
Even more important is that the victory of President without popular support is something improper.
Nazrál so time for serious debate on changing the constitution that would be an electoral college scrapped.
Some observers also complain about Negativistickou incendiary rhetoric and advertisements that characterized the campaign.
But this is the need to be judged in historic run.
In an era of the father of the founders of newspapers were extremely party and the George Washington makes Hrubost language policy.
After a large part of its early history -- a period of civil war and restoring not to mention -- was the country divided and just as now and fix this slow leak punishment is reflected in the bitter rhetoric campaign.
But at the same time, despite the incendiary advertising on both sides, the three nationally televised debate serious way raise important issues and attracted wide attention viewers.
More generally, acting president as the economy has hopes for re-election.
In this sense, in the Bush re-election this surprising, as it was a weak majority.
Largely this Nepopulárnost was caused by the Iraq war.
Kerry tried to push for a central campaign theme war, low level of job creation, inadequate health care and the Bush tax cuts for the group with higher incomes, but some observers feel that never resulted in a clear message.
Bush counter concerns about security in the face of terrorism and cultural populism on issues such as marriages of gay couples and the right to abortion.
Eventually, security and cultural populism Trumfovaly over economic populism.
Interpretation of the election result in further affect the east of the polling stations, in which voters were surveyed (after voice to the ballot box), what issues are the most important for them.
Most of respondents (22%) said that "moral values", by contrast, 20% said that they do it was called the economy and 19% mentioned terrorism.
Social conservatives it as so that he and Bush the victory that would further their agenda should dominate the president's term.
Opinion poll conducted shows a week later, centre suggested that the category of "moral values" includes a wide range of issues, not just the right to abortion and gay wedding.
In fact, polls show that 25% of the public supports gay marriages and 35% favors legal civil lawsuit of gay marriage were quashed (the position defended by Kerry).
Nevertheless, in the case of 37% of those who are against gay marriage, especially in the red core of countries subject to mobilize voters and Bush is to go to elections.
More pressing question is whether the US is hopelessly divided.
The electoral map of the red and blue States has on the Internet a jokes and joke about the fact that blue Coast, from red of the country.
Some call it "Coastopia" (coastal) utopia.
Dividing line is not as harsh.
Each of the camps in some states election by a small advantage, and if the map at the state level, but counties, much of the country looks quite.
A better description of the coast than versus the Gangetic state is more cities and suburbs and provinces.
Opinion polls confirm this, for they show that most Americans do not belong to extremes of the political spectrum, but that is moderate in their midst.
The political elite, such as party activists and members of Congress, but are more prone to excesses than the public.
It initially appears to be a mystery, since he should have the motivation is simply pushed to the center, which is rich in voters.
Many members of Congress but represent the networks that are for their parties secure, so their re-election is at stake in the party Primárkách, who dominate activist and radical wing of the parties.
This tended to reinforce the rise of cable networks, which attract viewers through "" programs, and Internet who enter the bitter controversy without any Filtru.
Reforms aimed at changes borders congressional districts, which would in them by more competition, would help alleviate this problem, but few the incumbent congressmen will vote for changes that could boost the risk that will be beaten.
Fix this slow leak outcome indicates that Bush gained a weaker mandate than it is apparently convinced.
Given that faces the difficult issues in foreign, fiscal and social policies, yet he would be wise if to appease its conservative member base but he turned to political center. So far, however, remains unclear whether will prevail ideological or a pragmatic policy.
To Get Rid of the Oil Habit
A leading priority agenda of Germany for its EU presidency and the G-8, startup in January, has set a Chancellor Angela Merkel addressing climate change.
Here is a concrete proposal, which is a broad enough to him, world leaders consider and adopt, and not sufficiently clear to him, other governments and businesses to understand: simply on the next G-8 summit set deadlines, in which will cease to be in industrial countries endorsed the idea of vehicles oil products.
Such a decision should strongly positive economic and geopolitical consequences.
The real cause of the current concerns about energy is not in the world's oil supplies, but rather that domestic oil production in its largest consumer-Europe, the United States and China -- dropped at the very moment when the growing Asian demand bother to market.
Available resources will be increasingly concentrated in the Middle East simply because supplies in other regions run out soon.
The major oil exporters, are not willing to submit to its investment policy to the requirements of the market.
Saudi Arabia seeks to oil production carried out independently, while Iran potential investors deters bureaucratic impediments and corruption.
Iraq suffers from bad security situation in Russia and what now down to foreign investors stick to its feet.
These four countries well established their own half the world's oil supplies and two-thirds of what would potentially could export.
It is these factors, rather than the cost of production, is the core of high oil prices and of oil contracts in Central Asia and Africa.
Opinion polls, that high oil prices are good, because they serve the environment, it ignores basic facts of international politics.
First, in many poor African and Asian countries represent oil imports substantially larger share of national spending than in industrial countries, which means that it is under threat of economic growth and social development, while on the horizon is a new crisis indebtedness.
Rents from oil production in the main export countries from reforms.
Because of their financial strength in the Great Kondici regime, for example, in Venezuela and Iran feel less and less-linked international rules.
Opozdilci between consumer states such as China, echoing earlier habits in the West, with a long record of ignoring the encroachment on human rights to secure lucrative business, oil, endowed with authoritarian regimes.
Initiated by a change in a global scale can only world political and economic hard scales, the leading industrial countries that remain by far the biggest consumers.
Changes must start in the transport sector, which is responsible for more than half the current consumption of oil -- and this share is likely to grow in the future.
The G-8 countries would therefore have agreed that since by 2025 will not allow any new cars driven by oil products.
This decision would be directed against individual mobility, but against the waste of scarce resources, which is the urgent need to production of synthetic materials.
Political leaders should not no particular technology.
Rather, should give the automotive industry incentives to develop alternative technologies that rely on the Pohon from Biomasy, Etylén,, even during a transition period and on natural gas.
Countries that are leading the way forward politically, as collateral advantage to make its domestic industries leading place in the energy technologies, so it bad future markets.
The expected significant reduction in CO2 emissions would eventually could bring a breakthrough, which is needed in the international climate policy.
The change would, however, occurred in the economic development: if cure from his "dependency" on oil, it would remain more for the poor, less-developed and newly industrialized countries and also it depresses prices and geopolitical release energy competition.
Geopoliticky would benefits were similarly obvious, because it would significantly reduce the ability of the major oil exporter, with industrial countries.
This could increase bargaining power of the international community in the Middle East and strengthen the social forces in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia, which genuinely want to promote from within the political and economic reform.
As technologically advanced countries and major automobile manufacturers in Germany is advantageous position to such an initiative.
Merkel, which has an of physics and his political career began as environment minister -- in the 1995 conference chaired by the UN framework convention on climate change -- is perhaps for resolving this issue a more credible than any of his colleagues in the EU and G-8.
It is time for bold leadership acts.
The Myth of Trade and Aid
Trade and aid have become international fashionable slogans.
It seems that the increase in aid (including debt relief) and ensuring better access products from poor countries to the markets of rich countries are at the top of the global agenda.
The debate now lead about what to do, but, how do and how fast.
In this climate are lost unambiguous lessons from the past five decades of economic development.
On place between them, the fact that development is largely in the hands of the poor countries.
Countries that are in the recent past have well do so because of their own efforts.
Aid and access to markets in the rarely played a key role.
Consider developing country, which is free and preferential market access of his biggest neighbor, which happened to be also the world economy.
Further suppose that this country can send millions of its citizens for work across borders, is a recipient of the internal investment and is fully integrated into the international production chain.
The banking system, supports the stated willingness to rich neighbor served as a lender of last resort.
Globalization has neither can be better if the truth?
And now to consider the other country.
The stops in access to the world market trade embargo, from west to receive foreign aid or any other forms of support, is excluded from international organizations, such as the WTO, and must not borrow from the IMF and World Bank.
And to these external liability was less imposes this economy also own high barriers to international trade (in the form of state Dirigismu, import tariffs and quantitative restrictions on).
As has readers may, it is a real country: Mexico and Vietnam.
Mexico has more than 3 500-kilometer long border with the United States, which it provides not only the privileged access to market goods and work, but also claims the source of the US Treasury (as it became clear during the peso crisis in 1995).
Vietnam to maintain the America until 1994 trade embargo, diplomatic relations with these countries only established in 1995 and violated the advantages granted Vietnam's imports even after many years.
Moreover, Vietnam still stand by the WTO.
And now compare economic performance of both countries.
Since the signing of the NAFTA in December 1992 in the Mexican economy has grown at an average annual rate of only 1%.
This is not only far below the Asian economic a superstar, but, it is only a fraction of its own Mexican growth during the decades previous debt crisis of 1982 (3% per year between 1960 and 1981).
Vietnam's economy, before the start of the economic reforms in 1998, and the arrival of a diplomatic contacts with the US in 1995 grew an annual rate of 5%, and since then, continues in the rapid growth of 4.5%.
The country experienced a dramatic decline in poverty, while Mexico declined in real wages.
Both countries have a sharp increase in international trade and foreign investment, but yet offer vastly different picture in indicators that matter most: in raising living standards, especially poor people.
These examples show that when it comes to economic fate of the country exceeds domestic efforts everything else.
Not all the opportunities that Mexico offering market of the United States, failed to offset the consequences of the political mistakes at home, particularly in the ability to reverse the real exchange-rate appreciation of the peso and expand productivity growth reached at the close of export activity in the rest of the economy.
Most of all, depends on whether a country the right to produce growth strategy.
Vietnam without all the advantages of a strategy to focus on diversifying the economy and increasing production capacity of domestic suppliers.
A post-war experience supports the conclusion that the most important of all is domestic politics.
South Korea in the early 1960s Neodlepila DNA from the moment when foreign aid was the top, but at the time was on the wane.
Taiwan received foreign aid and no preferential access to markets.
China and India, the two today's economic, a superstar, largely due to its unique reform drive.
It is tempting to rare African success -- Botswana and Mauricius -- foreign demand for their exports (diamonds or clothes), but this explanation works only to some extent.
It is obvious that both countries would be without access to foreign markets much poorer.
As in other cases of successful development but it is different from other external benefits, who enjoys, but the ability to exploit these advantages.
Witness in a situation, to which bogged down other rich countries in the incidence of natural resources.
In Sierra Leone diamonds "hardly the word" raises the prospect of a peace and prosperity.
As well as the export processing zones little that is spreading around the world, had reported results on Mauriciu.
None of this, the rich countries of the responsibility to help.
May make the world less for corrupt dictators -- such as greater exchange of financial information and the recognition of international treaties, that these dictators have signed.
As well as increase the number of workers from poor countries, which will be allowed to work in rich countries, and provide a broad framework for the oriented strategy relaxation of rules of the WTO and conditionality from the US should on the development of higher long-term impact.
It is not far from clear that the expansion of access to markets and increase the aid is a way of precious political capital in the north.
Development would have focused on trade and aid, but on improving the political environment in poor countries.
Who is dependent now?
If he was now alive the late great Argentine economist Raúl Prebisch, undoubtedly would do if turned over the world upside down.
Their hugely influential theory of "independence" pointed out that if poor countries too rely on exports of commodities, never achieve industrial depth that is required to maintain rapid growth.
Instead, stuck in the cycle of falling global commodity prices and an dwindling income shares.
Prebischova favored political reaction, protectionism, has proved disastrous for many Latin American and African countries, which gave to his advice.
But it is the fact that the many years seemed Prebisch right Pojmenovává long-term trends commodity prices.
Sustained gains in efficiency of agriculture and production of natural resources depressing commodities, especially in the 1980s and 1990s.
With only a few exceptions, the country, which centered on exports of commodities, have done it, while natural resource-rich Asian countries Pádily forward.
But now, when the global economy employs Asian giants, India and China, the price of oil, gold, grain and virtually all other commodities rise sharply.
Even though it will always show cycles -- oil prices, for example, is likely to fall than they rose again -- the long-term trend for many commodities certainly will remain for some time growing.
One thing, which they trade negotiators and other policymakers even to admit, though Prebisch, that would see immediately, is that this dramatic turn of events entails major implications for the global balance of power.
No other aspects of economic globalization will probably not in the coming decades for the world leaders a greater challenge.
Questions are many.
Today's rich countries are ready to era of mutual dependency, which yearns for a commodity as thoroughly as developing countries for industrial imports and technology?
They are ready to inevitable transfer of power and influence to commodity producers, who will be a rich?
As the two world superpower, China and the United States, with the fact that important regions in commodities, from Africa across the Middle East to Central Asia, are Poseté badly national states?
Some self-appointed Jasnovidci to relate to issues such as the problem natural resources, with the world is essential commodities worrisome pace is underway.
Many supporters today is the theory of "Hubbertova highs" in the output of oil, which assumes that we have the upper limits mining capacity, plans dry up and from now on it will be only from the hills.
But as she points out, a leading historian of the history of oil, the prophet of doom Dan Yergin declared that the world is oil, have for at least four times.
Every time the threat of radical improved technologies.
At the end of the first decade of the 19th century oil output include collecting matter through Mul.
Now no one is surprised plans in depth 3,000 meters under sea bottom.
To comparable progress has been widely in the development of red and in agriculture.
Not a commodity, the world in the near there.
Instead, yet there is the inclusion of 2.5 billion people (only China and India) into the global economy translates into a shift in demand, which probably will cause much stronger pressure on rising commodity prices than what they can offset technological advances.
Prices of natural resources will therefore go up for at least 50 to 75 years, and perhaps the time, than people in the next century will benefit on Mars.
world politics change the balance of global economic power, which will result?
The first world war, of course, in part triggered fears of Germany, that other colonial powers are reserved for too large a share of the world's oil supplies and commodities.
In World War II, Japan similarly worry about the stability of its foreign oil supplies and other natural resources.
Will the kind of tension between China, whose natural resources are limited (the problem is there even water), and the West?
This is, fortunately for now seems unlikely, particularly given a sober and pragmatic approach of the Chinese leadership to difficulties in natural resources.
The Chinese are looking for regions such as Africa, and hope that it will find a permanent trade partners.
Share political evangelism Americans who want to exporters, commodities trading only, but is also keen to turn on their faith.
Are there but also others supported US leaders, who with respect to supply energy to talk about change in the US self-sufficient country.
But this is practically joke: austerity perhaps, but never self-reliance.
Much of the Arab world understandably, regards the Iraq invasion as a cornerstone of a real strategy of the US in the region to secure stable supplies of energy.
If they are right, we can only hope that America has in the down payment plan B.
So far will continue to rise in commodities prices, with oil exporters currently represent the biggest contributors to the yawning US trade deficit.
Perhaps that the real strategies of the US is owed to countries in oil so much money that will feel depend on satisfying America!
This is the reversal that would Prebisch never envisaged.
Iranian Hard-line Yes
The next president, who was elected Iran's hard-line and mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, probably get worse as relations with the West and international isolation of the country.
For domestic, but probably Islamist regime will be doing better than, he would have done with moderate result.
It is clear that Ahmadinejad has real base supporters.
But these circumstances, that he ran as a populist, spoke of help the poor performance condemned the government and was almost as opposition candidates are all irrelevant: it was Vyvolencem regime and ultimately it did help against rival candidates for hard-line.
The regime which used his opportunities.
A little more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani, who disagree with some existing policies, into a representative of the "establishment" and his own people in the rebels.
The government, is to use a sense of directed against the establishment to reinforce their power.
The fact that the President Mohammed Khatami was supporters of the reform movement -- though supporters leader that ultimately nothing achieved -- underscores just how carefully ruler of the political situation turned.
Ahmadinejad is representative of the younger activists revolution of the pre-quarter-century.
Directly participate in holding American hostage in Iran, although how far to participate in it, remains subject to dispute.
Worrying is that is closer to two main groups that represent the most extreme part of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards: and Organization of.
The first is parallel army; the second is the organization to intimidate opponents and all those who are seeking a more open society.
Fears that Iran conquered even more radical leadership, but help alleviate two factors.
First, Ahmadinejad will focus more on domestic issues, because it will seek to improve the living standards of poor Iranians -- even though it is not clear to what extent will.
Second, and ideological foreign policy will remain essentially the same group, which is in power since the revolution.
The president has less power than it seems, will make especially supreme leader Ayatollah Ali.
Nevertheless, Ahmadinejad's electoral victory challenge inexorably demonstrates that Iran represents for Western policies and stability of the Middle East.
In the first sign of extreme elements in Iran and the terrorist clients countries -- Lebanese Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad and the various small groups of acting against Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Arab countries -- that they have the green light to the start of the attacks.
All those likely to conclude that Iran is will support whatever do anything.
On the surface was Iran often quite cautious, but is hidden in the world's leading sponsors of terror.
The Iranian officials sometimes could act for themselves and order and control certain operations; now it is not in such actions feel low.
Ahmadinejad, openly Defends Iran's program to acquire nuclear weapons.
Most Iranian politicians -- at least those which the government allows publicly act -- program supports, but prefer a quiet and cautious approach.
Rafsanjani, for example, building better economic relations with the West over progress on the nuclear front.
If nuclear President Ahmadinejad of Iran, is in it more likely that weapons used.
This does not mean that we should blow, but rather that it is used for the purpose of diplomatic blackmail and threats to the rise of up to crisis levels.
Given that Iranian leaders day declared their desire to wipe Israel off the map and fought with the US (Ahmadinejad on the road to the ballot box, they stepped on the American flag), the risk of confrontation increased.
Finally, for Ahmadinejad is likely to be bold in subversion stability in Iraq and that his victory will encourage both radical Iranian officials and extremists inside of Iraq.
Iran now sends to Iraq of agents and supports the clients, whose goal is to turn the country in a clone.
Iraqis, including Shiite Muslims -- who profess the same a strain of Islam as the Iranians -- generally reject such meddling.
Militant Iranian stance likely to intensify friction with Iraq and would cause there other anti-US violence.
In short, Iran's election results is dangerous, even though as highly destabilizing, turned out will depend on the negotiations and the extent of powers that grants him Khamenei.
To deal with such openly extremist Iran -- a radical and according to norms of hard-line regime -- will not only for the US, but also for Europe.
Will the European countries trying to pretend that militant rhetoric and its provocations do not mind and that about Iran's nuclear ambitions can find a diplomatic solution?
With Rafsanjani would be easy to either real communication or simulating cooperation.
With but will be needed rates appeasement to persist at least a minimal diplomatic development.
Some Iranian reformers and the exile represent Ahmadinejad's election in a clean and say that in the case of his administration is likely to show the real face of the regime and eliminate the West all the false hope of compromise.
But the presidency can also pose a success of the regime in of discontent with the quarter-century radical Islamist government.
Whatever the consequences of any, for the West Ahmadinejad's victory means that all, what applies to Iran, will be even the most heated.
The Poor to Rich and Gives
It seems that President Bush is ready to turn in the coming years America's budget in ruin.
When Bush took office, the prospect of budget surpluses all possibilities.
Given the combination of irresponsible tax cuts, which imposed the Republicans now fiscal horizon has economy, bubble stock markets and massive increase in spending on arms race.
And it will be worse, as the Bush administration and with the Republican-controlled Congress are gearing up this fiscal mess even wider.
Damage causing, perhaps will weaken the United States and increase instability of the world economy.
US Republican party traditionally supported the balanced budgets.
That changed with the advent of the Reagan administration, when conservative Republicans prefer tax cuts at the cost of large fiscal deficits.
President Reagan told the American people that it can also enjoy tax cut, growth of the army and the continuation of its popular programs government spending.
Unsurprisingly, the result was a series of huge budget deficits to settle for years.
As the first president George Bush and Bill Clinton to increase taxes to the disarray of the Reagan era redress.
Tax hikes probably contributed to Bill Clinton's victory over the first President Bush in 1992.
Yet Clinton hinted decided to complete the process of restoring fiscal stability, in part because to insure long-term financing pension program of social security.
When Clinton left office in 2000, the budgetary situation was the best in decades.
And then, President George Bush Junior and emulate Reagan: big tax cuts, major spending increases for arms and continue or even expanding popular programs government spending.
The result was predictable.
In January 2001 was the result of the cumulative budget planned for the period 2002-2011 surplus with the sum of 5 trillion dollars.
By mid-2002, the planned surpluses disappear.
Taking into account this change economic conditions and the threat of war in Iraq, one would expect that the Bush administration and with the Republican-controlled Congress will be in justifying the new tax cuts cautious. This would be.
Their top priority is to approve another tax cut, that the most to benefit the rich.
The government also calls for a significant increase of defense spending.
Given the forthcoming presidential election designed for November 2004, we can be certain that even outside the military to no significant cut government spending will not happen.
So, it seems that large budget deficits in the US last taking hold.
If he does not change the level of domestic spending in proportion to the national income, the cumulative budget outcomes achieved in the next ten years combined deficit 1.5 trillion dollars.
This figure but may be still optimistic, because perhaps adequately take into account the cost of the possible war in Iraq, another round of tax cuts and the danger of higher interest rates in the years.
As is possible that are Republicans to these problems to?
Some have greater interest in the tax cut for the rich than anything else.
Others believe that the deficit to be large-scale violations of domestic government spending and this will be diminished state, and this is the desire of their hearts.
Trouble this view is that most of the taxpayers has programs domestic spending in the popular and is willing to support cuts in expenditure.
The question that more, this is why the Americans in the election of the vote such political approach when it should be clear that the problems are obvious.
The answer is that many voters the budgetary problems do.
Better answer is that the majority of Americans in such a policy of the vote.
Turnout was in 2002 only around 40% and the Republicans gained only about half of the vote -- the voices of approximately 20% of eligible voters.
Of course, that prospect may not be as the dark.
The war in Iraq can be avoided.
The proposed tax cuts is possible to mitigate or from them away.
But we have in the years large budget deficits and growing sense of unease in both the US and abroad, which will come from America's macroeconomic situation.
Foreign investors may decide to finance the US budget and current deficit under favourable conditions.
The dollar may weaken and can start to a greater extent than the fear of inflation.
This meant that US policymakers will lose its security and flexibility required in response to economic shocks.
The poor, in both the US and foreign, could suffer the most, when President Bush and the US Congress, say, the American people and the world that because of the large budget deficit is not enough money to fight poverty, disease, and the problems of education.
If the ordinary Americans realize this fiscal danger, the rich may Vyváznou with another gift, while the United States and the world have for years their painful consequences.
The Lessons of What Makes America's Fiscal
George W. Bush has done economic policy, the US more harm than any other president in American history and overcome his master Ronald Reagan.
In just three years in office destroyed the fragile political consensus, whose creation it took decades and whose re-creating it can take a further 10 years.
But Bush's long-term economic health and social stability America.
Because the long-term budgetary issues that the US so badly manage, it is not specific, they can learn from mistakes fiscal America take important lesson, other countries.
The main problem of fiscal policy is that, politicians, can easily temporarily increased popularity by reducing taxes and boosting public spending and create a massive public debt and its servicing intervening in the future.
This trick can be enforced for several years, but budget deficits and rising public debt sooner or later be painful reversal of policy.
Cynical politics could still buy re-election, and before the case of crisis, can no longer be in.
One would have thought that after hundreds of similar show of fiscal irresponsibility around the world over the past decade, will voters at a similar trick allergic.
Bush but he still has flaunted again and to buy popularity heavy tax cuts at the current military spending growth, and even spending on education and health.
The result is the budget deficit equivalent to more than 5% of GDP.
What is worse is that long-term budget outlook of the United States were worrying even before Bush began its reckless policy.
The people of the US are aging, so come the rapid increase in spending in publicly funded health care and pension systems.
Careful calculations show that future revenues in fiscal policy by Bush are likely to Desetibiliony dollars lower than public spending on pensions, health care and other fiscal, that the public expects.
In the future and in a moment may need to a sharp increase in tax collection, sharp cuts in public expenditure, or both, is to be correct Bush's actions.
So why the public supports his policies?
Because the public this long-term effects little understood or about them less concerned with, although ultimately favorably with a majority of Americans.
The richest taxpayers are, of course, happy, because much of the tax cuts will shift it.
It is astonishing that the richest five percent of the American taxpayers' was given to nearly half the tax cuts, and the taxpayers clearly expect most of the future expenditure cuts and tax increases on their shoulders will do the other 95% of the population -- or middle and lower class.
Bush is yet to have convinced many voters from the poor and middle classes that they should be happy without, however, tell them that if the policy of his administration's long-term will prevail, they will have to pay for their small tax cut a more extensive restrictions on government services in the future.
If the Americans should political memory understood is that on the current fiscal "tobogan" in the past 20 years, already one Svezli.
Also, Ronald Reagan took office with the promise of heavy tax cuts and a large increase in military spending.
By mid-1980s was the result of a huge budget deficit.
The tax cuts, Reagan earned enormous popularity and Dopomohly him to re-election in 1984.
Return of the budget back to surplus, it took more than a decade since Reagan's second term after term George Bush's older and Bill Clinton.
Of course, that means pass new tax cuts, which prepared the old George Bush's re-election and led to polarization policies in the 1990s.
History will almost certainly be repeated.
Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush administration believes that today's budget deficits will be the sharp reduction in government social spending.
I hope that they will liquidate programs as "social security" and Medicare.
The American public but these plans strongly supports.
Right-wing strategy the tax cut for the purpose of late but enforcement of cuts in social agenda because it and eventually will have to be an increase in tax rates.
Some Bush administration officials argue that the tax cuts are important for United States from recession.
Also this argument is wrong.
The US economy from recession could even without the tax cuts, and perhaps even looks strong.
In any case, it is a great mistake based long-term fiscal policy in the short-term economic cycle.
For other countries of this are two vital lessons.
The first is the recognition that the looming US budget deficits, sooner or later, limit the power of the United States in the world.
Americans supported the war in Iraq only because for it must pay in the form of tax increases.
If it will have to choose between foreign adventure and higher taxes, with much less likely they will support the costly military operations abroad.
When the public will face fiscal mess that has left behind Bush, the US are deeply divided internally.
The second lesson is that countries would have in the planning of the budget taking into account the growing fiscal costs caused by the aging population.
Taxpayers or parliaments have rarely considerations on the long-term budgetary conditions.
Since the government would therefore should require that, together with an annual budget proposals also provided long-term budget estimates, which would reduce tends to short-term political manipulation of the budget.
The US can other countries serve as a kind of early warning.
The White House should provide for the rest of the same threat as the Wizards had given announced: "it at home."
Securities Markets and Politics
Many economic and financial analysts complain that securities markets emerging countries are often substantially manipulated by the government and that it is a market more political than economic.
Unspoken premise seems to be that the securities markets advanced countries, runs a purely economic nature of the force and that he is predicting their performance is the same as predicting growth of the trees.
This description securities markets emerging countries is not the only non-partisan, for the same description also applies to securities markets in developed countries.
Analysts predict the best know that the performance of stock market any country in effect means that, as well, according to view the government has in the current political climate of investors in equities thrive.
Consider stock market of the United States, by far the largest in the world.
The general view is that the government is intervening between society and that returns on investment in the American stock market reflect fundamental forces a capitalist economy.
This is one reason why the US is a magnet for portfolio investors from around the world.
Returns, with whom they are American securities markets as attractive, but reflects the fragile political balances.
With over time and changes of political pressures, jumped above all tax rates affecting Securities.
For example, during World War II, reduce political support for the great wealth and the government sharply raised taxes on capital gains, dividends and high income at all.
When the second world war triggered massive recovery from economic crisis the 1930's, the President Roosevelt and Congress phrase added tax from excess profits to have proof that shareholders will not benefit too much.
By contrast, 1980, when the while, but stock market was weak, with American voters have decided on the Ronald Reagan, about which many thought that is the president too right-wing.
Asked for cuts in taxes on capital gains, dividends and income-and he was either.
Political interference on the stock market is not only of taxes on capital gains, dividends and income.
Taxes on assets, consumption tax, import tariffs and taxes, etc -- which are financing, directly or indirectly, corporations -- may have impact on profits of enterprises, and so on the stock market.
It is not accidental that whenever the securities markets thrive, the government to look to these tax break net profits of enterprises.
The policy of securities market at all ended with taxes.
On the contrary, in the profits of enterprises, and in the consequences, and on the stock market, has the effects of almost all of the government actions.
After the stock market collapse of 1929 US government block most antitrust activities, thereby firms to gain monopoly position, which were reinforced by their value.
This policy delayed recovery from the high unemployment, but even that target abated political forces support under the slogan of the stock market.
Similarly, one of the most important things on which work President Reagan was destroying the substantial parts of the power of trade unions, which compete for their share of pie corporate profits.
Reagan's victory over the strike of air in 1981 was the fault of events for both the US trade union movement, and for the stock market, which 1982 began their dramatic bull market.
The US government supported the stock market particularly aggressively from the moment Kulminace bubble stem price of shares in 2000, most notably repeated interest rate cuts.
Of course, that is publicly advocate in relation to encouraging the economy, not the support of the stock market.
But a telling sign of the importance of US stock market is that the falling prices stem stocks were deemed one of the most important factors economy.
The response of the authorities has reduced to monetary stimulus.
If national income and product us demonstrate that effective taxation profit enterprises (% profits really government through taxes) in the first quarter of 2000, when culminated with stock market and the economy in general -- jumped to 3%, while in the third quarter of 2003, when the market was in a downturn, fell to 2%.
Much of this decline reflects the direct tax rebates Odhlasované Congress and the widespread feeling among businesses that, under the current economic and political situation can be in maneuvering tax timid.
After the stock market was also sharply reduce the maximum tax on dividend increase of stocks, and from 35% to 15%, which brought a major advantage of the long-term investors and boost effect Reinvestic dividends after-tax.
Even in this case were tax cuts advocated with respect to stimulate the economy, which of course, but can be said about any measures aimed to support the stock market.
Whether a credible justification, but depends on the balance of political forces.
We can say that in the US has 200 years by the same variables, including opposition to the high taxes and weak trade unions movement -- and so it is expected to be employed in the future and that will ensure high returns on the stock market and a large inflows of foreign investment.
Those who believe that investment in US stock market to maintain strong growth trend for decades, they can have quite right.
People would have to be clear in what actually predicts.
In principle by not only the economy, but also policy, and even cultural values that shaped economic policy and economic performance.
Global Home
The houses are from the local investment, entrenched in some places such as trees, and therefore flourish or withered in response to local economic conditions.
On TV screens, we Mihotá around the world, but the market with our home, which is almost exclusively for local Amatéry, remains locked directly with us in the backyard.
This would, however, could soon change.
During the month, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in cooperation with our society Macromarkets and further Fiserv and standards *** poor "to introduce options and futures contracts on home prices in the ten cities of the United States.
The treaty will be based on the index of prices home with *** p/C, which have developed from the academic work that we almost 20 years ago before conducted I and my colleague Karl case.
For many years to promote the futures contract on housing, but no stock market has so far refused the index to the creation of the futures market to use.
Futures markets focused on the prices of home will allow investors around the world directly invest in home in the US, when through these markets to acquire stakes in them.
Investors in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo will be able to invest in home-populated their owners in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
The fundamental principle of financial theory -- "diversify" or "distribution of risks" -- suggests that the interests of the new contracts will be large.
The people and businesses in New York, for example, are too heavily exposed to their local real estate risk, so these risks should reduce the sale of futures contracts on the prices of the New York home.
People in Tokyo take some of their risks purchases of futures on home prices in New York, if properly set prices.
New Yorkers will continue to live in their home, but investment risks are distributed around the world.
The creation of a true futures market with a family house no one tried to since 1991, when his attempt to unfold such market in Britain failed the London Stock Exchange with futures and options LIFFE (now after the merger into the government).
Their attempt to never create greater trade turnover.
The Stock Exchange of organizing a cocktail, and no one will come.
British markets are betting on margins in the prices of home or online markets also never largely failed.
This time will it be otherwise?
Of course, to new markets is always uncertain thing: the people want to come to the cocktail, only if there will be more people; there is no, no one wants to come.
Similarly, in markets where not many investors, cannot be done enough deals that would ensure returns, which would attract investors.
Just as it is often the case for a cocktail, can be while a bit of a mystery, as the major new markets are in motion, but we know that now and then this happens.
The first indications show a growing interest in trade with the futures contract on home prices, above all, how strongly the importance of diversifying risks underscore debate on the "real estate bubble."
After the announcement by the CME one of its competitors, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said he planned to create a futures and options contracts for the main regions of the US, which are based on the median home price National Association of real estate offices.
But besides strong public interest in investment in housing and providing risks with the US, must be resolved even more important things to futures markets succeed, we must expose prices and investors must understand what these prices mean.
I think is quite likely that many of these futures markets will soon be predict substantial declines in prices in some major cities of the US next year.
Will the situation, which traders called "backwardation": futures prices in the market is now lower than the current house prices.
This may have to be the first day, when will the real estate futures trading, but it is quite likely that this comes within a few months.
On some of these markets backwardation we need to keep his office.
Everyone knows that in recent years many of these cities (as well as other parts of the world) is a huge real estate boom.
International investors are likely to invest in these cities if the expectations of a decline in prices on the futures market adapt to the people of Tokyo because of their own bitter experience well understood.
But if the level of backwardation sufficient, even investors who think that the US market with housing is heading to the downturn, will be able from futures on home prices expect decent gains because get reduced prices are already on the futures market.
It is nonetheless take to the people in New York aimed at ensuring their investment in real estate to the fact that they will sell futures contracts, price decline.
They will have to get used to the idea that the market already weakening expected, and that can protect just before the extent of the possible future falling prices, which is over these expectations.
To correct my thinking perhaps it comes to actually see future market prices.
So far was the future direction of a real estate merely a thing of the various views.
When the markets will create an international consensus on future home prices in cities around the world, we can better manage the risk that the city faces, and thus stabilise their economies -- and our own lives.
That report markets?
Stock markets in most of the world are roughly from 1 May, a growing decline; the main part of the collapse occurred during the period roughly to 2 May, but prices continue to fall in average.
Mean trouble on world stock markets trouble for the world economy?
Consider the strongest declines.
The index of major countries came to a collapse in India, where since May 1 to 2 May, falling stock prices by 1%.
The disaster on the other side of the planet was almost as large and the upper and lower highs since the level in India ones a day or by two: In Argentina stock prices fell by 1%, in Brazil by 1% and in Mexico by 1%.
European markets also suffered major losses.
In Sweden since May 9 to 2 May, stock prices falling by 1%; in almost identical period prices fell by 9% in Germany, about 9% in France and in the UK and about 9% in Italy.
Likewise, stock prices in Asia during the almost the same period fell from the highest in the lower value of 1% in Korea, about 9% in Hong Kong and by 8% in Japan.
Many commentators to combine these events with developments in the United States.
Prices of US stocks but fell sharply between May 9 and 2 May only 5%.
For the global downturn, it is neither China because of its stock prices, in fact, during this period increased.
The usual explanation economists revolves around the monetary policy.
As a result of the deflationary scared 2003 central banks around the world to lower interest rates, thereby fueling speculative boom as the market, stocks and on the real estate market.
But now, according to this view, are Hlodat rising interest rates, which does a further decline in asset prices.
These arguments certainly includes a point.
US Federal Reserve, on 10 may raise rates and its Chairman Ben Bernanke then suggested that in the future can there be another increase.
Further were 17 may be reported data on deterioration of US inflation, that there is further monetary tightening.
Economists welcomed the world is seen as a logical and intractable, which implies that understand what is happening.
This his approach but often exaggerate the role of the Central Bank.
Indeed, the US rate hike was only one in all -- is already the sixteenth.
Ever since in May declines in stock markets began, no other major central bank raise rates, until June 7, when did several banks (the European Central Bank and banks in India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).
Another factor is the price of oil, which since March 22 to 2 May by 24% and, in the time of the absolute record.
Clearly this was an important event that should credibly affect stock markets around the world.
The increase in oil prices were guilty of virtually all economic recession since World War II.
Yet the rise of oil prices in the appropriate interval, when in the mid-May, stock market index plummeting more.
If we are to argue that the increase in oil prices caused stock declines to be assumed coincidence of Prodlevu.
Stock markets but are not very logical and a delayed response to shocks oil prices could happen.
As for all other prices in financial markets is true that the increase are attention.
When oil prices rise sharply, people watch news about oil prices and on these prices we speak, triggering greater sensitivity on these reports.
Oil prices linked to the crisis in the Middle East and in May in the news dominated.
The increase in oil prices in the minds of investors probably still Umocnily ominous signs and a strong words of some political figures.
Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres 8 May in response to hostile statements of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that "the president of Iran should not forget that Iran may also be wiped off the map."
At the beginning of the May stock fall, Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority state, and on May 1 newspapers wrote that he is in the two leading universities in the country received from students Vestoje.
This report can be treated as evidence of that Ahmadinejad politically pays their game with fire in the nuclear question, which would reinforce the impression that the tense situation in the Middle East could result in even higher oil prices.
This report may seem much further from the stock market than monetary policy.
But the response to them, together with the recent increase in oil prices, can largely explain the change in market psychology.
Access to risk with over time and changing events as and Peresovy remarks may hasten such changes.
So even though these issues occurring in ways that can be difficult to try to quantify, analysts would probably in order to understand the direction of the world's stock market should words attention as carefully as the words.
Economists may be enthusiastic about that, should focus on public opinion on it to influence changes in price, on the world coverage and on speculative dynamism.
After all, of such an approach is that economic events are less predictable and economists (less) than to represent.
Such a focus but gives intuitively sense.
What actually have ideas investors?
Ahmadinejad is charismatic person; Bernanke not.
Ahmadinejad engaging in risky undertaking; Bernanke not.
And what is perhaps the most important, Ahmadinejad has a destabilizing influence; Bernanke not.
Indeed, whatever the primary cause of the global decline in stock prices from mid-May any, to the unstable market psychology are significant.
Can be hard to believe that the related only to those of the likely monetary policy and not serious and deeper issues, including energy and political tensions, on which the likely performance of the world economy.
Why is for Férovost?
Marks *** Spencer, a chain of supermarkets and shops clothing with 400 stores across Britain, recently announced that the Sortiment coffee and tea, their total 38 species, go to the Fairtrade, marketing symbol "ethical production."
In its 200 cafes café revive already chain sells only tea and coffee and the Fairtrade brand names.
They are also its sales and other goods from Fairtrade cotton.
The announcement came during the campaign "Fairtrade fortnight," promotion of fair trade products, which was part of trail farmers from developing countries, the British who related how Fairtrade helps their community.
The shift to ethical consumption is a significant increase in the United States, because consumers are increasingly turning to organic, - produced food and to egg from hens that are not held in a cage.
In the UK was survey found that half of those, who was a symbol of Fairtrade, this brand of known and know that as products, which provide a decent conditions for farmers, the third world.
A similar poll in the US there, but related data and discussions with our students suggest that number would be much lower.
Traders seeking Certifikaci Fairtrade manufacturers must pay $to cover the costs of sustainable production and will pay a living.
For example, the minimum price for coffee is $1 per pound, no matter how low can fall market prices.
If market prices has grown over this amount, the price of Fairtrade rise so that the hostage of five cents to pound up.
From small farmers, for their part, is to organize themselves into cooperatives or other groups, which enable democratic participation.
and manufacturing businesses can identify Fairtrade use if its workers providing decent wages, lives up Hygienické, security and environmental standards, allow unions or other forms of association, provided a good house if they did not live at home and use child or forced labour.
Not every Fairtrade approve.
Brink Lindsey, director of the pro-market research centers for trade policy in Institute, is convinced that coffee Fairtrade is "well-intentioned impasse."
To some extent rightly says that the real cause of the fall in prices of coffee was Ziskuchtivost multinational corporations, but the big increases in the production of coffee in Brazil and in Vietnam, along with new technology that allows for coffee and fostered by using less of the labour force, and thus less costly.
According to Lindseyova view, if we want to help coffee producers, we should be persuaded to switch from coffee to profitable crops -- and here for the obstacles, rightly calls to remove trade barriers and subsidies rich states -- or to turn to products with higher value, for example, special type of coffee, they bring higher prices.
But what makes the argument special is that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee and can be considered for the meeting of what he advocates -- telling farmers to produce special type of coffee, which deliver higher prices.
Market economists no reply when corporations to the promotion of their products blatantly use Snobskou appeal.
The people to pay 48 dollars a pound of coffee from Jamaican Blue Mountains, precisely because there has to James Bond, economists argue that this distorts the market.
So why is critical, when consumers choose to pay 12 dollars a pound of coffee, which they know that was the toxic chemicals, grow without dark under trees, which helped survive bird, and farmers, who is now can afford to feed their children and send them into schools?
Economists say that if you want someone to help with food and educating their children, you can for 10 dollars to buy coffee and without logo Fairtrade that not as good as completely, and take their tax cuts and spend two dollars to development agency, which provides food and education for poor children.
While this is possible to progress, but Fairtrade has its advantages.
Farmers know that they must provide products that have consumers like both to his taste, and for the manner in which a.
If their product sells well, can be proud of that made something of what is around the world interests.
In view of the farmers is better get compensation for the sale of Fairtrade products than charitable handouts, which would receive an even without work and regardless of the quality of what they produce.
under brand Fairtrade is no more "anti-market" than pay more for Gucci brand and this reflects better ethical priorities.
Fair trade is not state subsidies.
Its success depends on political lobbing, but to market demand.
In Europe, fortunately, this market demand is soaring.
One hopes that a similar level had been in the developed world and everywhere where people can decide on their freely considered expenditure.
Pigs Tele and American Democracy
In a flood headlines about the fact that control of the United States Congress in elections in November, the Democrats remained largely ignored a large election results.
While on the one hand, expose the weaknesses of the American political system, but also renewed my faith in Soucitnost ordinary Americans.
If citizens Arizona collect sufficient numbers of signing may lose a proposed law to vote in the direct popular vote.
One of this year's referendum concerns the law that would prohibit or closing the pregnant Prasnic or tele-raised for meat in such a way that animals from the loosely reversed, Lehnout, and it is Natáhnout limbs.
People who it a modern industrial agriculture many do not know may ask why is there such legislation needed.
Agricultural methods that even 50 years ago widely followed and in some countries are still common, but widely covered all animals enough space on the and stretching their limbs.
In the US but now roughly 90% of the Prasnic -- pigs by mothers and killed by the porcine meat, Bacon and -- spend most of life in a cage locked the size of an by about 0.5 2.2 meters.
Can they reversed, Lehnout to feet or do much more than one step forward or Dozadu.
Another Prasnice are behave in a string, which he also fought in.
Also Tele are shut in the life of individual that enables him to have reversed, Lehnout, or to Natáhnout limbs.
The point of the these methods is saving jobs -- makes it easy manipulation, animals and to run the station loyal thousands or tens of thousands of animals in the low number of workers and lower demands for their expertise.
In addition, from animals wasting energy in motion or mutual.
After protests agencies to protect animals, the European Commission a few years ago order for their scientific Commission report on these methods.
The commission found that animals suffer due to move freely and a total absence of any that during the day.
To the same conclusion would of course, to reach and common sense.
The EU after the report has set a date for which will mark conditions for these animals banned.
Date set by 1 January 2007 for Tele, is already almost there.
The Kóje for Prasnice that are already in the UK and Sweden, will be illegal to 2013 banned in the EU.
Gradually are also adopted measures to improve the conditions Nosnic, which are usually in these basic cages, where they are not enough room to Roztáhly wings.
In the US are not similar measures at national level in sight.
When me my European friends in the past asked why the United States on the living conditions animals so heavily lag behind in Europe, should not be to no answer.
After another pressing I must accept the explanation that the Americans on animal matter less than the Europeans.
And then in 2002 raised the protectors of animals to Florida to the vote the proposal, which is to forbid Prasnic in.
To the surprise of many for this proposal, 55% of the voting.
Also in last November's referendum in Arizona vote despite the well-paid opposition from the agro-business 62% of the voters to ban small cages for Prasnice and tele.
Florida and Arizona are not progressive states -- both have in 2004 over George W. Bush before John Kerry.
The results so strongly suggest that if get the chance to vote on the shores of the farming Prasnic and Tele so tiny cramped conditions all Americans, most of them would have voted against.
It seems that the Americans care about animal welfare as well as Europeans.
So if we want to explain the gap between Europe and the US on the conditions for agricultural animals, we should focus on the political system.
In Europe's voters about the welfare of animals effectively affecting members of the national parliaments, but also members of the European Parliament, the result of which were national laws and regulations of the EU, which in this concern to respond.
By contrast, in the US had such concern to members of Congress no visible effect.
The conditions the breeding of farm animals adjusted no federal legislation-and very little state legislation.
According to me this is due by agro-business can Desetimiliony dollars into the pockets of the congressional representatives seeking re-election.
The Movement for animal rights, despite broad public support has been able to survive in the political arena Lobbismu and subsidies to the election campaign.
In the US electoral politics have more money than the price of the views of the voters.
Party discipline is weak and congressmen, most of the money needed to re-election by themselves, and that is, moreover, in the case of members of the U.S. House of Representatives happening every two years.
In Europe, where a strong party discipline and campaign finance individual candidates, but the party, money plays smaller role.
In the US, a country that display their democratic traditions, are pigs and Tele hardly the only who loses.
What is happening in Afghanistan's new army?
The assassination of Afghan minister of air transport an outraged the (perhaps members of the Afghan interim administration) shows that the Afghan society remains deeply divided.
The first reform of the Afghan army that ambivalence even wider.
Defense Minister temporary Hamid Karzai's government has appointed a top officers of the new army.
The minister, General Mohammed Fahim, Tajiks from northern Panjsirského district, received a three month of the command of the forces of the Northern Alliance that conquer Kabul for the help of US bombers.
This appointment but Karzai's efforts to unite the country's overall.
Afghanistan is a multiethnic state, in which Pastuni accounting for two-fifths of the total population.
Hazárové Tajiks and the other two out of.
Thirty of the eight officers that Minister Fahim degree in general, is 30 seven Tajiks and Uzbeks is one of the remaining.
If, in the army summoned any from 15 to 17 million, will, under the virtually entirely of Tajiks.
Pastunstina is something from varies as well as to be from English and millions of have only basic knowledge.
Geographic character of the new army command is as close as his ethnic composition.
Thirty five of the Thirty eight senior officers come from a smaller area north from Kabul, and from Parwan province (in which a Bagramské airports) and from far Panjsirského Valley, which was for a long time the root of the Northern Alliance.
In other words, from the new army's elite was Vynecháno Twenty seven of the twenty nine Afghan provinces.
Such a closely-oriented group might prevent feel a clique, if was composed of representatives of at least twelve political parties of the country.
But this is not its case.
Eighteen of Thirty eight generals are members of the only party, Jean, Islamic factions, which for a long time led the mullah and former professor of theology Burhanuddin.
It is the party to rule soon in Kabul in the 1990s and caused the bloodshed and chaos in which as a result of most Afghans welcomed the Taliban.
Virtually the same number as a member of the Jamiat party are in the military leadership represented the communists.
Sestnáct of Thirty eight generals after a long time amongst the party whose activity in the late 1970s, have led to the Soviet invasion in 1979, which cost the lives of two and half a million Afghans.
Most Afghans now on the communists treated the same place goodwill as, for example, or Poles to Hitler's National Socialists.
It is true that Afghans, as well as others, had to join the Communist Party reasons and in no case to be that each of them was harshly by ideologues.
But between generals is six former party professionals, who served the side and after an end to the invasion of the Red Army.
All six of these men, and moreover, three other the communists, who served as officers of the Afghan army, actively cooperate in the 10-year Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
We can see how would probably respond to the French, for example, if a French officer corps after World War II, of complicity in the occupation of their country with the Wehrmacht.
After Afghanistan, innovations rapidly expand.
If so who did not happen, nationalists (which virtually all Afghans are) soon political awareness of the circle around general Fahima revealed.
But also the administrative incompetence and bias of high military command evidence unilateralism would could perhaps be partially reverse if new general into national armed forces and commitment to enhance the professionalism of the true patriotic values.
Unfortunately, only ten of Thirty eight commander has experience as a professional military officers.
September served as pilots.
By contrast, Twenty four of the total number of (professional experience of the remaining four generals are known) is coming of civilian life, in which worked in various professions, for example, as officials of the Communist Party, one of them then he has career Mullah.
What did these data for everyday practice mean?
Mean that commanders of the international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, as well as US military and diplomatic officials, will meet with Afghan deputy defence minister Abdul Dostumem, a notorious brutal and corrupt commander, communists, who maintains contacts with the old friends of the Red Army to continue serving in Moscow.
This means that the commanders of the Afghan armed forces, as well as a strategic commander and commander of military intelligence services are also the communists, people, their orientation is uncertain, the person who most Afghans trust.
This is really a group that war has divided Afghanistan together again together?
Will these dubious to generals to gain the confidence of the three-quarters of the Afghan population that was to top military command to approach?
Or it is rather the result of rampant approach to governance, which (sometimes in the future) will further bloody ethnic response those whose justified interests were now cynically Poslapány?
The United Nations, and American political leaders should consider these questions before with a predatory takeover of power and a popular Mensinou reconciled.
The Celebration of Iracionálna
Three cheers for new Nobel laureate in economics, Daniel Kahnemanovi at Princeton University and Vernon Smith of George Mason University in Virginie.
As for the Nobel prize is, the award are not only the recognition of the original work Kahnemana and Smith, but also belief schools, among the main leaders of both scientists whose belongs.
Psychologists Kahneman showed that individuals systematically act rationally, less than think orthodox economists.
Their research not only demonstrates that people tend to do otherwise than to predict the standard economic theory, but also that do it regularly, systematically and in ways that one can understand and interpret through alternative hypothesis, which compete with the assumption that operate orthodox economists.
Most market participants -- but also ordinary monitors -- came as nothing extraordinary.
from Wall Street, who sell the shares of which they knew that for anything, this is not Iracionalitu that Kahneman and Smith revealed routinely use and abuse.
Gold, which culminated in "Bublinovou" economy was in large part is based on the use of investor psychology.
This Iracionalita is nothing new or for economists.
John Maynard Keynes, no longer on the stock market, he wrote that are not based on rational individuals attempting to the discovery of the fundamental principles of markets, but that it is more a beauty contest in which those who can win the best guess what says jury.
This year's Nobel prize is, like last year (which I was one of the three Nobel) celebration simplistic criticism of the market economy.
Last year the emphasis on this, that different market participants have different (and) imperfect information and that these asymmetries of information has a profound impact on the functioning of the economy.
Last year's Nobel laureates they suggested that the markets are not effective in general and that they have an important role perform government.
Invisible hand founder of the political economy of Adam Smith, the idea that free markets are led to efficiency as an invisible hands -- is invisible at least partly because none at all.
For those who every day, work on the markets (and earn the mountains of money by using and to information asymmetry) is not that no news.
For more than 20 years, economists are for the "patterns of rational expectations," which assume that all market participants have the same (if not perfect) information and to act perfectly rationally that markets are perfectly effective that there is no unemployment (except in cases when it will cause Chtivé unions or government minimum wages) and credit rationing system.
That such models dominated, particularly at American universities, despite evidence of their Zkreslenosti, suggests a triumph of ideology of science.
Many graduates of these universities but unfortunately, are now in charge of policy and the economy in many countries of the world and build program based on the idea that over time, it says market fundamentalism.
To put it right: models of rational expectations are an important contribution to economic science; energy with which its advocates undertook in economic thinking, helped to expose the weaknesses of starting hypothesis.
Good science is aware of their limits, but the prophet of rational expectations typically is full of modesty.
Vernon Smith is the leading figures of the experimental economics, so the idea that in the laboratory environment needs to test a wide range can be a series of economic instantly dismissed.
One of the reasons why the economy is so tough discipline and why there are so many disagreements among economists is that economists cannot pursue controlled experiments.
Nature while directly abound in natural experiments, but in most cases had so many things are changing so fast that it is often very difficult to determine what caused what.
In principle the point is that, in the laboratory can be undertaken-attempts and to draw more reliable conclusions.
Critics Experimental Economics warned that the subjects comes into experimental situation way of thinking that are affected by the environment outside the experiment, and that attempts are not so clean and conclusions clearly as in natural sciences.
Economic experiments, however, be allowed to participate in the nature of many important processes and help improve the rules of procedure and, for example, an auction.
It is important that Iracionalita participants a market that was subject to Kahnemanova research, was in the context of the laboratory has repeatedly demonstrated.
The entertainment results reached experimental economy include findings about altruism and selfishness.
It seems (at least in experimental environment) that the trial subjects are not so selfish, as economists expect -- with the exception of a single group, the economists.
This is because the economy as scientific disciplines has attracted more individuals who are from the nature or selfish, because the economy is being formed and makes them selfish individuals?
The truth lies will almost certainly somewhere in the middle.
The question of the relative weight of these two hypothesis is likely to solve the only other experimental research.
The award of the Nobel prize in the two scientists is that it is important to study the people and the economy such, what are, and not such that we want to have.
Let us hope that when a better understanding on the human behavior, we can come up with such a policy, under which will work well and economy.
The Bush Energy Policy Fair
One of the meetings of this year's World Economic Forum in Davos as experts on the oil industry that melting the polar ice sheets, which occurs faster than anyone expected -- represents not only problem, but also an opportunity: can the lead to open its vast oil reserves.
As these experts also concede the fact that the United States signed the convention on marine law -- the International Convention, who has access to oil a day under the marine and mineral rights on other raw materials from the sea -- represents a risk of international conflict.
At the same time, these same experts point to light aspect: the oil industry may not in the search for other supplies please do Congress on the rights of the Zplundrovat Alaska.
President George W. Bush is a shadowy ability to see things in the wider framework.
With over the years, is still made it clear that their energy policy is many wrong.
That is so strong Rukopis oil industry, even Bush leaders of one previous bill declared that "forget no special interests."
Bush has been touted the merits of free market, but also all too readily pieces of the huge charity energy sector, although countries faced with the rapid increase in deficits.
In the energy market is failing, but government intervention should go precisely the opposite direction than what the Bush administration is proposing.
Given the fact that Americans pay full price for the pollution -- in the form of its enormous share in the making of greenhouse gases -- that is the result of their profligate energy consumption, the price of energy Podhodnocena, further keeps the excessive consumption.
It is vital that the government to protect nature, and intervention in the price system -- through taxes on energy -- represent the most effective means to achieve this.
Instead, Bush supported conservation, a policy of "first SAP America", thereby enhancing future US dependence on foreign oil.
Never mind him that the high demand driving oil prices up, which is the gift from heaven for many people in the Middle East who do not belong among the friends of America.
Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it seems that the Bush finally awakened to the reality of the growing US dependence; given the spike in oil prices could be difficult to see the consequences of.
steps his administration but also in this case almost certainly the situation in the immediate future only worsened.
In the protection of nature Bush still refuses to do anything and their continuing prayer to save US technology, has only very little money.
What, then to think about Bush's recently declared commitment to cut 25 years of independence of the United States on the Middle East oil by 75%?
For investors is the message clear: to invest more in the development of reserves in the Middle East, which are far from cheap source of oil in the world.
Without new investment in the development of Middle Eastern supplies and given the unbridled growth energy consumption in the US, China and elsewhere but demand ahead of supply.
And as if this was not less, the threats of sanctions against Iran carries the risk of interruption of supplies from one of the world's major producers.
At a time when the world oil production is close to maximum capacity and prices are already more than double compared to level before the war in Iraq, this portend further price increases and other increases profits of the oil industry -- a clear winner of the Middle East politics.
Of course, Bush cannot be denied, that is a problem finally recognize.
A close look at his proposal but as always reveals further trick of his administration.
In addition to acknowledge the seriousness of the global warming, support the conservation and devote sufficient resources for research to something really changed, means the Bush promises to reduce dependence on Middle East oil less than it seems.
From the Middle East, comes only 20% of oil used in the US, and so can be achieved its goal of a minor by shifting demand elsewhere.
People also might think that the Bush administration must understand the mechanisms of global trade with oil.
Even if that America was on the Middle East oil independent, cut the supply of the Middle East oil could have devastating effects on world prices -- and thus on the US economy.
As for the Bush administration's often, there is no explanation for the official strategy not flattering.
Bush is doing only policy and trying to Antiarabskému and feelings in America?
Or is this just another example of incompetence and tumult?
According to what we in the past five years have seen, contains the right answer is probably more than small amounts of honest and pure folly.
China's Road Map
China is preparing to accept its September and to prepare the way for the continuation of perhaps the remarkable economic transition in history and also improve the well being of almost a quarter of the world's population.
The world has experienced a steady growth; and even never been to such a reduction of poverty.
Part of a recipe for long-term success of China is almost a unique combination of pragmatism and vision.
While much of the rest of the developing world, which runs the Washington consensus, would lead to quixotic drive for higher GDP, China once again made it clear that it is a sustainable and fair, an increase in real living standards.
China knows that has entered a phase of economic growth that strains environmental huge -- and unsustainable -- claims.
If not to change course, it will eventually to the detriment of living standards.
That is why the new places great emphasis on the environment.
Even many backward parts of China's growth rate, which would better surprises were it not the fact that other parts of the country grow more rapidly.
Although the process of eliminating poverty, inequality is on the rise, given the growing differences between cities and rural areas and between coastal and inland regions.
This year's report on world development released World Bank explains why would I was preoccupies not only poverty and inequality and September five-year plan, China is the problem is in advance.
The government has several years of talk about a harmonious society and this is a ambitious plans to achieve this goal.
China is also aware that what the less developed countries share from developed countries, is not only the gap in resources, but the gap in knowledge.
be so bold plans not only on this gap, but also on the creation of separate bases for innovation.
China's role in the world and in the world economy is changing, and this also reflects the plan.
Its next growth will have to be more on domestic demand than the exports, which will require an increase in consumption.
Indeed, China has accustomed to the problem: the excessive savings.
People set aside in part because of lack of government social insurance programs. strengthen Social Security (retirement) and public health and education will reduce social inequality, to strengthen among citizens a sense of affluence and also support the current consumption.
If these measures will succeed -- and China has almost always overcome his own high expectations -- could exert great pressure on the global economic system, whose balance already compromise the large US fiscal and trade imbalances.
If China less save -- and if, as officials announced, has a diverse policy the reserves -- who will finance the US trade deficit of two billion dollars a day?
This is subject to sometimes sometimes, but must not be a distant sometimes.
With such a clear vision of the future will be the challenge of its implementation.
China is a great country and without large-scale decentralization could not succeed as it has succeeded so far.
But decentralization brings its own problems.
Greenhouse gases, for example, are global problems.
While America says that cannot afford to do anything in this matter, senior Chinese officials to act responsibly.
During the months since the adoption of a were to adopt new environmental taxes on cars, gasoline and products from timber: China to solve their own and the world's environmental problems using market mechanisms.
The pressures on the representatives of local governments to ensure economic growth and jobs, but will be immense.
They will find themselves for worse temptation argued that when we produce in a way that protects the planet, nor can America, as this, we cannot afford to us?
To his vision translated into actions, the Chinese government will need strong political programs, as, for example, are already established environmental taxes.
As China near a market economy, there are some deficiencies that in developed countries: interest groups that for the fine veils market ideology have self-serving arguments.
Some argue for the economy starve-the -- beast "wealth": for the poor, old growth will eventually benefit everyone.
Others are opposed to competition policy and strict laws in relation to the management firms: let us demonstrate their miracles Darwinian survival strong.
Growth will be the main arguments to counter a strong social and environmental policies: higher taxes on gas buried our fledgling auto industry.
Such allegedly produce growth policy would not only failed to ensure growth, but would threaten the vision of China's future.
There is the only way to avoid: open discussion of economic policy, designed to detect deceptive conclusions and open up room for creative solutions to many fundamental issues that China now faces.
George W. Bush has demonstrated the dangers of excessive secrecy and reducing the decision-making processes at the close of.
Most people outside China not entirely understates the extent to which its leaders, in contrast to Bush, taking in large parts of the considerations and broad consultation (and even the foreigners), in an attempt to solve the problems that lie before them.
The market economy are not.
Cannot be simply to leave the autopilot, especially if we want to share their benefits widely.
The management of a market economy is not an easy task.
This is an art and maintain a balance must be constantly to respond to economic change.
China's September a road map such responses.
This world is watching with surprises and hope, because the lives of 1.3 billion people remain transform.
Democratic Lesson from Tocqueville
It seems completely in place, that because of the Iraq war the world 200 years after the birth of Alexis de Tocqueville debating about the nature of democracy.
Tocqueville right Proslul by refused to reactionary nostalgia and as our fate as victory of democracy, but it warned of dangers that democracy means for freedom.
We should still share their concerns?
Tocqueville regarded democracy not only a political regime, but above all for intellectual regime that shape society in general practices, which it gives the sociological and psychological dimension.
Democratic regimes, he argued Tocqueville, determine our ideas, desire and passion.
As there is one of the Renaissance and in the twentieth century Homo Sovieticus people, "Democratic" is a form of human beings.
According to Tocqueville would systemic effects democracy citizens could lead to a loss of thinking.
They could only pretend that the events and values judged self-; in fact, would only copy gross and simplified views masses.
What Tocqueville calls by keeping their "social power" over the sentiment is really in democratic regimes perhaps the strongest -- its Outlook predicts growth in the current demagogy and media manipulation.
Tocqueville was convinced that this tendency has no virtual long-term limits.
The decline of critical thinking, which, it seems, democracy is it cannot prevent even local democracy or small companies, or government checks and balances or civil rights.
Schools have the ability to be little more than enclave protected from Leptavou force social influences affecting the mind.
Similarly, while the Tocqueville believed the effort to virtue à la ancient nations or from leaning toward religious faith can sometimes spirit let go, both coming into conflict with the democratic ideals, if it in public life officially decreed.
In this sense among Tocqueville school heir include theorists Frankfurt schools and Arendtová Hannah, who equally worried decay sense in modern societies.
French philosopher Marcel Gauchet even his recent book called democracy alone against each other.
The democratic way of life, says the author, tend to break an authentic thinking and suppressing "high" culture, so Poddává Tuctovosti, in which citizens as a result of susceptible to the enemies of democracy.
But while are histories of the bloody regime and meat, greater risk for democratic countries is that their citizens to withdraw to the apathy and short-term thinking aimed at gratification of momentary needs.
The past, despite the ritual, which seeks to remind the moments in history -- Zahlazována habits on what is now and what is new.
This tailspin and reportedly well educated ruling class.
The fundamental problem of the democratic sentiment is the lack of historical awareness.
Indeed the flaw in democracy, as Tocqueville argued, mean that the only-realistic, but sustainable-way, after that we can go is pessimism?
Think so.
There are ways to fight against what we might call the "democratic stupidity" of today.
The first defense is to promote educational system, which truly to shape the critical thinking, particularly through (in our time)'s neglected objects: literature, history and philosophy.
If there informed and critical civil base that democracy requires, our schools must stop pandering to the fashionable waves and start analytical ability of students.
The biggest obstacle to such education, mass media, with their tendency to pursue Plytkost and fun.
Many people now spent much of life before television than in the classroom.
Passivity, the mass media are growing, is just the opposite active engagement that democratic citizens need.
But it is difficult to imagine the mass media (other quality newspapers) from its own will become an instrument of education, which improve critical faculties citizens.
Concern over the mass media is not an elitist contempt popular culture.
The question is not in popularity by itself, after all Mozart was in its time popular and Shakespeare's game, like the poor and rich -- but in the reluctance of the mass culture and be questioned.
The upshot of this failure is universal indifference and passivity of its audience.
Global media culture, unable to inspire the art of critical thinking and waking up Povznesené city, has long been on the rise.
It is a culture that its neglect threatens democratic freedom, because it cannot create a sense of duty -- to society, to history to communities.
It is too late to do something about the culture that Umrtvuje soul?
Tocqueville, elite of his era, for their complacency in the face of force of democracy.
Will a short-sightedness, our leaders also as a force for a his worrying problem?
Europe for All
Serving members of the European Union today, it seems, questioned the future of the Union, but we in the Ukraine on the European Union are looking with hope and admiration.
To join the EU's development is the main goal of our foreign policy, because Ukraine revealed that statehood is not the ultimate goal, but the beginning.
European unity is indeed indivisible: If one nation ostracized, are all free.
We Europeans we's inevitable networks, into common Roucha fate.
The display all aspects of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, confirms.
Whatever touched one Europeans directly affected, others indirectly.
Never again we cannot afford to live with the idea of a narrow two Europe, half of the rich and poor, half of those inside and those abroad.
No one who lives in the European continent, can-and-must not be regarded as outsiders in the Union.
It is in fact depends today's spectacular Pax Europa and today's Europe-wide prosperity.
Of course, some people that Ukraine is not Europe.
However, arrived in Kiev, speaking to people, young and old, with factory workers, wife farmers with lawyers, doctors and teachers, who in the winter invariably stood for weeks in the great and the snow and continue to defend our freedom.
Perhaps a tie with those who stood alongside General de Gaulle in the French resistance?
Not agree with those who died in the 1930's in the fight for Spanish Republic who liberated Budapest in 1956 and in the 1970s to end fascism in Spain and Portugal?
Energy provides them the same spirit as Poland's solidarity and peace meat, which meant Prague Velvet Revolution in 1989?
This is the real European spirit and no doubts it crushed.
Those who say that Ukraine is for EU membership too underdeveloped, to answer, also arrived in my country, whether you see how mother that remain in work long into the night to their children learn to use computers that are in employment.
To come to a language school in each village and in any city, where young people for Europe and learn French, German and English.
Those who question the absence of the Ukraine should understand that Europe is not a question of technical equipment and Superdálnic; it is Neuhasitelnou desire for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.
I believe that our future is as hopeful, as is the Europe's noble, and that our fate is not be forgotten border calm the region, but sets and European peace-builders and European unity.
It does not mean self-isolation, as achieved national independence currently does not mean more than a return to the world stage with the new charter.
The new countries can with their former occupiers create productive relations as well as build France and Germany -- it is a relationship based on equality and mutual interests.
This is the relationship, what my government struggles with Russia, and his successful is the creation of what we can contribute to the enlargement of the European zone of peace.
Of course, it is premature to do more than just showing their great respect with which we look at the prospect of EU membership.
We know that our share of the greatest had created overnight.
We know that a great deal of the results of European unification is in the document and the declaration, but in innovative action scheduled so as to improve the lives and provide security for all Europeans.
A Ukraine worthy of EU membership will not be easy, cheap and quick.
But will be created and will, as the Union.
We realize that this is a huge task, but the reward for the hardship of States and Europe should know that this is our aim.
Part of efforts to revive the Ukraine is creative battle for an end to the terrifying century in which the domination of rval fascism and communism ideology, born in the heart of Europe.
A few months ago our children and their parents in cities across Ukraine was confronted by armed soldiers, dogs, and even death.
Before a few years ago was rent murderers of the former regime tortured and young journalists Heorhij Gongadze, which tried to the public informed about the corruption of the regime.
Our Orange Revolution of this year's winter shows that the Ukrainian people win.
So, despite today's doubts and difficulties in Europe is maintained sustained confidence.
Refused to accept despair as the ultimate response to the lack of clarity and of Ukraine's history.
Refused to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically tied to the communist heritage that can never see the dawn of peace and a real European unity.
When the citizens of the EU wanted over the place of Ukraine in Europe, should be carefully in the face, who see, and also to look deeper in the face.
They should look deeper than on this despoiled bare inherited from communism and on poverty and social differences, through which is the overthrow of former leaders wanted to extend its devastating governance.
Instead, should look in the face of our President Viktor Yushchenko, ruined during the election campaign, poison and recall words excellent André Malraux, the French for a "beautiful faces are those that have been wounded."
Muslim Civil War
It is now split between Sunnis and Shiites in the Middle East deeper than hostility between Israel and the Arabs?
Given the response of some Arab governments to Hezbollah's decision to attack Israel would be that people may think.
Although Israeli bombs capturing the city of Beirut and Tyre, Saudi Arabia, perhaps conservative Arab Muslim nation openly condemned the progress of the Shiite Hezbollah, which is a conflict with Israel.
Never in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict happened that the state, which is regarded as the leader of the Arab Muslim nations and openly supported Israel.
Saudi Arabia's split with Hezbollah, is not a simple issue.
Egypt and Jordan also directly condemned Hezbollah and its leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah for adventurism.
What lies behind this stunning developments?
We are seeing a fundamental shift in relations between the Arab nationalism and Islamic?
The government is Sunni Saudi Arabia and worried by the Shiite Islam in the greater extent than in what is genuinely committed to encouraging Arab unity, and the Palestinian cause?
Condemning Hezbollah Arabs suggests that sectarian divisions Muslims, who is there already in the daily violence in Iraq, in the Middle East and deepens.
The desire of US President George W. Bush's break Zamrzlé society the Arab world was meant as a modernizing forces stand against the key elements in the Arab and Islamic societies.
Instead, it seems that Bush sent from the chain forces in the region.
Opening the May began with a new and still an ugly era violence that may not be described otherwise than a "Muslim civil war."
The conflict between Shiites and Sunnis there since the dawn of Islam, but geographical and ethnic isolation Arab Shiite Iran along with the rule of the Sunni Arabs over the Shiite minority in most other countries to maintain this rivalry in reasonable bounds.
This tension further ebbed in the flow of "Islamization" caused by Iranian revolution, as sectarian Sunni Arab identity was immediately after it pushed further into the background and instead has emerged as a general "Islamic" Asertivita.
All this changed in September 2001, when Al-Qaeda, Sunni terrorist force that strongly recruits from Saudi Wahhabi ideology, take attacks on the United States.
On March suddenly has Specificky Sunni form of militant Islam.
When the United States launched a war as the Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan and the Sunni Iraqi regime, has given that this new radical Sunni a strain even more.
Sunni Arabs in the region, who identified the new self-, see Israel and the West as a mere one threat, while the other a so-called "Shiite" -- bands mainland spreading from Lebanon to Syria and Iraq to Iran and populated by allegedly heretical Shiites.
Saudi Arabia's rulers as instead of the Muslim faith in Mecca and Medin feel this threat perhaps sharply.
This Sunni eye Shia not only control the oil-rich region of Iran, Iraq and the eastern Saudi Arabia, but try to -- through the actions of Hezbollah -- usurp the role of the "protector" central dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian case.
Saudi Arabia's kingdom to turn its back on to Hezbollah because the Saudi royal family derived its legitimacy from the strict form of Sunni Islam and doubt the loyalty of their Shiite population.
Ironically, it is just the United States, longtime protectors of Saudi Arabia that allow the Shiites that toppled Saddam Hussein and brought Shiite parties in Iraq to power.
It seems that the Bush administration is aware of what has made; while the Shiite Oblouk east of the Arab Muslim world is the rise, the US seeks to strengthen its protection of the Sunni Oblouku -- Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia in the western part of the region.
Israel, the Druhdy implacable enemy Arab things like now to the defense structure Zapadl.
Such status but must be given the sensitivities of pan-bound unstable.
Nowadays, ordinary Saudis to television screens with broadcasting stations, and other Arab satellite networks and watch events in Gaza and southern Lebanon.
See how it unleashed Arab Shi'ite (not) blood and armed resistance put only Hezbollah.
In their eyes, and a Hezbollah heroic example of resistance.
In the Saudi state, as a result, deepening schism between Sunnis and Shiites.
After official condemnation of Hezbollah called on Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi clerics, to the kingdom of its official, Fatwu condemning members of Hezbollah, Shiite deviant and.
A similar conviction but can only escalate the sectarian divisions within the Saudi Arabia, and in the entire region.
To reach Sunni regimes as this antagonism to the belief that need own Hezbollah, which would fight in their corner ring?
If such a conclusion does, it may not look for long, because many such fighters has already been trained -- Al Káidou.
Georgia to the Heart of Europe
Era, when Europe can rely on the US-led war, ensuring peace and creating democracy in its own backyard is over.
Given the enlargement of the European Union this backyard, has shown how the recent crisis over Russia's gas, currently includes not only Ukraine, but Georgia.
Georgia, as Ukraine, a test of democracy that Europe cannot afford to ignore.
Georgia was the first post-Soviet countries, which carry out its "Barevnou revolution" and this demonstrated with dignity and maturity that its people, he chose democracy and European values.
Flags of the European Union, which has since then, on all Georgian public buildings, showing natural sympathy, as well as old as the country's history, which was for ancient river part and parcel of the then known world.
Prométheus, Médeia, Amazon and in neighboring Armenia Noemova Ark -- the Europe our myths are it is here.
For its history, culture and traditions -- including critical, independent, and defiant spirit within the former Soviet Union -- would appear that Georgia is the ideal candidate to democratization.
So it is the more worrying that there Troskotá democratization.
All seemed to rather not look promising.
With resistance met with political reform, privatisation, anti-corruption measures, to find new leaders of the Immaculate concessions to the last regime and implementing pro-European foreign policy.
Among leaders who would claim to represent the will of the majority, pockets more and more power, but again, the totalitarian approaches.
Georgia's political elite, similar Hydra, constantly dies, once again the turns.
The very same people and methods of governance, which "rose revolution" of November 2003 seeks to re-appear in the pockets of power, through their personal connections that go beyond the Georgian border, and its huge wealth and Vycizelovaného craft political conspiracies and manipulation.
This has much in common with the nature of democracy, which is based not only on the ballot box, but also on the division of power.
The government interfered with affairs of the parliament, which translate to intervene in decision-making government-in my case, for example, to nomination ambassador and their daily job responsibilities.
Finally, the most serious is that the judiciary is not yet an independent, which undermines the rule of law and thus discourage desperately needed private investment.
Georgia's democracy, the head, but not yet body: citizens continue to spurn policy as a moral squalor, so he left to those who long ago should go into retirement.
But in democracy remains strongly rooted in the Georgian people, civil organisations and in the media.
It is time to to Europe for ensuring that this hope Nevyhasne.
The US is already in Georgia since independence has done for promoting political stability, what can only.
Of course, Eduard Shevardnadze in governance, former secretary of state of the Soviet Union, which we as its president expelled, the stability not always equated with democracy.
But the Americans generous invest in the survival of democratic ideas and leaders.
Although backed by financier George Soros Foundation rose revolution Nevykonstruovala, they claim Russian nationalists, certainly the conditions that democracy requires, Foster, is to stimulate and help them.
If, however, help reinforce the Georgian democracy, the country now needs the support of the different nature, for which provision is better equipped with Europe.
Models of the balance of power, the functioning of the judiciary and local democracy must be inspired by European models that are Georgian reality closer than the Anglo-Saxon model American-style.
The rejection of the challenges posed by Europe would be a betrayal of all its fundamental duties in place -- small,, flexible, with recent historical traditions -- where democracy is much greater chance of success than in Ukraine, which is as formidable, and still-minded, a Central Asia not to mention.
Indeed, providing support for Georgian democracy that struggle with the popular support, would most likely postponed democratic progress in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia in itself.
This clearly raises the stakes.
Russia, while never give up its imperial dreams and tools of dominance, nevertheless, the evening's with the inevitability of democracy, at least after its fringes.
Hesitant acceptance of certain normality in relations with its neighbors but it was always vulnerable to sudden explosion celebrated Russian "irrational" -- aggressive ethos that glorifies the state and to promote its power on weakness.
Here is a key to understanding the recent Russia's gas crisis.
Less certain is that every sign of retreat from democracy in Georgia and other post-Soviet states will only further fuel neo-imperial ambitions of Russia.
It is a European responsibility to persuade Russia that a return to the past is hopelessly impossible.
Europe must assume its role not only to be in the future to ensure independence energy supplies, but also to show that European values of freedom, democracy and justice between nations have real power.
To succeed, Europe must be equipped with the necessary instruments: the foundations to the promotion of Europe and to support political reform, the university, where officials have trained future fledgling democracy, the police and army corps of judges and judicial officials, who breathe life into models that we want to follow.
Europe in particular needs of conviction.
If now, Europe cannot convince themselves that it has a vital interest in the future of their neighbors, who will in Europe believe tomorrow?
