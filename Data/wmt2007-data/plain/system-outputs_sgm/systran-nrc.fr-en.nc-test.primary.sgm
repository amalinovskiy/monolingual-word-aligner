<seg id=1>The divided racial House of Europe</seg>
<seg id=2>The extreme European right is characterized by racism and its use of the migration issue as a political discrepancy.</seg>
<seg id=3>Northern League in Italy, the Vlaams Blok in the Netherlands, supporters of the National Front of Le Pen in France, are all examples of parties or movements were on the theme's current aversion towards immigrants and promoting simplistic policies to control them.</seg>
<seg id=4>While people like Jorg Haidar, Jean-Marie Le Pen can go and (never rather early) come, racial question will not disappear from European policy in the near future.</seg>
<seg id=5>An aging population and increasingly open borders mean growing racial fragmentation in European countries.</seg>
<seg id=6>The dominant centrist parties of the left and the center-right faced this perspective in applying ostrich policy, hoping against all expectations that the problem disappears.</seg>
<seg id=7>It will not, as the racial history of America clearly shows.</seg>
<seg id=8>The racial relations in the US monopolized for decades - and always monopolizing -- the front of politics so racial cleavages occupy a place as important as the income, if not more, as determining factors in preferences and political attitudes.</seg>
<seg id=9>The first step to discuss the racial policy is to understanding the origin and consequences of racial animosity, even if that means the discovery of real unpleasant hearing.</seg>
<seg id=10>This is precisely the objectives mainly by research teams in economics, sociology, psychology and political science in the US.</seg>
<seg id=11>This research shows that the representatives of various races have less confidence with one another; the White are less prone to support the spending of social security, which they support the minorities; more fragmented communities racialement have less efficient governments, corruption and greater trading of benefits, higher rates of crime and less productive public goods per imposed dollar.</seg>
<seg id=12>This does not mean that we need to eliminate heterogeneity and creating communities racialement homogeneous, but we must recognize the reality of these problems to start to work out sound public policy regarding racial relations.</seg>
<seg id=13>Of course, Americans contest the methods to be used.</seg>
<seg id=14>Some vote from affirmative action plans which offer minorities preferences in the allocation of a job, admission to university and public contracts.</seg>
<seg id=15>These policies are seen as a means of providing compensation for the injustices of past and, more importantly, of creating models of role and overcome remaining and perhaps unwitting discrimination.</seg>
<seg id=16>Others protest affirmative action and support a policy that does not concern a race, together with the policies with the free market and family values pro-, is enough to create jobs for minorities and help not to separate the black families.</seg>
<seg id=17>The latter is crucial in any policy because one of the most important causes of poverty in the US is the spread of single parents (include unmarried mother) in black Community.</seg>
<seg id=18>Whatever the right answer, the issue here is the determination of the measures to be taken concerning race is a major problem in American politics.</seg>
<seg id=19>Of course, minorities progressed towards more integration and economic success.</seg>
<seg id=20>In the 1950's, blacks could not sit at the buses, now two of the main players of American foreign policy are blacks.</seg>
<seg id=21>To be sure, American politicians of right-wing continue to deploy the "racial map" as a tactical tool.</seg>
<seg id=22>Take the case of Patrick currency, former Deputy of Nixon and Reagan who presented itself as an independent presidential candidate during the last election.</seg>
<seg id=23>He recently published a book with success entitled "The Death of the West: how dying populations and can invasion imperil our country and civilization.</seg>
<seg id=24>But for every book like this, there are ten different which has a serious analysis of racial question in America.</seg>
<seg id=25>The analysis and the political debates on racial relations have considerable delays in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=26>At most, the question is closely examined in terms of immigration quotas and restrictions of borders, not in terms of opportunities and social problems created by increasingly mixed Europe racialement.</seg>
<seg id=27>Of course, a clear immigration policy is needed in order to prevent the accumulation of immigrants in an illegal situation.</seg>
<seg id=28>But it is not enough: controls borders in Mexico do not mean the end of the US policy on the internal problems of race!</seg>
<seg id=29>Europe is rich and its population ages quickly: the Europeans, reinforced by generous social security schemes, are no longer prepared to accept "dirty" jobs in, say, agriculture and industry leather.</seg>
<seg id=30>This attitude is inevitable increased immigration.</seg>
<seg id=31>Europeans but speedy to blame the US for the failure of its policy towards minorities and for all manifestations of racism across the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id=32>Reading the European press often reveals a superiority complex toward America on racial questions: they (Americans) have problems with racism; we are immune against him, except skinheads crazy - and their similar.</seg>
<seg id=33>What has happened in the past weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, shows that racial problem in Europe is deeper and, as in the US, has been the sad reality that relations racial are inherently difficult and that confidence and a cooperative conduct not travel of course the racial lines.</seg>
<seg id=34>If the mainstream parties of Europe do not start more seriously to understand the racial tensions that exist in their countries and to put race 'central to their priorities, people like Le Pen will always try to try to fill the gap with their message of hatred.</seg>
<seg id=35>French exception fighting</seg>
<seg id=36>The attention of Europe very turned today and the path to enlargement and the Constitution being negotiated between Member States.</seg>
<seg id=37>But the result of several Gallic ranks with the European Commission will be no less important to determine the fate of new enlarged Europe.</seg>
<seg id=38>France unilaterally chose to ignore the Stability and Growth Pact by letting run its public deficit over the 3% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=39>The French refer to the rational stringency of their thinking, but where budgets are concerned, Descartes is no longer appropriate and confusion is its membership.</seg>
<seg id=40>France were a major criticism of Ireland when, in 2000, the Irish Government has not reduce its budgetary surplus, which was to 4%, that is simply a 0.5%.</seg>
<seg id=41>Other countries did not respect the Stability Pact, but France is the first country to do with a small smile satisfied openly contemptuous.</seg>
<seg id=42>None of this should surprise.</seg>
<seg id=43>France merely apply to EU regulations its practice rooted well to see its own culture as an exception.</seg>
<seg id=44>Thus, France systematically oppose its veto any reform of the common agricultural policy of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=45>As everyone knows, the CAP is a very fine gift to European farm rich (particularly French farmers - who do not deserve it at all, at the expense of farmers in difficulty in the developing countries and European consumers.</seg>
<seg id=46>France is also trying to return to the old policies -- of private companies in deficit and about to collapse with great public money strengthening.</seg>
<seg id=47>The European Commissioner responsible for competition, Mario Monti, losing the battle: it needs the support of those who believe in the market and equal treatment for all.</seg>
<seg id=48>The history is simple.</seg>
<seg id=49>The French government plans to bail Alstom, a society that developed products high-tech, including the high speed trains, the train in French speed, but which recently is bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id=50>The French government proclaims that it will never abandon its rescue plan Alstom, a plan which has all the incentives usual exhibited: job, protection of investors, etc.</seg>
<seg id=51>Moreover, since Alstom is a high-technology society, the French Government is playing the research and development card, arguing that R & D investment is beneficial to growth.</seg>
<seg id=52>Sauver Alstom by nationalising the company is obviously a mistake.</seg>
<seg id=53>The company is formed different units, some good, others failed: clearly, it should be dismantled.</seg>
<seg id=54>The good units such as the TGV, will find easily purchasing; deficit units must be closed.</seg>
<seg id=55>The money of French taxpayers will be better spent on temporary cost of converting paid rather than to keep alive a society which is good.</seg>
<seg id=56>It is important that the Commission does not allow France cutting laws to measure for itself in policies on competition, as it appears to be doing with budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=57>The Commission should like condemn the public financing of private companies in France it condemns subsidies in any EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id=58>The Commission already have some success on this side, notably by forcing Germany to cancel government guarantees of public banks.</seg>
<seg id=59>Alstom including and France in general should no exception and must meet the same standards.</seg>
<seg id=60>If the Commission does not act, the European Union will look further at a playground for French officials.</seg>
<seg id=61>France has led the European Union's foreign policy with its Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin, who acts and is increasingly a Foreign Minister of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=62>At the same time, France is ignoring fundamental regulations of common economic policy and government aid for private companies.</seg>
<seg id=63>The European Commission will lose the little credibility that remains to eventually resembling a Paris district of less important?</seg>
<seg id=64>Losing on the question of Alstom would have serious repercussions in Europe and not just for policies on competition.</seg>
<seg id=65>For the oil war</seg>
<seg id=66>For decades, so much the Republicans, democrats pursue the same objectives in oil field: to maintain until making may the stability of oil prices, to carefully reduce domestic consumption, reducing dependency on imports and to diversify foreign sources of supply.</seg>
<seg id=67>Despite appearances, these goals are always the same today, under the Bush administration.</seg>
<seg id=68>Many observers believe that the invasion of Iraq, Bush chose another way.</seg>
<seg id=69>A significant increase in the Iraqi production probably increases oil dependency on us.</seg>
<seg id=70>The price of a barrel of oil may fall to find a new source of supply, from which increased dependence on the US, especially vis-à-vis the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=71>It is paradoxical that the US exercised more control Iraqi oil in program "food for oil" UN before the war - it was the UN and not Saddam Hussein who set the level of Iraqi exports) that they cannot do it in the context of a future democratic Iraqi state.</seg>
<seg id=72>If the Bush administration sought stable, safe, diverse and cheap tanker sources of supply was enough for him to lift the embargo against Libya, in Iran, Iraq, Sudan and to let run oil.</seg>
<seg id=73>But the interests of America for Iraqi oil is dictated by the economy or the energy policy.</seg>
<seg id=74>The Bush administration acknowledged that Iraqi oil is primarily a geopolitical acquis.</seg>
<seg id=75>Who controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq,.</seg>
<seg id=76>Saddam owed its ability to has controlled the second world oil reserves.</seg>
<seg id=77>It knew perfectly well what owed to black gold.</seg>
<seg id=78>Faced with the possibility of the invasion and defeat, he threatened to set fire to Iraq's oil fields.</seg>
<seg id=79>The confusion and the plundering of Iraqi oil installations and pipelines show that almost everyone understood that controlling oil is to control the country.</seg>
<seg id=80>In preparing the invasion by the US, the security of the oil fields was a priority.</seg>
<seg id=81>We did not an increase in supply or a fall in prices on the American market, but the overthrow of Saddam and its replacement by a new government.</seg>
<seg id=82>The future of Iraq is linked to oil production of the country.</seg>
<seg id=83>But given the vagaries of oil market, especially in such an unstable situation, we cannot see how the Bush administration can achieve its objectives in the years ahead.</seg>
<seg id=84>The problem is simple.</seg>
<seg id=85>The US must use the income from oil to reduce the costs of Iraqi regime change based on American taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id=86>In the long term, any reconstruction plan depends on the ability of Iraq to export large volumes of oil.</seg>
<seg id=87>If Iraq does not produce oil, President Bush cannot keep the promises it has made to the Iraqi people, the American people and to the international community.</seg>
<seg id=88>Before the invasion of Iraq had a productive capacity of three million barrels of oil per day.</seg>
<seg id=89>But it will not be able to return to that level of production in time to establish an Iraqi government.</seg>
<seg id=90>An increase in production requires the development of oil facilities, which requires great investment, a government in place and political stability.</seg>
<seg id=91>Nobody, not even the Bush administration, expect these conditions are soon.</seg>
<seg id=92>Political stability is the precondition to increase production capacity.</seg>
<seg id=93>The experience of Iran, of Kuwait, Russia and even of Iraq, shows that it is about three years of political stability before production capacity can rise and lasting.</seg>
<seg id=94>It will take several years for Iraq to build a new constitution, to establish a democratic government, to negotiate the distribution of oil revenue between different regions, to settle investment and make the economy more attractive to foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id=95>It will take too long to negotiate with the multinational oil companies and neighbors achieving the feasibility studies and technical studies needed, as well as reconstruction, rehabilitation and the exploration of its oil fields.</seg>
<seg id=96>Also, even a 3 years is optimistic because this assumes that Meanwhile the occupation stopped, Iraqis implement their own government and is stop political instability.</seg>
<seg id=97>But reality may be different.</seg>
<seg id=98>Important tensions can remain for years.</seg>
<seg id=99>And it would not be surprising that the production of Iraqi oil stops brutally, even with a democratic government.</seg>
<seg id=100>History shows that strikes and social unrest that can obscure the oil production happen more easily in a democratic context than under a dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id=101>If Iraq is unable to increase its oil production in the years ahead, it will be a thorn in football, both for foreign policy the energy policy of the US.</seg>
<seg id=102>How the latter can finance the reconstruction of Iraq in the long term?</seg>
<seg id=103>Who will pay for maintaining a fragile democracy in Iraq?</seg>
<seg id=104>Will the US can maintain their occupation without ensuring the food of the Iraqi people, the medical and other basic services?</seg>
<seg id=105>These are difficult issues, and we cannot answer them before a democratic regime controls and does not guarantee Iraqi oil production.</seg>
<seg id=106>Let murderers defend human rights</seg>
<seg id=107>If it were not so bad, it would be the grim joke the millennium: Libya was elected to chair the UN Commission on Human Rights!</seg>
<seg id=108>When caligula appointed its horse in the Senate, horse, at least, have blood on his shoes.</seg>
<seg id=109>Of course, the procedure was perfectly legal: the presidency changes every year a region of the world to another.</seg>
<seg id=110>This year, it was the turn of Africa to appoint the President and he appointed Libya.</seg>
<seg id=111>Only the United States and Canada voted against.</seg>
<seg id=112>With their endless shame, European countries refrained from.</seg>
<seg id=113>This says a lot about the moral bankruptcy of the UN that this decision is at this very sensitive point for this body.</seg>
<seg id=114>President Bush challenged the UN to express serious about their own mandatory decisions on Iraq: otherwise, they can have the same ignominious destiny as society of Nations, which was powerless in the 1930s when he was faced with the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.</seg>
<seg id=115>The election of Libya to chair an organization of UN charged to enforce human rights today hardly contributes to support the legitimacy or the moral authority of the world organization.</seg>
<seg id=116>Remember that Libya is a totalitarian tyranny; its leader Muammar Ghaddafi, combine behavior sometimes change with policies extremists by supporting dictators around the world.</seg>
<seg id=117>It leads one of the most tyrannical regimes in the world, in which there is no evidence of election and where the contrary opinions are repressed instantly.</seg>
<seg id=118>Under his rule, Libya supported terrorist organisations around the world, from go further the many Palestinian extremist groups.</seg>
<seg id=119>It still faces the UN sanctions for the role it played in the attack on a flight halted am above turn, in Scotland, ten years ago.</seg>
<seg id=120>Over the past decade, the position of the United Nations as a symbol of the ideals of peaceful world community was consistently undermined.</seg>
<seg id=121>They were entirely unable to stop the war in the Balkans; in at least one case, Srebrenica, Dutch forces of the United Nations peacekeeping stayed and witnessed the worst massacre in post-war Europe by the Bosnian Serbs massacred roughly from Muslims without defense.</seg>
<seg id=122>A Dutch inquiry committee later admitted that the Dutch battalion the UN was, indeed, complicit in this war crime.</seg>
<seg id=123>In Rwanda, when genocide began, the representative of the UN for peacekeeping ordered the evacuation of the United Nations forces in the country, leaving the path to the bloodiest genocide since the second world war.</seg>
<seg id=124>The name of the Representative of the UN, Kofi Annan.</seg>
<seg id=125>It is a depressing and pathetic past that the UN, probably trying in vain to buy while appearing in the Iraq crisis, such as international legitimacy and voice of reason.</seg>
<seg id=126>But at a time when the UN inspections in Iraq resemble the sending of the Salvation Army to remove a gang of bandits, it may be that the election of Libya to the head of the Commission on Human Rights is a historic date, in the final failure of a body whose creation raised huge hopes.</seg>
<seg id=127>The organizations do not usually die, and certainly there is too much state reason not to ensure that the UN will continue obstacle.</seg>
<seg id=128>But they will be a mere shadow of what they should and could be.</seg>
<seg id=129>The UN's today give hypocrisy a bad reputation.</seg>
<seg id=130>Supporters of the authority are</seg>
<seg id=131>Last Thursday, the judges of the central court in Jakarta in Indonesia condemned me a year in prison.</seg>
<seg id=132>I am guilty in my capacity as editor of the weekly tempo newsmagazine, according to the Court, for libel toward tomy winata, a magnate business, to have meant his possible involvement in a fire in the market for textiles of Southeast Asia's Jakarta and have an riots by broadcasting lies.</seg>
<seg id=133>Does my and similar cases, again predict the end of a short democratic experiment in Indonesia?</seg>
<seg id=134>The "rioting." I authored is produced in March last year, when nearly 200 rogue claiming itself of winata the agencies pace attacked, threatening to set fire to building, pressing staff and injuring a journalist.</seg>
<seg id=135>To try to resolve the peaceful situation of way I was persuaded to go to negotiate at central police service in Jakarta and it discovered, horrified that leaders this clique it had seized power at the police station.</seg>
<seg id=136>I was struck awls and football while the police allowed.</seg>
<seg id=137>Fortunately, many journalists come to our help with service voyage and cameras to register such events.</seg>
<seg id=138>The spread of these images began public outrage and forced Parliament to open a public inquiry.</seg>
<seg id=139>Those responsible for national police and police in Jakarta were called and, because of strong pressure from public opinion, the leaders of this clique were charged.</seg>
<seg id=140>Yet winata itself escaped the survey from police by stating simply publicly that its supporters acted without informing and without its agreement.</seg>
<seg id=141>It brought complain itself later, against Ahmad taufik, the author of the article, teuku iskandar Ali, editor and me.</seg>
<seg id=142>The hearings of the trial that lasted a year was marked by a series of suspect developments all support for winata.</seg>
<seg id=143>First, the issue assembled by police and the prosecutor contained clearly falsified documents so that the police charged two officers.</seg>
<seg id=144>But the Court refused our application of suspension of the hearings until clarifying the legality of the issue of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id=145>The case against involved officers seems not to nowhere.</seg>
<seg id=146>On the contrary, one of them was promoted at the new anti-terrorist unit in Jakarta which has just been created (and is financed by the US).</seg>
<seg id=147>The other is, they say, back at the police academy to receive a specialist training.</seg>
<seg id=148>Then, after six months of hearings, the main judge's panel of three judges was suddenly promoted to lead municipal Court Jakarta at a time.</seg>
<seg id=149>One of my lawyers notice in 35 years of practice to court, he had never seen a judge main being replaced along the affair.</seg>
<seg id=150>Indeed, despite his promotion, the judge continued to chair another case in the same building.</seg>
<seg id=151>A judge who in the past had has against tempo during the collective at law provided through winata replaced it.</seg>
<seg id=152>Finally, winata, during his testimony, presented a false witness while denying being interviewed by tempo.</seg>
<seg id=153>A registration of telephone call was broadcast during the hearings, the journalist who conducted maintenance and both writers who have witnessed that testified testified, telephone produced official documents attesting to this phone call as evidence of its existence, and experts demonstrated that the voice of registration was that of tomy winata.</seg>
<seg id=154>But the judges rejected's request tempo asking's arrest winata to be tried for false witness and advised us to complain to the police, something that we have.</seg>
<seg id=155>The judges then refused our application of postponement of the decisions of the Court until the matter of false witness of Mr. winata is judged.</seg>
<seg id=156>Given all these shortcomings in form, my conviction and my prison sentence is hardly surprising.</seg>
<seg id=157>But I am very hopeful out to win when the call tempo is brought before higher authorities.</seg>
<seg id=158>The higher courts Indonesians are more law-abiding ethics and the head of the Supreme Court is a defender of democracy and freedom of expression. business of tempo could well become a milestone in our democracy, like the famous decision by the US Supreme Court in the case of New York Times against Sullivan.</seg>
<seg id=159>While raising the tolerance in charges against libel, this decision allowed American press to demand accountability to the leaders of public affairs.</seg>
<seg id=160>No country knows better than Indonesia that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are tested indicators of democratic development and that of the journalists is one of the first symptoms of authoritarianism.</seg>
<seg id=161>Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the 1950s, before gagging the press by President Sukarno, helped by the military junta in 1956.</seg>
<seg id=162>Criticism having been stifled, consolidation of power without against power was easy and, in July 1959, Sukarno could issue the early "enlightened democracy.</seg>
<seg id=163>In the first few years after the fall of Sukarno in 1966, all the benefits of a real democracy, including freedom of the press, were restored (except the Communists).</seg>
<seg id=164>But the regime of President Suharto also embarked on gagging the press in the early 1970's, by suspending various newspapers and imprisoning many journalists.</seg>
<seg id=165>The down press, other political rights were quickly ridiculed and democracy Indonesian disappeared again.</seg>
<seg id=166>Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the first democratic Muslim community of history.</seg>
<seg id=167>Free elections, just and peaceful were held twice for the election of Parliament and the direct election of the President, including the last presidential elections, showing the possible coexistence between Islam and democracy.</seg>
<seg id=168>The enemies of democracy but never rest.</seg>
<seg id=169>Islamic extremists embarked on bombings without distinction, while groups with marked authoritarian tendencies made a breakthrough in circles near President Megawati.</seg>
<seg id=170>But Mrs Megawati has just lost the recent presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id=171>Will Susilo, the newly elected President, continue to persecute journalists?</seg>
<seg id=172>My conviction, the trials and condemnations of other journalists, will mark the beginning of the end of the third democracy Indonesian won so hard?</seg>
<seg id=173>The answer lies in the support that democratic activists Indonesians may generate drive and internationally.</seg>
<seg id=174>Losing Indonesia, potential torch of hope of all democratic activists in world Muslim community, would be a terrible defeat.</seg>
<seg id=175>The moral of capital punishment</seg>
<seg id=176>One often blame the US their refusal to abolish the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=177>Many people to claim today that the abolition of capital punishment is essential to establish a civilized system of criminal law.</seg>
<seg id=178>The Nobel Gary Becker is not of this opinion.</seg>
<seg id=179>European governments are resolutely opposed to the death penalty -- the EU bans it fully, and some Europeans see its use in the US concerns barbarism.</seg>
<seg id=180>Indeed, many European intellectuals think capital punishment, and any penalty in general, does not deter the criminals.</seg>
<seg id=181>But as Europeans, with rates crime far lower than those in the US during the last century, could long provide "smoothness" for most crimes, he saw their crime rate increase in a brutal way over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=182>On the contrary, the American rates fell partly through increased use of penalty.</seg>
<seg id=183>Capital punishment in fact part.</seg>
<seg id=184>I am to implement some people charged with murder because, and for that reason alone I believe that prevents other killings.</seg>
<seg id=185>If I were not believe, I am opposed to the death penalty, for revenge and other possible incentives should not be a basis for a public policy.</seg>
<seg id=186>Serious empirical research on capital punishment in the US started with a study of Isaac Ehrlich, published in 1975 in American economic review.</seg>
<seg id=187>Some studies that followed sometimes discovered a deterrent effect much weaker, others effect stronger.</seg>
<seg id=188>Yet available information is limited, so it is appropriate to base its findings merely on econometric evidence.</seg>
<seg id=189>Clearly, the public policy punishment cannot expect perfect evidence.</seg>
<seg id=190>But even with limited quantitative evidence that one has the good reasons for accepting the deterrent power of capital punishment is enough.</seg>
<seg id=191>Most people, and the murderers in particular, are afraid of death, especially when it follows quickly and almost inexorably the repeatable a murder.</seg>
<seg id=192>As called David Hume on suicide, "no man has rejected life until it has been worth it to live.</seg>
<seg id=193>This is our natural horror death... "Similarly, schopenhauer thought" when the horrors of life reach the point where they exceed the horrors of death, a man is the end of his life.</seg>
<seg id=194>But terrors of death oppose considerable resistance... "</seg>
<seg id=195>Opponents of the death penalty often claim that the state has no right, morally, to take the lives of anyone, even if the most reprehensible murderer.</seg>
<seg id=196>But this is quite the wrong conclusion that thinks that the death penalty is deterrent.</seg>
<seg id=197>To see why, suppose that for every suspected conducted, (Instead, let us say, to be sentenced to life imprisonment) the number of killing is cut to three, which is a figure far lower than Ehrlich and than other estimates of the effect of deterrence.</seg>
<seg id=198>This means that for every suspected not yet achieved, three innocent victims will die.</seg>
<seg id=199>Indeed, the government "to" many lives indirectly if it did not use the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=200>To save three innocent lives for everyone led seems a very attractive market, or even two lives saved by execution is a cost / benefit ratio persuasive for the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=201>It should be agreed that the thesis for the death penalty is less distinct when the number of lives saved with every execution falls.</seg>
<seg id=202>But even if one lives were saved with every execution, the market can still be desirable if the saved life is far better than the suppressed life, which is usually the case.</seg>
<seg id=203>Many protests to the idea to compare qualities of saved lives and that is removed.</seg>
<seg id=204>But I do not see how to avoid this comparison.</seg>
<seg id=205>Take the case of a criminal of career stealing and killing a victim out correct life and leaves many children and a partner behind it.</seg>
<seg id=206>Suppose that it is possible to save the life of an innocent victim carrying out a criminal of this type.</seg>
<seg id=207>It seems obvious to me that to save the lives of such a victim must carry more weight than to the lives of criminal.</seg>
<seg id=208>Of course every case is also clear, but a comparison of qualities of individual lives must be part of any sensible social policy.</seg>
<seg id=209>That is also why the death penalty should only be used for murder and not for less serious crimes.</seg>
<seg id=210>When it comes to choosing the lives and, for example, to reduce the stolen from private property, the thesis of more lenient punishment is more powerful.</seg>
<seg id=211>Although serious aggression, including some terrible rapes, approach sometimes murder in their seriousness, might call the death penalty, I am not for its use in such cases.</seg>
<seg id=212>One of the main arguments to hold the death penalty to murder is "marginal deterrence."</seg>
<seg id=213>If the aggression was punished with the death penalty, that would push the aggressors to kill their victims not being discovered (which is a major reason for the severity of punishment is proportionate to the seriousness of the crimes).</seg>
<seg id=214>One of the complications may yet that a murderer would fight with more offensive to avoid being captured, which could cause more deaths.</seg>
<seg id=215>But, although marginal deterrence is important, I believe the resistance of the murderers their capture, sometimes at the expense of their own lives, is actually an indirect evidence that criminals fear the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=216>Naturally, the risk to achieve the innocent worries me.</seg>
<seg id=217>I support the death penalty would weaken much if the execution rate innocent people were as important as much claims.</seg>
<seg id=218>However, I believe the appeals in the US offer enormous protection, not so much against unfair condemnation than against unfair executions, which means that there is very little, if at all, such people led from which it is proven that they were innocent.</seg>
<seg id=219>And this was immensely consolidated by the development of identification by DNA.</seg>
<seg id=220>I say again that the debate on the death penalty is a debate on the ability of deterrence (which can be reduced by too long calls).</seg>
<seg id=221>I understand that some remain sceptical ahead of the existing evidence, although I think they are wrong about this as on the question of common sense of the problem.</seg>
<seg id=222>It is very disturbing to take the lives of someone, even that of a murderer, but sometimes the very unpleasant acts are needed to prevent even worse behavior causing the deaths of innocent victims.</seg>
<seg id=223>Putin against people</seg>
<seg id=224>I helped the choice of Vladimir Putin to succeed the first democratically elected President, Boris Yeltsin.</seg>
<seg id=225>Since structures such KGB and mafia direct Russia today and manipulate the judiciary is allowed Yeltsin wanted to choose its own successor to avoid prosecution.</seg>
<seg id=226>But we, who chose Putin, were responsible for finding a successor willing to continue the reforms started by Yeltsin, not someone who would protect them, he and his family.</seg>
<seg id=227>Yeltsin was not afraid of nothing, not about its own survival, but the survival of democratic idea has introduced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=228>This idea is endangered by the successor we chose to him.</seg>
<seg id=229>I do not wish to deny responsibility for my support Putin.</seg>
<seg id=230>We were not close friend, but he and I worked together in critical situations, and I never doubted his sincerity.</seg>
<seg id=231>Putin is according to its convictions.</seg>
<seg id=232>The problem is that its convictions, including the belief that Russia can flourish only if it is led by one source of power, are wrong.</seg>
<seg id=233>And this important mistaken is leading Russia to its political ruin.</seg>
<seg id=234>Obviously, no one can hold a post with high responsibility without serious even fundamental mistakes, and this is especially true when times are disrupted.</seg>
<seg id=235>Yeltsin was no exception, but he admitted his mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=236>When it took on 31 December 1999, he asked for forgiveness have started the war in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id=237>Putin, by contrast, seems incapable recognize and admit mistakes, and continues to a policy long after its failure becomes clear to the entire world.</seg>
<seg id=238>One of the mistakes of Yeltsin was its failure to put moral priorities at the head of its reform agenda.</seg>
<seg id=239>Russia should have repentance of Stalinism and the system of gulags.</seg>
<seg id=240>The entire nation, without exception, should have repentance, as the Germans did since 1945.</seg>
<seg id=241>This failure matters, because it allowed the unconditional faith of Putin in central authority leads to new capture of State by the security services.</seg>
<seg id=242>Indeed, one of the direct consequences of national repentance should have been that is all of the Communist Party and the disqualification of any political post of those working for the KGB.</seg>
<seg id=243>Even if such political who are not mere in post-communist societies, where victims and collaborators were so many, and the border between two sometimes the so blurred a viable solution could be found, as in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id=244>The choice doing nothing left Russia's security structures unscathed and able to make their return on politics, at which they arrived today.</seg>
<seg id=245>The political resurrection of the structures of the KGB, Putin, and their efforts to silenced, has again transformed Russia into a country's defectors.</seg>
<seg id=246>It is impossible to silenced the independent politicians and media without stifling the financial sources, which is why the Kremlin, Putin has concentrated its attacks on the so-called ‘ oligarchs. "</seg>
<seg id=247>The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his trial were orchestrated for that very reason.</seg>
<seg id=248>Removing independent financial sources and the security services that dominate the Kremlin hoped to destroy the independent politics in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=249>Without independent foundations of thought is a climate of fear that is.</seg>
<seg id=250>But fear is not only degrading, does not help control.</seg>
<seg id=251>Yeltsin had intuitively understand that fear and centralized and downward decision-making cannot be the way to run a modern country, and he was therefore insisted reforming the relationship between citizens and the state.</seg>
<seg id=252>Putin still does not understand that a centralized political system is also unable to grasp and correct the mistakes today as it was during the Soviet era.</seg>
<seg id=253>For lack of sound education, Putin is quite really make Russia to same disintegration that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet state.</seg>
<seg id=254>The people begin to do it.</seg>
<seg id=255>He notes that the desire for Putin to create a strong and effective modern state cannot be made because a modern state is not controlled above, but by informed citizens who force their leaders to recognize and correct its mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=256>Putin, too, seems to suspect the powerlessness of his regime.</seg>
<seg id=257>This is one of the reasons that led Russia so aggressive with its neighbours, the Ukraine and Georgia, and which lead to maintaining a military presence in places like Transdneistria, secessionist regions of Moldova.</seg>
<seg id=258>It is essential in areas close to Russia, the Kremlin thinks it can persuade the Russians of his omnipotence.</seg>
<seg id=259>Since the debate in Russia are châtrés and that the Kremlin is able to manipulate the election, a regime change is the only solution that we can maintain that the democracy.</seg>
<seg id=260>It is pointless to cling to illusions.</seg>
<seg id=261>Those who oppose Putin must decide what they want and say that if the regime fail to enforce the Constitution, they have the right to force there by any means.</seg>
<seg id=262>Today, the question of power in Russia cannot decide longer at the polls.</seg>
<seg id=263>As in Ukraine, Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan, it will decide in the street.</seg>
<seg id=264>Impose and spend (please)</seg>
<seg id=265>Excessive taxation can blunting the incentives and block growth.</seg>
<seg id=266>But insufficient tax may also produce the same effects.</seg>
<seg id=267>Governments with a scarce tax revenue can provide the essential public goods.</seg>
<seg id=268>Worse, low tax revenue in poor countries often result inherent flaws in the system of tax fundraising (instead of low tax rates) which also encourage it not productivity.</seg>
<seg id=269>India illustrates the importance of a fiscal system designed good.</seg>
<seg id=270>In Bangalore, companies of high-tech built campuses of international class guns with workable disobeying and star communications networks of data.</seg>
<seg id=271>Out of these campuses, however, extend from open sewers, not taken refuse and roads in a state of advanced languish.</seg>
<seg id=272>While the technological companies leave instantly terabytes of data to distant continents, local transport progress with an almost medieval pace.</seg>
<seg id=273>Therefore, companies with Bangalore exploit their own services bus, sub-contract with private providers have drinking water, and install power to protect themselves from the power cuts.</seg>
<seg id=274>The state cannot cope this disaster because it is bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id=275>The debt of the Government of India exceeds 70% of GDP so that more than half of its tax revenue is spent on repayment of interests.</seg>
<seg id=276>But the debt is not the excessive spending in the past.</seg>
<seg id=277>The spending of the Government of India represents around 15% of GNP, with an average of around 40% of the GDP of the OECD.</seg>
<seg id=278>The financial problems of India rather have been a tax system designed evil and mismanaged.</seg>
<seg id=279>The rates and the rules for income taxes of individuals and businesses seem reasonable in view of the international standards.</seg>
<seg id=280>Nevertheless, the Government of India sees income taxes accounting for only about 3.7% of GDP, or around half of those in South Korea and other Asian Tigers.</seg>
<seg id=281>Agriculture in India is about a quarter of GNP, but even the rich farmers do not pay taxes.</seg>
<seg id=282>Exporting companies in the software industry and other industries are given a temporary tax relief on their profits, while their employees pay their personal income taxes.</seg>
<seg id=283>Despite reasonable rates, tax evasion is currency.</seg>
<seg id=284>Fraud is explained by the fact that the government has not invest in staff or systems to discover the intractable taxpayers, who rarely go to prison, who can often out of business by pouring bribes when they are caught.</seg>
<seg id=285>More subtly again the evasion of "direct" taxes on income and benefits reflect the disorder inherent in the system of "indirect" tax on production and consumption.</seg>
<seg id=286>The taxes represent more than 60% of indirect taxes from India, which is in turn the same proportion of its total tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id=287>The excise basic set at 16% of the value of the production of a society.</seg>
<seg id=288>Then different cuts, exemptions and supplements follow.</seg>
<seg id=289>For example, a "rate right to preferential conditions" 8% are taken on categories such as food, the Games, over cotton and computers.</seg>
<seg id=290>A "excise special" additional 8% are taken on products which include polyester filaments, cars and conditioners nanoparticles.</seg>
<seg id=291>A "excise additional" (not to be confused with the "special excise") are taken on "products of special importance.</seg>
<seg id=292>The exemptions from taxes are many and complex including business with total annual incomes below 10 million gained and companies located in some troubled or backward areas.</seg>
<seg id=293>In general, exemptions are divided into 70 categories, themselves divided into 259 entries, 52 conditions and 7 lists, each containing many things.</seg>
<seg id=294>Exemptions incite the abuses.</seg>
<seg id=295>For a certain amount, officials located at the bottom of the hierarchy, which shows in exemplary discretion in implementing conditions, can be urged to give favorable interpretations.</seg>
<seg id=296>The products placed on high rates (for example, polite stones) are sold as products imposed onless rates (for example, like unpolished stones).</seg>
<seg id=297>Fraud in the taxes is more contagious than tax evasion on profits and incomes.</seg>
<seg id=298>If a company fraud, taxes and that the tax rate is higher than the profit before taxes in industry, its competitors must also cheat just to survive.</seg>
<seg id=299>While fraud is, governments take additional "or" special "rights" which incite greater fraud.</seg>
<seg id=300>Perceptions of direct taxes also suffer.</seg>
<seg id=301>The bribe paid to tax collector's taxes for a favorable classification, the difference between the value of polite and unpolished stones, and the omission of registration of real income create "black" funds that cannot be said about forms of income declaration.</seg>
<seg id=302>Besides weakening the power of the State for essential goods, public systems to escape indirect taxes also discourage companies adopting more productive technologies which requires technology involving a deployment large-scale.</seg>
<seg id=303>But as indirect taxes can be more easily abused by deploying several small units instead of one great unity, it is impossible to economies of scale.</seg>
<seg id=304>It is important to note that in the software industry, where all units are exempted from indirect taxes, Indian companies operate on an efficient scale.</seg>
<seg id=305>India could imitate the example of China, in which harmonisation of indirect taxes in 1994 prepared the ground for a great boom?</seg>
<seg id=306>Or are the governments of the coalition in a vigorous democracy incapable of such reform?</seg>
<seg id=307>The last year, the government led by the BJP India's enacted legislation enabling of the significant reduction in budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=308>Then appointed a working party to make the necessary changes to give the policies public spending and to fiscal policies.</seg>
<seg id=309>Last July, the working group proposed to raise taxes (rather than to reduce spending) removing most exemptions of indirect taxes, among other things.</seg>
<seg id=310>The new government led by the Congress of India also appears to support these proposals.</seg>
<seg id=311>If the Congress and the opposition parties follow, they will help it to sustain economic growth of the country and to dispel the idea that democracies cannot take the necessary measures to promote development.</seg>
<seg id=312>That is the problem with Turkey?</seg>
<seg id=313>16 December, Orhan Pamuk, one of the most famous Turkish writers, a court in Istanbul it will face must answer the charge of "insulting the national identity" being accused for an open discussion on genocide by Turks of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916.</seg>
<seg id=314>Faces Pamuk three years in prison.</seg>
<seg id=315>The efforts of Turkey for fines and prison on those who run over the official framework convince me that I was right to disagree with the negotiations on accession to the EU.</seg>
<seg id=316>In December 1999, the European Council gave Turkey the status candidate country of the EU, which meant that Turkey would use the Union has not yet set future date.</seg>
<seg id=317>The Council asked the European Commission to decide before October 2004 if Turkey meets the political criteria for membership, which include democracy, the rule of law and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg id=318>The decision was one of the last catches by the Commission, Romano Prodi, of which I was a member.</seg>
<seg id=319>Among its 30 members, 29 said that Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the criteria to continue.</seg>
<seg id=320>I was the only dissident.</seg>
<seg id=321>It is the report even with Turkey, prepared by Günter Verheugen, then responsible for enlargement of the EU, who justified my decision.</seg>
<seg id=322>This report mentioned that in 2003, some 21.870 Turks sought asylum from the EU, including 2.127 were accepted.</seg>
<seg id=323>In other words, the EU governments themselves recognized in 2003 that the Turkish government had persecuted over 2,000 of its own citizens.</seg>
<seg id=324>In the meantime, the Commission published a report on the progress on Turkey believing that the reforms pursued, although at slower pace, under government with suitable Islamic direction of Recep Tayyip Erdogan Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id=325>This report has nevertheless about serious doubts: the human rights violations, including the practice of torture, continued; military influence preserved too scale; free speech was not universally observed; religious minorities outright women and cultural were discriminated against and to violence against women did not meet a sufficiently strong opposition.</seg>
<seg id=326>The situation has not changed much since the discussions about accession started in October.</seg>
<seg id=327>Beyond the persecution Pamuk is the victim, the unacceptable behavior abound.</seg>
<seg id=328>In March 2005, the police strongly intervened in a demonstration celebrate International Women's Day.</seg>
<seg id=329>In May, the greatest teaching trade union was banned for supporting the education of 14 million Kurds in Turkey in their own language.</seg>
<seg id=330>It is undeniable that intolerance reached until the heights of the Turkish Government.</seg>
<seg id=331>The Abdullah Gul foreign minister recently cancelled in a brutal way a press conference in Copenhagen when it located a Kurdish journalist in public that the Danes refused to leave.</seg>
<seg id=332>Such acts and such attitudes largely justify my disapproval of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id=333>But even if these shortcomings were corrected, Turkey should not be admitted to the EU, because it is not a European country.</seg>
<seg id=334>Christianity, feudality, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, democracy and industrialization has made us Europeans that we are, but they have not done Turks what they are.</seg>
<seg id=335>So I am not convinced that reform in Turkey, implemented due to the insistence of the European Commission, will be continued after accession.</seg>
<seg id=336>I even suspect as there would be duplication.</seg>
<seg id=337>Moreover, the Turkish accession would probably lead to the Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and perhaps of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.</seg>
<seg id=338>In the first three countries are certainly more European than Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=339>Leaving aside the three Caucasus republics but by including the successor states to Yugoslavia, this would give an EU of some 35 Members.</seg>
<seg id=340>What kind of Union would this be?</seg>
<seg id=341>The EU is not merely a club of friends.</seg>
<seg id=342>It is based on the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.</seg>
<seg id=343>The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties of the Union, must protect these four fundamental freedoms, which means that it must sometimes persuade, and if necessary to force the Member States to change their legislation.</seg>
<seg id=344>Policies concerning alcohol in Sweden, Volkswagen law Germany and discriminated against funds of foreign investment in France are examples of cases that made the Commission unpopular.</seg>
<seg id=345>But they were necessary.</seg>
<seg id=346>When I left the Commission, I was back me a pile of 1,500 observations of irregularities in this style.</seg>
<seg id=347>In short, EU membership implies the acceptance of incisive measures which profoundly affect the internal affairs of a state.</seg>
<seg id=348>That is not possible with such disparate members.</seg>
<seg id=349>The EU would fall victim of what the historian Paul Kennedy calls "imperial surextension."</seg>
<seg id=350>It would be diluted in unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=351>For this reason former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing feared that Turkish membership would lead to the end of the EU, and so the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said "Turkish accession would be more than the EU could not support it."</seg>
<seg id=352>But the strongest reason to oppose the Turkish accession is a question of democracy: most of the population of the EU does not want it simply.</seg>
<seg id=353>Bolivia's crisis, failure of Latin America</seg>
<seg id=354>Bolivia is a typical country of Latin America, far from it.</seg>
<seg id=355>And if they were not the Haiti unrest, it would be the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere is more stable than Haiti as shows its history and its two hundred coups since independence.</seg>
<seg id=356>In a region with indigenous past extremely at dispersed and isolated present, Bolivia is perhaps in Guatemala, the only Latin American country where indigenous peoples represent the majority of the population.</seg>
<seg id=357>Its topography and its ethnic distribution generate forces separatists and even secessionist that threaten national unity of how much more provocative that elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id=358>It is, of course, with Paraguay, the only country of all private subcontinent of access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id=359>Thus, it would be undesirable to extrapolate the crisis currently Bolivia through to the rest of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=360>General would be too simplistic; elsewhere, the institutions are much stronger, poverty, especially poverty, was reduced and the struggles of ownership of natural resources were usually settled.</seg>
<seg id=361>Even in countries like Venezuela, which possesses huge oil reserves, which are equipped with a nationalist government to traditional spirit, the status quo continue enabled the preservation of foreign investment for almost eight years of government of President Hugo Chávez.</seg>
<seg id=362>Although the existence of indigenous movement is a reality in many countries, since Chiapas until the "araucania," the Amazon until ayacucho, they never asked any real threat in national integrity in any country in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=363>Thus, Bolivia did not see a prescient crisis, nor eternal "the theory of the" indeed, where Lyndon jonhson and Che guevarra believed both in the case of Bolivia, does not seem valid or even partially reasonable.</seg>
<seg id=364>But the current crisis in Bolivia accuses the "democratic deficit" which afflicts Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=365>The elected leaders are failure for some reason in Bolivia, Ecuador and Haiti.</seg>
<seg id=366>Democracy is failing or absent in Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua and feels threatened pure some reason in Venezuela and in Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=367>None of these cases like the other and they have all different degrees of danger, destruction and reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id=368>The question is what can be done with this fact, who contrasts hard to encouraging prospects which prevailed until in recent years.</seg>
<seg id=369>At the last meeting of the Organization of American States held very lauderdale, in Florida, the United States delegation borrowed a good idea provided by others and simply passed it because of its support.</seg>
<seg id=370>History began two years ago when Dante caputo Argentina, former foreign minister, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) were responsible for preparing a report on democracy in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=371>Their conclusions indicated that an early-warning system of democratic crises in the region would help generate some actions before any loss of control, such as Bolivia today.</seg>
<seg id=372>Mr caputo and team of provided then had convinced Chile's President Ricardo Lagos, to take the initiative and promoting it with some of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id=373>What happened the initiative does not go very far.</seg>
<seg id=374>Indeed, the UNDP report on democracy in Latin America, published in 2004, barely mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=375>The US and the new Secretary-General of the OAS, José Miguel Insulza, boost it at the meeting of the OAS in Florida, but it was killed by reasonable fears of Latin American persuaded that it action against Venezuela, combined with anachronistic fears of Latin American on violations of the sacrosanct principle of nonintervention.</seg>
<seg id=376>Despite the impossibility for the continent of agreeing in principle, the idea of an early-warning system deserves to be studied.</seg>
<seg id=377>Today, Latin American Community probably has little opportunity for intervention on Bolivia's situation, yet it is dangerous to everyone.</seg>
<seg id=378>Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and the growers of coca leaf, may be an honest democratic leader, somewhat unwise, but its supporters are all away authoritarian will?</seg>
<seg id=379>Perhaps Hugo Chavez not finance Mr Morales and other Bolivia dissidents but Venezuela and Cuba aren't tempted to meddle in the affairs of this country where Che guevarra died in leading the guerrillas almost 40 years ago?</seg>
<seg id=380>Will the Community business of Santa Cruz in Bolivia may not follow its threats of secession, but prefer to share oil and natural gas reserves of their region with indigenous peoples of Highlands rather than Brazilian manufacturers of São Paulo?</seg>
<seg id=381>Before the events do not reach extremes, it may be good if the OAS (and not the US) interfere themselves.</seg>
<seg id=382>The region continues to need this participation, in terms of time, message and appropriate democratic platform, as distinct from traditional American intervention and the usual indifference of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=383>Decline in France?</seg>
<seg id=384>The French are notoriously sensitive, not to say on the defensive, about the scale of France abroad.</seg>
<seg id=385>The French state puts a lot of money to the spread of language and culture French, but the French are painfully aware that global position of their country is no longer what it was.</seg>
<seg id=386>In this context, not surprisingly, only in the last presidential election, the publication of a report from the Commission stating that economic standing of France among European countries had passed from 3</seg>
<seg id=387>OECD and Eurostat, European body to unite these data, it has to stop this aspect of the debate by showing that France, Germany, Italy, and Britain presented all of the same living standards per capita.</seg>
<seg id=388>But the controversy over a wider scale not disappear for that.</seg>
<seg id=389>Rumors worry about "French decline" made their resurgence in the steps of protest has this year against pension reform, growing differences on fiscal policy with the European Commission and bickering with America on the Iraq War.</seg>
<seg id=390>The nonfictionalized work who wins a great success in France today is a controversial written by Nicholas Cohen, France who fall.</seg>
<seg id=391>The book will dribble is full of counts of de Gaulle and Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id=392>According to the author, recent achievements of France get back to the 1970s, to express the TGV, and Airbus.</seg>
<seg id=393>He criticizes Mitterrand and Chirac severely combined with a "common talent to win elections and make France losing.</seg>
<seg id=394>The success of the book is in itself a sign of "malaise.</seg>
<seg id=395>But of what kind?</seg>
<seg id=396>The evidence of including given by Cohen is not as convincing as he wants to believe it.</seg>
<seg id=397>For example, he quotes the depletion of industrial jobs as the most obvious evidence of the decline in France.</seg>
<seg id=398>But activities is real common to all advanced countries.</seg>
<seg id=399>Indeed, France has indeed better than most of its close competitor rich and, unlike in Germany, the UK and the US, has maintained the same world market share in the industrial sector that is held at the beginning of the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id=400>Moreover, according to a specific measure of competitiveness and foreign investment, France achieved excellent results in these areas.</seg>
<seg id=401>According to a recent report published by economic Council analysis, direct investment in France increased to 60 billion in 2001, almost twice as much as Germany.</seg>
<seg id=402>The French competitiveness of costs also improved (20%) in the last three decades, higher productivity offset the rapid growth of wages.</seg>
<seg id=403>But the heart of the economic problems in the long run in France is in fear of losing the industrial jobs.</seg>
<seg id=404>France remains a strong industrial power in traditional sectors such as the car and aerospace but lagging behind in innovative markets in which smaller companies broadcasting new technologies.</seg>
<seg id=405>France, for example, invests only 30 billion dollars per year in research and development in high technology, against 51 billion dollars for Germany, 98 billion dollars for Japan and 265 billion dollars for the US.</seg>
<seg id=406>In short, the analysis of will dribble share in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id=407>France has several important reforms over the last two decades: financial economic liberalization and the elimination of exchange and price controls, the late restrictions of credit, European liberalization, reducing inflation and trade deficits, the advent of the euro and forced globalization firms' of the country.</seg>
<seg id=408>French malaise was certainly not induced by these reforms.</seg>
<seg id=409>The problem of France is that it has failed to recognize the new world of that already part.</seg>
<seg id=410>French capitalism dead and France fails to accept its disappearance.</seg>
<seg id=411>France must be the only country in which a Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, felt compelled television to apologize having said that "the state is not the all-powerful.</seg>
<seg id=412>There are many reasons to explain the French schizophrenia, but the most important political game for 20 years concerns.</seg>
<seg id=413>Until 1981, France was clearly divided between right and left.</seg>
<seg id=414>During this period, Mitterand administrations and Chirac have blunted their ideological side to implement the difficult process of adaptation to Europe and globalization.</seg>
<seg id=415>A "treatment by electric shock" in Thatcher two decades ago could have forged a new political consciousness.</seg>
<seg id=416>But the slow and consensual passage of reform helped to French to live in a world and to believe in another.</seg>
<seg id=417>This fact largely explains the political upheaval exploded in the last presidential campaign, when the leader of the extreme right-wing Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round of the presidential elections before the first outgoing Minister Lionel Jospin.</seg>
<seg id=418>The rise of the extreme Left, which together 10% of the vote during the election campaign, also evident from this political failure.</seg>
<seg id=419>France needs a political revolution much more than an economic revolution in order to manage to accept reality, including the fact that "French decline" is fear created by French people.</seg>
<seg id=420>The value of the European Values</seg>
<seg id=421>European leaders continued the constitutional discussions which had ended last December after a dispute on voting rights.</seg>
<seg id=422>This debate must clearly lead to compromises, which could not delay.</seg>
<seg id=423>Yet to understand clearly that are the intended objectives of the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=424>Two fundamental principles underpinned European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=425>These two principles are held with cross of philosophy, politics, economics, "and right.</seg>
<seg id=426>For years, they were part of the legal and institutional framework of the EU, in the Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which quotes them the preamble) and in the recent draft for the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=427>In short, they are written in the history and the ideals of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=428>But what is the real significance of these two principles?</seg>
<seg id=429>Consider the solidarity which at least lends itself to both interpretations: the static solidarity, which only concerns the distribution of income and wealth, the broader concept of dynamic solidarity, which concerns the production of income and wealth.</seg>
<seg id=430>In post-war history of European integration, dynamic solidarity strongly appeared for the first time, the European Coal and Steel Community, both in its economic development strategy (reconstruction - that in the Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome.</seg>
<seg id=431>That does not mean that dynamic solidarity was removed subsequently: the European Monetary Union, for example, expressed this principle perfectly.</seg>
<seg id=432>So, although some countries did not immediately enjoy the euro, they nevertheless accepted because they were convinced that the positive effects in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=433>In other words, dynamic solidarity means to promote policies that promote investment, innovation, economic growth and employment.</seg>
<seg id=434>But, as the growth of GDP in the EU States, dynamic solidarity was rocked over the past decade.</seg>
<seg id=435>The discrepancy between the research and development is a particular concern.</seg>
<seg id=436>Implementation of the so-called Lisbon strategy of the EU, adopted in 2000 with the promise to create the most competitive economy in the world, is threatened by the growing importance attached to static solidarity, which is reflected in the high costs of social security and the high taxes needed to finance.</seg>
<seg id=437>The primacy of static solidarity is due to an aging population that, together with a slow growth, caused structural fiscal imbalances.</seg>
<seg id=438>One of the greatest challenges facing becoming of the EU is treating the current dominance of static solidarity, directed towards the elderly, at the cost of dynamic solidarity, which supports the young.</seg>
<seg id=439>After all, the Union cannot continues current consumption to win over the investment needed to future prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=440>Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in what its interpretation is also twice: vertical subsidiarity and horizontal subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=441>Vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of powers between the various levels of government and sovereignty: the EU, the national States, the regions and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id=442>The most famous application of this principle is the federalism.</seg>
<seg id=443>The European Treaties express this vertical subsidiarity clearly.</seg>
<seg id=444>But is it enough to include the institutional and constitutional groundworks emerging from the Union?</seg>
<seg id=445>Horizontal subsidiarity concerns accountability and freedom of humans as on social and economic powers.</seg>
<seg id=446>It encompasses the relationship between the state, society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=447>But the company and the market have their rights and their own sovereignty which are not granted by the state.</seg>
<seg id=448>Emerges then the following problem: how to ensure the autonomy of each Kingdom?</seg>
<seg id=449>Examples of this include the horizontal subsidiarity the internal European market, which created a new type of economic freedom and increased competition between companies by eliminating protection that national governments for them.</seg>
<seg id=450>Horizontal subsidiarity means in society and the economic sphere, the state cannot violate freedom and the many record, which must be complied with the highest possible level.</seg>
<seg id=451>It also means that a "higher power" must support it whenever freedom and several short-term are not enough to meet the necessary to human dignity.</seg>
<seg id=452>This support must be provided by methods that promote natural potential of individuals, society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=453>But this is only possible if the role of horizontal subsidiarity is made clear, that was not the case in the European Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights or the work of the European Convention.</seg>
<seg id=454>In short, Solidarity involves redistribution now rather than growth (so the current generation expressed solidarity with future generations) While subsidiarity concerns the distribution of political power rather than a careful definition of borders between state, civil society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=455>Today, these two values defined so as to support the state.</seg>
<seg id=456>Indeed, the emphasis on growth oriented market was often identify with the semi-presidentialism foreign values of America.</seg>
<seg id=457>But these values are deeply rooted in Europe and they must be displaced again.</seg>
<seg id=458>The EU must restore its economic vitality by pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity more balanced for the market and society, which would reduce the socio-economic influence of state.</seg>
<seg id=459>Public institutions must produce public goods (such as security, justice and fiscal and monetary policy), society must offer social goods (like culture, education and assistance in needy) and the market must produce economic goods (related profits, growth and jobs).</seg>
<seg id=460>In the 21st century, Europe must review the value of these two principles (solidarity and subsidiarity) if we are to achieve the historic objective of integration: freedom and welfare needed to defeat the political differences and divisions which led to tragedies during the 20th century.</seg>
<seg id=461>It is in that spirit must be developed the European Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=462>The politics of the values</seg>
<seg id=463>The debate about American elections still weakened.</seg>
<seg id=464>How President George W. Bush could get three million votes more Senator John Kerry, and, moreover, to be offered a Republican majority in both houses of congress?</seg>
<seg id=465>There is little on answers, but two topics are recurring in many explanations.</seg>
<seg id=466>One of these themes is due to its personality.</seg>
<seg id=467>Our age an uncertain and threat, citizens placed their trust in President they knew rather than in a candidate having no trusted yet.</seg>
<seg id=468>The second is that of values.</seg>
<seg id=469>Citizens voted for a set of values rather than for specific policies.</seg>
<seg id=470>Indeed, some (said - are in line with the policies of Kerry but gave voice to Bush because they felt "at ease" with all its attitude.</seg>
<seg id=471>It is clear that the US is now deeply divided into electoral terms.</seg>
<seg id=472>An ark of blue States (Democratic) in the north, east and west extends around a huge red area (Republican) in Central and South.</seg>
<seg id=473>Beyond geographical division, divisions reproduce at the local level.</seg>
<seg id=474>The gerrymandering, the practice of retraçage of electoral borders for one political party to the detriment of another, is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id=475>Voters tend to shift in places where most people share their values, which they republican or democratic.</seg>
<seg id=476>What are these values exactly?</seg>
<seg id=477>Indeed the values deal, so we are told, "of God, of weapons and gay.</seg>
<seg id=478>Religion plays a role, especially the real specific to the Bible on history of creation.</seg>
<seg id=479>Possession of a weapon is the ultimate test of individualism and use of weapons in times of war has nothing odious.</seg>
<seg id=480>The gay and other practical "Modern" are rejected, laws.</seg>
<seg id=481>As the political economist Andrew involved in computer hacking said recently, "the candidacy of Bush was built to form a majority giving 60 million voters the chance to feel well for themselves.</seg>
<seg id=482>Everything or are are an American phenomenon other trends elsewhere?</seg>
<seg id=483>One of the responses wants as a US phenomenon, the politics of values can command a majority well today but in no way general.</seg>
<seg id=484>Europe and other parts of the world are divided similarly.</seg>
<seg id=485>The person is certainly, under the clear political differences also questions of values that have not yet been clarified.</seg>
<seg id=486>However, the traditional political differences based on dispute about basic values play an increasingly important in the elections.</seg>
<seg id=487>Prime Minister Tony Blair, for example, another leader facing an election in his country, this sort of personality and talk about policies, but are primarily a set of values of middle class.</seg>
<seg id=488>When he talks of "modernization" or "to enter the twenty-first century", he manages to suggest a strange mixture but attractive change and stability.</seg>
<seg id=489>That leaves the conservative opposition without effective response.</seg>
<seg id=490>Even the question of tax cuts and asylum tighter fail to fly on the control of different of values than the Republican Party managed to hear in the US.</seg>
<seg id=491>The situation is the same in Germany, where the obvious influence of politics of values is even less.</seg>
<seg id=492>The debate, in Germany, is still in its majority political debate.</seg>
<seg id=493>When opposition offers the government to negotiate the reform of social protection or, more recently, the fight against unemployment, underlying challenge is not posed in terms of values but rather of expertise.</seg>
<seg id=494>But under the traditional battlefield of English or German political debate, or elsewhere in Europe, the clashes of values threaten.</seg>
<seg id=495>The parties fighting for those who can "feel at home in their own", but perhaps they do not understand, although this is only partly a question of politics.</seg>
<seg id=496>Religion will never be an important factor in European politics: the opinion polls show that religious practice remains one of the few major differences between Americans and Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=497>Weapons also occupy a different place in European minds: it is their absence which Europeans see as important.</seg>
<seg id=498>Europe was without a doubt a current of pacifist values.</seg>
<seg id=499>And the question of political correctness ("gay") also plays a part less so far in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=500>Above all, Europe itself divides Europeans, because the "national question" is present in all European States.</seg>
<seg id=501>It is a question of values inspired by fear.</seg>
<seg id=502>Citizens want to know where they stand and in the process, are turned against the US and to Europe or against Europe and to their own countries.</seg>
<seg id=503>In any case, we then leave the realm of policies and even of politics and into the marshlands field of symbols and myths.</seg>
<seg id=504>What, however, is the main danger that democracies face, because the politics of values is a dangerous development.</seg>
<seg id=505>It reintroduces fundamental divisions of a society whose more democratic success was precisely to banish the fundamentalism of politics.</seg>
<seg id=506>An enlightened public debate should be a discussion on the policies contained in a Community of values.</seg>
<seg id=507>It is therefore important to stress this objective of the policy of freedom.</seg>
<seg id=508>The advent of the interest</seg>
<seg id=509>One swallow does not make spring and one month of normal growth in employment and prices rising in the United States does not mean that the Federal Reserve is no longer afraid a malaise and a economic deflation.</seg>
<seg id=510>But the time will come when world interest rates will begin to increase as central bankers prepared to resist the wave of rising inflation.</seg>
<seg id=511>When that time comes, whether this autumn, in 2005 or 2006, or in 2007, America and the world economy faces financial vulnerabilities that will reflect the last three years successful monetary stimulation halting the decline in production and by moderating unemployment.</seg>
<seg id=512>Short-term interest rates are surprisingly low: only 2% in the eurozone, just 1% in the US and zero in Japan.</seg>
<seg id=513>The expansionary monetary policy has been a success, but only after brought interest rates to fund historical basic grades and have convinced investors who borrowing costs would remain existing levels of long.</seg>
<seg id=514>Monetary stimulus mainly caused to increase asset prices: this produces a benefit, a dividend or praise becomes more attractive, and thus far more valuable in financial terms, as interest rates are very low and should remain so.</seg>
<seg id=515>This explains the considerable differences between the current home prices in the US, ordinary shares in New York, London and Frankfurt, and obligations in the long run around the world and what should be a conventional way, its basic values.</seg>
<seg id=516>What will happen when central banks begin to raise their interest rates?</seg>
<seg id=517>In 1994, the rise in interest rates in the short term has led to increased interest rates on long-term (and lower prices of obligations in the long run) of at least double the provided for standard models.</seg>
<seg id=518>Interest rates in peripheral economies in developing further increased far more than the rates of the principal advanced industrial countries.</seg>
<seg id=519>The first danger for 2005 and the coming years, when global interest rates rise, as is highly likely, is another wave of financial crises in emerging markets.</seg>
<seg id=520>For countries like Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia, the record of the 1990s shows that interest rate variations can grow and capital flows to be reversed remarkably faster, whatever the degree of goodwill with representatives of the IMF and the analyses carried out by the large banks see the policies of a country.</seg>
<seg id=521>The changes in interest rates of emerging markets are currently abnormally low.</seg>
<seg id=522>Flows international currencies, inflow of capital into excluded us, are not yet at levels associated with a "irrational exuberance," but it is very likely that happens before interest rates are beginning to climb.</seg>
<seg id=523>This prospect is worrying because if there is a lesson of the 1990s is that no one should overestimate the stability of global financial flows.</seg>
<seg id=524>The second danger is the high values of credit in the main advanced industrial countries.</seg>
<seg id=525>The thinking prevailing within the Federal Reserve, which I fully agree with, argues that the revolution in information technology continues, that the potential output in the United States still grows very quickly and that the gap production is relatively large.</seg>
<seg id=526>This means that interest rates will certainly have to remain low for a relatively long time.</seg>
<seg id=527>Moreover, reliance on the Federal Reserve is large and the last vestiges of the premium for risk of inflation in the 1970s do not contain any interest rates.</seg>
<seg id=528>Therefore, even after the levels of production returned to their potential level, interest rates remain low according to the standards of the 1980s and 1990s.</seg>
<seg id=529>This is of course good news for those who hold assets such as obligations in the long run, of the actions and property.</seg>
<seg id=530>Indeed, the increased cost of credit in the long term was precisely to what the fall in interest rates aspired: to make real bond holders, particularly bosses, richer is after all a boost to spending.</seg>
<seg id=531>But the bad news is that even if interest rates are supposed to remain low for some time, they will remain too low indefinitely.</seg>
<seg id=532>The bottom line is that when interest rates go up, the values of credit fall.</seg>
<seg id=533>It is in these periods, particularly when the values of credit fall quickly and dramatically, we fully discover the degree of expertise of our central bankers in their main task: to reduce financial volatility and support economic stability.</seg>
<seg id=534>It is also during these periods we discover how people who have obligations in the long run, of property or actions hold them not because they believe that the current prices are interesting from the basic price, but because their prices increased in recent years.</seg>
<seg id=535>It is a crucial issue for political decision-making because the people who buy assets in the long run because prices seemed to increase indefinitely are also those who will sell once the trend seems to be reversed.</seg>
<seg id=536>Particularly the United States' trade deficit indicate a massive instability if the asset prices in the long run should fall substantially.</seg>
<seg id=537>Certainly the challenges that will arise for the decision-making economic policies of the world in coming years will differ from those with which they face since the collapse of illusion of NASDAQ.</seg>
<seg id=538>The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those from a fall in production and the threat of deflation.</seg>
<seg id=539>But, as we learned during the 1990s, that does not mean that the challenges ahead will be easier to solve.</seg>
<seg id=540>America's future opposite</seg>
<seg id=541>I recently found an interesting fact: American economists who deal with international finance and American by who deal with domestic economy have views on different -- indeed, opposed - on the possible consequences of the huge US deficit.</seg>
<seg id=542>Economists of international finance see a financial crisis possible, followed by a painful and perhaps prolonged recession in the US.</seg>
<seg id=543>The By who treat domestic economy in contrast not see a further drop in the value of the dollar as a crisis but as an opportunity to accelerate growth.</seg>
<seg id=544>The By who consider domestic economy usually see things like this: at some point in the future, foreign central banks are willing to continue their massive purchases security measures in dollars for the dollar.</seg>
<seg id=545>When they stop their programs purchase of dollar large-scale, the value of the dollar will fall and will strongly fall.</seg>
<seg id=546>And from this point of view, if the value of the dollar declining, American exports will become more attractive to foreign markets and American labour market will resume, labour being redirected towards new export industries undergoing boom.</seg>
<seg id=547>The situation is comparable to that of Britain when it gave up its indexation exchange rate and let the pound be depreciated from the German mark, or what happened in the US in the late 1980s when the dollar was depreciated from the book the mark and - especially - from the Japanese yen.</seg>
<seg id=548>Economists of international finance describe a bleaker future.</seg>
<seg id=549>They see the late programs purchase of dollar large-scale by central banks will lead not only to the decline in the dollar but also to a rise in the number of American interest rates in the long run, which will immediately bring down household consumption and will govern investment after a short period of time.</seg>
<seg id=550>Undoubtedly, economists of international finance also consider that American exports will benefit from the fall of the dollar but the data in demand are like the push export happen one or two years after the decline in consumption and investment.</seg>
<seg id=551>Eight to ten million people will have to move from the service sector and construction in the export of goods, which means that structural unemployment will rise.</seg>
<seg id=552>Perhaps one will attend financial panic: the large financial institutions with short-term obligations and long-term assets will have difficulty in supporting a significant rise in long-term interest rates made in dollar.</seg>
<seg id=553>This factor of inequality may cause some financial tension and a bankruptcy as easily as those generated during the Mexican crisis and East Asia in the 1990s and the Argentine crisis of the decade because of assets in local currency and obligations in dollar that banks held.</seg>
<seg id=554>When economists of international finance propose this scenario, by specialized in domestic economy answer them that is like a case of incompetence in monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=555>Why the Federal Reserve should allow the rising interest rates in the long term when foreign central banks will cease their programs purchase of dollar?</seg>
<seg id=556>Should it not then intervene and take over by American purchase of Treasury link in the long run, thus maintaining long-term interest rates at a satisfactory level to encourage full employment?</seg>
<seg id=557>Economists of international finance usually answer that the Federal Reserve has no power to do so.</seg>
<seg id=558>Forced to choose between full employment and price stability, according to them, the Federal Reserve choose price stability, because its institutional memory of the 1970s and the theft of inflation remains very strong.</seg>
<seg id=559>So, since the fall of the value of the dollar raises import prices and thus functions as a negative shock on the supply side in the economic sector, the Federal Reserve will have to increase, not reduce its interest rates in order to sell rather than to buy Treasury bonds.</seg>
<seg id=560>Serious economists that I greatly respect find to give an opinion in opposing camps.</seg>
<seg id=561>I am not enough wise agree with one or other, but I know no doubt that side I hope to see wrong.</seg>
<seg id=562>Poor pupils of Europe</seg>
<seg id=563>In the US, States that continue misguided fiscal policies are penalized.</seg>
<seg id=564>Their obligations are sold on the cheap compared with other better managed States.</seg>
<seg id=565>The debts superior they must pay is useful, to some degree, disciplinary measures against temptation to spend today and paying later.</seg>
<seg id=566>Naturally, the discipline of the market is not perfect: the bond market "not see" hardly the passive implicit futures (like the promised payments pensions).</seg>
<seg id=567>However, the application of this fiscal discipline, together with the internal budgetary processes of each State, prevented occurred of fiscal crisis of major in the US since the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id=568>Consider the case of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=569>Before the advent of the euro, many states of Europe southern suffered fiscal crises, producing vague high expectations.</seg>
<seg id=570>But to the single currency, the way to solve a fiscal crisis by inflation was closed, since European Central Bank (ECB) monitors monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=571>But even if the nations can no longer count on inflation to address the imbalance in their finances, the single currency allow them to use the capacity for debt that is actually for other members of the European Union to expand their extravagant folly and delaying their political responsibility periods of leave good times been [1] [sic].</seg>
<seg id=572>This is to avoid the possibility that the EU created the Stability and Growth Pact: the budget deficit of governments should not exceed 3% of their GDP.</seg>
<seg id=573>Last week, the German Government, once the European country most careful and disciplined in fiscal terms has violated the rules of the Pact for the fifth consecutive year, without actually making (much) excuses.</seg>
<seg id=574>The Finance Minister peer steinbrueck announced that he expected the Commission to apply sanctions against Germany: the credibility of the Pact would, said, put at risk if no gesture made.</seg>
<seg id=575>So, Germany would not impede the sanctions this time, as it was two and a half years ago.</seg>
<seg id=576>But steinbrueck expressed clearly purely expected only sanction symbolic in response to the budget deficit accounting for 3.4% of GDP, not with penalties that would have a real cost its government and its economy.</seg>
<seg id=577>The Stability and Growth Pact is not, or not yet, in the process of working in the way, initially.</seg>
<seg id=578>What about market discipline?</seg>
<seg id=579>Is the will of the German Government to increase its debt and to increase its deficits limited by the fact that market recognizes and penalizes nations that have their tax position weaken?</seg>
<seg id=580>In short, not.</seg>
<seg id=581>Interest rates on the sovereign debt in euro of the twelve governments in the eurozone are very similar.</seg>
<seg id=582>The market does not seem to worry that countries have different potential to generate exports financing of funding necessary to pay off debts, or different current or projected reports déficit debt / GDP.</seg>
<seg id=583>Willem Buiter, the University of Amsterdam and Anne sibert, the University of London, believe it is the acceptance of the ECB throughout the euro-zone deficit as guaranteed that undermined the will of the market to become the conductor of fiscal restraint.</seg>
<seg id=584>As long as marginal part of German debt is used as a guarantee of short-term borrowing or central part of a functioning of pension fought to buy liquidity, its value is more likely to be determined by the terms that the ECB accepts as secure than by its fundamental.</seg>
<seg id=585>The treatment by the ECB of any debt such as so important source of liquidity reserve wrong now no differential analysis of sovereign risk in the long run.</seg>
<seg id=586>They is dangerous long-term.</seg>
<seg id=587>We must have both market discipline and sound fiscal management to have a reasonable chance to benefit from price stability in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=588>Even today to sanction by market something that can become throwaway neck or to activate the institutional levers that give a voice to future generations, and you expose yourself to suffer serious consequences -- perhaps not today and tomorrow, but one day and for the rest of your life.</seg>
<seg id=589>As time passes, the arrival of the single currency and how the euro was implemented generate unease increasingly.</seg>
<seg id=590>The politics of all the eurozone in general too deflation.</seg>
<seg id=591>The transfer to the currency current tenable to regions that slow or are already in recession when the ECB applies a stricter policy are taken.</seg>
<seg id=592>The institutional foundations for a stable fiscal policy in the long term are undergoing erosion.</seg>
<seg id=593>Now, Buiter and sibert convince us that the ECB gives the market less possibility of reward most so and penalising the extravagant, that it should not.</seg>
<seg id=594>The earth does not move yet, and this will not happen before a moment.</seg>
<seg id=595>But the ground under the euro could well sharp If things do not change.</seg>
<seg id=596>Milosevic and Hussein: even trial even joke</seg>
<seg id=597>The trials of war criminals were once serious business.</seg>
<seg id=598>Remember the pictures Herman goering and Rudolf prodigy, disasters, in the dock in Nuremberg.</seg>
<seg id=599>Some leaders Nazis were even hung after the relatively short but fair trials.</seg>
<seg id=600>Nowadays, the trials of the most despicable leaders of the world became jokes.</seg>
<seg id=601>The trial of Saddam Hussein and his friends of Baath is a continuing series of awkward moments.</seg>
<seg id=602>The accused try a singery after another and Hussein is showing all forms of contempt for the only thing that has not yet made is to demonstrate its backside the judge.</seg>
<seg id=603>It is difficult to look forward to an outcome which could be legitimacy in the eyes of the Iraqis or world.</seg>
<seg id=604>Meanwhile, Slobodan Milosevic's trial changed into funeral boring after four years of reports and 200 million dollars spent unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg id=605>In Cambodia, the UN and the government procrastinated for almost ten years how to provide the surviving personalities Khmer Rouge in the courts.</seg>
<seg id=606>The killers masses some who seized power in the twentieth century were sentenced to be killed in government popular or tried for their crimes, at least, if they did not die during their term.</seg>
<seg id=607>Who can feel to trust the last Communist leader of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, was shot at his wife without very appearance of a fair trial?</seg>
<seg id=608>The formal traps of genuine Court are always preferable to instant justice, even if the final result is also death.</seg>
<seg id=609>Today there are two plausible ways to proceed as regards a burden tyrant.</seg>
<seg id=610>A nation may send its former leaders in the courts, as did the Argentines in the 1980s with generals responsible disappearance of more than 5000 of their citizens.</seg>
<seg id=611>Internationally, the model of Nuremberg remains valid to be a model for other trials, although under conditions ambiguities that victorious powers sometimes require's accounts for certain crimes, such as "crimes against humanity," which are not properly defined at the time when they are made.</seg>
<seg id=612>It is a time when we can see the benefits of both national and international trials.</seg>
<seg id=613>The trials at home allowed the local community to give vent to his penalty by participating in close to the procedure.</seg>
<seg id=614>As judges and fear, fellow the accused may also bring greater sensitivity to the estimate of guilt because they could enjoy the harsh conditions under which a burden dictator made his decisions.</seg>
<seg id=615>The trial of the generals in Argentina was a sacred ritual of success in the painful transition the military junta to democracy, but that experience ended in a larmoyante called into question.</seg>
<seg id=616>Even after their judgment, generals were strong enough to require denunciation of their trials then an amnesty for the next President.</seg>
<seg id=617>The Argentine politics is still tangled in legal consequences of these trials in twenty years ago.</seg>
<seg id=618>Internationally, the decision by the UN Security Council to establish the international criminal tribunal for ex-Yugoslavia (ICTY) was also greeted with great confidence.</seg>
<seg id=619>The ICTY made several decisions founders under Antonio Cassese.</seg>
<seg id=620>But then the judges had the misfortune to conduct their dream expensive: to judge the wretched as leader, Slobodan Milosevic.</seg>
<seg id=621>We cannot have a clear idea of how the Serbs would have tried Milosevic in a local trial.</seg>
<seg id=622>Many would have depended on political party which would controlled the Court.</seg>
<seg id=623>At international level, fears did not about excess policy but to excess right.</seg>
<seg id=624>The trial of Milosevic should be more than just was to be the emblem of the justice of the UN.</seg>
<seg id=625>So Milosevic was allowed to deny itself -- error in terms long and efficiency of the trial.</seg>
<seg id=626>There were no limits to the number of people that the charge called to testify on the same terrible history to aggression and brutality Serbs.</seg>
<seg id=627>It will take several months to determine the problem and to know why this scandal a four-year trial.</seg>
<seg id=628>My intuition that well-meaning officials of the Court were influenced too by the Commission of truth and reconciliation, African model is sold in schools of law as a desirable alternative fairness.</seg>
<seg id=629>In South Africa trials, the most important question was not the future of the accused but the history of the victims.</seg>
<seg id=630>Every victim was encouraged to tell its history and accused listened.</seg>
<seg id=631>In the case of massacres in the twentieth century, such such can last for decades.</seg>
<seg id=632>To encourage people to talk to give the accused the right to take the word and to block the trial by its own merits of political leaders are the ingredients of endless session.</seg>
<seg id=633>One of the lessons we have learned from the trials of Milosevic and Hussein is that we should not judge men or women making them lose their charismatic attraction.</seg>
<seg id=634>They will reverse the trial, especially if they are allowed to defend themselves, and use the During to justify their prices.</seg>
<seg id=635>The tyrants should be judged only after being clearly demolished.</seg>
<seg id=636>Irony of history that the Court of Nuremberg was lively by representatives of the victors and the powerful was an advantage.</seg>
<seg id=637>They provided a constant reminder for goering prodigy, and their henchmen who ordered the allies, then the Nazis were irremediably defeat.</seg>
<seg id=638>To punish the guilty, rather than form of how history would be written, was always the objective light of trial.</seg>
<seg id=639>The tragedy of trials of Milosevic and Hussein is that points on the "i" in history still missing and that history itself is on trial.</seg>
<seg id=640>The significant hesitation of officials gave rise to procedures, both national and international, which facilitated the fantasies of justification and return.</seg>
<seg id=641>In the case of Saddam Hussein, this fantasy could be done.</seg>
<seg id=642>Divide of the Iraqi economy</seg>
<seg id=643>All who analyse Iraq as a nation divided between communities of Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds.</seg>
<seg id=644>But there is another division equally fundamental, a division which contributes so much to the ongoing insurgency that sectarian conflict and opposition to military occupation led by the Americans, who growing gap between the rich and poor from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=645>When Iraq was released, people, especially the poor people, committed to expect a charismatic leader would save them hard reality of daily life.</seg>
<seg id=646>That fear, they had no idea about how democracy could apply to their company or how groups of human rights and other agencies civil rights could help them to their future.</seg>
<seg id=647>Iraq quickly found itself in a new right of social division.</seg>
<seg id=648>On the one hand those who were understood how to operate in a democracy, come to power and to achieve clean ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=649>They know how to speak the language of democracy, winning both money and influence, and ensuring the contest of independent organizations to defend their rights and their preferences.</seg>
<seg id=650>Other, however, there is a huge Iraqi population without, especially the widows women, divorced or abandoned without anyone to deal with them, they and their children.</seg>
<seg id=651>For these, democracy and human rights do not mean much.</seg>
<seg id=652>They are culture, poor and sick.</seg>
<seg id=653>Victims of an education system which collapsed over a decade ago, they were not to find employment in the Iraqi economy in withering away.</seg>
<seg id=654>Suffering under Saddam, no effort was made to higher standard of living for poor.</seg>
<seg id=655>I visited large Iraqi slums and discovered families living in homes barely covered with a roof, once pests everywhere, with sewage open-air running under their doors.</seg>
<seg id=656>Harms and day, they live in the black.</seg>
<seg id=657>Not need anything less than food, decent homes and employment opportunities, these families expect death, appalled by the cries of their starving children.</seg>
<seg id=658>When I met the women who live in these homes, they bombed me questions: democracy was going to give them food and homes?</seg>
<seg id=659>Democracy would prevent people from from their wives?</seg>
<seg id=660>Democracy would grant citizenship to their children?</seg>
<seg id=661>They would give the right to divorce the husbands who would have abandoned them?</seg>
<seg id=662>All these issues, I answered yes.</seg>
<seg id=663>Yes, democracy will grant the right of a decent home, the right to you to learn and work, and it will grant citizenship to children and equality.</seg>
<seg id=664>But you will have to work hard and make every effort to demand such rights.</seg>
<seg id=665>What they replied: "Saddam learned to be unemployed, silent and fearful for 35 years.</seg>
<seg id=666>There can we now? "</seg>
<seg id=667>In these poor areas live most Iraqis, people are going through bitter temptations.</seg>
<seg id=668>Many people who are not with the range of political leaders or Government.</seg>
<seg id=669>They easily fall into violence, theft and sabotage.</seg>
<seg id=670>Poverty leads them to accept money in exchange for terrorist acts, complicit with the promise of a false heroism they cannot exploit during the long reign of Saddam.</seg>
<seg id=671>Poverty exacerbated the trauma of violent history of wars and atrocities of Iraq, which destroyed the sensitivity of people to the killing.</seg>
<seg id=672>Although the living conditions in Iraq today lead many young men to violence, I am convinced that simply provide employment and decent homes save them.</seg>
<seg id=673>Employment, in particular, would help young people to forge new lives through serious employment.</seg>
<seg id=674>We must not use dummy jobs to make up the army of unemployed.</seg>
<seg id=675>We must give people jobs so that they can contribute positively to the reconstruction country.</seg>
<seg id=676>By nature, every individual seeks to be useful for its own society.</seg>
<seg id=677>But the culture that Saddam has convinced Iraqis that political connections are the only way to achieve authority, money and to know.</seg>
<seg id=678>To overcome such sentiments will take time and will require a thriving economy, which means that the new Iraqi government should have limited powers to facilitate the growth of private while encouraging the widespread understanding of democracy and human rights.</seg>
<seg id=679>The religious groups are willing to participate in the process.</seg>
<seg id=680>We can also rehabilitate the technocrats who served under Saddam, so that they may also serve their country.</seg>
<seg id=681>Last, but not least, we must offer loans to poor families to help them build a respectable life.</seg>
<seg id=682>The government must above all every effort to convince poor Iraqi people of the value of democracy and freedom and the importance of the Constitution in achieving their aspirations for a better life.</seg>
<seg id=683>That will not be easy to do where many see infringe the law is an act of heroism.</seg>
<seg id=684>There, the Iraqis have learned that power should be concentrated in the hands of a minority, and the creation of justice requires to combat corruption in all its forms.</seg>
<seg id=685>If the Constitution must operate as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, poor Iraqis must learn to make them this struggle.</seg>
<seg id=686>Identity Islamic</seg>
<seg id=687>Wherever you direct eyes today, Islam is used (and abused) as a political force.</seg>
<seg id=688>Some Muslims use them as inciting the action; many Muslims in the West (and in other countries - perceive it as "another" demanding containment and "another" exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=689>As a Turk, I feel directly both sides of the debate.</seg>
<seg id=690>The reason that Islam is a religion of "the other" in the eyes of the West is that the West attended a systematic deinstitutionalisation of religion.</seg>
<seg id=691>It is not religion that disappeared from the modern western life, of course, but rather the claims that religious institutions can issue on individual conduct.</seg>
<seg id=692>Religion in the modern world is more than ever personal experience and spiritual.</seg>
<seg id=693>However, a process of deinstitutionalisation of religious experience also happens within Islam.</seg>
<seg id=694>The politicization of Islam replacing the authority of religious classes of Islam, ulema.</seg>
<seg id=695>As in the West, Islamist religious experience becomes more personal.</seg>
<seg id=696>The interpretation of religious texts by individual Muslims, including political activists, intellectuals and women, is a consequence among many.</seg>
<seg id=697>We should also mention the popularizing of religious knowledge, the lesson of the Koran being abused and being taken out of context for political objectives.</seg>
<seg id=698>Who decides now is legitimate and of what is illegal in Islam?</seg>
<seg id=699>Who has sufficient authority to interpret the religious texts?</seg>
<seg id=700>Who can make a online or declare "Jihad"?</seg>
<seg id=701>Nowadays, activism and terrorism offer or impose, a source of legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id=702>So drawn decide what means or Islam does not mean, without the rule of religious schools and specialist training.</seg>
<seg id=703>Indeed, Islam today is largely interpreted by cultural political parties and movements, not by religious institutions.</seg>
<seg id=704>This deinstitutionalisation allowed Islam to move from the status of local and national social link to the Creator of imaginary links between all Muslims around the world who feel oppressed or misplaced.</seg>
<seg id=705>Islamism can unite Members who were deeply divided: intellectual Muslims Sufis and saints Muslims in shariat origin; Shiite Muslims and Sunni; Conservative Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran.</seg>
<seg id=706>Islam is also dynamic, its believers leaving rural areas for cities, including Western cities.</seg>
<seg id=707>Much of this movement as negative and emphasizes that these people are socially displaced and that they rock later in alienation and, for some, terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=708>But the social mobility is also a precondition to create a modern perspective.</seg>
<seg id=709>Obviously, migration causes a feeling of distance among Muslims, if not a complete break, their social origins.</seg>
<seg id=710>Their religious experience is so new, deprived of theological Community or public institutions.</seg>
<seg id=711>Religious experience is rather a form of social imagination in which they rebuild a feeling of belonging of Islam in both a new and strange environment.</seg>
<seg id=712>This is not the distance from the modern life, but the proximity to the life that is a return to the religious identity.</seg>
<seg id=713>Indeed, the vast majority of radicalism appears in groups that, from their experience of mobility and movement, are familiar with the secular western regimes of political thought and urban life.</seg>
<seg id=714>Disoriented by an unknown environment, these individuals are clinging to Islam that is their sole support.</seg>
<seg id=715>But if this support functions, Islam must be released from its traditionally dawdling, passive and flexible attitude modernity.</seg>
<seg id=716>While wearing a veil or under, in claiming the right to places of prayer to work or to school and requiring special food, Muslims are identified openly as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id=717>They inform the world that they are more committed and more careful in their religious compliance that individuals who confining their religiosity with private life.</seg>
<seg id=718>For example, no Muslims generally view of the veil as the sign of depreciation and inferiority of Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id=719>Of shame, but became for Muslims a sign of their positive claim an Islamic identity.</seg>
<seg id=720>The Muslim young women of Europe illustrate to perfect this transformation.</seg>
<seg id=721>The girls who adopt the headscarves in French and German schools are closer, in many respects - namely, a culture of young, the awareness of the regime and language - their classmates that their mothers without education who are forced to stay at home.</seg>
<seg id=722>By adopting the headscarves for European public sphere, these girls change without it the symbol and the role of Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id=723>This trend goes well beyond simple headscarves.</seg>
<seg id=724>All Western Muslims have a double sense of belonging, a double cultural capital.</seg>
<seg id=725>They are defined by their religiosity, but they also have universal secular knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=726>The fact that they have this cultural capital doubles, they can move quite freely between different activities and space (residence, school, houses of youth and space for urban leisure).</seg>
<seg id=727>To be Muslim and islamiste are two different things.</seg>
<seg id=728>We are now witnessing the change of Muslim identity for an Islamic identity.</seg>
<seg id=729>Me religious for individual Muslims passes from the UK private to public realm.</seg>
<seg id=730>The question remains for each is whether this quest for identity can welcome headscarves and a broad public acceptance of the Islamic religion or if a positive assertion of Islam requires more fundamental renunciation of modernity.</seg>
<seg id=731>A new era for Islamic science?</seg>
<seg id=732>For several hundred years, while science and mathematics had a period of great inventiveness, a region in the world was different from others.</seg>
<seg id=733>The masters of these disciplines were Italy there, medicine advanced very close and people questioned the operation of nature.</seg>
<seg id=734>None of surprising that region was universally respected.</seg>
<seg id=735>The other half of world, scientists were punished even killed.</seg>
<seg id=736>Mathematics, considered irreligious and foreign, was;, was controlled later to religion.</seg>
<seg id=737>The standard of living was low.</seg>
<seg id=738>The region prosperous was the Islamic Middle East as America Europe remained poor.</seg>
<seg id=739>The two regions were controlled religiously (the historians disagree in the role and nature of religions in this context - but science flourish only in one of them.</seg>
<seg id=740>Today, of course, roles in the Islamic Middle East and the West are reversed.</seg>
<seg id=741>Since the second world war, the US is the employed world leaders in the area of science.</seg>
<seg id=742>Throughout this period, the most brilliant students were lured out of their countries of origin by the prospect of better opportunities for career and research.</seg>
<seg id=743>Up to a recent period, over half the graduate students in higher mathematics, science and technology in the US was born abroad.</seg>
<seg id=744>Many of these young talent remained after graduation, and so the industrial world that government have benefited.</seg>
<seg id=745>Meanwhile, the Islamic culture entered an historic phase in which science was comparable to the influence of the West, even - for this.</seg>
<seg id=746>Even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant proportion of research, the Arab leaders did not encourage such investments, and the result is that their companies have not prosper as far as they could.</seg>
<seg id=747>Recently, a desire for greater political respect pushed the Islamic nations to invest in technological, which is particularly visible in Pakistan and Iran's nuclear ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=748>But while such weapons has political weight, science on which they rest is banal and old.</seg>
<seg id=749>Respect from visions considered, rather than born discoveries past, is much more significant.</seg>
<seg id=750>Imagine the influence which would in mind have a Pakistani Institute global cancer research.</seg>
<seg id=751>And would political rhetoric so change researchers in Oman found a way of eliminating aids?</seg>
<seg id=752>This opportunity does not exist at present.</seg>
<seg id=753>But there is another, which are not limited to Islamic societies.</seg>
<seg id=754>The United States made serious falseone recently.</seg>
<seg id=755>"questions of faith" replaced science within the government, on the basis of the presidency.</seg>
<seg id=756>Eminent scientists saw their reports modified by members of the political staff when the facts contradicted the official version.</seg>
<seg id=757>Encouraged by an administration influenced by religion, school systems are confusing their teaching of science towards "values."</seg>
<seg id=758>Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, the entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, which slows down the flow of young talent to American universities.</seg>
<seg id=759>Big scientific bodies protested without result.</seg>
<seg id=760>At the same time, tax laws were revised to short-term investors richer, discouraging long-term investment in research.</seg>
<seg id=761>Half a billion of $was devoted to the Iraq war, a sum of equal to the funding of all thousand years basic research.</seg>
<seg id=762>Although the US avoids a dark age of fundamentalism are clearly risk losing their world domination in research.</seg>
<seg id=763>Japan recognized the link between political weight and science in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id=764>The main Japanese industrial, Akio morita, CEO from Sony, and politician of right-wing shintaro ishihara, made a series of speeches produced and published in 1986 as title of Japan that can say no [Japan, who can say no].</seg>
<seg id=765>They outlined a national strategy in which global influence would result scientific power.</seg>
<seg id=766>The main idea is that the military power could be made obsolete if the "food chain" of military technology were controlled by other nations.</seg>
<seg id=767>The title of a book refers to the project of Japan to say "no" to the American military influence once Japan will control leading military technology.</seg>
<seg id=768>To build a knowledge-based economy through wealth from oil is possible.</seg>
<seg id=769>Texas for example, like most of the south of the US, used economically poor and in decline.</seg>
<seg id=770>Even with oil revenues, the flow of dollars in the economy in itself is not enough to boost prosperity as much as one might think.</seg>
<seg id=771>Texas therefore decided to spend the oil money to an equipment for education.</seg>
<seg id=772>Today, this equipment is equal to that of Harvard University, extends to 15 universities.</seg>
<seg id=773>It had a staggering effect: aerospace industry almost disappeared from California, but exploding in Texas.</seg>
<seg id=774>The research centers and the companies of telecommunications precipitated in Texas, the Canadian giant of Nortel telecommunications.</seg>
<seg id=775>Although industry a crisis in the US, Texas is one of the most solid industrial economies of the world.</seg>
<seg id=776>There is no reason that the same results can be achieved in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=777>But above all, the Islamic world to rediscover and be reconciled with its proud legacy.</seg>
<seg id=778>The Iranian debate on Iraq</seg>
<seg id=779>No country in the Middle East following the events of the post-war Iraq's of near as Iran.</seg>
<seg id=780>The geographical proximity, intense and violent history of war with Iraq, Saddam Hussein, of religious and emotional connections with Shia in Iraq, some concern about the US and with their policy in the region: these are the sons unite Iran with its western neighbour.</seg>
<seg id=781>Given the continuing tensions with America, Iran is particularly concerned by the possibility of a continued US presence in its neighbour, by the dominant role of America in building the future about Iraq's post-Saddam.</seg>
<seg id=782>Foreign observers are hard to follow the Iranian internal debates, but they exist, they are intense, even if they are not always visible to international public in general.</seg>
<seg id=783>One can three general approaches in Iranian debate in ever-changing about Iraq's post-Saddam.</seg>
<seg id=784>Iran's office support that Iran will inevitably have to cooperate with the US about Iraq's post-Saddam, even if only to ensure that the rights of Shiite population of Iraq are respected.</seg>
<seg id=785>For this reason, Iran should win the assurance that the new Iraqi leader is hostile and look for him to win bilateral friendships.</seg>
<seg id=786>Other key considerations for office with the preservation of Iraq's territorial integrity and repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.</seg>
<seg id=787>They are moderates who thinks the Iranian Government should insist on the US for the extradition of members of the organization of Mujahideen Mujahedin-e (MKO) based in Iraq, as well as the total dismantling of organization.</seg>
<seg id=788>In exchange, the Iranian Government should give its support to ensure peace, stability and security in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=789>All in all, the office to limit US-Iran relations women, focusing them on a plan which largely reflects domestic concerns of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=790>In general, the conservative forces in Iran support this approach.</seg>
<seg id=791>Another approach proposes a more active and cooperative role in Iran in the reconstruction of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=792>Advocates of this position argue that Iran is well placed to facilitate the reconstruction, because of its well established infrastructure for personal and institutional links with Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=793>Finally, one thinks, the US and the international community will recognize the value of Iranian cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=794>Iran's cooperation should be rewarded with dismantling for infrastructure for the MKO in Iraq, in exchange for an Iranian promise to perhaps tackle the activities of al-Qaeda, expel members of al-Qaeda of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=795>Moreover, Iran should invite the Americans to meet his cooperation with the assurance of a guarantee in return that Iran in future becoming the target of US military action.</seg>
<seg id=796>In short, the advocates of cooperation are calling for an open and explicit market: support for Iran to ensure stability during the current transition as its commitment to maintain cooperative relations with any permanent government that will arise in Iraq in exchange for the improvement of regional and international position of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=797>This position is widely held in the reform movements in Iran, within and outside the administration, by the technocratic class and business whose orientation is more international.</seg>
<seg id=798>Finally, for the Iranian radicals, the possibility of cooperation with the US is pure fantasy.</seg>
<seg id=799>They are convinced that America only seeks to undermine Iranian security and to put at risk its national interests.</seg>
<seg id=800>According to the radicals, the US will at least seek to impose substantial changes on the Iranian Foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id=801>At worst, they say, America will seek to impose a regime change in Iran actively.</seg>
<seg id=802>It will enthusiastically militate against the acquisition of knowledge and nuclear energy by Iran and may even try to weaken the military power of Iran as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=803>The radicals perceive the American invasion of Iraq as a reflection of us will to pin Iran.</seg>
<seg id=804>In return, they feel that Iran should take an aggressive stance in defense of its interests, and form strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers and use the Iranian influence Iraq to prevent the formation of a government pro-American and anti-Iranian in Baghdad.</seg>
<seg id=805>Supporters of the hard line on all sides support this approach.</seg>
<seg id=806>The overthrow of Saddam Hussein and his regime was only the easiest aspect of the Iraqi crisis.</seg>
<seg id=807>Now the hardest remains to be done: to establish peace and security to win the war against terrorism and to convince the Muslim masses that America does not intend to occupy Iraq to trap all its oil resources and to redraw the Middle East with its image.</seg>
<seg id=808>Meanwhile, opposition against the US, under the expression of suicide bombings to bomb or other forms of terrorism, will probably only grow.</seg>
<seg id=809>Iran is intended to keep its decisive position in the region through its political dynamism and its Muslim identity with ECHO echoes throughout the Muslim world.</seg>
<seg id=810>What happens in Iraq has major implications in Iran and the US would do well to find a way of recognizing this fact.</seg>
<seg id=811>American threats, or the discussions on another war, fuel fire of resentment and frustration in Iran, reinforcing the most radical movements.</seg>
<seg id=812>If the US wants to avoid such effects, they must agree to limit their influence of his own radicals, assuming that American interests in Iraq are best defended through cooperation with Iran.</seg>
<seg id=813>An outcome for Iraq</seg>
<seg id=814>The situation in Iraq have reached the point where everyone wants the same openly: the departure of the coalition forces.</seg>
<seg id=815>The recent disclosure of a confidential note the Ministry of Defense British on the withdrawal of troops is to stress this aspiration.</seg>
<seg id=816>The only question is how to meet it.</seg>
<seg id=817>Until the coalition forces will remain, violence will only increase.</seg>
<seg id=818>But if they leave, the escalation of violence will take place yet and even more quickly.</seg>
<seg id=819>The real issue is how to manage to Iraq to organize an army and the police with which we can trust to uphold law and order.</seg>
<seg id=820>There is still a long way to go to approach it.</seg>
<seg id=821>Despite the courage of many Iraqis who join the police and the army, Does it surprise anyone that some have incentives than pure less.</seg>
<seg id=822>In northern Iraq, we regulate old accounts and ethnic segregation is introduced in fact into some traditionally mixed areas, like irbil.</seg>
<seg id=823>In other regions, the sharia is imposed.</seg>
<seg id=824>How Iraq can create bodies likely to enforce the law effectively and fairness, regardless of ethnic, religious or kind?</seg>
<seg id=825>The traditional response is to recruit, form, inculcate "good values."</seg>
<seg id=826>But there is no time.</seg>
<seg id=827>Other means should be found.</seg>
<seg id=828>In the absence of a system of value deeply rooted, Iraq needs associations rooted in civil society, in which organizes it and army must be called to account.</seg>
<seg id=829>They may take various forms, but most importantly, they really are extended at a local level, and that they have the support of the authorities of the district, the region and country when they report abuses.</seg>
<seg id=830>If a local surveillance is implemented, completed, acknowledged at the national level, then the majority of military and police may behave properly, otherwise, it would be easier to identify them and to manage them.</seg>
<seg id=831>Such measures may be ballooned optimistic, yet in Afghanistan, a country which looks like Iraq in many respects, many groups work so.</seg>
<seg id=832>The cooperation for peace and unity (cpau) provides a model in the way of operating.</seg>
<seg id=833>In Afghanistan, in Iraq, the priority of ordinary people was to reduce violence.</seg>
<seg id=834>The cpau worked in every country in the last three years to implement committees of peace in the constituencies, supported by satellite advice of peace in the villages.</seg>
<seg id=835>This initiative faces a culture in which violence is so deep-rooted that children, at a time, have the arithmetic by relying the dead Soviet soldiers.</seg>
<seg id=836>The committees so tried to gather all the groups of the Community, including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, the police, judges and businessmen, to devise ways of solving conflicts without violence.</seg>
<seg id=837>Even if the committees failed officially role of control so far (is expected in the future), the mere fact that the police, the army, justice form of that role, met in touch with the rest of the Community, allows feedback, contribute to the establishment of trust.</seg>
<seg id=838>Some results are remarkable.</seg>
<seg id=839>In one training sessions, local military commander came to spend a few hours by polite, and ended up being every week.</seg>
<seg id=840>He left by unapologetic himself for his violent past and committed de-fang his private army of 2 000.</seg>
<seg id=841>It is now regularly visit to the offices of the committee.</seg>
<seg id=842>In Iraq, projects as humanitarian contact center de Kirkuk start to play a monitoring function providing the population with the various ethnic groups the opportunity to set out its complaints and to obtain help to resolve its problems.</seg>
<seg id=843>But too often, even in the case of a trial, the judgment is not applied because the victims yield to the threat.</seg>
<seg id=844>The US and British forces have already well work to strengthen civil society.</seg>
<seg id=845>We do not hear of training sessions of emancipation of women, or the success of the Organization of local elections to small scale in the country.</seg>
<seg id=846>To mobilize civil society is an enormous challenge, especially when, as in Iraq, this must be done quickly and large-scale.</seg>
<seg id=847>The military forces are needed, but as well as the encouragement of disarmament, in the form of prospects for economic opportunities more profitable than the crime and theft.</seg>
<seg id=848>Fortunately, such an organization of civil society is costing as little as important.</seg>
<seg id=849>Association humanitarian contact center treats any Kirkuk at an annual cost of $75 000 us.</seg>
<seg id=850>With $10 million, we could establish a hundred centers of similar, and there would be common.</seg>
<seg id=851>It is time to engage in this respect, for without failing the brave people that the challenge to hold on to power.</seg>
<seg id=852>Otherwise, the Iraqi people may not have the security of that desperately needs after so many years.</seg>
<seg id=853>The democracy on Nile?</seg>
<seg id=854>The surprise decision by Egyptian President Mubarak dares to propose a constitutional amendment authorizing the holding of direct and competitive presidential elections may well be a giant step forward for democracy in Egypt and in the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id=855>The West accustomed to a pluralist democracy may have difficulty in understanding that potentially considerable change that decision will generate an accustomed country with military rule for over 50 years.</seg>
<seg id=856>Under the current system, Egyptian citizens can only be the day of a presidential referendum every six years to say yes or no to the only name that were on the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id=857>This explains why an individual like Mubarak always received more than 90% of the votes, albeit in the middle of an indifferent rate participation.</seg>
<seg id=858>The strong men Syrian and Iraqi made even better with this system, probably because they demanded that the names and addresses the voters be put down every vote.</seg>
<seg id=859>Many people support long that democratization in the Middle East cannot progress until Egypt will not become fully involved in the process.</seg>
<seg id=860>Egypt could hardly a commitment to democratization without first amending its constitution in order to reduce the phenomenal powers of its President and limiting the length of his term.</seg>
<seg id=861>Mubarak, after all, is already at its 24 year as President.</seg>
<seg id=862>Thus, his announcement of competitive presidential elections is a first step.</seg>
<seg id=863>The regime can assume it can use the process to its advantage, but events would be more difficult to control than expected once citizens will start to feel made responsible.</seg>
<seg id=864>The democratic genius left bottle.</seg>
<seg id=865>In any case, Egypt is not the only country in the region troubled to go down the road of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=866>Turkey on one side of the Middle East and Morocco's other are already well engaged in this process.</seg>
<seg id=867>The real land two appears then resulting from the temporal proximity and the positive results of the recent elections held in Iraq, Palestine and, to a lesser degree, in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=868>The unprecedented protests against the occupation of Lebanon by Syria following the assassination of the former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, Al do not seem to mitigate.</seg>
<seg id=869>The Egyptian opposition groups also organized increasingly bold steps and other forms of civil disobedience in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id=870>The catalyst for their anger was the arrest and detention of the leader of the opposition, sick Ayman Nour, at the end of January.</seg>
<seg id=871>The arbitrary attitude of the government reinvigorated national Kifaya Movement (which means "enough"), which required the late Mubarak regime.</seg>
<seg id=872>Suddenly, the conventional wisdom that the Egyptians are passive and are afraid to act more not to be true.</seg>
<seg id=873>An alliance of local, regional and international forces is united against permanent tyranny exercised on banks of Nile.</seg>
<seg id=874>The recent wave of popular pressure seems to have rocked the regime.</seg>
<seg id=875>Only a month before, muybarak refused the demands of constitutional reform by taxing them with "futile.</seg>
<seg id=876>But, whatever the combination of events that brought this U-turn, the initiative concerning the elections must be welcomed.</seg>
<seg id=877>It is a first necessary step, although insufficient, stagnate to overhaul the political system of Egypt.</seg>
<seg id=878>The Egyptians are already suspicious of reform symbolic to Tunisia, country in which President Zine El abidin bin Ali, this office long, created a caricature of constitutional amendment which seemed to open up competitive presidential election, but which subsequently led to a show of support to some "opponents" handpicked on part.</seg>
<seg id=879>In the previous Tunisia presidential referenda, bin Ali collected 99% of votes systematically; now obtained 96%.</seg>
<seg id=880>Let us hope that Mubarak is more serious about electoral reform.</seg>
<seg id=881>To prove its sincerity, it must command the immediate liberation of Ayman Nour and measures to end the 24 year old state of emergency, which prevents the organization of political campaigns successfully.</seg>
<seg id=882>Mubarak must also approve a limit of two five-year successive mandates for every President.</seg>
<seg id=883>Equally necessary, for measures to win the confidence of people, including access open and equal to the media, which are currently controlled by the state.</seg>
<seg id=884>I announced that I intended to contest this forthcoming presidential elections in order to open the debate on these essential reforms.</seg>
<seg id=885>But I will return with pleasure to my life of private citizen when I have the assurance of a free and open election next autumn.</seg>
<seg id=886>If they are seriously implemented, these steps will turn the legacy of Mubarak.</seg>

<seg id=888>Historic elections for Egypt?</seg>
<seg id=889>The Egyptians will go to the polls 7 September to elect a President of 10 candidates, including dares Mubarak, in power since 24 years.</seg>
<seg id=890>Little doubt that he will be re-elected after the election, many The steps with passion follow from it.</seg>
<seg id=891>Some 6,000 national election observers were trained for the moment, and hundreds of international observers will happen in the country this week.</seg>
<seg id=892>Although all the signs outside of genuine electoral competition are implemented, it is striking that several signs of authenticity fail to appeal.</seg>
<seg id=893>Despite the promises of the opposite, the conditions of play are far from fair.</seg>
<seg id=894>Mubarak has a disproportionate number of benefits: recognition of the name, a near the electronic media controlled by the state and nothing less than 85% print media.</seg>
<seg id=895>A week before the vote, some of opposition candidates have not yet had the opportunity to spread one campaign on television Egypt.</seg>
<seg id=896>All members of the presidential election Commission are appointed by Mubarak, electoral new rules eliminated all independent competitors.</seg>
<seg id=897>Since 2000, a ruling of the Supreme Court provides that the 8 000 Egyptian judges must monitor the elections and to certify the results.</seg>
<seg id=898>That is a significant step towards fairer election, because trade union of judges remained rather independent over the past half-century of hold on executive.</seg>
<seg id=899>Mubarak's regime therefore had to use different subterfuge to counteract trade union of judges.</seg>
<seg id=900>One of them was again the definition of 'legal' to include thousands of workers graduate in law, without experience to the Court but true to the government that leaves little margin to real judges, because if they protest by boycotting their work of observation, the task will be allocated again to the police's was Minister for the Interior.</seg>
<seg id=901>So, in the past, trade union of judges performed his task with predictable result.</seg>
<seg id=902>During the parliamentary elections in 2000, while the ruling party of Mubarak received only about 38% of the votes in areas supervised by real judges, results managed peak at 86% when almost judges were responsible for the observation.</seg>
<seg id=903>This year promises to be different.</seg>
<seg id=904>In the spring, the judges held an assembly major national and resolved that unless the government is not given full independence them and the exclusive control of the process of elections, they would not control the presidential elections (or Member of Parliament) ahead.</seg>
<seg id=905>2 September, they have their ultimate demand: the regime must allow civil groups to observe the elections, to stop modifying the definition of legitimate judges for electoral purposes, and accept that no ballot box leaves the presence of a legitimate judge without its content limited, are certified and postponed.</seg>
<seg id=906>For the moment it seems that there is no way out as the head of the presidential election Commission announced publicly on television Egypt that he refused observation by citizens of the elections.</seg>
<seg id=907>One is the interesting developments, before the vote, is reproduced a raged public debate on the subject: needed to boycott the election or going to vote?</seg>
<seg id=908>Many opposition parties called their Members not to to protest tight electoral rules that strongly support Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id=909>Moreover, the Muslim Brotherhood, considered competencies the only group of opposition with weight in Egypt, push their supporters to vote according to their conscience but not to support any "governing despotic and corrupt."</seg>
<seg id=910>It has been an implicit but clear repudiation of Mubarak, only Head of State for 24 years.</seg>
<seg id=911>Some 34 civil society organisations prepare thousands of young Egyptians to monitor the elections despite the renewed government objections.</seg>
<seg id=912>These groups argue that if the regime does not intend to rig elections, then the presence of national and international observers should not pose any problems.</seg>
<seg id=913>The response of the regime is saying that any outside supervision is interference in Egypt sovereignty, and that national observers would be an affront to the integrity of judges.</seg>
<seg id=914>The latter argument quickly fell when trade union of judges has voted to observers of civil society.</seg>
<seg id=915>The Mubarak regime is frightened voices from within and without that challenge her to hold free and fair elections, or that it is simply unable to remove the cheating in party so it became inherent in its operation, the current signs do not bode well for the vote to Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id=916>Meanwhile, for the first time the Egyptians make exciting experience of the challenge to tyranny, enjoy a very new freedom.</seg>
<seg id=917>European desire of the dollar</seg>
<seg id=918>The currencies can play a crucial role not only in commercial transactions, but also in the diplomatic and political arguments.</seg>
<seg id=919>When that happens, the trading become harder and subject to greater uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id=920>The politicization of money during the depression of the interwar proved devastating economically.</seg>
<seg id=921>But of violent wars of currencies were more recently.</seg>
<seg id=922>In the 1960s, the international monetary order became the subject of fierce political struggle.</seg>
<seg id=923>Each player had markedly different theories and explanations on the situation.</seg>
<seg id=924>Europeans, particularly the French, have complained that the Charles de Gaulle general called "exorbitant immunity" of the US dollar.</seg>
<seg id=925>The general and his monetary guru, Jacques rueff, argued that the US used the status of the dollar as currency major reserve the fixed exchange rate regime Bretton Woods to manage deficits and paying foreign military adventurism (at that time in Vietnam).</seg>
<seg id=926>France has responded by calling a currency reform that would put an end to the special role of the dollar and tried revive the largely discredited gold standard.</seg>
<seg id=927>Europeans began a long discussion on the benefits of monetary union, the achievement of which would allow them to compete with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id=928>But from the American view, the international role of the dollar was a trap.</seg>
<seg id=929>Others might change their exchange rates and could therefore maintain greater competition in terms of exports.</seg>
<seg id=930>The US Government was helpless a undervalued yen, fueling the belief that the rest of the world used the dollar to confront the basis for manufacturing America.</seg>
<seg id=931>The Nixon administration concluded that the only way to save the US economy was to start in a monetary unilateralism (such spectacular monetary expansion that other countries will be forced to adjust their exchange rates).</seg>
<seg id=932>These battles forgotten long seem suddenly very present again.</seg>
<seg id=933>The world does not have more than a regime fixed exchange rate, but the dollar is a currency of major reserve, a kind of Bretton Woods floating.</seg>
<seg id=934>For us, the role of reserves of the dollar is a potential threat, for no Americans, it would act instead of another example of American Neo-Imperial quest for hegemony.</seg>
<seg id=935>During this decade, China has taken place of Japan's 1960s, preventing its exchange rate from up in order to push export growth.</seg>
<seg id=936>That made it the target of American recriminations about unfair competition and to efforts to impose an adjustment exchange rate risks deter the Americans to buy toys, equipment and clothes Chinese.</seg>
<seg id=937>American manufacturers thought the bras made in China threatened American lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id=938>Meanwhile, Europeans (and particularly French) complain about huge US deficits and the argument about de Gaulle claiming that the rest of the world pays for wars America's East again to the regime.</seg>
<seg id=939>Some Europeans suggest that Asian central banks have greater part of their reserves in euros, an echo of the failed attempt in general to capitulate America by selling $against gold.</seg>
<seg id=940>1960s ended by a collapse of the "system", a major financial unrest, accompanied by a vague increases in the prices of goods.</seg>
<seg id=941>All people was hit and the role of America on the world stage was undermined.</seg>
<seg id=942>A similar collapse today should have a markedly different effect.</seg>
<seg id=943>The system of current rate floating is more stable and otherwise distributed adjustment costs.</seg>
<seg id=944>Most Americans do not suffer much from the marked decline in the dollar because foreign sellers must make adjustments price for the American market.</seg>
<seg id=945>The Asian economies develop vigorously and their central banks to their rely on the US.</seg>
<seg id=946>They should continue this policy not to see their sectors export to undergo sudden failure on capital American market.</seg>
<seg id=947>The US will have more time to treat a deficit of accounts - currents which will not be viable in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=948>Regions economically dynamic in the world (North America and Asia) are therefore bound by a Pact that will ensure the continuity of the centrality of the US dollar.</seg>
<seg id=949>The Americans will continue to accumulate debts because the Asians encourage it.</seg>
<seg id=950>The repeal of the Pact would be contrary to the interests of both parties.</seg>
<seg id=951>It is not an American unilateralism because the Pact involves collaboration with Asia.</seg>
<seg id=952>But for Europeans, who are excluded from Pact, this pact is like a monetary and economic unilateralism.</seg>
<seg id=953>Meanwhile, the supremacy of the euro on the dollar will suffer the European industrial exporters.</seg>
<seg id=954>Europe is not yet able to remove them.</seg>
<seg id=955>Europe will indeed be the greatest victim of the new clashes of currencies.</seg>
<seg id=956>The responses forecasting in the 1960s (restoration of gold standard or invention of a common European currency) no longer seems useful.</seg>
<seg id=957>A common currency did not help provide substantial protection.</seg>
<seg id=958>The old version of the European reaction (what psychologists call "'s desire dollar") will become more pervasive.</seg>
<seg id=959>The European Central Bank will be invited to expand monetary basis, as if the imitation of the dollar was the answer to all the industrial problems, structural and demographic who invade Europe.</seg>
<seg id=960>But we should remember that the problems of Europe do not come from the manipulation of currencies.</seg>
<seg id=961>The protests against the new version of the exorbitant monetary privilege of America should be seen for what they are: a means to compensate for real European powerlessness.</seg>
<seg id=962>The desire of the dollar is therefore prepared to disappear and it will be enhanced, international value of the dollar disappearing without causing obviously effects on people who imprint it and use it.</seg>
<seg id=963>Of an epidemic policy</seg>
<seg id=964>The Americans, as people in every country in the world, were to accept that the policy plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public officials.</seg>
<seg id=965>Many of us are surprised (although some may be disappointed) when a federal judge or a diplomat senior be appointed because he has achieved a crucial test of loyalty to an important principle in the eyes of the Party, or Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id=966>But science, it is widely believed, occupies a special place, and here the US is an example of warning to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=967>Scientific appointments must be based on objective criteria for training, expertise and performance.</seg>
<seg id=968>Of course, it is legitimate to question a future Secretary to health and human services (laid) on their views on abortion.</seg>
<seg id=969>But it is quite wrong that the candidate chosen to sit in scientific advisory committees to test of political honesty.</seg>
<seg id=970>Similarly, the membership organizations at scientific proposals, a fundamental process for scientific progress, would undoubtedly be without all barriers that are unrelated to the professional qualifications.</seg>
<seg id=971>Unfortunately, the scientists in the US increasingly come up against these barriers.</seg>
<seg id=972>During the last autumn, science review published several reports on the issue.</seg>
<seg id=973>One of these reports was the mass replacement of members of the advisory committee of national centrist for environmental health, which belongs to the center of disease prevention and control (CDC), without prior consultation with the Director of the Center.</seg>
<seg id=974>Similar cases have also been observed in consultative committee a lead poisoning and prevention CDC, consultative committee a national human research protections and consultative committee a genetic test.</seg>
<seg id=975>The current epidemic ideology, where the advisory committees dissolved then are reformed with new members, and where the candidates are subject to test of honesty, seems overcome with some observers.</seg>
<seg id=976>Representatives of laid talked about as "practice fairly today.</seg>
<seg id=977>It is not a practice in America, or at least not until today.</seg>
<seg id=978>In any case, the fact that the Bush Administration makes jump from tests the candidates to key positions have to determine its compatibility with his "values" is hardly worrying.</seg>
<seg id=979>Development more serious concerns the degree of importance of the ideological investigations, which are brought in areas that far immune to this kind of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id=980>Indeed, the most revealing cases in the growing political epidemic may was the overhaul of the membership of slice of study by the National Institute of Health and safety at work, which reviews the subsidies to study of wounds that have occurred in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=981>The advisory committees could have been vulnerable to an occasional overhaul of this type in the past.</seg>
<seg id=982>After all, they recommended policies that politicians or not take into account.</seg>
<seg id=983>But sections of study?</seg>
<seg id=984>In October 2002, science published a editorial of David michaels and many of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id=985>Many of them were former officials distinguished who participated in some of the committees concerned and they gave a valuable views to the issue, based on their experience.</seg>
<seg id=986>Their article was a business itself, but the consequences that it had been more attractive.</seg>
<seg id=987>It began a theft of letters where scientists mentioned similar experiences.</seg>
<seg id=988>A candidate in muscular dystrophy research coordinating committee of the National Institute of Health told that an inquiry was carried out into it by a Member of the White House.</seg>
<seg id=989>After being invited to mention his views on the various policies of the Bush administration, which none of it had connection to the work of the Committee, it had to indicate whether it supported the President on embryonic stem cells.</seg>
<seg id=990>Another person having expressed, a professor of psychiatry distinguished and psychology told receiving a call from the White House concerning his appointment in national Council of drug abuse.</seg>
<seg id=991>Its interlocutor declared that it ought to be an investigation him in order to "whether his views may embarrass the President.</seg>
<seg id=992>According to Professor, questions are followed, the representative of the White House holding a card of rating.</seg>
<seg id=993>Example: "You got two out of three; the President is opposed to exchange for intravenous [for users of intravenous drugs] for moral reasons, whatever the result."</seg>
<seg id=994>Then the conversation took a turn even more alarming.</seg>
<seg id=995>The representative asked the candidate had they voted for Bush and, after having received a negative answer, he asked: 'why did you not support President? "</seg>
<seg id=996>This is connected with a dictatorship, not a democracy.</seg>
<seg id=997>The purpose of scientific advisory committees is providing advice impartial and thought to the political process.</seg>
<seg id=998>There is nothing to gain and much to lose, when a deliberate political result is proposed.</seg>
<seg id=999>This is why the determination of the research projects to be supported was always a matter to be evaluated objectively peer, not by politicians.</seg>
<seg id=1000>Indeed, the law that applies here (the law on the federal advisory committees, federal advisory committee act) requires explicitly that the committees be impartial and "not influenced the inappropriate by body with the power to appoint.</seg>
<seg id=1001>American Secretary to health and human services Tommy Thompson and staff office of the White House should set an example to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1002>They can do this very easily: while respecting the law.</seg>
<seg id=1003>Moscow in murder</seg>
<seg id=1004>It is time to end the fiction that the "dictatorship of law" of Vladimir Putin made post-communist Russia so itself little more law-abiding,.</seg>
<seg id=1005>The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of journalists among the best and most courageous of Russia, a woman who dared to come about the brutal killing made by Russian soldiers in Chechnya, is the ultimate proof that President Putin leads one banal dictatorship is evidence of ordinary disregard for the law.</seg>
<seg id=1006>It is time for the rest of the world to recognize this, especially for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1007>The German Foreign Minister of preparing a policy on relations between Russia and Germany, which should ratify the indifference to the lack of respect for the law expressed Putin as national interests of the most powerful member of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1008>But the indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin continue in this way in the international arena, as its current campaign shows to strangle Georgia economically.</seg>
<seg id=1009>The murder of Politkovskaya is a disaster taste of times: as in the days of glory of kbg in Putin's Russia people disappear, simply.</seg>
<seg id=1010>The assassination of Politkovskaya is the third apparently political murder in three weeks.</seg>
<seg id=1011>Enver ziganshin, chief engineer of BP Russia, was killed by ball with irkoutsk on 30 September.</seg>
<seg id=1012>Andrei Kozlov, her of the Central Bank of Russia which has a campaign against financial fraud, was murdered on 14 September.</seg>
<seg id=1013>The fact that Prosecutor Russia's Yuri tchaïka takes the investigation into the murder of Politkovskaya in hand, as it has the Kozlov, is not a source of hope, as would be the case in a true democracy if such a senior involved himself in a survey.</seg>
<seg id=1014>Indeed, involvement of the highest levels of government in Russia is almost an assurance that the murderer will never be found.</seg>
<seg id=1015>The murder of Politkovskaya is a particularly sinister well when it is considered that issued virulent criticism made of the Russian President.</seg>
<seg id=1016>In its articles for one some newspapers still independent of Moscow, novaïa gazeta, in his book "Russia's Putin: life in a failing democracy" and "a dirty war: a Russian journalist Chechnya" Politkovskaya commented on the removal of freedoms that signs under President Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1017>That shows the fate of former exiles businessmen Boris berezovski and Vladimir gusinki, and that of the oil magnate jailed Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the fate of enemies of Putin can take three forms: the exile, the prison or fall.</seg>
<seg id=1018>I am not accusing the government of Putin has ordered the killing of Politkovskaya.</seg>
<seg id=1019>After all, as an investigative journalist out is mad many others besides Putin, including the current Prime Minister Chechen Ramzan Kadyrov is not the least, that it was to achieve a policy of kidnapping to ransom.</seg>
<seg id=1020>But even if the associates, Vladimir Putin had nothing to do with the murder by ball of Politkovskaya in a lift its building from central Moscow, its disregard for the law created climate in which murder took place.</seg>
<seg id=1021>The image of the murder of Thomas Beckett in his Cathedral of Canterbury there are many centuries, the crime was committed with clear conviction that the King of it would be satisfied.</seg>
<seg id=1022>Given what Politkovskaya represented - responsibility for a democratic press to call into question the Kremlin and its policies - the government should have made sure that would happen to him nothing.</seg>
<seg id=1023>Putin's Russia already lost 12 prominent journalists, murdered during the past six years.</seg>
<seg id=1024>None of these crimes was yet, which would not be the case if the "dictatorship of law" of Putin were more than simply a public relations strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1025>The six years that have passed since the arrival of Vladimir Putin's Kremlin were marked by deeply contradictory signals.</seg>
<seg id=1026>On the one hand, the world is a young graduate leader committing himself to modernize Russia, particularly bringing law enforcement and legal practices to international standards.</seg>
<seg id=1027>On the other side, the President is only look and saying nothing while his former colleagues of Russian Security Service (FSB, the former KGB) not protected those made kill, and even launch a series of cases of espionage notorious against ecological journalists, scientists and activists.</seg>
<seg id=1028>Among these "prefixed spies" seem the journalist Gregori Pasko, expert in arms control Igor soutiagine, diplomat Valentin moiseïev, physicist Valentin Danilov and others.</seg>
<seg id=1029>The influence supposedly civilizing that implies is a Western partner, over a G8 summit Saint Petersburg, for example, appears to count for nothing in cabal the Kremlin Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1030>Once again, from the values of the West brought about another Potemkin village; Russia has a facade of laws and democratic rules, but behind this one board decoration are the same up arbitrary making law.</seg>
<seg id=1031>Globally, the danger is that failure to laws expressed Putin is exported.</seg>
<seg id=1032>Near the Russian border, a form of criminalised diplomacy is in train of root.</seg>
<seg id=1033>Consider how Putin tried to rig the elections in Ukraine, and the charges without being stopped and taken against the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko.</seg>
<seg id=1034>Consider the secessionist regions play the mavericks in Moldova and Georgia, that exist only because they have the support of the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1035>Look as Kremlin seeks to sing its neighbours by threatening their energy supplies.</seg>
<seg id=1036>All policemen know when it is ignoring the behavior of criminals, those only become more audacious.</seg>
<seg id=1037>It is high time that the world recognizes Vladimir Putin for what it is: a man who brings Russia to the country's shadow.</seg>
<seg id=1038>The world must now contemplate the old Latin maxim which tacet consentere videtur: silence means consent, and whether it is really wise to happily grant construction by Putin a superpower energy where the law does not matter.</seg>
<seg id=1039>A gas pipeline to strengthen empire of Russia</seg>
<seg id=1040>Gerhard Schröder, less than one month ago, was still German Chancellor agreed to become President of the company responsible for construction d a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany across the Baltic and Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1041>In many countries, Schröder would easily demonstrated offence of conflict of interest.</seg>
<seg id=1042>Its apparent moral failure is amplified by the fact that at the same time, Russia is threatening to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine if it does not yield to the tariff demands of Gazprom, gas giant state ownership of the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1043>The strategic goal of Russia is obvious., no longer to distribute a gas to Ukraine also means much of Europe will not be supplied longer, because most big pipeline across Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id=1044>, bypassing the Baltic Ukraine, Poland and, of course, states, new pipeline will strengthen the influence of Kremlin again that seeks to be essential in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1045>President Vladimir Putin and his government's clones of KGB will no longer have to worry about reactions of Western Europe when they decide with firmness put pressure on the postcommunist neighbors of Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1046>Should Europe really equip Putin with such weapon imperial?</seg>
<seg id=1047>Worse still, Russia will have to use this weapon to EU at its energy boot?</seg>
<seg id=1048>As a former German Chancellor is managing the firm will provide Russia way of handling the European economy testifies to the dangerous complacency in Europe against the ambitions euphoric of Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1049>Of course, Russia's media are aware of the growing dependence of Europe by reports on energy resources of Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1050>They go of délecter. Russian editorialists were written "when we integrate and increase our energy trade with Europe, it will have to keep silent on human rights."</seg>
<seg id=1051>Putin expressed this position in a more oblique way while being committed than he calls a "policy independence."</seg>
<seg id=1052>So is he simply saying that Russia must remain "independent" of the concerns of Western democracies regarding ethics and human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1053>There may be some European leaders really believe that maintaining the soft prosperity of EU justifies that we are silent about human rights and other issues that make the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1054>Of course, we must brief us on commercial 'issues, such as expropriation of Yukos. But, if the Kremlin came to parking our values and critical towards -- as about Chechnya bloodstained -- it would appear that Europeans would prefer to remain silent to face a potential rising energy prices or even a blockade, as that Ukraine is currently experiencing.</seg>
<seg id=1055>While Putin's Court home-office, and submitting the Duma to its will, the hopes of the EU to see Russia becoming increasingly "European" should be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=1056>Russia that Putin is building is transformed gradually it neglected its hopes of liberty post-Soviet becoming a oil and gas bulwark committed to new elite of the KGB.</seg>
<seg id=1057>Indeed, Matthias warnig, the director of the consortium's gas pipeline chaired by Schroeder, is an old friend of Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1058>Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal revealed that warnig, the director of the Russian arm of Versicherung Bank, is a former officer of Stasi, former secret police of East Germany, and that it met Putin in the late 1980s when the Russian President was KGB spy in the GDR.</seg>
<seg id=1059>The Russians accept a trained government of former KGB men who lack of compassion and the denial of dissidents are the rule, their exhaustion for the last 20 years reflects reasons.</seg>
<seg id=1060>Now the Kremlin estimates that what is good for basic Russians also for citizens of independent nations no pity is will not be granted to small weak countries once Russia will hold the way daunting them and keep them and threatening them from energy blockade.</seg>
<seg id=1061>As a former head of state of independent of Lithuania news, I was often face such threats.</seg>
<seg id=1062>The European Union signed many agreements with Russia, including a "common" area of freedom and justice.</seg>
<seg id=1063>The Kremlin is very strong to counterfeit such idealism.</seg>
<seg id=1064>Its control Eastern Europe has been imposed on the basis of the Treaty "friendship," and Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968 were "fraternal" missions.</seg>
<seg id=1065>But watch how Putin mockery this space a "common": this barbarous treatment of Chechens, the imprisonment of businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky, harassment of foreign NGOs and for Yuliya deputy, one of the egeries's Orange Revolution, by the Russian military judges on entirely invented charges.</seg>
<seg id=1066>If Europeans really believe in their common space of human rights and freedoms, they must nevertheless acknowledge that these values are not shared by the henchmen calculating of Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1067>The same applies in viewing Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=1068>Is it conceivable that the homeland of "red terror", countless unpunished crimes of the Soviet era and still dirty hands of the blood of the Lithuanians to Caucasians really can help to fight global threat held up by Iran and North Korea?</seg>
<seg id=1069>It seems more likely cold minds of the Kremlin will simply exploit every crisis to increase their capacity destruction and their influence.</seg>
<seg id=1070>For decades, the area of Europe I come was left at -- evil.</seg>
<seg id=1071>That is why I cannot remain silent when Europe fact indiscriminately in a new appeasement.</seg>
<seg id=1072>We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, learned from our history that behind every diplomatic act Russia's ambition imperial is hiding place.</seg>
<seg id=1073>Western Europeans, who have forgotten this story, should heed our warnings.</seg>
<seg id=1074>The dependence on Russia -- even if it takes the face of so-called "charismatic" Gerhard Schröder -- can only lead right in the wall.</seg>
<seg id=1075>Iraq: the bullets ballots against</seg>
<seg id=1076>When the war in Iraq began in 2003, the Bush administration cherished ambitious projects: the image of Germany and Japan one, long and peaceful occupation considered, during which the rise in oil production will ensure a both growing prosperity as democratic structures would be built point by point.</seg>
<seg id=1077>The base was to be a liberal Constitution even post-modern with run-up it the guarantee of 25% of parliamentary seats guaranteed women.</seg>
<seg id=1078>Current Iraq has neither peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1079>The Constitution to be voted on 15 October, this rule of 25%, but nothing Liberal.</seg>
<seg id=1080>The key provision (Article 2) stating that no law can contradict "the undisputed laws of Islam" violates the basic principles of parliamentary sovereignty, and will prevent the legislation in line with international standards.</seg>
<seg id=1081>For example, the age of consent to sexual relations for girls cannot high above nine years, because Mohammed itself had a nine-year old wife.</seg>
<seg id=1082>That means that some nine year old girls are also adult from criminal law, and feasible of capital punishment, for example, conversion with another religion.</seg>
<seg id=1083>The Shia can use this clause to put their ayatollahs above the elected Parliament, as in Iran, because they alone are allowed to determine the "laws" of Islam.</seg>
<seg id=1084>The Iraqi foreigners and few Liberals worry on this about Islamic clause, but the opposition to the Constitution, widespread among Sunnis, aims to other provisions: exclusion from the "party Saddamist Baath" of politics and administration, and the federalist provisions that granting autonomy to the 18 Iraqi provinces and allow them to join in regional governments.</seg>
<seg id=1085>The law of exclusion is a personal problem for the elites Sunnis, which include thousands of businessmen, Liberals, even of artists, who, with few exceptions, were all members of the Baath.</seg>
<seg id=1086>In theory, constitutional ban could not be retroactive.</seg>
<seg id=1087>In practice, however, the administrative laws are now being implemented to exclude members of the Baath so-called "of senior" of any form of employment to the government, which concerns thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id=1088>The Sunnis would probably accept the federalist provisions if they only applied to the Kurds.</seg>
<seg id=1089>They know that the alternative is a return to centralism but the Kurdish secession of three provinces with most dahuk, Arbil and as sulaymaniyah to form independent Kurdistan, with its own Treasury, its Army (pesh merga), and its oil production around Kirkuk, second largest holds in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=1090>The Sunnis reject this same federalism for Shia because they regard them as Arab compatriots who always accepted law Sunni in the past and will do so again, unless they have their own government.</seg>
<seg id=1091>This is what the new Constitution would allow, because the provinces in the south - which have the main Iraqi oil reserves - with Shiite majority could form their own regional government.</seg>
<seg id=1092>In the usual style of the Middle East, leaders Sunnis disappointed and the Constitution threaten now use of violence.</seg>
<seg id=1093>But the federalism is not the only reason why advocates of supremacy Sunni and Islamists launch attacks deadly.</seg>
<seg id=1094>Their opposition are more basic: they do not accept the principle of democratic government by majority.</seg>
<seg id=1095>Instead, they seek to restore the rule of Sunni minority.</seg>
<seg id=1096>For the Islamists, all Shia deserve death anyway, as goes.</seg>
<seg id=1097>A Shi'ite leader moqtada was - is also vehemently oppose the federalism.</seg>
<seg id=1098>His followers, largely illiterate, are poorest and most Shiite violent of slums in Baghdad and beyond, whose "Mahdi militia" resisted American troops in 2004, even while the Americans protected the Shia from attacks Sunnis.</seg>
<seg id=1099>As a young priest draws its authority from his father, a Ayatollah died populist itself, was face opposition living Iraqi ayatollahs, who disdain his ignorance and his violence.</seg>
<seg id=1100>Was absolutely cannot compete in terms of religious authority, so it chooses to take a party Arab nationalist against them, often stress that most Shi'ite religious dignity, Ayatollah Sistani, no Arab but Persian.</seg>
<seg id=1101>Similarly, it is his followers that El Laâlam, which runs the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution to Iraq (sciri) and their militias "Badr" were exiled subsidized in Iran, where many fought Iranian side during the long a bitter Iran-Iraq war, until Americans "bring back them."</seg>
<seg id=1102>Was opposes the federalism because a Shiite regional government would obey its enemies, Sistani and sciri, and says, would fall within the Iranian umbrella.</seg>
<seg id=1103>To stress his message, was sent his men to fight the Badr militias, successfully in Baghdad, where mahdis are many, but not in Najaf, where was is who after destruction it caused last year until his men are massacred by the Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1104>; it was difficult enough to face was the Mafia-like. Now, a mere political calculation suggests that it will undoubtedly be the main character to determine the outcome of the vote of the Constitution of October.</seg>
<seg id=1105>To reject the Constitution and to create new elections to a constitutional assembly, opponents need a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces.</seg>
<seg id=1106>The Sunnis are likely to win only in two provinces, but if was orders to its supporters slums of Baghdad to vote no to local Sunni, it will undoubtedly bring down capital into the hands of the opposition to the Constitution and will ensure his defeat.</seg>
<seg id=1107>Like all political rogue, was is naturally to sell.</seg>
<seg id=1108>Last year it was required for murder.</seg>
<seg id=1109>Today it seeks recognition as a statesman, he wants money, and at least implicitly, humiliation of Sistani and sciri.</seg>
<seg id=1110>He can very receive proposals and negotiations perhaps has begun.</seg>
<seg id=1111>But some of the Shias whom he attacks with words and bullets have thousands of armed men at their disposal and for them, it deserves just bullets in return.</seg>
<seg id=1112>The end of secrecy</seg>
<seg id=1113>Transparency is not always an easy exercise in the new democracies of Eastern Europe is Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany discovered, when a registration in which he declared the lies of his government began riots.</seg>
<seg id=1114>Such as Hungary, Romania post-communist worked to encourage open and honest in a society that once numbered among the most closed in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1115>But the persistence of a culture of secrecy exploded corruption and abuses of power.</seg>
<seg id=1116>Yet we noticed a real move towards greater transparency, evolution recognized by the European Union gave the green light for Romania to join the beginning of 2007.</seg>
<seg id=1117>In addition to setting up what the EU is now for a "functioning market economy," essential reforms in the political and legal, for which I am responsible, move to strengthen the transparency and control of the funding of political parties for the reform of the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id=1118>The legal reform contribute to uproot corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1119>Ministers and former ministers, members of Parliament, magistrates, lawyers, and members of the police, customs and other public bodies, as well as leaders of private companies, were into scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id=1120>Moreover, new forms were developed for the declaration of assets and financial interests by people occupation of official functions in government, in Parliament, public administration and local and judiciary.</seg>
<seg id=1121>The new methods of declaration are most detailed in Europe, and above all they are made public.</seg>
<seg id=1122>Progress of Romania is confirmed by a report published this month, that the Eastern European citizens now have access to government information as well as those of established democracies of long.</seg>
<seg id=1123>The report transparency and silence, open society justice initiative (available on www.justiceinitiative.org - even states that the new democracies are sometimes better than the old: some Romanian government bodies responding to requests for information of citizens over their French or Spanish counterparts.</seg>
<seg id=1124>More precisely, 60% of the demands are content in Romania, against 31% in France and 24% in Spain.</seg>
<seg id=1125>Among other good rules, we can cite Peru and Mexico, two countries that adopted legislation on freedom of information in 2002, shortly after Romania.</seg>
<seg id=1126>But it is not always easier access to sensitive information in democracies of transition.</seg>
<seg id=1127>I worked as counsel for the defence of human rights in the Romanian Helsinki Committee, and we often have to grasp the courts to demand on communication under the Romanian law in 2001 for freedom of information.</seg>
<seg id=1128>For example, when we formally gained access to data on telephone tapping allowed by the prosecutor, he has simply ignored this decision.</seg>
<seg id=1129>We attacked it with civilians, the judge fixed a fine for every day that goes by information.</seg>
<seg id=1130>Only when the media were interested in trade, that data - many eavesdropping allowed during the previous ten years, people and duration of the operations, were made public.</seg>
<seg id=1131>Romania then finally started to look back on a past marked by the omnipresence of Securitate.</seg>
<seg id=1132>I am one of government today, and I realize that it is always difficult to share some information to the public.</seg>
<seg id=1133>But it is painful reforms are needed.</seg>
<seg id=1134>We would not have led to the good economic and political reform that will enable us to join the EU without submitting our policies to the scrutiny of public and not accepting the increased participation of citizens in the decision-making that inevitably accompanies such openness.</seg>
<seg id=1135>Indeed, access to information became a prerequisite of democracy throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id=1136>When the US embraced Freedom of Information Act in 1996, they were only in Sweden and Finland.</seg>
<seg id=1137>Today, 65 countries have such legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1138>In Romania, who fought for the adoption of a law on freedom of information derive Party fully.</seg>
<seg id=1139>According to the study of Justice initiative, people who apply to the Romanian Government receive without much difficulty of information that would have been unthinkable to communicate a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id=1140>So the Romanian Department of Defense revealed the number of dead soldiers in 2003, as well as the circumstances (including 13 suicide, two deaths ball, two dead in fighting in Afghanistan).</seg>
<seg id=1141>Another example, the Court of Bucharest received a request concerning the number of judges have been subjected to disciplinary proceedings since the beginning of 2000, and the reasons for the possible sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=1142>The Court passed this request on to the Supreme Council of magistrates, which gave a comprehensive answer: four pages listing all the disciplined magistrates, reasons and measures.</seg>
<seg id=1143>This process is both the result and the engine of the pursuit of reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1144>Rulers were not always very at ease on openness, the battle is for the most sensitive documents.</seg>
<seg id=1145>But in Communist countries in the past, the benefits of transparency are undeniable.</seg>
<seg id=1146>However, the experience of Romania shows that official secrecy is always a risk that no country is immune, and that only a vigilance of every time can prevent it from undermining the foundations of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1147>Saving the trees of Life</seg>
<seg id=1148>Nobody can finish his day without having used a derivative of forest.</seg>
<seg id=1149>In a much more important than a generally believes, Paper it writes, running water our taps, medicines that look after us, drink whose our homes and our furniture all have come from forest.</seg>
<seg id=1150>Forests give us the air we breathe and shelter of species on the way out.</seg>
<seg id=1151>They also provide places to leisure, which is becoming increasingly important in the complexity of our world.</seg>
<seg id=1152>Roughly 1.5 billion people living in poor rural areas depend directly on forests for their basic requirements in food and firewood.</seg>
<seg id=1153>However, deforestation is.</seg>
<seg id=1154>Every year, we lose 14.6 million hectares of forest, or an area almost as big as four times Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id=1155>The irresponsible management of forests, enhanced by too weak regulations and government bonds, and the markets which reward illegal slaughter conspire to deprive the world's most threatened most precious forests and.</seg>
<seg id=1156>When forests are beginning to disappear, a set of environmental, social and economic problems usually follow, affecting all somehow.</seg>
<seg id=1157>The island of Sumatra in Indonesia is a good example.</seg>
<seg id=1158>The societies of pasta and papers undertake an endemic and illegal destruction forests which have the greatest diversity of plants in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1159>It is highly likely that still unknown plants will disappear in the process like the species on the way out as the rhino and elephant in Sumatra, orang outang.</seg>
<seg id=1160>When the forest Sumatra disappears, whole communities will also find without proper places of life or any decent means of earning a living.</seg>
<seg id=1161>Moreover, the distortion that the trade in illegal products and products cheap imposes on world markets East difficulties for responsible citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1162>Developing countries lose $15 billion tax revenues each year because of illegal slaughter.</seg>
<seg id=1163>To complicate the whole, the demand for wood for reconstruction following the tsunami of last year, an already unsustainable demand for the forests in Sumatra intensified.</seg>
<seg id=1164>The basins of Amazon and Congo are the object of similar threats.</seg>
<seg id=1165>A recent study of the UN, assessment of the ecosystems for millennium (em), shows that the forests and other areas important know a serious decline due to mismanagement and will continue to disappear if the serious protective measures are not in place.</seg>
<seg id=1166>Information published by the Brazilian government shows that deforestation of unique forests in the Amazon, because agricultural conversions, reached 2.6 million hectares last year, which changes the total area of deforestation of Amazon to 17%.</seg>
<seg id=1167>However, the battle against deforestation is not yet lost.</seg>
<seg id=1168>Various organizations, movements defense and businesses concerned about the state of the world forests are working together to reverse the phenomenon of deforestation and improving forest management.</seg>
<seg id=1169>For example, the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) and the World Bank has helped the Brazilian Government to launch an initiative aimed at establishing new protection areas of forest over 17 million hectares as a national parks.</seg>
<seg id=1170>The cooperation of the WWF and the World Bank also motivated other partners to establish funds of trust to manage these protected areas with life.</seg>
<seg id=1171>Similarly, a summit meeting of the leaders of the countries of the Congo Basin allowed cross-border cooperation for the conservation of forests and their enlightened management.</seg>
<seg id=1172>This led later to the provision of $53 million by the State Department in the United States to promote the conservation of forests in Congo.</seg>
<seg id=1173>Since the first meeting of the leaders in 3.5 million hectares of protected areas were recently held in Congo Basin.</seg>
<seg id=1174>Nevertheless, given the aftermath of the Asian tsunami of last December, the weight of arguments provided by the em and statistics on the deforestation of the most critical areas, we should continue our efforts.</seg>
<seg id=1175>The World Bank and the World Wildlife Fund recently promised to work with the reduction of 10% of world rate deforestation for 2010 and work with the institutions of the public and private sectors to allow ambitious achievements on the conservation of forests.</seg>
<seg id=1176>The studies of the WWF show that if the world forests are divided between different uses, including the protection of certain areas, commercial management responsibility and restoration for forest landscapes, we can provide for world requirements in forest products while maintaining the environmental and social values essential for the future.</seg>
<seg id=1177>The managers of companies, governments, civil society organisations must play their part in achieving this vision.</seg>
<seg id=1178>The Saudis fanatics are?</seg>
<seg id=1179>The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia provided much questioning the prospects for survival of the House of Saud ruling and to consider whether the UK is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive or not.</seg>
<seg id=1180>For one reason or another, it seems that the Saudi society generated a current of violent fanaticism which draws its inspiration in extreme religious orthodoxy.</seg>
<seg id=1181>The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers who participated in the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US were Saudis around a deep-rooted perception of the UK as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.</seg>
<seg id=1182>In some ways, this perception is right, but it cannot be applied to the Saudi population as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=1183>On the contrary, it would be a serious mistake to suppose that fanatical Islamism entirely defines the Saudi attitudes towards religion.</seg>
<seg id=1184>Between 2001 and 2003, I was in a team carried out on a large scale of values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and Jordan.</seg>
<seg id=1185>Our results produced a surprisingly moderate image of the Saudi attitudes.</seg>
<seg id=1186>By comparison with respondents from other countries of the Middle East, the Saudis were less the monks of all in general, and their attitudes towards arranged marriages democracy and also indicate a moderate underlying sentiment.</seg>
<seg id=1187>Certainly in the four countries, religiosity spreads, more than 90% of respondents saying collectively they believe in God, a life after death, and in heaven and hell.</seg>
<seg id=1188>But the Saudis seem less than their Muslim religious fellow-believers.</seg>
<seg id=1189>Two sixty percent of the Saudis were described as religious individuals, against 82% of the Iranians, 85% of Jordanian and 98% of the Egyptians.</seg>
<seg id=1190>The Americans also seem to be more a religious that Saudis, 81%.</seg>
<seg id=1191>This gap can be explained in part by transnational differences on the meaning of the word "religiosity.</seg>
<seg id=1192>For example, the Americans can define the religiosity otherwise people of the countries of the Middle East, with perhaps an attachment less said with religious beliefs than in Islamic countries.</seg>
<seg id=1193>This may also justify partly of differences between Islamic countries.</seg>
<seg id=1194>But the gap between the Saudis on one side and the Iranians, Jordanians and Egyptians of other regarding religiosity autodéfinie, is so great that it turns the widespread perception of highly conservative religious and Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=1195>Indeed, actions speak louder than words: only 28% of the Saudis stated that they seen weekly religious services, on 27% from Iranians, 44% of Jordanian, 42% of the Egyptians and 45% of Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1196>These conclusions, although their with popular perceptions of the Saudi culture, are less surprising that they do not they may seem.</seg>
<seg id=1197>The -- of religion support long that in a monolithic religious environment, or when the religious institutions are closely related to the State, the total religiosity in population decline.</seg>
<seg id=1198>It is sensible to think that when the authorities of the State apply rigid behavioural codes, people tend to rebel and moving away from the formally ratified religious institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1199>Little wonder, then, but the Egyptians and Jordanians, who live in countries in which the state does not apply worldview, are more religious than the Iranians or the Saudis, who have to live with police of local "virtue" supported by the State.</seg>
<seg id=1200>Even on the question of marriage, many Saudis expressed surprisingly Liberal views.</seg>
<seg id=1201>The respondents were divided almost equally on arranged marriages, half supports the idea that marriage must be based on parental consent, against 48% which saw the love as bases marriage.</seg>
<seg id=1202>Given the segregation of gender and absent dominance anchored, this outcome seems to reveal a strong desire of individual choice more demonstrated in what has been, traditionally, a family decision.</seg>
<seg id=1203>Finally, the Saudis are fierce supporters of democracy, contradict again the widespread image of Saudi conservatism.</seg>
<seg id=1204>On all the Saudis questioned, 58% regarded democracy as the best form of government, 23% were in dispute and 18% have not spoken.</seg>
<seg id=1205>The massive support for democracy in a country without secular and nationalist history seems against intuitive.</seg>
<seg id=1206>In fact, support for democracy is several other liberal attitudes that we saw in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=1207>Advocates of democracy tend to be less religious, more secular, more tolerant towards more critical of the actions of the public sector, and more worried by western cultural invasion.</seg>
<seg id=1208>Beyond the data of study, history has shown that the liberal ideas becoming more widespread when a despotic monarch controls in supporting a religious institution.</seg>
<seg id=1209>A strong running of liberalism appeared in the late nineteenth century in Ottoman Syria in response to the religious despotism of Sultan suggests.</seg>
<seg id=1210>At the same time, a secular movement anticlerical in the name of constitutional politics arrived in Iran, reaction to absolutist alliance between shahs quajar and religious institution.</seg>
<seg id=1211>In the light of similarities between these previous historical and current conditions in Saudi Arabia should not dismiss the possibility of reform.</seg>
<seg id=1212>The data of study also suggest that the Saudis could demand well more transparent policy and a religion least interventionist.</seg>
<seg id=1213>Museum the European</seg>
<seg id=1214>At the end of the nineteenth century, Asia represented for Europeans an artistic source of inspiration and the target of imperialist ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1215>Instead, Europe was a symbol of modernity -- for Japan's Japan era -- or decline -- for China.</seg>
<seg id=1216>A century later, because of the Japanese economic miracle, Europeans considered at least a small part of Asia as a focus of technological progress and industrial fast.</seg>
<seg id=1217>Today, at the dawn of the 21st century, mutual perceptions of Europe and Asia are changing radically, with thriving Asian economies and an EU undergoing identity crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1218>Some important Asian figures such as former Singaporean prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, launch warnings to Europeans: if they remain healthy, their continent soon no longer interest but for high-end tourism and real estate.</seg>
<seg id=1219>An influential Chinese businessman, who shares his time between Hong Kong and London, was even more specific.</seg>
<seg id=1220>He said a few weeks ago, during a demonstration private meeting in Paris's political leaders and of big business: "You are becoming third world you are wasting your time with the constitution, the welfare state, the crisis of the funding of pensions, and you systematically bring the wrong answers to the questions you raised.</seg>
<seg id=1221>The idea that Europeans are made of Asia in general, and of China in particular, is more complex. It goes from clear-sighted adaptation to a new respectable competitor, with the simple ideological rejection.</seg>
<seg id=1222>In mai1968, some French students took to the streets to invent a new world dreamed of Mao's China, a country but plunged into brutal and foolish cultural revolution.</seg>
<seg id=1223>This absurd passion was the result both of ignorance of the crimes of the regime Maoist from boredom felt in a prosperous society close to full employment.</seg>
<seg id=1224>Today, their heirs criticize Asian capitalist model openly.</seg>
<seg id=1225>China, once star anti-capitalist of revolutionary utopian, became the ultra-liberal enemy feared by a new generation of utopian reactionary in defending the status quo in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1226>The students who expressed recently on the streets of Paris do not want to emulate the Chinese and the Indians; they refuse the logic of globalization and abandonment of hard-won social benefits.</seg>
<seg id=1227>The attitude of the European economic elites is different.</seg>
<seg id=1228>They have understood that their time post-colonial conceptions of nostalgia, that China and India will be large markets exports and huge tanks of cheap labour, are obsolete.</seg>
<seg id=1229>These countries become real competitors worthy of respect, even of admiration.</seg>
<seg id=1230>Quality, the costs and delivery times - the car industry for example - are reaching the European level.</seg>
<seg id=1231>Europe retains an advantage in scientific disciplines and for the pharmaceutical industry, but new all-powerful companies, especially in India, handle increasingly to recruit graduates of MIT and Harvard, -- through still lower labour costs -- to remain competitive in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1232>Unfortunately, if European leaders have acknowledged the Asian challenge, they failed to translate it into a lesson of realism, in a context of globalization irresistible, or in a call to arms in social and economic.</seg>
<seg id=1233>In fact, European politicians, with rare exceptions like Tony Blair, were too long in adapting to roar developments in Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1234>Deprived of long-term strategy, obsessed with short-term interests, the European politicians - unlike the business leaders - did not win respect for their Asian counterparts.</seg>
<seg id=1235>Is that, on a continent that failed to burying the past and leaving the spectrum of nationalism, the EU is a model for reconciliation, peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1236>But can this image survive a pursuit of decline?</seg>
<seg id=1237>For the Asians, European model can become a political version of Venice: a place one visits with nostalgia for size passed, like a admirably Museum.</seg>
<seg id=1238>Blue and red</seg>
<seg id=1239>The appointment of Condoleezza Rice at as US Secretary of State Colin Powell to replace shows that the recent presidential elections still have powerful repercussions.</seg>
<seg id=1240>It is important that the Americans but also especially the rest of the world understand what these elections expose us of America.</seg>
<seg id=1241>The presidential election of this year shows that American démocracie is healthy, and that some things would benefit from being improved.</seg>
<seg id=1242>Unlike the election of 2000, where President Bush had not received the support of the popular vote and barely won the vote of the electoral college, Bush won of 3.5 million voice this time.</seg>
<seg id=1243>While some Democrats remain bitter, the legitimacy of the victory of Bush cannot be questioned.</seg>
<seg id=1244>America is strongly divided between States, red Republican, and blue, democratic states.</seg>
<seg id=1245>If 100,000 votes had awry in the red state Ohio, John Kerry would become President (despite a minority popular vote).</seg>
<seg id=1246>The electoral college was incorporated the US Constitution protecting small States in the federal system and this means today that the campaign is now widely over a dozen States at most, battle areas where public opinion is closely divided.</seg>
<seg id=1247>Fundamentally, there is something incredible in the election of Presidents without popular majority.</seg>
<seg id=1248>So it is time to discuss amendment to the Constitution to abolish electoral college.</seg>
<seg id=1249>Some observers complain rhetoric and negative advertisements good to to be divisive that characterized this campaign.</seg>
<seg id=1250>It must be appreciated from in historical terms.</seg>
<seg id=1251>At the time of the founding fathers, newspapers easily took Party and George wahsington was appalled by tough political language.</seg>
<seg id=1252>For most of its premium history, let alone the civil war and the period of reconstruction, the country was closely as divided as it is today and bitter rhetoric of campaigns always reflected this narrow competition.</seg>
<seg id=1253>Nevertheless, despite the negative advertisements on both sides, the three TV national debates raised important questions in a serious format and were largely followed.</seg>
<seg id=1254>In general, any President enjoying economic growth may all be re-elected.</seg>
<seg id=1255>In this sense, the real surprise in's re-election Bush was low margin of a majority.</seg>
<seg id=1256>Primarily, that is due to the unpopularity of the Iraq war.</seg>
<seg id=1257>Kerry tried to turn the war, the low job creation, inadequate medical cover and tax assets of Bush towards favored classes of the key issues in the campaign but some observers felt that failed to send a clear message.</seg>
<seg id=1258>Bush against it with security against terrorism and a cultural populism of certain issues like homosexual marriage and abortion.</seg>
<seg id=1259>Finally, cultural populism and security carried it against economic populism.</seg>
<seg id=1260>The interpretation of election was influenced by the investigations of outcome of the polls at which voters were to vote (after voting) about matters ontle more numbered.</seg>
<seg id=1261>The majority (22%) replied "moral values", by comparing only 20% the economy and 19% terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=1262>The social conservatives interpreted this as meaning that they had won the election of Bush and that their program was to dominate his second term.</seg>
<seg id=1263>But a Pew poll conducted a week after the election indicated that the category of "moral values" espoused a variety of issues besides the rights to abortion and gay marriage.</seg>
<seg id=1264>Indeed, polls show that 25% of public defend homosexual marriage and 35% are for the legal civil unions of gay couples (position that Kerry defended).</seg>
<seg id=1265>Nevertheless, for the 37% who are opposed to homosexual marriage especially in red states in the center of the country, the question helped to bring the supporters of Bush to put them to the polls.</seg>
<seg id=1266>The question is, overall, if the US is divided beyond hope.</seg>
<seg id=1267>The electoral map of red and blue States gave rise to Internet jokes and cartoons on the secession of both blue shores of with red center of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1268>Some call this "côtopie."</seg>
<seg id=1269>But divisions are not so clear.</seg>
<seg id=1270>In the two camps, many States were won by a small margin and if rather round the cards by county than by State, most of the countries turn to the combined one.</seg>
<seg id=1271>Cities against suburbs and rural areas would be a better description of the situation instead of côtes against heart of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1272>Indeed, public opinion polls show that the majority of Americans are concentrated in the moderate center of the political spectrum rather than the two extremes.</seg>
<seg id=1273>But the political elites like the political activists and the Members of Congress suggest extremists more that public.</seg>
<seg id=1274>At first glance, this seems surprising, since they should feel attracted by center, rich in voice.</seg>
<seg id=1275>However, many Members of Congress districts are have acquired their party and the real threat to their re-election is the preliminaries parties, dominated by the militant wings and most extreme of parties.</seg>
<seg id=1276>This trend is reinforced by the rise of cable, which attracts the viewers around controversial information programmes, entertainment and writers, who Internet called blogs, to debate an without ruling filter.</seg>
<seg id=1277>A reform which would help to change the borders of the districts of competitive congresses to return them permettrer response to this problem, but few are chosen will vote such changes that would increase the risk of their defeat.</seg>
<seg id=1278>The low margin of results suggests that Bush is not really the term the change that he thinks it has won.</seg>
<seg id=1279>Given the difficult issues of tax, foreign policy and dociale, it would be wise to turn the focus rather than to reconcile its conservative basis, but the policy that prevails between the conviction or pragmatic policy remains uncertain.</seg>
<seg id=1280>Let us get oil?</seg>
<seg id=1281>The Chancellor Angela Merkel in combating global warming the main priority of the German presidencies of the European Union and the G8 begin in January.</seg>
<seg id=1282>Its specific proposal is rather general so the leaders take it into account and accept it, quite clear that the other governments and businesses includes; at the next G8 summit, it will simply be a date from which the vehicles running on petrol will be registered longer in large industrial countries.</seg>
<seg id=1283>This decision will have considerable at geopolitics and economic positive impact.</seg>
<seg id=1284>Today, real concern regarding energy is not associated with reduced in global oil supplies, but to the decline of internal production of large consumers -- Europe, the US and China -- when the growing demand from Asia burdens market.</seg>
<seg id=1285>The reserves available will focus more in the Middle East, because those of other parts of the world will soon dry.</seg>
<seg id=1286>Moreover, the major oil exporters are not prepared to subject their policies of investment to market rates.</seg>
<seg id=1287>Saudi Arabia wants only to manage its oil production and, in turn, Iran is fear to potential investors with its bureaucratic obstacles and its corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1288>Iraq is a lack of security, while foreigners are failure at every attempt investment in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1289>These four states contain half of the world's oil reserves, two-thirds of which could potentially be exported.</seg>
<seg id=1290>These factors, except the production costs, are the cause of high oil prices and the race for contracts in Africa and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1291>The fact of believing that the increase in oil prices is good for the environment does not take account of data points of international politics.</seg>
<seg id=1292>First, in most poor countries of Africa and Asia, oil imports is more of the national spending than in the industrialized countries, which means that economic growth and social development are compromise, and that new crises of debt threaten.</seg>
<seg id=1293>The incomes of oil production block reforms in the major exporting countries.</seg>
<seg id=1294>Through strengthening them financial power, regimes such as Venezuela and Iran feel less and less forced by international rules.</seg>
<seg id=1295>Recent newcomers among large consumer countries energy, like China, repeat the old habits of the industrial West and its long tradition of closing our eyes to the human rights violations, in order to ensure lucrative contracts with authoritarian regimes and oil-rich.</seg>
<seg id=1296>Only the economic and political heavyweights, industrial countries who are by far the biggest oil consumers can effect change worldwide.</seg>
<seg id=1297>It is important to start with the transport sector, which today represents more than half of oil consumption -- proportion is set to rise in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1298>So, the G8 must agree not to place new cars more drive for petrol as 2025.</seg>
<seg id=1299>This decision is not directed against mobility, but against the waste of a scarce resource having to serve primarily to produce synthetic materials.</seg>
<seg id=1300>Politicians should not privilege such technology.</seg>
<seg id=1301>They should rather encourage car industry to develop alternative technologies which use biofuels, ethylene, hydrogen and even natural gas, for a transitional period.</seg>
<seg id=1302>The countries that opened the way for the political will, such as a collateral benefit, implement national industries first in technology energy to ensure later markets.</seg>
<seg id=1303>The important expected of CO2 reduction could eventually lead to progress needed for international policy on climate.</seg>
<seg id=1304>Economic development also comes into play: if we look after our "dependence" with oil, poor and less developed countries and the new industrial countries, could have more, which would bring down prices and would calm the energy competition.</seg>
<seg id=1305>In geopolitical terms, the benefits would be just as evident, particularly large oil exporting countries would be much less to sing the industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg id=1306>This turnaround would increase the negotiating power of the international community in the Middle East and would strengthen the social forces in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia, which seriously want to promote the economic and political reform from within.</seg>
<seg id=1307>Large producing cars and country with advanced technology, Germany is well placed to launch such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id=1308>Angela Merkel, who holds a Ph.D. in physics and began his political career in the post of minister of the environment - over in 1995 the first Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change -- would be more credible than any of his colleagues in the EU and G8 to address the problem.</seg>
<seg id=1309>It is high time to achieve a political act of bravery.</seg>
<seg id=1310>The myth of humanitarian aid and trade</seg>
<seg id=1311>Humanitarian aid and trade became words international.</seg>
<seg id=1312>Increased aid (accompanied by a relief debt) and greater access to the markets of rich countries for products in poor countries: that now seems to have been the first place on the international agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1313>Indeed, the debate today is not longer on measures to, but the quantity of measures to be taken and that speed.</seg>
<seg id=1314>Lost in all: clear should learn from the past five decades of economic development.</seg>
<seg id=1315>At the forefront of these lessons, we learn that economic development is largely left in the hands of poor nations themselves.</seg>
<seg id=1316>Countries that managed well in the recent past has through their own efforts.</seg>
<seg id=1317>Humanitarian aid and the markets have only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id=1318>Take the example of a developing country which States and free access to the preferential market its largest neighbour, which is also the most powerful economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1319>Suppose moreover than this country is able to send millions of its citizens to work on the other side, receives a huge volume of foreign investment and or completely integrated into the international production lines.</seg>
<seg id=1320>Moreover, the banking system of the country is supported by its close rich and his willingness to act as lender of last resort.</seg>
<seg id=1321>Isn't globalization may arise under better auspices only these?</seg>
<seg id=1322>Consider a second country now.</seg>
<seg id=1323>It faces a trade embargo on the largest global market, receives no foreign aid or any form of support from the Western world, is excluded from international organisations such as the WTO and cannot borrow at the IMF and World Bank.</seg>
<seg id=1324>If these external handicaps were not sufficiently debilitating, can be added an economy that maintaining himself of barriers against international trade (in the form of trade State, barriers and quantitative restrictions on imports).</seg>
<seg id=1325>As the reader may guess, these countries really exist: it is of Mexico and Vietnam.</seg>
<seg id=1326>Mexico shares a 3 200 miles long border with the US, which offers not only the privileged access to a market of goods and labour, but also to a share of the financial resources of the state American (as the experience of the crisis of the peso in 1995 made demonstration).</seg>
<seg id=1327>By contrast, America kept its ban trade against Vietnam until 1994, not restore its diplomatic relations before 1995 and granted the status of most-favoured-nation to the Vietnamese imports only many years later.</seg>
<seg id=1328>Vietnam has yet enter WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1329>Let us consider their economic performance.</seg>
<seg id=1330>Since the signing of the NAFTA in December 1992, Mexico's economy has an average annual increase in little more than 1% per capita.</seg>
<seg id=1331>Not only that figure is well below the rate of the champions of Asian economy, but only a fraction of clean growth performance in Mexico's decades before the crisis by debt 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).</seg>
<seg id=1332>Vietnam, however, have an annual increase of 5.6% per capita since the beginning of its economic reforms in 1988 and the restoration of diplomatic relations with the US in 1995, experienced a continuing rapid growth at the rate of 4.5% since.</seg>
<seg id=1333>Vietnam witnessed a dramatic decline in poverty while Mexico experienced a cut in real wages.</seg>
<seg id=1334>Both countries have experienced a marked take-off of international trade and foreign investment, but the picture is very contrasted where it matters most: in the improvement of living standards, especially among the poor.</seg>
<seg id=1335>What these examples show is that domestic efforts overshadow all other elements in the determination of economic fortunes of a country.</seg>
<seg id=1336>What the American market had offer Mexico could not offset the consequences of policy mistakes on the internal market, especially the inability to reverse the true appreciation of the exchange rate of the peso or to expand productivity gains achieved in a narrow sector activities of exports to the rest of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1337>What matters most is the adoption by a country with a strategy of appropriate growth.</seg>
<seg id=1338>Without the benefits which Mexico benefited, Vietnam pursued a strategy against the diversification of its economy and improving the productive capacity of domestic suppliers.</seg>
<seg id=1339>The total experience of the post-war supports the evidence that domestic policies are most important.</seg>
<seg id=1340>South Korea took off in the early 1960's, not when foreign subsidies were their height, but when they began to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id=1341>Taiwan has not enjoy foreign subsidies or privileged access to certain markets.</seg>
<seg id=1342>China and India, economic a superstar's time, largely flourished through their own efforts of economic reform.</seg>
<seg id=1343>It is tempting to the back of the foreign demand for its exports rare African successes, Botswana and Mauritius (respectively diamonds and clothing), but this cannot go very far.</seg>
<seg id=1344>Obviously, these two countries would be much poorer without access to foreign markets.</seg>
<seg id=1345>But, as in every case of successful development, which distinguish them are not external benefits they enjoyed but their ability to exploit these benefits.</seg>
<seg id=1346>It is enough to see how others squandered the advantage that their natural resources to them.</seg>
<seg id=1347>The word "diamonds" especially does not give rise to the spirit an image of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.</seg>
<seg id=1348>Similarly, few areas of treatment export number throughout the world did not know the level of development seen in the Mauritius.</seg>
<seg id=1349>This does not release but rich countries of their obligation to help.</seg>
<seg id=1350>They can lead the hard to corrupt dictators, and share the financial information best and refusing to acknowledge the international contracts that they sign.</seg>
<seg id=1351>Likewise, increasing the number of workers in poor countries allowed to work in rich countries and a broader range of policies directed towards growth through relaxation of the rules and conditions of WTO imposed by the US would produce a greater impact on long-term development.</seg>
<seg id=1352>It is not proven that enlargement of the market access and subsidies is the best use to make political capital of the Northern hemisphere.</seg>
<seg id=1353>The development should concentrate on improving the political environment in poor countries, rather than on aid and trade.</seg>
<seg id=1354>Interdependence</seg>
<seg id=1355>If the great Argentine economist Raul prebisch were living today, there is no doubt that it would ask if the world began to turn back.</seg>
<seg id=1356>Its largely influential theory of dependence argued that if poor countries was too much on commodity exports, they would never reach the industrial level needed to support rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id=1357>They are embourberaient in place in a cycle of global decline the prices of raw materials and reduction endless by incomes.</seg>
<seg id=1358>The preferred response of prebisch, protectionism, turned out to be disastrous for many countries of Latin America and Africa following it.</seg>
<seg id=1359>But the fact is that for years, prebisch appears to have had the reaction right about price trends in commodity in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=1360>The permanent efficiency gains in the areas of agriculture and the extraction of natural resources to lower the price of raw materials, especially in the 1980s and 1990s.</seg>
<seg id=1361>With few exceptions, countries that focused on commodity exports obtained only poor results, while Asian countries without a that little of resources made rapid progress.</seg>
<seg id=1362>Today however, with the Asian giants, India and China, which join the world economy, the price of petrol, gold, wheat and virtually all other commodity explode.</seg>
<seg id=1363>Yes, there will always be cycles (oil price, for example, may fall again before boosting its rise) but the long-term trend many materials will remain clear up for some time yet.</seg>
<seg id=1364>It is that some many negotiating trade and other decisions have not seem recognize still, while prebisch it should include immediately, be this sharp turnaround of contain some huge involvement in the global balance of power.</seg>
<seg id=1365>Indeed, any other aspect of economic globalization will launch moreover challenges to the world's leaders in the coming decades.</seg>
<seg id=1366>The questions are many.</seg>
<seg id=1367>Are the rich countries are now prepared to entering the period when co dependence, they will be as desperately asked for raw materials as the developing countries are to industrial products and technologies?</seg>
<seg id=1368>They are prepared with the inevitable flow of power and influence to raw material producer countries as those grow rich?</seg>
<seg id=1369>How the two superpowers of the world, China and the US, will manage the fact that important commodity exporting regions of Africa and the Middle East to Central Asia covered with nation-states poorly trained?</seg>
<seg id=1370>Some retired prophets expose the problem like the limits of nature reserves and claim that the most critical materials diminished at an alarming rate.</seg>
<seg id=1371>Today, many followers of the principle of "the peak of hubbert" of oil production, which argues that we reached higher limit of our production capacity, that wells are edge, and that things can only get worse.</seg>
<seg id=1372>But, as the distinguished historian Dan oil yergin indicates, the birds of ill omen protested that black gold resources were about to dry up at least four times already.</seg>
<seg id=1373>Each time, of radical technological progress leave these threats.</seg>
<seg id=1374>In the late years 1800, oil extraction involved to monitoring the stubborn.</seg>
<seg id=1375>Today, to on to 3,000 same under the land of the oceans seem natural to everyone.</seg>
<seg id=1376>Such progress has been made in the areas of extraction of metals and agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=1377>No, the world is facing a forthcoming commodity shortage.</seg>
<seg id=1378>Indeed, it happens that the integration of 2.5 billion people (whether China and India) in the world economy produces a movement of demand likely to put more pressure on the rise in the price of raw materials than any technological advantage may be able to balance.</seg>
<seg id=1379>Therefore, and at least 50 to 75, and possibly even humans begin on Mars over the centuries to come, prices many natural resources will rise.</seg>
<seg id=1380>The new balance of economic powers which will result will it destabilize the global political situation?</seg>
<seg id=1381>The first world war was partly began by a concern Germany at the monopolization by other colonial powers of too much of global oil and raw materials.</seg>
<seg id=1382>Similarly, during World War II, Japan's fears for the stability of its supplies from oil and other natural resources from abroad.</seg>
<seg id=1383>Will such tensions appear between China with uncertain resources (even water scarcity there is problematic) and the West?</seg>
<seg id=1384>Fortunately, this does not seem likely for now, especially given the approach as straightforward as pragmatic the problems of resources in their countries expressed China's leaders.</seg>
<seg id=1385>China's turn to regions like Africa in the hope of finding trading partners stable.</seg>
<seg id=1386>They do not share the political evangelism the Americans, who do not want to trade with commodity exporters, but also want to convert them.</seg>
<seg id=1387>And then there are the American leaders who talk to the US self-sufficient in terms of energy resources.</seg>
<seg id=1388>It is a joke: enough, perhaps, but self-sufficient, never.</seg>
<seg id=1389>A large part of the Arab world believes, and it is understandable that the invasion of Iraq is a cornerstone of the American strategy aimed at providing stable energy resources.</seg>
<seg id=1390>If they are right, one can only hope that America has a way of helping.</seg>
<seg id=1391>Meanwhile, the prices of raw materials will continue to rise, and the oil exporters to constitute the largest contributors to the open trade deficit in the US.</seg>
<seg id=1392>Perhaps the real American strategy is it trying to have the money oil exporting countries so that they will become dependent on happiness that they get in America!</seg>
<seg id=1393>This is a turning point that prebisch would not have expected.</seg>
<seg id=1394>The radical choice of Iran</seg>
<seg id=1395>The choice of the Iranians to power radical mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, risk alter relations with the West and stressing the isolation of the country at international level.</seg>
<seg id=1396>But in terms of domestic policy, the Islamic regime may be better than if a more moderate candidates had prevailed.</seg>
<seg id=1397>Clearly Ahmadinejad has a real basis for support.</seg>
<seg id=1398>The fact that it was in the form of populist, that he spoke to help the poor, condemned the government and almost acted as a candidate's opposition No matter: he embodied the choice of the regime, and ended up receiving an official help including against radical rivals.</seg>
<seg id=1399>The regime has great skill.</seg>
<seg id=1400>He turned the candidate little more pragmatic Rafsanjani -- in disagreement with government policies, a character in harmony with the established order and its own candidate as a rebel.</seg>
<seg id=1401>The government then used the resentment against the establishment to consolidate its own power.</seg>
<seg id=1402>Since former President, Mohamed Khatami, supported the reformist movement, but to me if it were not very bold and that in the end nothing done it only to highlight how leaders turned to their advantage the political situation.</seg>
<seg id=1403>Ahmadinejad is a representative of the youngest activists revolution anti-Western Shah of 25 years ago.</seg>
<seg id=1404>It is directly involved in the taking of American hostages in Iran, albeit not really know at that point.</seg>
<seg id=1405>Most worrying is close to the two main groups that are things more extremists of Iran: the body of the guardians of the Islamic revolution and basij organization.</seg>
<seg id=1406>The first is an army parall at the pro- regime; the second is an organization which as the opponents and whoever is to search for a more open society.</seg>
<seg id=1407>But this concern to see Iran at the hands of leaders even more radical is mixed by two factors.</seg>
<seg id=1408>First, Ahmadinejad probably will focus on national problem to systems evolved, and will try - no one can predict its chances of succ to's - to improve the lives of the poorest Iranians.</seg>
<seg id=1409>Second to decentralized, the group in power since the revolution will continue to follow the policies ideological and étrang at the.</seg>
<seg id=1410>The President has fewer powers than it they may seem, special to reviving is special to reviving overshadowed by guide supreme to me the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</seg>
<seg id=1411>Nevertheless, the election of Ahmadinejad cr at ment highlights the challenge that Iran is for Western policy and stability in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1412>First, to send the signal to elements plus extremists in Iran and to terrorist customers of the country -- Hezbollah Lebanese Palestinian, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, many small groups who act against Arab Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other countries -- which they have the green light to launch their attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1413>They will certainly believe that Iran will support them, but they do.</seg>
<seg id=1414>On Iran, often has relatively cautious, playing with covered the role of world silent partner of terror.</seg>
<seg id=1415>Iranian officials who could individually, to act to order and coordinate specific operations, will feel now freer to do so.</seg>
<seg id=1416>Moreover, Ahmadinejad openly provides an intensive program to nuclear weapons.</seg>
<seg id=1417>Most Iranian politicians at least those that allows the government to act in the open, support this agenda but support an approach more discr to reflects and cautious.</seg>
<seg id=1418>Rafsanjani, for example, is pass the establishment of better relations with the West before the breakthrough on the nuclear front.</seg>
<seg id=1419>If Ahmadinejad is's President nuclear Iran is more likely to use weapons in a risky ways of them.</seg>
<seg id=1420>This does not mean that it would use them, but rather than it would use of it at the end of diplomatic blackmail, making up the threats to the levels of crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1421>Since the Iranian leaders proclaim their daily desire to wipe Israel's card and fighting America (Ahmadinejad went to the image of a US flag, going to vote), the risk of confrontation has increased.</seg>
<seg id=1422>Finally, Ahmadinejad may be defies to jeopardize stability on Iraq, and his victory will encourage radical Iranian officials and the Iraqi extremists.</seg>
<seg id=1423>Iran send already many agents in Iraq and supports customers who seek to turn this country into cloning.</seg>
<seg id=1424>Iraqis, including the Shia Muslims, who follow the same to me version of Islam that Iranians, usually reject such interference.</seg>
<seg id=1425>More militant Iranian position can increase the friction with Iraq and to inspire there even more anti-US violence.</seg>
<seg id=1426>In short, the result of Iranian elections is dangerous, but to me if its potential create will depend on acts of Ahmadinejad and the degree of power that Khamenei will give.</seg>
<seg id=1427>Moreover, to deal with Iran also openly extremist and radical same to me by the crit to decades have a hard regime already -- will constitute a challenge not only for us but also for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1428>Will European countries continue to argue that militant rhetoric and provocations of Ahmadinejad have not and that it is possible to find a diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear ambitions?</seg>
<seg id=1429>With Rafsanjani, a real agreement or at least appearance of cooperation would have been easy to maintain.</seg>
<seg id=1430>But, with Ahmadinejad, there must be a huge amount of appeasement to keep to the tiniest diplomatic proceedings.</seg>
<seg id=1431>Some reformist and Iranian exiles welcome the election of Ahmadinejad, because they believe that his administration is more likely to demonstrate the real face of the regime and to doubt any hope of compromise of the West.</seg>
<seg id=1432>But it can also flown in succ to's regime to return to its advantage the dissatisfaction caused by a quarter to si to century of R to gne radical Islamists.</seg>
<seg id=1433>Regardless of the consequences, the victory of Ahmadinejad means for the West that do with Iran will become even more difficult.</seg>
<seg id=1434>Consider to poor, give the rich</seg>
<seg id=1435>President Bush seems about to ruin the American budget for years to come.</seg>
<seg id=1436>When President Bush took office, the forecasts anticipated budgetary surpluses as long as one might imagine.</seg>
<seg id=1437>Today, through a combination of irresponsible tax cuts launched by Republicans, an economic slowdown, the collapse of the bubble of the stock market and a massive increase in military spending, tax horizon is dominated by large deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1438>The worst is to come, because the Bush administration and Congress with Republican majority prepared to aggravate the fiscal mess.</seg>
<seg id=1439>The damage they will likely to weaken America and will increase instability of the international economy.</seg>
<seg id=1440>Usually, America's Republican Party defended the balanced budgets.</seg>
<seg id=1441>It changed the Reagan administration, when the conservative Republicans supported the tax cuts, even though it was done by large budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1442>President Reagan announced to the American people it could enjoy both tax cuts, the strengthening of the army and the pursuit of their spending programmes preferred.</seg>
<seg id=1443>The result, no surprise, was a series of important budget deficits and whose disposal took several years.</seg>
<seg id=1444>President George Bush senior as far as President Bill Clinton had to raise taxes to bring order to the chaos of the Reagan era.</seg>
<seg id=1445>These increases in taxes probably contributed to defeat of the President Bush senior by Bill Clinton in 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1446>But Clinton lacks decided to complete the process to restore fiscal balance, partly to safeguard the long-term funding from programs pension and social security.</seg>
<seg id=1447>When Clinton left the Presidency in 2000, the budget situation was best for decades.</seg>
<seg id=1448>Then came the President George Bush sons, ready to again Reagan with large tax cuts, a considerable increase in military spending and continuing and even the development of programs of popular spending.</seg>
<seg id=1449>The result was predictable.</seg>
<seg id=1450>In January 2001 the cumulative estimates for the years 2002 to 2011 anticipated a budget surplus of 5.6 trillion.</seg>
<seg id=1451>Mid-2002, these early surpluses disappeared.</seg>
<seg id=1452>In light of these new economic conditions, and in the shadow of the Iraq war, one would expect that the Bush administration and the Republican Congress are careful in defense of new tax cuts.</seg>
<seg id=1453>But far from it, their priority is to establish more tax cuts from which only the wealthy classes will benefit mainly.</seg>
<seg id=1454>At the same time, the government claims large increases in military expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1455>In the run-up to the presidential election of November 2004, we can be certain that no significant reduction in expenditure will intervene in peaceful programs.</seg>
<seg id=1456>So it seems that the massive budget deficits are for sustained.</seg>
<seg id=1457>If the domestic spending is simply constant, at a fraction of national income, next decade the cumulative estimates anticipate total deficit of 1.5 trillion.</seg>
<seg id=1458>But that figure could be optimistic because it probably takes account of the cost of a likely war against Iraq, neither another set of tax cuts, or the risk of increased interest rates for years to come.</seg>
<seg id=1459>Why the Republicans show do little about this mess?</seg>
<seg id=1460>Some Republicans are more concerned about the tax cuts for the wealthy classes than anything else.</seg>
<seg id=1461>Others think the deficits will bring by force of large reductions in domestic government spending, thus reducing the participation of the State, which is their wish expensive.</seg>
<seg id=1462>The problem of the latest analysis is that most of the taxpayers are attached to the social programs and large expenditure cuts will not easily.</seg>
<seg id=1463>The issue more intrigante remains to know why the Americans vote for such policies when they should know that it may result in the issues.</seg>
<seg id=1464>One of the possible responses is the fact that many voters do not wait for budgetary problems.</seg>
<seg id=1465>A better response is the fact that the majority of Americans have never actually voted for these policies.</seg>
<seg id=1466>The turnout of the election of 2002 was only 40% of the voters, only about half of 40% voted for the Republicans, or about 20% of people in voting rights.</seg>
<seg id=1467>Of course, the prospects not necessarily so dark.</seg>
<seg id=1468>The war against Iraq may be avoided.</seg>
<seg id=1469>The President-designate, of tax cuts may moderate or abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=1470>But I predict large budget deficits for years to come and a growing sense of unease within America and abroad about America's macroeconomic situation.</seg>
<seg id=1471>Foreign investors could decide to reduce their financing government budget and current account deficit of America in favorable terms.</seg>
<seg id=1472>The dollar may weaken, and fear of inflation could become even more marked.</seg>
<seg id=1473>This will lose confidence with policymakers in the US that will then be more flexible in responding to the economic shocks.</seg>
<seg id=1474>The disadvantaged classes, in the US and abroad, could suffer more, since President Bush and the Congress state with the American people and the world that are not available to deal with poverty, health and education, because of the large budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1475>If the average American doesn't open our eyes to these tax risks, the wealthy classes have another gift of several billion dollars in the country and global support them the harsh consequences for years to come.</seg>
<seg id=1476>Lessons withholding tax carelessness of America</seg>
<seg id=1477>George W. Bush has far more to destroy the economic policy of the US that all other presidents of American history, exceeding even its most, Ronald Reagan.</seg>
<seg id=1478>In just three years in office, he destroyed a fragile political consensus which requested ten years of effort and which may require another decade to be rebuilt.</seg>
<seg id=1479>In so doing, Bush risky economic health and social stability in the long term of America.</seg>
<seg id=1480>Given that the budgetary challenges in the long run that the US in a very clumsy way deals are not the only existing challenges, tax mistakes America's offer important lessons to others.</seg>
<seg id=1481>The main problem presented by fiscal policy is that politicians can easily make themselves temporarily popular reducing taxes and by increasing public spending by accumulating massive national debts and leaving their pay to future members.</seg>
<seg id=1482>This stratagem can some years, but the budget deficits and the growing debt impose earlier than expected a painful change of policy.</seg>
<seg id=1483>A cynic might yet buy his re-election and perhaps be party to retirement when the crisis comes.</seg>
<seg id=1484>One might imagine that after decades of similar episodes of political irresponsibility in countries around the world, voters would be allergic to such stratagem.</seg>
<seg id=1485>But Bush's claim again by buying a popularity today by distributing massive health tax cuts while simultaneously increased military spending and spending education.</seg>
<seg id=1486>The budget deficit thus obtained equivalent to more than 5% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=1487>Worse, the perspectives in the long-term for America were already worrying before Bush does not start to apply his imprudent policy.</seg>
<seg id=1488>American population is aging, so that the costs of pensions and health care systems publicly-funded will spiralling increase in.</seg>
<seg id=1489>Deeper calculations show that revenues which will be released through fiscal policies advocated by Bush may not reaching dozens of trillion dollars that represent the costs of public pensions, health care and other fiscal spending expected by the population.</seg>
<seg id=1490>For some time in the future, we must strongly increase tax collection, drastically to reduce public spending, or both, reducing the actions of Bush.</seg>
<seg id=1491>So why people support does its policies?</seg>
<seg id=1492>Because it includes little these consequences in the long run, or that it is not concerned with it, even if these consequences have an impact on the majority of Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1493>The richest taxpayers are of course pleased because they enjoyed the bulk of the tax cuts.</seg>
<seg id=1494>As surprisingly it may seem, the richest 5% of American taxpayers received around half of the tax cuts and these taxpayers rich expect clear until the other 95% (middle class and poor) support most future reductions spending and increases in taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1495>Meanwhile, Bush convinced many of poor voters and voters of the middle classes that they should also be happy to their fate without telling them that they will have to pay their small tax cuts by cuts far more to future government services if policies of his administration prevail over the long term.</seg>
<seg id=1496>If the Americans had a political memory, it would understand that they have soared this "Russian mountain" tax over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=1497>Ronald Reagan also took his works by promising massive tax cuts and large increases in military expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1498>That ended in a huge deficit in the middle of the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id=1499>The tax cuts made Reagan extremely popular and allowed it to be re-elected in 1984.</seg>
<seg id=1500>It then took a decade (from second term of Reagan until the mandates of Sr., George Bush and Bill Clinton) to return to a surplus budget.</seg>
<seg id=1501>Of course, this outcome requires the approval of new increases in taxes, which cost his re-election George Bush, Sr. and led to the polarized policy of the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id=1502>History has great likely to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id=1503>Some ideologues of right in the Bush administration believe that the current budget deficits will ultimately lead to drastically reduce social spending of government.</seg>
<seg id=1504>They hope to dismantling programmes such as social security, Medicare.</seg>
<seg id=1505>But the US population supports these social programs firmly.</seg>
<seg id=1506>So the strategy that first is to reduce taxes in order to necessarily lead to further cuts in social programs is doomed to failure and will inevitably lead to increased tax rates.</seg>
<seg id=1507>Other ideologues of the Bush Administration argue that the tax cuts of key importance to leave the us a recession.</seg>
<seg id=1508>This argument is also wrong.</seg>
<seg id=1509>America's economy could have been corrected without tax cuts, and perhaps even more firmly.</seg>
<seg id=1510>In any case, this is a monumental mistake to base the long-term fiscal policies on business cycle in the short term.</seg>
<seg id=1511>Other countries have two lessons necessary to retain this situation.</seg>
<seg id=1512>The first is that the imminent budget deficits of us will limit sooner or later the international power of America.</seg>
<seg id=1513>The Americans supported the Iraq war only because they did not have to subsidize it by higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1514>When the Americans are forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be much less willing to support costly military operations abroad.</seg>
<seg id=1515>Indeed, the US will be deeply divided internally when the population is grappling with fiscal mess left by Bush.</seg>
<seg id=1516>The second lesson is that countries must plan their budgets by the increasing tax costs caused by an aging population.</seg>
<seg id=1517>The budgetary conditions in the long term are rarely taken by the taxpayers or Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1518>Governments must have put budgetary assessments in the long run both their proposals for an annual budget to reduce the trend towards political manipulation in the short term of the budget.</seg>
<seg id=1519>The US can play the role of a warning signal for other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1520>The White House should give other countries the same Council that myself on television give their spectators: "do not try to similar on you.</seg>
<seg id=1521>The politicization of securities market</seg>
<seg id=1522>Many economic and financial analysts complain that markets of securities of emerging countries often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political than economic.</seg>
<seg id=1523>By contrast, a primitive force economic rules markets of securities in the advanced countries and to predict their performance is tantamount to predict the growth of trees.</seg>
<seg id=1524>This description of the markets of the securities in emerging countries is false, just partially, because the same description applies to the markets of securities in advanced countries.</seg>
<seg id=1525>Indeed, the best analysts know than to predict the performance of the securities market in any country is basically predict the extent to which the government wants than investors market of securities involved in the current political environment.</seg>
<seg id=1526>Take the securities market of the US, by far the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1527>The government leaves the silent companies and return on the investment in American market securities reflect fundamental forces solid capitalist economy.</seg>
<seg id=1528>This explains in part why the US attracts investors of portfolio around the world.</seg>
<seg id=1529>But the returns that make us markets of securities if attractive reflect a fragile political balance.</seg>
<seg id=1530>In particular, the tax rates affecting securities diverse over time to change the political pressures.</seg>
<seg id=1531>During World War II, for example, the political support for large fortunes reduced and government sharply increased tax on the profits of capital, the dividends and generally high.</seg>
<seg id=1532>When the World War II helped to improve significantly the economy weakened by the Great Depression of the 1930s, President Roosevelt and Congress a income tax exceptional to ensure that the shareholders do not release too significant benefits.</seg>
<seg id=1533>By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but that the securities market was on low, American voters elected Ronald Reagan, a man judged by many as being a president too on the right.</seg>
<seg id=1534>He asked, and obtained, tax cuts for the profits of capital, the dividends and incomes.</seg>
<seg id=1535>The political interference in the securities market not only deal with the tax on the profits of capital, the dividends and.</seg>
<seg id=1536>Taxes on land, indirect taxes, import and taxation of sales, which are all paid directly or indirectly by the companies, may impact amplified on corporate profit and thus on the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1537>It is no accident that where markets of securities develop, governments to ensure that lower taxes to the limit the benefits of societies after tax.</seg>
<seg id=1538>Indeed, the policies of the markets of securities do not stop with taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1539>Instead, almost every activity of government touches the benefit of companies and then the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1540>After the crash of markets of securities of 1929, the US government suspended most anti-trust activity allowing companies to acquire a monopoly that increases their value.</seg>
<seg id=1541>This policy delayed the fall of high unemployment, but was not enough to control the political forces deployed to support the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1542>Similarly, one of the actions the largest companies by President Reagan was to destroy much of power remaining the unions of America, which other get their share of the industrial pie.</seg>
<seg id=1543>The victory won by Reagan during the strike of air traffic control in 1981 was a watershed for American trade union movement, and also for the securities market that launched its dramatic market to the rise in 1982.</seg>
<seg id=1544>The US government has particularly strong support the securities market from the high point of illusion price actions in 2000, and in particular to reduce interest rates repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id=1545>Of course, this measure was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy, not in terms of supporting the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1546>But it is highly revealing size of the American market in securities that one of the most important factors upon economy concerns the prices of actions declining.</seg>
<seg id=1547>The response from the authorities was not only a monetary stimulus.</seg>
<seg id=1548>National accounts of products and incomes of us show that effective rate of income taxes of enterprises (percentage of really benefits paid to the government in the form of taxes) amounts in peak with 33.7m% in the first quarter 2000 (the record of the securities market and the economy in general) and fell to Mittelempfängern% in the fourth quarter 2003, when the market was low.</seg>
<seg id=1549>Much of this decline reflects the measures of tax reduction passed by Congress and perception, among companies, that economic environment and current policy, they can be shown more powerful to avoid paying tax.</seg>
<seg id=1550>Moreover, after the crash of the securities market, the maximum tax dividends on securities increased from 35% to 15%, providing a further substantial benefit to investors in the long term and intensify the combined effect of reinvestment from dividends after tax.</seg>
<seg id=1551>Again, that tax cut was justified to stimulate the economy what can, of course, try to almost any measures to support the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1552>But it is the balance of political forces which determines the credibility of such a justification.</seg>
<seg id=1553>One could argue that the same variables, including hostility to high taxes and weak trade union movement, worked in the US over the past 200 years is and that they should continue to work in the future, producing has raised the markets of securities and attractive inflows considerable foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id=1554>Those who believe that investments in the US market in securities will follow the same growth trend raised for decades could right well.</seg>
<seg id=1555>But it is important to be clear on what omen.</seg>
<seg id=1556>The forecasts primarily not just about economics, but also on policy, and even to cultural values which are the policies and economic performance.</seg>
<seg id=1557>The real estate market with World</seg>
<seg id=1558>There is no investment more local than real downgrade the home than buy is rooted in a particular place, like a tree, flowers or languishes in wishes of local economic conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1559>The entire world meet on our screens of television, but the real estate market, made up almost only of local amateur, rarely through local geographic borders.</seg>
<seg id=1560>Soon, however, that may change.</seg>
<seg id=1561>Within a month, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), with my firm MacroMarkets, like fiserv and Standard & Poor's's, will in time launch options on contracts on real prices in ten cities in the US.</seg>
<seg id=1562>The contracts will be based on real price we's & P / case owing, established by speculative research that my colleague Karl case and I conducted, almost twenty years ago.</seg>
<seg id=1563>For a long time we canvass for housing market in time, but no stock, so far, wanted to use this indices creating such a market.</seg>
<seg id=1564>The futures real prices will help investors around the world to indirectly invest in American housing, through these markets.</seg>
<seg id=1565>A purchaser in Paris, Rio or Tokyo will have the possibility of investing in housing occupied by their owners in New York, and Los Angeles, Las Vegas, among others.</seg>
<seg id=1566>One of the fundamental principles of financial theory -- the diversification or the spread of risk -- means that the interest these new agreements will be strong.</seg>
<seg id=1567>Enterprises and the people in New York, for example, are overexposed with local real risks. But, by selling their housing in the long term, they must succeed in reducing the risks.</seg>
<seg id=1568>Investors in Tokyo will bear some risks by buying housing in New York in time, if the price is right.</seg>
<seg id=1569>The New Yorkers will continue to live in their homes, having spread investment risks throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id=1570>The experience of genuine futures market on single-family housing was not retentée Since 1991, when London futures and options exchange (so-called now euronext.liffe) failed launch by such a market.</seg>
<seg id=1571>This test has produced large volumes of transactions.</seg>
<seg id=1572>The stock market began a concept that did not convince anyone.</seg>
<seg id=1573>The British market Paris diverse on real prices, like some retail markets online, never paid much either.</seg>
<seg id=1574>Will this be different this time?</seg>
<seg id=1575>Of course, the launch of a new market remains dubious. people are interested in an idea if sympathy of it already many others; if nobody is attractive, it will not attract more.</seg>
<seg id=1576>The same applies to markets if there are no interest investors, it will not happen enough transactions to generate profits to attract others.</seg>
<seg id=1577>However, as is the case for all brilliant ideas, we never know why they also appeal so we cannot predict out of this new market, but we know that sometimes success is at work.</seg>
<seg id=1578>The initial indicators suggest that the growing interest in transactions for future delivery on real prices, especially because of the current discourse on "housing bubble," stresses the importance of the diversification of risks.</seg>
<seg id=1579>After the announcement of the CME, one of its competitors, Chicago board exchange options, declared its plan to of creating options on contracts in the long term in the largest American regions, based on average real prices released by the National Association of Realtors (national Association real estate agents).</seg>
<seg id=1580>However, in addition to strong public for real investment and the covering of risks, another thorny issue must be resolved if the futures markets operate well: prices must be openly revealed and investors must understand the significance of this.</seg>
<seg id=1581>I believe what there is every chance that these futures markets soon result in lower prices in some American city.</seg>
<seg id=1582>It will be a question of "outlying" call, which traders. Now the price in the long term market is below the cost of real estate.</seg>
<seg id=1583>Probably, the outlying will not appear from day one of real transactions, but it should arise after a few months.</seg>
<seg id=1584>We may need outlying some of these markets play indeed their functions.</seg>
<seg id=1585>Everyone knows that these cities have enormous real boom in recent years (it is widespread world phenomenon elsewhere).</seg>
<seg id=1586>The international investors do not seem reluctant to invest in these cities, without the prospect of a fall in prices based on futures richer people in Tokyo know their costs.</seg>
<seg id=1587>However, if the outlying is important enough, even investors who argue that the US housing market is in decline can always expect good return of home prices in the long term, because they already enjoy lower prices on futures market.</seg>
<seg id=1588>Nevertheless, the New Yorkers will require to make adjustments to cover their real investment, if they want to sell contracts in time causing a fall in prices naturally.</seg>
<seg id=1589>They will have to get used to the idea that the market already anticipated this decline and that they can only be protected from negligible potential margin which exceeds that anticipation.</seg>
<seg id=1590>Indeed, such adjustments in our thinking will happen probably if reveals the future market prices.</seg>
<seg id=1591>So far, the trend in home prices was largely the result of different opinions.</seg>
<seg id=1592>When the markets create an international consensus about housing prices across the cities of the world, it will be easier to manage the risks that they meet stabilizing while on the one hand, their economies, by contrast, our own living standards.</seg>
<seg id=1593>But what makes move markets?</seg>
<seg id=1594>Since 10 May roughly, most of the world markets has strong cumulative declines, particularly in two weeks around on 23 May, with average of prices which persist down.</seg>
<seg id=1595>This concern on world stock means concern for the economy of the world?</seg>
<seg id=1596>Consider the most marked falls.</seg>
<seg id=1597>Among the major countries, the most impressive crash is that of India, where prices fell by revaluation% between on 10 May and on 22 May.</seg>
<seg id=1598>The debacle across the globe have as much scope almost. Here the ups and downs had only a few days of disparity from India: in Argentina, prices fell from 16.1%, Brazil's FF% and Mexico's 13.8%.</seg>
<seg id=1599>The European markets too suffered large losses.</seg>
<seg id=1600>In Sweden, seen prices down 15.2% between 9 May and on 22 May; almost the same period, they fell from 9.7% in Germany, /% in France and the United Kingdom and 9.3% in Italy.</seg>
<seg id=1601>In Asia, prices fell by 11.5% in Korea, 9.3% in Hong Kong and 8% in Japan over the same period.</seg>
<seg id=1602>Many commentators trying to combine these events with the situation in the US.</seg>
<seg id=1603>But the US prices did not show that a decline in 5.2% between 9 and 24 May.</seg>
<seg id=1604>China does not seem to be behind this global decline since prices rose there for this period.</seg>
<seg id=1605>The standard explanations of economists about monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=1606>In the wake of the great fear of deflation of 2003, central banks around the world lower interest rates, causing speculative explosions in the real estate market and in the stock market.</seg>
<seg id=1607>But today, according to this view, interest rates rising beginning to effect, which indicate new declines in markets.</seg>
<seg id=1608>There is undoubtedly an important element of truth in this argument.</seg>
<seg id=1609>The US Federal Reserve indeed increased its interest rates of 10 and its President, Ben Bernanke, then indicated that other increases could happen in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1610>17 May, increased American data was announced, which suggests future monetary clamps.</seg>
<seg id=1611>Economists like to think that the world is logical and manageable, which means that they understand what is happening.</seg>
<seg id=1612>But in so doing, they often exaggerated the role of central banks.</seg>
<seg id=1613>Indeed, the increase in American rates only did fall in a series of increases in rates -- 16 of at again.</seg>
<seg id=1614>No other major central bank increased its rates after the beginning of the decline of stock in May until the 7 8 June dates at which many have there (the European Central bank, India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).</seg>
<seg id=1615>Another factor: oil price, which has grown by 24% between 22 March and on 2 May from all its record.</seg>
<seg id=1616>That would undoubtedly to constitute a major event can influence the markets around the world.</seg>
<seg id=1617>The oil price rises play the role of the culprit in virtually all economic recessions since the second world war.</seg>
<seg id=1618>Yet the stolen oil prices do not correspond to the time when the stock prices fell most, in mid-May.</seg>
<seg id=1619>To argue that these increases caused the declining market implies a discrepancy of several weeks.</seg>
<seg id=1620>But the stock is not very logical, answer interest-rate to clash of oil prices might be possible.</seg>
<seg id=1621>As for all prices in any financial market, increased always draws attention.</seg>
<seg id=1622>When oil prices rise rapidly, people watch information that speaks and discussed between them these increases, creating themselves a sensitivity increased to this news.</seg>
<seg id=1623>The crisis in the Middle East is linked to oil prices, and it was the dominant information in May.</seg>
<seg id=1624>Signs a bad sign and language is used by various political figures could be amplified in the minds of investors by increases in oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1625>On 8 May, Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres, in response to the hostile by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, struck that "the Iranian President should remember that Iran also could map."</seg>
<seg id=1626>Similarly, around the beginning of the stock market decline may, Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia, the country with the largest number of Muslims in the world, newspapers reported on 13 May it received a real ovation from students of two of the best universities of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1627>This story can be interpreted as evidence that the strategy of the verge of Ahmadinejad in nuclear energy provides political dividends him, fueling a perception that the tense situation in the Middle East could lead to further increases in oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1628>These articles of newspapers may seem much further away from stock than the monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=1629>But public reaction that they cause, and the recent increases in oil prices, could enter for good measure the change in psychology market.</seg>
<seg id=1630>Attitudes to the risk change with time, and the events like the remarks d Ahmedinejad and fathers can precipitate these changes.</seg>
<seg id=1631>So, although these events are difficult to quantify, perhaps the analysts should pay as much attention to what Ahmadinejad as those of Bernanke when they try to understand the leadership that the world stock.</seg>
<seg id=1632>Perhaps economists do not like to focus on mentality of public and how it interacts with fluctuations in prices, the new world and speculative dynamics.</seg>
<seg id=1633>That would mean that the economic events are less predictable (and 'economists) than they do not have to imagine.</seg>
<seg id=1634>But from an intuitive view it would be logical to do so.</seg>
<seg id=1635>What is really in the leading investors?</seg>
<seg id=1636>Ahmadinejad is a charismatic character, not Bernanke</seg>
<seg id=1637>Ahmadinejad board in an adventure, not Bernanke</seg>
<seg id=1638>And, perhaps most important, Ahmadinejad has destabilizing influence, not Bernanke</seg>
<seg id=1639>Whatever their cause ultimately, the world stock falls mid-May indicate a psychology of volatile market.</seg>
<seg id=1640>Difficult to believe that they were dependent solely on opinions about the possible monetary policies, not with broader and deeper issues, particularly on energy and political tension, which are the foundations of the performance of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id=1641>Why pay more for fair trade?</seg>
<seg id=1642>Marks & Spencer, the chain of supermarkets and clothes boss of 400 stores around Britain, has just announced that it was going to convert its comprehensive cafes and teas understanding 38 different products with Fair Trade labelling, the symbol marketing of "ethical production.</seg>
<seg id=1643>The chain sells already only with coffee this label in these 200 coffee shops "coffee lives again.</seg>
<seg id=1644>It also encourages purchase of shirts and other goods has developed out of cotton resulting from fair trade.</seg>
<seg id=1645>This announcement occurred fifteen "fair trade" in these two weeks of promoting labeled products, meetings of presentation were held with producers of the developing countries to explain to the British how this form of trade helped their communities.</seg>
<seg id=1646>The movement towards a more ethical consumption also knows significant progress in the United States consumers turn increasingly towards food biological or produced locally, such as egg eggs raised in freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1647>In the UK, a survey showed that more than 50% of respondents recognized the symbol of fair trade and understood that products which this label more observed, for the farmers in the third world.</seg>
<seg id=1648>There is currently no study comparable to the US, but the reported data and the discussions I have had with my own students suggests that the figure would be low for the Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1649>The traders that want certification trade must pay the producers a price covering the costs of sustainable production and sufficient wages to live.</seg>
<seg id=1650>For example, the minimum course for coffee on is in 1.26, never mind the fall of the level of market price.</seg>
<seg id=1651>If the market price exceeds that figure, tariff about fair trade will increase in order to remain higher 5 hundreds / pound.</seg>
<seg id=1652>Regarding small producers, they must be organized in cooperatives or other types of groups for democratic participation.</seg>
<seg id=1653>The cultivated areas and factories can claim label fair trade if they provide decent salaries to their workers, if they comply with the health standards, environmental and security, if they allow the trade unions or any other form of associations of workers, if they provide decent housing to workers who work away from home and if they use neither forced labour and child work.</seg>
<seg id=1654>However, not everyone approve of fair trade.</seg>
<seg id=1655>Brink Lindsey, Director of the Center of studies trade policies Cato Institute, Organization ', estimates that the campaign for the coffee labelled fair trade is a "paved with deadlock of good intentions.</seg>
<seg id=1656>It explained by motivating the real cause of the fall in the price of coffee does not lie in achieving the excessive profits by multinationals, but in the significant rise in coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with the new methods culture coffee planting working increasingly so cheaply.</seg>
<seg id=1657>From the perspective of Lindsey, if we want to help the coffee farmers, we must encourage them to abandon the coffee for cheaper cultures -- insist here, rightly, on trade restrictions imposed by the rich countries and on subsidies which constitute obstacles to be removed -- or to products with high added value, such as special cafes that can be paid dearly.</seg>
<seg id=1658>What is curious in's arguments Lindsey, however, is that the campaign for the fair coffee appears to do exactly what it recommends, i.e. to encourage coffee farmers to produce special cafes power to pay more expensive.</seg>
<seg id=1659>Economists' not against the companies openly using the attractiveness of luxury to promote their products.</seg>
<seg id=1660>So people are prepared to spend Hague 48 for coffee on Jamaican blue mountain, because it is the preferred coffee of James Bond, economists don't believe in this case that the market is distorted.</seg>
<seg id=1661>So why are so critical consumers who want to pay $12 for coffee on that they know that it was cultivated without pesticide under ombrageux trees conducive to the survival of birds, by producers who can now feed and possibly educate their children?</seg>
<seg id=1662>Economists could reply to that if you want to help people to feed and educate their children, it is possible to buy a not fair coffee on the same taste for $10 and pay the Hague two other an charity association that distributing food and provides education for the poor children.</seg>
<seg id=1663>It is indeed a possible strategy. But, fair trade present real benefits.</seg>
<seg id=1664>Producers know that they must make a valuable coffee of consumers not only for his taste, but also for the way they are cultivated.</seg>
<seg id=1665>If their coffee is sold well are proud to have produced a product sought in the entire world.</seg>
<seg id=1666>From the perspective of the farmers, to receive a premium by selling a labeled product fair trade is preferable to obtaining a charitable assistance they receive in any case, whether working or not, whatever the quality of their production.</seg>
<seg id=1667>To pay more for a product labeled fair trade is no longer "market" that spending more buy a Gucci branded products.</seg>
<seg id=1668>Moreover, this label reflects better ethical priorities.</seg>
<seg id=1669>It is not just a subsidy by governments, success depends on political lobbied and market demand not.</seg>
<seg id=1670>Fortunately, in Europe, this request is growing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id=1671>Let us hope that it will soon reach such levels everywhere in developed countries, where consumers can decide with their own way how to spend their money.</seg>
<seg id=1672>Calves, pigs and American democracy</seg>
<seg id=1673>Among breaks of securities on the return of the democratic majority in Congress after the elections in November, the result of an important vote is largely overlooked.</seg>
<seg id=1674>Although he highlighted the shortcomings of the American political system, it also enabled me to accept the compassion ordinary American citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1675>In Sasabe, people can, if they combined a sufficient number of signatures, issue a bill to direct popular vote.</seg>
<seg id=1676>This year, one of the questions submitted by popular vote was a law to ban that around pregnant, or the calves raised for meat, are saddled or confined in a way that prevents them from being turned freely, nodding or extending their members.</seg>
<seg id=1677>Perhaps those who do not know the methods of intensive farming will our by the need for such legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1678>Traditional farming as it has been practiced throughout the world fifty years ago, and in some countries even today allows the animals move and be long.</seg>
<seg id=1679>But today, almost 90% of reproductive around -- mothers of pigs raised and slaughtered for meat, bacon and ham -- pass the bulk of their lives in stalls which measure around 60 by by 2.2 meters.</seg>
<seg id=1680>They can neither be turned, neither to expand their leg once lies, or to advance or back down of more than one step.</seg>
<seg id=1681>They are also sometimes saddled limiting their movements.</seg>
<seg id=1682>Similarly, the calves are confined their lives during the boxes individual where they cannot be turned to lie down or again themselves.</seg>
<seg id=1683>Essentially, these methods to save the cost of labour and facilitate the management of animals and help employ fewer workers, and less qualified.</seg>
<seg id=1684>They also prevent the animals from squandering energy while déplaçdant or fighting between them.</seg>
<seg id=1685>A few years ago, following protests of animal welfare organizations, the EU Commission requested a report by the Standing Committee of the EU on methods of intensive farming.</seg>
<seg id=1686>The report's conclusions indicate that animals suffer to move and have nothing to do all day.</seg>
<seg id=1687>Of course, simple common sense allows to reach the same conclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1688>Following up the report, the EU set the dates from which the containment of raised will be banned.</seg>
<seg id=1689>For calves, on 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id=1690>The individual stalls for around, already banned in the UK and Sweden, will be banned as 2013 across the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1691>Measures to improve the welfare of hens, high from hens in cages of fabric without enough in place to expand their wings, also apply gradually.</seg>
<seg id=1692>In the US, nothing the kind is expected.</seg>
<seg id=1693>Earlier, when my European friends asked why the United States showed such a delay in the welfare of raised from Europe, I can only answer.</seg>
<seg id=1694>If they insisted, I have to confess that one explanation was that the Americans less concerned about animals than Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1695>Then, in 2002, associations of animals managed to put the popular vote a proposal to ban the individual stalls for around in Florida.</seg>
<seg id=1696>To everyone's surprise, the proposal was accepted by 55% of the voters.</seg>
<seg id=1697>Last month in Sasabe, despite an opposition generously financed by agro-industrial the prohibition of boxes of containment for calves and pigs was also approved by 62% of the voters.</seg>
<seg id=1698>Neither Florida or Sasabe are States particularly progressive -- both voted for George W. Bush against John Kerry in 2004.</seg>
<seg id=1699>The results of these two popular vote so strongly suggest that if all Americans were to vote on maintaining the around pregnant and calves in containment, a vast majority would oppose it.</seg>
<seg id=1700>Ultimately, it seems that the Americans are concerned as well as Europeans of living conditions of raised.</seg>
<seg id=1701>To explain the difference between animal welfare on farming in Europe and the US, the political systems perhaps compared.</seg>
<seg id=1702>In Europe, the concerns of voters concerning conditions for animals reflected among members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, with the result that adopting national laws and guidelines for the EU to improve their lot.</seg>
<seg id=1703>In the US by contrast, these concerns had no visible effect on Members of Congress.</seg>
<seg id=1704>There is no federal legislation on the welfare of animals and almost no legislation in the US.</seg>
<seg id=1705>àb my view, tens of millions of dollars of agro-industrial resources by officials seeking to be re-elected there is for something.</seg>
<seg id=1706>The movement of defense of animals, despite strong popular support, makes the weight in the arena of political lobbying and electoral donations.</seg>
<seg id=1707>In American electoral races, money has more than the views of voters.</seg>
<seg id=1708>The discipline of party is weak and Members together have themselves most of the funds needed to their re-election -- indeed, every two years for Members of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id=1709>In Europe, where the discipline of the parties is respected and where parties, not the candidates, financing of electoral campaigns, money plays a smaller role.</seg>
<seg id=1710>In the US, a proud country of its democratic tradition, calves and pigs is not the only losers by far.</seg>
<seg id=1711>What is new about the new army entirely composed of Afghans?</seg>
<seg id=1712>The assassination of Afghan Minister aircraft by a crowd (perhaps told by members of own temporary administration of Afghanistan) shows that the Afghan society remains deeply showing.</seg>
<seg id=1713>The first reform on Afghan army will only exacerbate these divisions.</seg>
<seg id=1714>The Defence Minister of the interim administration of Hamid Karzai to Kabul has appointed the executives of the new army.</seg>
<seg id=1715>Minister, the General Mohammed Fahim, is one of Tajiks of district of Panjshir in the North, which has become three months ago the leader of the forces of the Northern Alliance that captured Kabul after American bombers quite how to them.</seg>
<seg id=1716>As a group, its allocation is a direct challenge to the goal of reunification of the country of Mr Karzai.</seg>
<seg id=1717>Afghanistan is a multiethnic nation, the largest group being Karzai, which is both three-fifths of the total population.</seg>
<seg id=1718>Hezaras and Tajiks constitute one-fifth of the population respectively.</seg>
<seg id=1719>On 38 officers raised a general by Mr Fahim, 37 are Tajiks, thirty eighth being Uzbek.</seg>
<seg id=1720>If, on the 15 to 17 million Karzai's country, some are recruited as soldiers, they will be useful in a command structure almost entirely composed of Tajiks.</seg>
<seg id=1721>The language of Karzai differs but Tajiks as Spanish, English, and millions of Karzai reaching the age of military service few concepts of Tajiks have best.</seg>
<seg id=1722>Geographical profile of the new military authority is as limited as its ethnic composition.</seg>
<seg id=1723>Thirty-five on 38 senior come from a small area in Northern Kabul understanding the province parwan (where the airport in Baghram is located) and it from the Panjshir valley along the bastion of the Northern Alliance.</seg>
<seg id=1724>In other words, the potential leaders from 27 in twenty-nine provinces in Afghanistan were excluded from new military elite from their countries.</seg>
<seg id=1725>Such a limited group may overcome the impression that its Members are a clique closed if they represented a broad sample of dozen political parties of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1726>But it is not.</seg>
<seg id=1727>Eighteen of 38 senior come from one party, jamiat had Jamyat, Islamic faction that was directed long by Mullah and former professor of theology Burhanuddin Rabbani.</seg>
<seg id=1728>It was the party that controlled Kabul a short time in the mid-1990s, creating carnage and chaos leading most Afghan to welcome the arrival of the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id=1729>The Communists equal almost the number of Members jamiat in military hierarchy.</seg>
<seg id=1730>Sixteen of 38 officers were aligned long on this party whose game in the late 1970s led to the Soviet invasion of 1979 89 that cost two and a half million Afghan lives.</seg>
<seg id=1731>Most Afghans consider today the Communists with the same degree of sympathy that the Czechs or Poles reluctance to national socialists of Hitler.</seg>
<seg id=1732>True, Afghans, as elsewhere, joined the Communist Party for various reasons and that they were by no means all the hardened ideologues.</seg>
<seg id=1733>But in the case of generals of general Fahim, six were professional workers of the Communist Party and continued to serve the party after the invasion of the Red Army.</seg>
<seg id=1734>These six men, plus three Communists who served as officers in the Afghan army, actively collaborated during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, that lasted a decade.</seg>
<seg id=1735>Imagine how the French would have reacted if a quarter of the body of French officers of the post-World War II had sided side of Wehrmacht while it occupied home.</seg>
<seg id=1736>In Afghanistan, the news travels fast by word of mouth.</seg>
<seg id=1737>The Afghan nationalists (i.e. nearly all Afghans) will discover soon political reasons for members of the intimate circle of Fahim general, if not before.</seg>
<seg id=1738>Even the overwhelming evidence of bias and prejudice in training the high command of the new military might be neutralized if the generals integrated a professionalism and a commitment to the patriotic values of truly national armed forces in their task.</seg>
<seg id=1739>Unfortunately, only ten of 38 officers promoted by Fahim received a training professional military officers.</seg>
<seg id=1740>An eleventh served as a pilot.</seg>
<seg id=1741>By contrast, health-insurance on 38 generals (the formations of the four generals remain unknown) are civilians, who had a profession, coming from the offices of the Communist party or, in any case, which were Mullah.</seg>
<seg id=1742>This means all these statistics in terms of everyday reality?</seg>
<seg id=1743>They mean that when the leaders of international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, as well as the official military and diplomatic us, with the Afghan Deputy Secretary of Defense, they meet Abdul Rashid Dostum, a Lord of war and a notoriously corrupt and brutal communist who as maintaining contact with former friends of the Red Army who are always used Moscow.</seg>
<seg id=1744>This means that the leader of the Afghan forces as well as the leader of the operations and the leader of the intelligence service of army are also Communist, people whose loyalty remain uncertain and that many Afghans are wary.</seg>
<seg id=1745>Is this team likely to unite Afghanistan torn by war?</seg>
<seg id=1746>Is the presence in Kabul a so dubious team that instilling confidence in three-quarters of the Afghan people, who are excluded from the military high command?</seg>
<seg id=1747>Or does the list rather constitute the harvesting of an approach 'everything for winner "of government that is forced (at some point in the future) making - another national bloody reaction by those whose legitimate interests were cynically trampled?</seg>
<seg id=1748>The UN and politicians European and American must reflect on these issues before making a catch order implacability by a small unpopular minority.</seg>
<seg id=1749>Celebration of the irrational</seg>
<seg id=1750>Hurra for new winners of the Nobel prize for economics: Daniel Kahneman at Princeton University and Vernon Smith of university George builder of Virginia.</seg>
<seg id=1751>Like many Nobel, these rewards acknowledge not only determine the work undertaken by Mr Kahneman and Smith, but also the schools of thought they helped to develop.</seg>
<seg id=1752>Mr Kahneman, psychologist, showed that people behave systematically to less traditional than traditional economists believe it.</seg>
<seg id=1753>Its work shows not only that people sometimes act differently from standard economic theoretical predictions, but also that they do regularly, systematically, and in a way that can be understood and interpreted across different assumptions that compete with those used by traditional economists.</seg>
<seg id=1754>For most of the market participants, and indeed of ordinary observers, this does not seem to make much difference.</seg>
<seg id=1755>The brokers of Wall Street that make trafficking with what they can be bad exploit the irrational, and that Kahneman and Smith showed.</seg>
<seg id=1756>Most of the passion that led to the expansion of market was based on the exploitation of psychology of investors.</seg>
<seg id=1757>In fact, this irrationality is not new either for economists.</seg>
<seg id=1758>John Maynard Keynes once described the stock market as not based on the struggle of rational individuals to discover the underpinnings of markets, but rather as a beauty contest in which winner has clear best those that judges will say.</seg>
<seg id=1759>The Nobel prize this year's famous criticism of the simplistic market, as last year (which I received with two other colleagues).</seg>
<seg id=1760>The winners of last year emphasized that the players in the market have different information (and imperfect), and this asymmetry information has an impact on the functioning of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1761>In particular, the winners of last year meant that markets are generally not effective; it remains with governments play an important role.</seg>
<seg id=1762>The invisible hand of Adam Smith, the idea that free trade leads to the efficiency and guided by an invisible hand, is invisible in part because it does not exist.</seg>
<seg id=1763>That, too, is nothing new for those working daily with markets (and make fortune using this asymmetry information and by exceeding it).</seg>
<seg id=1764>For more than twenty years, economists have passionate themselves for these so-called models "of rational expectations that" on the assumption that all participants have equal information (even imperfect) and act in a perfectly rational, that the markets are fully efficient, that there has been no unemployment (except when it is caused by eager unions or the minimum wage imposed by governments), and that there has been no rationing of funding.</seg>
<seg id=1765>Such models are dominant, especially in the prices of third round in the US, despite the evidence of the opposite shows the triumph of ideology on science.</seg>
<seg id=1766>Unfortunately, the students of these programmes in higher education are now the leaders of many countries and they try to implement programmes based on these ideas, the so-called today the fundamentalism of market.</seg>
<seg id=1767>Let me be clear: the rational forecast models has made a fundamental contribution to the economic theory; stringency that their supporters imposed on economic thinking helped to clarify the weakness of many underlying assumptions.</seg>
<seg id=1768>Good scientific thought can recognize its limits, but the prophets of rational expectations generally showed little modesty.</seg>
<seg id=1769>Vernon Smith is one of the leaders of developing experimental economy, the idea that we can test many economic proposals in a laboratory.</seg>
<seg id=1770>One reason for that make the economy is such a complex issue, which is also the many disagreements between economists, stems from the fact that economists cannot conduct controlled experiments.</seg>
<seg id=1771>Nature carrying the experiences life size, but in most circumstances, and things can change so quickly as is often difficult to disentangle the causes of consequences.</seg>
<seg id=1772>In principle, in a laboratory, one can undertake controlled experiments, and thus free up more reliable inférences.</seg>
<seg id=1773>Critics of the experimental economy are concerned that the subjects give the experimental contexts ways of thinking determined outside experience, so that the experience and the inférences are also vision and clear only in physical sciences.</seg>
<seg id=1774>Nevertheless, the economic experiences provide some knowledge of a number of questions, such as improved design of auctions.</seg>
<seg id=1775>Above all, the irrationality of the market participants, the key issue of the work of Mr Kahneman was true in a repeatedly within the laboratories.</seg>
<seg id=1776>One of the results more amusing released by the experimental economy is altruism and egoism.</seg>
<seg id=1777>It would appear (at least in the experimental situations) that the experimental subjects are not as selfish as economists think so, except a group of economists himself.</seg>
<seg id=1778>Would that be because economics is a discipline which attracts individuals who are, by nature, selfish or because the economy allows for paradigm people in order to make them more selfish?</seg>
<seg id=1779>The answer, certainly, is certainly a bit of both.</seg>
<seg id=1780>No doubt experimental research and future work will help resolve the issue of the relative importance of both assumptions.</seg>
<seg id=1781>The Nobel shows how important it is to study the individuals and economies such as they are and not as we want to see them.</seg>
<seg id=1782>Only by understanding best real humanity can we hope to design policies that will help to do better to function our economies.</seg>
<seg id=1783>Bush and his faith energy policy</seg>
<seg id=1784>An episode of most surreal happened this year, during the World Economic Forum in davos. experts in oil industry there explained why the melting of the ice cap -- much faster than all announced forecasts - is not only a problem, but also a chance in what news huge quantities of oil will now available.</seg>
<seg id=1785>Similarly, these experts recognized that America's refusal to sign the law of the sea, the international convention that determines the access to sources of offshore oil as to other maritime mineral resources, represents a risk of international conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1786>But they also insisted on benefits: oil industry, in its relentless quest for new reserves, does not have to beg Congress for the right to pillage Alaska.</seg>
<seg id=1787>President George W. Bush has a strange power not to understand the important messages.</seg>
<seg id=1788>For years, it is increasingly clear that its energy policy wrong.</seg>
<seg id=1789>Certain members of his party even refer to an old energy bill, written by oil industry, as being very beneficial for all lobbyists.</seg>
<seg id=1790>Making to bare the virtues of the market, the only purpose of Bush to grant enormous subsidies to the oil industry, despite the increasing deficits that the country faces.</seg>
<seg id=1791>However, the market does not function properly when it comes to energy intervention by the government should take a completely opposite direction that the Bush administration proposed.</seg>
<seg id=1792>The fact that the Americans do not pay the price of degradation -- especially of their enormous production of greenhouse gases -- from their energy waste causes a devaluation of the price of energy and blow, excessive consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1793>The government must encourage energy savings its intervention on pricing, mainly through the energy tax, is an effective way to do it.</seg>
<seg id=1794>Instead of supporting Bush, energy conservation state in a policy which consists of "first stuck America" of own resources, making it more dependent in the future on the external oil resources.</seg>
<seg id=1795>Never mind that strong demand is rising oil prices and thus creates a basket for many countries of the Middle East, which are not the best friends of America.</seg>
<seg id=1796>Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it seems that Bush finally took stock of the growing energy dependency of America he had become difficult for him not to realize consequences of runaway oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1797>But, once again, the halting gestures of his government will make aggravate the problems in the immediate future.</seg>
<seg id=1798>Bush still refuses to act for energy savings and spending finally little money to support its continued prayer of technological salvation.</seg>
<seg id=1799>What to do, then, the recent statement by Bush on his commitment to reduce, in 25 years, oil dependency of America on the Middle East by 75%?</seg>
<seg id=1800>For investors, the message is clear: no longer invest in new reserves of the Middle East, which are by far the least expensive oil resources of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1801>But if there is no new investment in reserves of the Middle East, the unrestrained growth in energy consumption in the US, China and elsewhere implies that exceeds demand.</seg>
<seg id=1802>And to crown it all, the threat of sanctions by Bush against Iran could cause the interruptions of supply of one of the largest producers of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1803>At a global level of oil production almost to its maximum and prices have almost doubled since the war in Iraq, this indicate prices even greater and greater profits for the oil industry, the only real winner of Bush's policy in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1804>In any case, no one should blame Bush for having recognized that there was a problem.</seg>
<seg id=1805>As always, its proposals anything else constitute only a small amount of round of hand of its administration.</seg>
<seg id=1806>Besides its refusal to recognize the global warming, to encourage energy savings or to allocate sufficient funds for further research, the great promise of Bush reduce American dependence on oil from the Middle East does not say much.</seg>
<seg id=1807>With only 20% of US oil from the Middle East, the goal of Bush could simply be achieved by growing modestly supplies from other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1808>The Bush administration must lead that oil benefits from the world market.</seg>
<seg id=1809>Even if America were totally independent of oil from the Middle East, reducing energy production region would have devastating effects on the world prices and certainly on the American economy.</seg>
<seg id=1810>As is too often the case with the Bush administration, there is no clear explanation of the official policy.</seg>
<seg id=1811>Is Bush play with policy have the sense anti-Arab and anti-Iranian of Americans?</seg>
<seg id=1812>Or is it yet another example of incompetence and confusion?</seg>
<seg id=1813>According to what we given these last five years, the answer right are certainly more than a little faith and pure stupid.</seg>
<seg id=1814>Of the roadmap China</seg>
<seg id=1815>China is set to adopt its 11 five-year plan, to be as decoration to extend what is perhaps the most remarkable transformation economic of history, by improving the welfare of almost a quarter of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id=1816>Never before the world had known such sustainable growth; never before it had not had such a poverty reduction there.</seg>
<seg id=1817>The explanation of the long-term success of China is partly in its unique association of pragmatism and vision of the future.</seg>
<seg id=1818>While most of the rest of the developing world, according to the Washington Consensus is launched in a quest for increased GDP worthy of Don Quixote, China again made clear that sought lasting and fairer increases real living standards.</seg>
<seg id=1819>China realize that went into economic growth imposing huge demands on environment that cannot last.</seg>
<seg id=1820>Unless change course, living standards will eventually be compromised.</seg>
<seg id=1821>That is why the new five-year plan emphasizes really the environment.</seg>
<seg id=1822>Many parts of China among latest have grown so fast that one would shout to wonder if other parts of the country has yet know a faster growth.</seg>
<seg id=1823>While this is reduced poverty, inequality has increased, with growing disparities between rural and urban areas, and parts of the coast and home.</seg>
<seg id=1824>This year's report the World Bank's World Development Report explains why inequality, not only poverty, should raise concerns; but the 11 five-year plan China's attacks the problem unify.</seg>
<seg id=1825>The government has mentioned for many years a more harmonious society, and the plan gives ambitious programs for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id=1826>China also recognizes what separates the least developed countries the most developed countries is not just a disparity of resources but also of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1827>So it has audacious plans to reduce these disparities and to create a basis for an independent innovation.</seg>
<seg id=1828>China's role in the world and the world economy has changed, and the plan also reflects this.</seg>
<seg id=1829>Its future growth should be based more on domestic demand that on exports, which means an increase in consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1830>Indeed, China suffers a rare problem: excessive savings.</seg>
<seg id=1831>People save partly because of weaknesses in social security schemes in the government: strengthening the social security (pensions), public health and education will reduce simultaneously social inequality, will increase the sense of well-being of the citizens and will support resembles consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1832>If that worked (and so far China almost always exceeded even its own high hopes) These adjustments could impose huge pressure on a global economic system already destabilized by enormous fiscal imbalances and trade in the US.</seg>
<seg id=1833>If China put itself at less saving -- and if, as was reported its representatives, it continues more diversified investment policy of its reserves, who will finance the trade deficit of more than $2 billion a day the US?</seg>
<seg id=1834>It is a subject close to another day, but that day is perhaps not so remote.</seg>
<seg id=1835>With such a clear vision of the future, the challenge will lie in force.</seg>
<seg id=1836>China is a large country which could not have succeeded as well without broad decentralization.</seg>
<seg id=1837>But decentralization poses its own problems.</seg>
<seg id=1838>The greenhouse gas, for example, are global problems.</seg>
<seg id=1839>While America proclaims that it does not have the means to do anything about it, the Chinese senior act more responsibly.</seg>
<seg id=1840>In the space of one month after the adoption of the plan, new ecological car taxes, the kind and products of timber were imposed: China uses the market mechanisms to solving environmental problems and the world.</seg>
<seg id=1841>But the pressure on those responsible for local governments to create economic growth and employment will be enormous.</seg>
<seg id=1842>They will be very tempted to say that if America cannot produce to protect our planet, how they would?</seg>
<seg id=1843>To put this vision into action, the Chinese Government will need strong policies, particularly of substantial increases in taxes on the environment.</seg>
<seg id=1844>While China transformed itself into a market economy, it saw developing certain problems which are the scourge of developed countries: the specific interests "of personal interests under a mask of ideology of market.</seg>
<seg id=1845>Some will mention the trickle-down effect: 'Have you not for the poor, in the end everybody will eventually enjoying growth.</seg>
<seg id=1846>And others will oppose the policies of competition and the strict laws of corporate governance: Let the Darwinism operate its wonders.</seg>
<seg id=1847>Arguments of growth will be advanced to counter high social and environmental policies: for example, to raise taxes on gasoline our nascent car will kill.</seg>
<seg id=1848>Such so-called policies pro- growth would not only fail to provide growth, they would threaten the entire vision of the future of China.</seg>
<seg id=1849>The only way of avoiding that: open discussion of economic policy in order to expose sophisms and of giving the means to enforce creative solutions to the many challenges that China must face today.</seg>
<seg id=1850>George W. Bush has demonstrated that it is dangerous to misuse the secrecy and restrict decision-making with a narrow circle of sycophantes.</seg>
<seg id=1851>Most people outside China do not see how its leaders, contrary, committed extensive deliberations and broad consultations (even with foreigners) while they fought to solve the enormous problem they face.</seg>
<seg id=1852>The market economies are not regulatory area.</seg>
<seg id=1853>They cannot simply be left as an accountable, particularly if we want to ensure that their profits are widely shared.</seg>
<seg id=1854>But to manage a market economy is not easy.</seg>
<seg id=1855>It is an act of balance that must constantly respond to economic changes.</seg>
<seg id=1856>The 11 five-year plan of China provides a roadmap in that direction.</seg>
<seg id=1857>The world opening the eyes, full of hope and fear, while the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to turn.</seg>
<seg id=1858>Lessons about democracy Tocqueville of</seg>
<seg id=1859>Because of war in Iraq, 200 years after the birth of Tocqueville, global discusses the nature of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1860>Tocqueville is famous rightly have rejected nostalgia reactionary given that democracy was our destiny, it us but on the dangers it contains for freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1861>Do we have to share his concern?</seg>
<seg id=1862>Tocqueville initially did not consider democracy a political system, but before like a intellectual system that works the customs and habits of the company, thus giving a sociological and psychological dimension to it.</seg>
<seg id=1863>Tocqueville thought the democratic regimes guide the course of our thoughts, our desires and our passions.</seg>
<seg id=1864>So there was the man's revival and with for 20th century the Homo sovieticus, "democratic man" is the form of human beings.</seg>
<seg id=1865>For Tocqueville, systemic effects of democracy can lead people to abandon their faculty of reasoning.</seg>
<seg id=1866>They can only pretending to judge events and values themselves, as in fact they simply say the narrow views of the majority.</seg>
<seg id=1867>What Tocqueville called the seizure of power "social" on the opinion may be stronger in democratic regimes -- a view that augur levels demagoguery and manipulation by the media in the modern world.</seg>
<seg id=1868>Tocqueville thought in the long run, nothing can be really opposed this trend.</seg>
<seg id=1869>Neither local democracy, neither of small groups within society, neither the countervailing powers, nor the civil rights can prevent the decline of critical thinking only democracy appears to generate.</seg>
<seg id=1870>The school best is an enclave beyond the irresistible influence that society has on spirit.</seg>
<seg id=1871>Similarly, Tocqueville thought the research of virtue of ways to old or religious faith could sometimes raise the heart, but both of these are incompatible with democratic ideal, once they are imposed by the authorities in public life.</seg>
<seg id=1872>In this respect, the theorists prefixed -- the school of Frankfurt and Hannah Arendt who feared above all the disappearance of reason in modern societies are heirs to the thought of Tocqueville.</seg>
<seg id=1873>We can also see that the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet entitled one recent books democracy against itself.</seg>
<seg id=1874>For these authors, democratic lifestyle tends to eliminate any thought original and prevent the emergence of a culture of good level, be replaced by a mediocrity leaving citizens vulnerable the enemies of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1875>If history is full of criminal regimes supported intimidated and manipulated masses, the greatest risk of democratic countries is that their citizens into the indifference and limiting themselves to a short-term thinking, towards their immediate interest.</seg>
<seg id=1876>The past - despite the rituals aimed at the celebration of the historical events - is masked by dependence on time today and in recent innovation.</seg>
<seg id=1877>Even the ruling class are well educated, is a victim of this influence.</seg>
<seg id=1878>The main problem of democratic mentality is its lack of historical conscience.</seg>
<seg id=1879>As he proclaimed Tocqueville, do the shortcomings of democracy to pessimism resigned the only way - realistic but unacceptable, which opens with us?</seg>
<seg id=1880>I do not think it.</seg>
<seg id=1881>There are means to fight what we could call "democratic stupidity" see spreading today.</seg>
<seg id=1882>The first of this is to develop an education system which is true critics, including through largely neglected matter teaching (nowadays) that are the literature, history and philosophy.</seg>
<seg id=1883>If you want to train people informed and capable are thinking, which is essential to the functioning of democracy, our schools must stop running after the latest pre-requisites underway and starting to develop the powers of analysis of school.</seg>
<seg id=1884>Because of their tendency to cultivate the surface one and distraction, the mass media are the main obstacle to such an education.</seg>
<seg id=1885>Today, many people are more times during their lives at like a classroom pass.</seg>
<seg id=1886>The passivity of the mass media mislead is exactly the opposite of the active involvement of citizens, needed to democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1887>But it is hard to imagine that the mass media (apart newspapers quality) accept of their own wishes to become the tools for education which would develop the critical spirit of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1888>This focus on the mass media does not reflect an elitist contempt for popular culture.</seg>
<seg id=1889>It is not just a question of popularity -- not been popular at its time and parties of Shakespeare attracted poor as much as the rich - but the refusal of mass culture to call into question and to cause.</seg>
<seg id=1890>The result is an indifference and a passivity widespread from public.</seg>
<seg id=1891>For a long time, a globalized media culture is becoming more widespread, unable to cause the least critical or raising the sentiments.</seg>
<seg id=1892>Because his lack of interest in these issues is a culture which threatens democratic liberties because it creates no a sense of duty towards society, history or the Community.</seg>
<seg id=1893>Is it too late to defend themselves against a culture that blunts so the minds?</seg>
<seg id=1894>Tocqueville scorned the elites of time because of their goodness about the dangers of democracy mass.</seg>
<seg id=1895>Will the myopia of our leaders support the achievement of its worrying prophecy?</seg>
<seg id=1896>All Europe</seg>
<seg id=1897>Members of long the EU seem to be the future of the European Union but Ukrainians watch the EU with some hope and some admiration.</seg>
<seg id=1898>The fundamental objective of our foreign policy is to integrate us into European progress, because Ukraine found that national autonomy is not an end in itself but just beginning.</seg>
<seg id=1899>Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when a nation is a victim of ostracism, no country is free.</seg>
<seg id=1900>We are Europeans all bound by a relationship which we cannot escape, linked in a single destiny.</seg>
<seg id=1901>Every aspect of culture that we share, let alone the century of suffering that we have shared, we confirm.</seg>
<seg id=1902>This affects a European affects us all directly indirectly.</seg>
<seg id=1903>We shall never again be able to afford to live with narrow notions of two Europes, Europe's previous and Europe by poor, elected officials and outcasts.</seg>
<seg id=1904>Anyone who lives across Europe today cannot, indeed should not, be considered a foreigner with its Union.</seg>
<seg id=1905>Big Pax Europe of today, like current prosperity pan-European, depends on it.</seg>
<seg id=1906>Some will say that Ukraine is not part of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1907>They come to Kiev and meet its people, young and old, workers, the wives of farmers, lawyers and doctors and teachers who rose and have remained standing in the cold and the snow's weeks during to defend their freedom last winter.</seg>
<seg id=1908>Aren't these united with those grouped around General de Gaulle in French resistance?</seg>
<seg id=1909>Do they not form a unit with those who died in the fight to defend the Spanish Republic in the 1930s, those released Budapest in 1956 and reflect fine with fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970s?</seg>
<seg id=1910>Aren't they lively a spirit in the Polish trade union solidarnösc and peaceful masses which started the Velvet Revolution in Prague in 1989?</seg>
<seg id=1911>This is the real heart of Europe and no doubt can destroy it.</seg>
<seg id=1912>All who consider that Ukraine is too lagging behind to join the Union, I will say that they also come them to visit my country and to see mothers who remain until late in the Bureau to teach their children use of computer of their office.</seg>
<seg id=1913>That they come to attend language classes in every village and city where our youth prepares for Europe by learning French, German and English.</seg>
<seg id=1914>Those who doubt the European vocation of Ukraine should understand that Europe is not just a question of material and highways: the insatiable desire for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=1915>I think our future is as promising as Europe's past is proud, and that our intended is a land border forgotten in a troubled region but that of an influential participants of peace and unity of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1916>Self-determination is no longer means to isolation because reach national independence nowadays simply means the return on the world stage with a new status.</seg>
<seg id=1917>The new nations can build their former occupiers the same kind of profitable relationship that France established in Germany: a relationship based on equality and mutual interests.</seg>
<seg id=1918>It is the relationship that my government wishes to establish with Russia, so we may help to expand peace zone in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1919>It is premature, of course, go beyond the indication of the high regard that we give the possibility of joining the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1920>We know that our role in this great building will be established in a night.</seg>
<seg id=1921>We know that the work of European unification is not limited to the documents and statements but takes root in the innovative actions designed to improve living standards and providing security for all Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1922>To build a worthy Ukraine to join the European Union will be easy, neither quick or without effort.</seg>
<seg id=1923>But like the EU itself, this will be built and this will happen.</seg>
<seg id=1924>We know that the challenge is large, but is worthwhile and Europe must understand that this is our objective.</seg>
<seg id=1925>Restoration of Ukraine is partly by an innovative battle to end a century nightmare in which fascism and communism, ideologies born at the heart of Europe clashed to seize power.</seg>
<seg id=1926>Through cities Ukrainian a few months ago still, parents and children faced armed troops, from dogs and even death.</seg>
<seg id=1927>Only a few years ago was a young journalist Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public about corruption of the old regime, was abused and beheading by the henchmen of the regime.</seg>
<seg id=1928>Our Orange Revolution, last winter, proved that Ukraine and its people can win.</seg>
<seg id=1929>So, despite the doubts and the difficulties, I retain a an confidence in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1930>I refuse to accept despair as final response to ambiguities and horrors of history of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id=1931>I refuse to accept the idea that Ukraine is so tragically condemned to live in the middle of the night without stars of communist legacy to never to see the end of the day of peace and a real European unity.</seg>
<seg id=1932>When the citizens of Europe about the place of Ukraine in Europe we need for them to consider closely and have to look beyond the front will show them.</seg>
<seg id=1933>Look beyond the devastated areas that Communism imposed on us, beyond poverty and social divisions by which our former leaders now defeated sought to extend their hand.</seg>
<seg id=1934>It will be better for them to consider closely the face of our President, Victor Yushchenko, devastated by poison that we managed to it during the election campaign of last year, and to recall the words of that great French that was André Malraux, where "best faces is what we wounded.</seg>
<seg id=1935>Muslim civil war the</seg>
<seg id=1936>Is the gap between Sunnis and Shia in the Middle East now deeper than antagonism between Israel and the Arabs?</seg>
<seg id=1937>One might think this when the reaction of some Arab governments in the decisions of Hezbollah to attack Israel.</seg>
<seg id=1938>While the Israeli bombs in Beirut and tyr, Saudi Arabia, perhaps the Muslim Arab state most conservative, openly condemned the actions of the Shiite Hezbollah that initiated the war against Israel.</seg>
<seg id=1939>Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, a state that as the leader of the people Arab Muslims had supported Israel so openly.</seg>
<seg id=1940>Moreover, the breaking of Saudi Arabia with Hezbollah is not unique.</seg>
<seg id=1941>Egypt and Jordan also categorically condemned Hezbollah and its leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, for their adventurism.</seg>
<seg id=1942>What is behind this astonishing situation?</seg>
<seg id=1943>Are we in time living a key turning point in relations between Arab nationalism and Islamic amount?</seg>
<seg id=1944>Does the government Sunni of Saudi Arabia feel more fear and concern about the Shia Islam that does not mean in Arab unity and the Palestinian cause?</seg>
<seg id=1945>The denunciations of Hezbollah by Arabs suggest that Muslim sectarian divide, already evident in daily violence in Iraq is widening and intensifies throughout the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1946>The will of President George W. Bush to destroy the cold companies of the Arab world was doomed to set the forces of modernization against traditional elements of Islamic and Arab societies.</seg>
<seg id=1947>It appears in place to have released most atavistic forces in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1948>The opening of this Pandora's box will produce an era even more horrific for widespread violence, with what can be called a "Muslim civil war."</seg>
<seg id=1949>The gap Shiite Sunni exists since the dawn of the history of Islam, but geographical and ethnic isolation of Shiite Iran not Arabic, as well as the domination of their minorities Shiite by Arab Sunnis, usually left this competition in background.</seg>
<seg id=1950>These tensions distant more during the wave of "Islamization" created by the Iranian revolution, because in its wake the sectarian identity of Sunni Arabs is pushed into the background as became widespread "Islamic" claim.</seg>
<seg id=1951>All this changed when al-Qaeda, a terrorist group Sunni which is largely by ideology and staff Saudi wahabbites, launched its attacks on America of September 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1952>A branch specifically Sunni of militant Islam was moving.</seg>
<seg id=1953>When the US launched wars both against the Taliban Sunnis to Afghanistan and the Iraqi regime Sunni, this new radical trend Sunni acquired more boldness still.</seg>
<seg id=1954>The region's Sunni Arabs, who now won in insurance, that Israel and the West as a single threat, other understanding the supposed "growing Shia" -- the arc of land which extends from Lebanon in Iran and Syria to and Iraq, inhabited by supposed the Shiite heretical.</seg>
<seg id=1955>Perhaps the leaders of Saudi Arabia, as guardians of the sacred sites of Muslim faith in Mecca and médine, feel this threat with worse.</seg>
<seg id=1956>For Sunni, Shia not just to dominate regions oil-rich of Iran, Iraq and the parts of the east of Saudi Arabia, they also test, by acts of Hezbollah, to usurp the role of "guard" of central dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cause.</seg>
<seg id=1957>It is because the Saudi royal family derives its legitimacy from a strict form of Sunni and questions the loyalty of its population Shiite that UK differs from Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id=1958>The irony of thing is that America, protective of long of Saudi Arabia, made taking responsibility for possible Shiite by toppling Saddam Hussein and by putting the Shiite parties in power in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=1959>The Bush Administration appears to recognize what did; as the Shiite arc arises in the east of the Arab Muslim world, the US is trying to consolidate their protection of Arc Sunni -- Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia - in the West of the region.</seg>
<seg id=1960>Israel, once deadly adversary of Arab cause, seems today embedded in this defensive structure.</seg>
<seg id=1961>But such a defensive position is inevitably unstable, simply by the sentiments panarabes.</seg>
<seg id=1962>Today, ordinary Saudi citizens do not take off Al Jazeera and other Arab TV networks of satellite to follow events in Gaza and southern Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id=1963>They see running Arab blood (not Shia), and only Hezbollah to answer.</seg>
<seg id=1964>For them, Hezbollah became a model of heroic resistance.</seg>
<seg id=1965>This leads the Saudi state to increase Sunni schism Shiite.</seg>
<seg id=1966>After the official denunciation of Hezbollah by Britain, the Saudi state asked its official clergy Wahhabi for fatwas condemning Hezbollah as a heretical and a deviant Shiite.</seg>
<seg id=1967>Such sentences can only exacerbate sectarian divisions in Saudi Arabia and in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1968>At the worsening of these antagonism, Sunni regimes finish by believing that they need their own Hezbollah fighting in their corner?</seg>
<seg id=1969>If they achieve this conclusion, they will not need to look far, because the fighters of such already followed a training - provided by Al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id=1970>Why Europe cannot ignore longer Georgia</seg>
<seg id=1971>The time when Europe could rely on America to make war, restoring peace and democracy in their own Court is over.</seg>
<seg id=1972>The enlargement of the European Union, as demonstrated by the recent crisis of Russian gas, this court includes now not only Ukraine but also Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1973>Indeed, in Georgia, as in Ukraine, democracy is being tested and Europe cannot afford to ignore it.</seg>
<seg id=1974>Georgia was the first country of post-Soviet space to make his "revolution of colour" and thereby making evidence, with dignity and maturity, the choice of its people towards democracy and European values.</seg>
<seg id=1975>Flags of the European Union that float on all public buildings Georgians since then demonstrate the natural attachment, as old as history of this country which the ancient Greeks, part of the world's time.</seg>
<seg id=1976>Prometheus, médée, amazones and in its neighbour Armenia Noah's ark, are all signs as Europe of our myths starts there.</seg>
<seg id=1977>In its history, its civilization, its traditions, former but also more recent when Georgia was different from other republics of the former USSR, by its critical, independent even critical, Georgia is probably still the place of this space where democratic transplant can take best.</seg>
<seg id=1978>It is all the more worrying to see the threatened democratization.</seg>
<seg id=1979>Everything seemed well enough to have begun.</seg>
<seg id=1980>Through launching achieved easily a policy of reforms, of privatization, fighting corruption, search for new frameworks and thus free of compromises with the previous regime, implementing a foreign policy marked by a return of Europe in the game Georgian.</seg>
<seg id=1981>The totalitarian state of mind since has resurfaced in those leaders who constantly, representatives of the majority, adapted ever more powers.</seg>
<seg id=1982>It is a caste who the such Hydra with thousand heads continually dying and revived its ashes.</seg>
<seg id=1983>These and their methods of power that the "Rose Revolution" of November 2003 wanted however once and for all have reintroduced the heart power, using their networks, with ramifications including outside the, their considerable financial burden, their skill at intrigues and manipulation of political and electoral equipment.</seg>
<seg id=1984>It is a power that does not sufficiently respect the essence of democracy which is not in the polls but in separation and the balance of power.</seg>
<seg id=1985>Every day, the government to interfere in the legislature, most of laws is written with the presidential Chancellery; Parliament is to control the daily exercise of government policy, including, in my case, the nomination of ambassadors and everyday work!</seg>
<seg id=1986>Finally, and this is more serious, the judiciary is still unable to free ourselves from the oversight of the executive and no longer represents or not yet for citizen or the investor's guarantor and guard, without which no rule of law, or of Economic Freedom</seg>
<seg id=1987>It is a society that to be democratic in its head, is still not in his leg is still hesitates to engage in politics leaving the scene to those with it for too long.</seg>
<seg id=1988>Because democracy is in danger of rock, but because it is still there, strongly established in the population, in civil society organisations, a press that is sought but which does not lose its faculty critical...</seg>
<seg id=1989>This is the time for Europe to save the democracy in order not to destroy these hopes.</seg>
<seg id=1990>The US has done what they could, since independence, and they are with stability mafia.</seg>
<seg id=1991>The stability was certainly not identified with democracy under the rule of Eduard Shevardnadze, former Foreign Minister Soviet the Rose Revolution sacked of its position of President Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1992>But the Americans invested very generously in the survival of elites Georgian and their training of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1993>Criticism of the Soros initiatives, today's regime, is more unfair: the revolution of November was not created of all sides by the US, with all due respect to the propaganda of Russian nationalists too used to direct aid to think otherwise, but the democratic carriers has certainly been fed, encouraged and supported by the aid Soros Foundation.</seg>
<seg id=1994>The course to be crossed today so that Georgia off its organization -- then forever the totalitarian evil, is a complex step which requires a support of another nature, that Europeans are more likely to provide.</seg>
<seg id=1995>The models that should be provided for the balance of power, the institutions of rule of law, the operation of legal or local democracy must start with the European forms closer to reality mafia than the Anglo-Saxon model, American alternative.</seg>
<seg id=1996>If Europe now rejected this task, it will betray his duty fundamental towards this country, small, Mediterranean and flexible, historical tradition, where democracy is more likely to succeed than in Ukraine, which is both great and always Soviet in spirit, let alone the Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1997>Not to help Georgia is accepting that democracy and thus stability are long ahead not only to Tbilisi, but more importantly to Kiev, Minsk, to say nothing of Moscow.</seg>
<seg id=1998>This is especially to take a very serious risk.</seg>
<seg id=1999>Moscow which ups and downs, endless shilly-shallying, an internal heartbreaking, began to be resigned to the idea of democratic inevitability, at least to its sea, not without having to abandon its imperial dreams and their instruments of domination, could suddenly review its perception.</seg>
<seg id=2000>This halting resignation, the acceptance of a normality in its relations with its neighbours, which has only just beginning, can be carried by sudden eruption of irrational of Russian power of this infamous "derjava" that cannot withstand the attractiveness of weakness in the sense of vacuum, temptation to again not equal, but most.</seg>
<seg id=2001>This explains the recent crisis of Russian gas.</seg>
<seg id=2002>Any sign of a decline in democracy, slowing of democratic wave, will be taken by Moscow as a foolish hope of reversibility where gradually Russia itself accustomed to believe in this.</seg>
<seg id=2003>It is Europe's responsibility to convince Russia that it places at scotches his hope in a return to the past.</seg>
<seg id=2004>Europe Is it responsible from itself, with its future energy independence is as this responsibility to show that there are also strong European values -- of liberty, democracy, justice between people.</seg>
<seg id=2005>For that Europe needs instruments of its policies: a great founding public private for Europe and democracy, a university to form, the executives of tomorrow's democracies that are still sought a police, army of judges and magistrates who live models near the companies that convert.</seg>
<seg id=2006>Europe needs above all conviction.</seg>
<seg id=2007>If Europe were not appropriate itself itself is interested in the fate of its neighbours, their democracy and in the future of its values and its spread, who will believe it tomorrow?</seg>
