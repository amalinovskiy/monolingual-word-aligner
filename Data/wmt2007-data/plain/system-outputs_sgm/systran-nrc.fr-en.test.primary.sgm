<seg id=1>Our Declaration of the Rights which is the first way the millennium.</seg>
<seg id=2>Let us organise itself to 15 in order to be able to welcome the right conditions for countries which are knocking on our door.</seg>
<seg id=3>The field of basic public services of social, cultural and charitable interest must be listed in Article 87 so that these important institutions can enjoy a sustainable protection.</seg>
<seg id=4>Some believe that we can create an internal market in Europe without agreeing on fundamental values and principles.</seg>
<seg id=5>I want to welcome, in my turn, strong and substantial intervention of President Prodi.</seg>
<seg id=6>You know that it is a deliberate choice that was made in Amsterdam, to distinguish between the two functions raring the high representative, unlike the Commission is not expressed independently, but he has to coordinate the common foreign and security policy which are the responsibility of the Member States and that we should perhaps allow considerable scope for the intergovernmental.</seg>
<seg id=7>It hoped that the Presidency trace in Nice the way for the future.</seg>
<seg id=8>We can actually want more and better, but I think quite honestly that it is a good start.</seg>
<seg id=9>I therefore hope that the Nice European Council will endorse this project and decides to commit itself as a project and not as accomplished fact, having obviously adopted the reforms that are necessary.</seg>
<seg id=10>I, however, as stated clearly in the current situation, we could achieve important goals of the Community way, such as a more effective action in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg id=11>It is only by linking Russia to the West and the European Union that we will be able to have an influence on its policy and to keep the contact and dialogue with it.</seg>
<seg id=12>Motion for a resolution (B5-0767 / 00) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=13>At the same time it continues this genocide and also seeks to destroy the freedom of the press and the rule of law which only exist in that country.</seg>
<seg id=14>To try to meet the expectations of this pensioner, who is called Giuseppe Italia, lives in Cremona, and would like to surf cop, I voted in favour of the Piecyk report on the development of seaports, inland ports and intermodal on problem-solver.</seg>
<seg id=15>The outcome of the vote in this House banned the object of the directive, however, accepted and approved by all the speakers and the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=16>Mr President, I voted in favour of the Skinner report, as I said during the debate, before the vote, because I believe that the venture capital is important.</seg>
<seg id=17>My party colleague Armonie Bordes emphasised yesterday in harsh terms that only a minority benefits from the commitment of Community funds and contributions to the case of pensions for the risk of society.</seg>
<seg id=18>Consequently, the Charter will be used more to devote the current practices, including retrograde, of the national States to represent progress.</seg>
<seg id=19>Mr President, we finally have a Charter of the rights of European citizens whose whole article, Article 25, which is dedicated to the elderly.</seg>
<seg id=20>This text may be painless first, since it takes up existing rights essentially. But if it were incorporated into the Treaty with binding force, as the European Parliament demands, it would tend mechanically, in time, with the standardisation of national rights in Europe; it would give a disproportionate power to the Court of Justice; it would encourage a greater centralisation around the European institutions; it would limit the autonomous margin for decision of each nation.</seg>
<seg id=21>· We must avoid overburdening the Charter with detailed regulations and leaving the care of those with secondary legislation.</seg>
<seg id=22>I will vote for another Charter by taking part in the demonstrations in Biarritz, 13 and 14 October, and in Nice on 7 December 2000.</seg>
<seg id=23>Progress towards the accession of the 12 candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=24>I believe that a number of Member States did not take the existence of this link yet to date and did not understand that a tentative progress of the Intergovernmental Conference could raise enormous difficulties to us in order to impose enlargement within the necessary delays.</seg>
<seg id=25>We will not be able to impose, in the long term, all that I have just mentioned up to now that if the political world and the elites of the applicant countries and the European Union – and, in this specific good, I agree with you, Commissioner – finally state that the enlargement of the Union benefits it.</seg>
<seg id=26>It is the formula adopted.</seg>
<seg id=27>Let me turn to the second guideline obeying the Presidency wishes to develop during this six-month period of the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=28>I therefore propose, it is to work in this direction with the idea that we will have to examine, from the point of view of 2003, which are the candidates who are ready to join us on this date.</seg>
<seg id=29>I thank the rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his clear and comprehensive report.</seg>
<seg id=30>The aim of the negotiations is in no way 'if': it is a question of 'how' and 'when'.</seg>
<seg id=31>But they did so because the prospect of accession to the European Union their fact of hope for the solidarity of the European people and that it offers a political and economic roots them strong.</seg>
<seg id=32>A number of countries have so far advanced as regards the second economic criteria - competition on the internal market - that they are around the corner of accession.</seg>
<seg id=33>We therefore seek close coordination with the programmes of the national governments, Parliament and other institutions.</seg>
<seg id=34>Every year, and we will be here once again - on 8 November, all the candidate countries eagerly await the judgment that the Commission passes on their progress.</seg>
<seg id=35>We have chosen to reason for the principle of differentiation, according to which each candidate country is assessed on its own merits.</seg>
<seg id=36>This debate is a further opportunity for my group to confirm that the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, but also of Cyprus and Malta – is the best guarantee future for all of us in Europe, in the East and in the West.</seg>
<seg id=37>The task, which is important, however, did not arouse great interest on the part of the public yet.</seg>
<seg id=38>People joke about enlargement which, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, must always speak in five years alone.</seg>
<seg id=39>The next natural opportunity, they will be the European elections in 2009, but we want to make an effort to ensure that the maximum country can join since 2004.</seg>
<seg id=40>Furthermore, six other fundamental problems concern us because of the method followed.</seg>
<seg id=41>In fact, it is the very model of European construction, in which we ourselves into, I mean the simultaneous integration of all sectors of activity whatever the traditions and the specific characteristics of each other's, which are turned once again into the trap.</seg>
<seg id=42>The expression of this almost universal feeling in Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the 1980s commits us all until today.</seg>
<seg id=43>However, that things are clear: there can be no accession on the cheap.</seg>
<seg id=44>There is a powerful idea which is as a nice idea: to be said that we will not make enlargements against the opinions and that the best way, indeed, of making enlargement with the opinions through their participation in the elections, as the elections are an expression of democracy and the method of accession of the people in the political system.</seg>
<seg id=45>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to comment briefly on the conditions to enable the scenario that several speakers wanted.</seg>
<seg id=46>You should not forget that these people are interests.</seg>
<seg id=47>However, I have already stated that all the countries mentioned this relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id=48>That means that we have already decided on the liberalisation of trade in the area of agricultural products without the Poles not fear that results from the collapse of their agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=49>Tensions happened, but as a whole, peace and trade between the citizens of the closer relations, which are exacerbated by the monetary Union.</seg>
<seg id=50>It must be the results of the negotiations that count.</seg>
<seg id=51>The only amendment which was tabled at the moment is covered by this report, but I am already that the Green Group wishes to stress the need for equal treatment of all citizens.</seg>
<seg id=52>That does not just involve law in the field of public service but also to open up possibilities of appropriate remuneration for young officials.</seg>
<seg id=53>That applies both to Latvia that the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=54>The joining of Litai to the euro is provided for in the second half of 2001.</seg>
<seg id=55>Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am rapporteur, is the biggest and most important, but, as we know, the most problematic of countries who are preparing to join the European Union to tell the truth, it is causing so many problems which it intends to raise the voices calling for the exclusion of the first group, that of the countries which will join the first.</seg>
<seg id=56>We have too many promises broken in Poland, with the eastern European countries, the formerly communist countries.</seg>
<seg id=57>There is a point which has regularly when it comes to the Czech Republic is the Roma problem.</seg>
<seg id=58>Slovakia is not condemned to remain in the second group and it is logical that it wants to join the Union at the same time as the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id=59>I would finally like to allow me a final comment on internal policy.</seg>
<seg id=60>Thirdly, with regard to agriculture, whose level of productivity is still lower than that of the European Union, it must be completely open the agricultural market with capital to the privatisation of land, the modernisation of farms and the structures of downstream, as well as improving the yields.</seg>
<seg id=61>Bulgaria is in a hurry to join the European Union and NATO.</seg>
<seg id=62>In chapter of extreme poverty - an issue which affects the Romanian one since 1990 - there is at last real signs of economic progress under the current government.</seg>
<seg id=63>I hope that these issues are becoming a priority for the new Parliament which will come from that fortnight and of the new government.</seg>
<seg id=64>But we also stress that the final solution, just and lasting must fully respect both the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, which is nothing more than the current international law, and the principles governing the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=65>Malta has also functional stable and democratic institutions.</seg>
<seg id=66>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we want to make our contribution to this debate.</seg>
<seg id=67>Yet they should be implemented by the European Community law is not just a collection of laws: it must also be a law applied in the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=68>This change poses difficult challenges to the citizens of the applicant countries but also ensures that, at the same time, their future and that their children.</seg>
<seg id=69>I agree with the previous speaker: we need to pay special attention to the border regions.</seg>
<seg id=70>In this respect, the Commission should not be left!</seg>
<seg id=71>The candidate countries are soon to be put on the path of economic growth, although it must be at the expense of the policy of protecting nature defined before.</seg>
<seg id=72>On the one hand and other, we have kept bad habits, most linked to health.</seg>
<seg id=73>- (ES) Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and united continent of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=74>The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and qualified trans-European networks, are aware that it is necessary to coordinate the various sectoral Community policies in favour of a global policy planning.</seg>
<seg id=75>I must stress yet again on the fact that the transport infrastructure are of the utmost importance to the success of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=76>Mr President, I agree with you when you say that enlargement is the main task of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=77>The traditional social values specific to the former planned economies in Central and Eastern Europe have been badly.</seg>
<seg id=78>The PPE-DE Group does not want to discharge the candidate countries from the responsibility of the pace of progress in the accession process: we cannot express any date.</seg>
<seg id=79>The second point is the appointment of the dates.</seg>
<seg id=80>There is another reason.</seg>
<seg id=81>Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the various countries and the EU as a whole dependent – the example of Denmark is there for us to show it – elimination on social and democratic deficits for European policy.</seg>
<seg id=82>The populism is the shameful dress up the technocrats give the popular will when it is expressed in a direction which is not appropriate to them.</seg>
<seg id=83>Ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for pause and the dinner. We will resume at 9 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=84>We will have, even if it is carried out later, the same currency for the whole continent.</seg>
<seg id=85>These thematic cause internal battles in each country.</seg>
<seg id=86>We invite them to fight for a different Europe, that of all the people, by removing all these inhumane characteristics, where people will be masters of their destiny, between them relations of peace, freedom, fraternity, mutually beneficial cooperation will develop.</seg>
<seg id=87>I publicly do the praise for their work and, in particular, the work carried out by Roma challenge appeal, whose headquarters are located in Birmingham, as well as the work of other organisations Irish supported by a number of people whose Daniel o scientist, the Irish artist, who promised 1 million pounds it collected in Ireland and other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id=88>The summit nizza must above all make it clear whether and how the EU will be able, for its part, will ultimately be ready in time for this enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=89>The Poles wonder if they will also benefit when they join or if they become a country of second-class.</seg>
<seg id=90>However, I am convinced that with good will and support of the European Union, a solution will be found which will allow the two communities harmoniously to live and prosper, as they did for centuries.</seg>
<seg id=91>We were also concerned about the problem of minorities because the issue of the integration of these minorities, including their linguistic integration, is also important in these countries.</seg>
<seg id=92>The requirement to be able to become a Member of the Union is basically to meet the basic requirements, known as the Copenhagen criteria.</seg>
<seg id=93>The benefits of enlargement have been mentioned, and it is one of the topics on which Lithuania can teach us something.</seg>
<seg id=94>Imagine that they are all like that.</seg>
<seg id=95>Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs, but I would particularly like to confine myself to Slovakia, and especially with the policy towards minorities.</seg>
<seg id=96>I therefore ask you at the forthcoming summit in nizza to set a deadline for which you intend to conclude the negotiations with the most advanced candidate countries on the road, without mentioning the name.</seg>
<seg id=97>The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its efforts to join the Union and, of course, to ensure that the planning of this aid is decentralised even.</seg>
<seg id=98>The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of civil society, the government and the parliament is an important part of this and - as we can see it as positive.</seg>
<seg id=99>We are finishing the division of Europe into two blocs and not to create a new division.</seg>
<seg id=100>All these things off appear in the report by Mrs Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, whom I thank on behalf of our group.</seg>
<seg id=101>In this respect, I believe that the question of Cyprus is, par excellence, for that will be judged on Europe's ability to see its political aspect.</seg>
<seg id=102>I myself live close to the Baltic Sea, which is for us a whole an ecological problem.</seg>
<seg id=103>The political vision remains.</seg>
<seg id=104>Therefore, it was very good to hear that Mr Hänsch, who decided on behalf of the PSE Group, hoped that the Commission should carry out a proper assessment of the effects of enlargement and of the economic consequences if enlargement should not take place.</seg>
<seg id=105>However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, according to which the setting of transitional periods is essential in the interests of both parties, and as an MEP from a border region and - as Mrs Schierhuber, the owner of a farm located near the Czech border, I particularly want to see the creation of close common economic space can be monitored without major problems and produce positive results on both sides.</seg>
<seg id=106>As a Social Democrat, I would like to highlight three points.</seg>
<seg id=107>The EEA which includes cases of the first pillar is on the one hand to companies applicant countries access to the internal market and youth and scientists have the right to participate in exchange programmes, but on the other hand, does not oblige the EU still to extend its aid system for agriculture with these countries.</seg>
<seg id=108>Secondly, we must say 'no' to the concept which bang would admit that at the same time an important group of countries, because that would be at odds with the principle of the admission of each country on its merits.</seg>
<seg id=109>Thirdly, we must do everything for, by 2003, to prepare the EU for the enlargement process in the direction of the excellent speech by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.</seg>
<seg id=110>In this respect, I would like to refer to the existing relationship between Parliament and the Council by highlighting the fact that there are enormous delays with regard to the answers to written questions.</seg>
<seg id=111>It is worrying to see that such things are happening in a country which will join the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=112>I therefore ask for the matter to be referred to the Committee on Legal Affairs so that it can prepare for all this.</seg>
<seg id=113>Mr President, we are discussing today, and perhaps to vote on three reports on the whole deal with this subject, two of which are of my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=114>All the players in the food chain would have in fact of winners.</seg>
<seg id=115>Safety will cost money all the actors in the food chain.</seg>
<seg id=116>It is therefore necessary to follow Mrs Paulsen and the Commission to adopt the principle of nondilution to secure the animal feed and genuinely to protect European consumers.</seg>
<seg id=117>The 1999 directive was indeed thought and it can boast right now on a success because the taxes could be reduced substantially.</seg>
<seg id=118>However, to allow purely and simply dilution does not provide a solution.</seg>
<seg id=119>Very quickly, we must insist on Amendment No 37 on dioxin.</seg>
<seg id=120>On this point we agree.</seg>
<seg id=121>Therefore, it will mean that we, the European consumers, we will continue to buy on world markets of beef and milk and derived from those produced from animal nutrition which are completely unrelated to the minimum and maximum limits set by the European Union and by a feed production system, buying raw materials on the international markets, free to mix any principle and composed, before introducing their products on the territory of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=122>We must be able to have, for the second reading, of the opinion of the committee on how to carry out the assessment of risk.</seg>
<seg id=123>On the other hand, it would be inappropriate, for example, to adopt Amendments Nos 39 and 40, because that would mean removing the possibility for the Member States, to intervene promptly against dangers which has suddenly discovered.</seg>
<seg id=124>Consumer protection begins from feed, of feed ingredients, the declaration and, finally, official controls.</seg>
<seg id=125>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our colleague Mrs Paulsen on undesirable substances in animal feed is an important issue and, like all the important issues, it is highly controversial.</seg>
<seg id=126>Mr President, the debate on this excellent report by Mrs Paulsen has been, on certain points, very busy on emotionally, and now that the debate is closed, I think we must assume that the demands made on the animal feed sector are certainly strict, but that we will then be able to ensure that quality is evolving by mixtures.</seg>
<seg id=127>Individually and together, these three proposals aim to fill the considerable shortcomings that have been highlighted by the dioxin crisis.</seg>
<seg id=128>Amendment No 33 removes the possibility of exporting the batch non-compliant towards the country of origin.</seg>
<seg id=129>Nor can I accept the amendments 41,42,43 and 44 which seek to restore the possibility of watering down, under certain conditions, of raw materials for the manufacture of feedingstuffs which is contaminated.</seg>
<seg id=130>They should be enough, given the commitment we made to establish, within the framework of the new proposal on the food authority, a rapid alert system covering the whole of the products and the food chain.</seg>
<seg id=131>Commissioner Byrne, behind this directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs, hidden, basically a problem we have for a long time, namely the question of open declaration.</seg>
<seg id=132>And for that reason alone, I will have learnt something.</seg>
<seg id=133>Because if we quickly put this into practice and if we set in motion the codecision procedure quickly, that would certainly be an appreciable gain and I am convinced that, with the Council, we shall be strong and united.</seg>
<seg id=134>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it may be that in future the contaminated raw materials can also enter the composition of feedingstuffs, in any case, that is not to be excluded.</seg>
<seg id=135>The BSE scandal is the worst known example.</seg>
<seg id=136>Common sense – our rapporteur says – is to have a label with open declaration, which gives the list of ingredients.</seg>
<seg id=137>I believe that the technical expertise, as well as the ability of the judgement of the members of the Committee on Agriculture are no doubt in the field of agriculture and of feedingstuffs, in order to find a solution channelled into practice and applicable which must be applied and understood by farmers and consumers.</seg>
<seg id=138>That is for the positive points.</seg>
<seg id=139>It is, in my opinion, of a legitimate right to information which must be met.</seg>
<seg id=140>Madam President, I ask you, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, to send a message of condolence from Parliament to the families of the victims and to the local authorities of both Brittany and of Marín, city of Galicia, which is from the majority of the victims.</seg>
<seg id=141>(Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=142>There are Members who oppose the tabling of this oral amendment?</seg>
<seg id=143>It is good that the rapporteur has explained to us.</seg>
<seg id=144>The majority of its technical proposals deserve to be supported with heat, for example on food safety, the dismantling of nuclear power stations of the first generation, environmental protection, the fight against social dumping, the essential code of conduct for companies in the West when they work in the East, etc., it is a huge task, and also absolute priority.</seg>
<seg id=145>At the same time, the difficulties to be overcome remain considerable, especially on the budget.</seg>
<seg id=146>Enlargement with 13 countries change not only the geopolitical context of the European Union, but it also changes the structure of this since, at the same time the total population will increase (+ 28%), but also the number of 'less-favoured regions'.</seg>
<seg id=147>In this respect, we should take account of the fact that in the candidate countries, an agricultural and food competitive will be of decisive importance for the success of the process of transformation and restructuring, because of its economic power and social high.</seg>
<seg id=148>For this reason, I would like the outermost regions, whose 6 out of 10 7 always among the poorest in the EU, benefit from the structural funds, not only on the criterion of GDP, but also on geographical and demographic indicators, especially social.</seg>
<seg id=149>Because we reject it in the interests of French, we cannot in all conscience, to approve its enlargement to the eastern European countries and the people, not been freed from communist dictatorship and which do not yet know which technocratic and totalitarian trap they want to join.</seg>
<seg id=150>We should have at most, limited to a short but intense resolution with regard to the reports on the countries.</seg>
<seg id=151>The current system, consisting of subsidies, subsidies and quotas, must be replaced by free trade and adjusted to the market.</seg>
<seg id=152>The importance and the extent of the problems that enlargement is not compatible with the double language used in what concerns them within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=153>For me, speaking of enlargement does not mean to sanction the membership or not some countries in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=154>Our neighbour resolutely tried over the past decade to meet the accession criteria.</seg>
<seg id=155>Latvia has a place in this House, not only because, overall, its progress right to give him credit for this' essential 'confidence to conclude such negotiations, but above all, and above all, because it is at this in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=156>I believe that, amongst the countries which have applied for membership, Poland is the State that more deserves our support, our commitment, since, without the very important initiatives of Poland, the fall of communism would not have taken place and we would not be here today to speak about this problem.</seg>
<seg id=157>That may be not so evident to the Polish people which remains largely movement.</seg>
<seg id=158>I invite Prague to take this message, this invitation, this request for dialogue, to act and to make it so that, together with this House, these being nationalistic period relics may be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=159>(IT) I welcome the Wiersma report on Slovakia's application for membership of the European Union and I agree with the majority of conclusions that he draws.</seg>
<seg id=160>On this occasion, I am pleased to address a special security for the elderly and pensioners Bulgarian Republic.</seg>
<seg id=161>I therefore do not see any reason why that Romania is not permitted within the European Union, if it continues to make progress at the same pace, and once the Union will have carried out the necessary adjustment of its institutional structure and its policies to cope with enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=162>Whatever solution is on the settlers, and God knows the problem is difficult, such as the return of land on both sides, which says that the report is too hard not to deserve a reserve.</seg>
<seg id=163>Unfortunately, some of the comments on the draft report on Cyprus' s membership application to the European Union, established by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, are not much help in this respect.</seg>
<seg id=164>This will not be easy, given the lack of good will of the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=165>Stenzel report (A5-0243 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=166>Misery, I was the victim of a food poisoning, albeit small, in the European Parliament, alas.</seg>
<seg id=167>For all these reasons, I voted in favour of the prohibition of dilution which is proposed by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=168>We must, in this resolution, to urge the ASEM countries so that they put pressure on the Burmese military regime in order to restore democracy in the country.</seg>
<seg id=169>We bias in our approach and our way of doing.</seg>
<seg id=170>It is not the time to be hesitant.</seg>
<seg id=171>I would like to mention a number of important points of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=172>The equal treatment and that no discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=173>For this reason we need a legislation against discrimination.</seg>
<seg id=174>We are therefore now with a large number of legal technical amendments aimed at ensuring equal degree of protection against discrimination based on race, on the one hand and discrimination on the grounds of religion, disability, age and sexual orientation, on the other.</seg>
<seg id=175>It was necessary to make an effort to balance and moderation and good legal technique and his report reflects - in my opinion, all these qualities.</seg>
<seg id=176>Furthermore, they believe that the cases of discrimination are not enough of them to justify a directive.</seg>
<seg id=177>The action plan before us does not provide sufficient resources to replace relevant work of the fifth framework programme - work which, I hope, will continue to be guaranteed in the other framework programmes - and we must therefore take care of their complementarity.</seg>
<seg id=178>Everyone agrees that it is necessary to combat discrimination, but opinions differ when it is a question of how and to what extent and in what way.</seg>
<seg id=179>I had the opportunity, in committee, to speak out against the fact that the experts can also be made them and NGOs to do have something to say.</seg>
<seg id=180>We are also very pleased with the provision of the directive stating that the equal treatment for people with disabilities also means that the companies are supposed to make adjustments in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=181>That is the only way we will succeed in effectively combating discrimination in all areas of life societal in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=182>After all, as we learn that the great Anglo-Saxon democracies, racism and discrimination are fought through the liberal democracy, and not by the restriction and the gradual erosion of economic freedoms, opinion, expression and association.</seg>
<seg id=183>Therefore, we have a proposal which raises homosexuality with the status of darned of marriage.</seg>
<seg id=184>We therefore strengthen the European Union ’ s positions on specific situations experienced by its citizens about the discrimination and equal treatment.</seg>
<seg id=185>I also refer to the issue of religious exemption.</seg>
<seg id=186>My attention was drawn to the potential interpretation of the explanatory statement in relation to Article 1, which again may seem a little obscure, if only to distinguish between the sexual orientation and behaviour.</seg>
<seg id=187>As what discrimination are treated on a hierarchical basis.</seg>
<seg id=188>In New Caledonia gives a preference described on a basis of the skin.</seg>
<seg id=189>These guidelines of the directive, together with the fact that, recently, the directive 2000 was adopted, show the clear will of the European Union to guarantee an open society, removed from predetermined categories and, above all, the scourge of racism which is deeply rooted in European history.</seg>
<seg id=190>Those who say that Europe must not adopt a directive setting out the values which we all want defend are wrong.</seg>
<seg id=191>Do not touch with these hard-won assets.</seg>
<seg id=192>Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the media must also play an important role in this task.</seg>
<seg id=193>The experience has also shown that the promotion of legislative measures to combat discrimination is essential, but it is not enough.</seg>
<seg id=194>We must certainly avoid confusion paperassières, which will do nothing but purely to reduce Europe to a body materialistic, politically correct, but unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id=195>I find all that Parliament instructed too heavily on legislation, ‘ reluctant ', that the European Commission wanted to propose.</seg>
<seg id=196>I shall begin by thanking the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, for their excellent reports.</seg>
<seg id=197>I also accept the amendments that you presented in order to stress the importance of the prevention of discrimination and to combat them.</seg>
<seg id=198>The second category is aimed at clarifying the text of the Commission proposal and the third is composed of a large number of amendments, the aim of which is to try to put this proposal into line with the directive on discrimination based on race, adopted in June.</seg>
<seg id=199>In particular, Amendments Nos 10 and 20 propose deleting the reference to the discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id=200>I cannot accept the reference you made in Amendments Nos 21 and 45, with the natural and legal persons as to the unofficial groupings, because this proposal employment applies only to individuals.</seg>
<seg id=201>The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.</seg>
<seg id=202>You cannot expect the public support for the peacekeeping if your troops are threatened with death by weapons which we ourselves have provided.</seg>
<seg id=203>Therefore, in my country, it would be a licence for me to have a shotgun but not to install me as broker at the back of my garden.</seg>
<seg id=204>Another important point: export ban, promote and market equipment and knowledge used for the practice of torture.</seg>
<seg id=205>Having said this, I would naturally like to congratulate the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Titley, for his excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=206>We must extend our considerations, on the one hand, the issues of constraint, but also with the means other than those intended for military use itself: with disarmament, conversion, strengthening the action of the customs authorities and the police, and on the other hand, to the candidate countries, as Mr Wiersma has just mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=207>The control of financial circuit is becoming increasingly difficult the circumvention of the regulations on trade in arms.</seg>
<seg id=208>The annual report is to identify such potential improvements.</seg>
<seg id=209>The European Union is currently considering the project beyond its expiry date, which will take place in November of this year.</seg>
<seg id=210>A methodology and indicators defined and will be presented to the next 'research'.</seg>
<seg id=211>I thank you, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=212>With regard to the problems of SMEs, of course, we have taken care to ensure that framework programme, SMEs have their share, as provided for in the budget decision.</seg>
<seg id=213>It at least emerges from the discussion of the budget in Greece and that it should be noted that those who propose the views of the European Union is are many is true?</seg>
<seg id=214>With regard to multidisciplinarity, I share your view.</seg>
<seg id=215>The first is the EU 's participation in the national programmes, which is mentioned specifically in its statement.</seg>
<seg id=216>We could not therefore talking about the European research area, if we are not, we are responsible for that 5% of this research.</seg>
<seg id=217>Thank you very much, Mr Busquin.</seg>
<seg id=218>On the one hand, following the effort made to fully commit appropriations at the end of 1999, the demands for Authority at the beginning of this year for the financing of new projects were necessarily very low.</seg>
<seg id=219>But I repeat that things were well made by Portugal for the previous period.</seg>
<seg id=220>Question No 2 by (H-0730 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=221>Finally, to set the excise duties on mineral oils at a high level does not lead to non-compliance with Community regulations on competition.</seg>
<seg id=222>Secondly, as Mr MacCormick knows, when the Member States support an industrial sector given by fiscal measures, it violates the rules on state aid, in fact the tax state aid amounts to subsidies.</seg>
<seg id=223>Nuclear energy, for example, is a very clear example.</seg>
<seg id=224>Subject: budget line 'minority languages' the budget of the European Union in favour of minority languages which exist since 1983, has been increasing steadily until 1995, the year in which they were high (EUR 4 million).</seg>
<seg id=225>Mr President, our colleagues in the House will be aware that very important resources are allocated to the Structural Funds - and this is new - with the cultural activities, because, with my colleague Michel Barnier, we attached importance to the fact that structural funds have not only invest in the roads or airports but also in human beings.</seg>
<seg id=226>The Commission will therefore not make new financial commitments next year.</seg>
<seg id=227>With regard to the specific proposals of funding, it is not possible for me to give an opinion here, because we must observe the normal procedure.</seg>
<seg id=228>I thought of several possibilities.</seg>
<seg id=229>It is therefore necessary that something is done about it, because it is million small and medium-sized enterprises throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id=230>Does it cover the regulatory requirements hunting, for example with the impetus, as well as the treatment of meat destined for personal consumption?</seg>
<seg id=231>If we were to implement this regulation to meat which is drunk itself, it would be for the elk hunters of a bureaucratic disaster.</seg>
<seg id=232>I intend, after the conclusion of this report, to present proposals to improve the transport of animals and to address the problem of inadequate application of the restrictions of travel times.</seg>
<seg id=233>We have already discussed this issue at my meeting with the Group of the Greens.</seg>
<seg id=234>Our question was clear: what are the measures taken by the Commission?</seg>
<seg id=235>The general product safety also obliges the producers to inform consumers of the risks.</seg>
<seg id=236>The case of Maryam ayubi is extremely worrying.</seg>
<seg id=237>Question No 14 by (H-0745 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=238>The attitude of the EU with regard to this ministerial meeting in Vientiane, and even the question of its presence or the degree to which the EU should be represented, will depend on the development of the situation in Burma in December too.</seg>
<seg id=239>A final point.</seg>
<seg id=240>Elections are an important step in the participation of Kosovar in managing their own communities.</seg>
<seg id=241>I can even tell you that the holding of these elections more democratic, was held over some of our countries, to which I was, either as a participant, or as an observer.</seg>
<seg id=242>But we considered it a beginning and not in any way of the outcome of the process.</seg>
<seg id=243>It calls for a more effective control of the arms trade and for greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id=244>I now see that the number of contracts on arms and their components is increasing every year.</seg>
<seg id=245>We cannot make concrete decisions on the basis of information, shadow of shadow realities.</seg>
<seg id=246>The arrangement which was to maintain them together in the same DG should be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id=247>If these institutions must have the opportunity to appoint an internal auditor, it might be sufficient to impose minimum requirements audit to the Financial Controller.</seg>
<seg id=248>The Commissioner will be aware, this proposal does not achieve the unanimity in this House.</seg>
<seg id=249>We have nothing to object to an independent internal auditing service, to which we give the green light today through the report by our colleague, Mr van Hulten.</seg>
<seg id=250>Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=251>We are of the opinion that the modernisation of administration is urgently needed.</seg>
<seg id=252>An independent counter check is essential to avoid the mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=253>Money must be spent on a better targeted and more effective in the future, of course, we must be better able to ensure that the money is actually spent for the purposes for which they were affected by the budgetary authorities.</seg>
<seg id=254>On the amendments, I would like to briefly make the following point: the Commission agrees with this additional recital.</seg>
<seg id=255>So I thank you for your proposals and your deliberations.</seg>
<seg id=256>I would like to summarise the proposals for this report which firstly seem to me to be the most important and practical operational, the creation of an expert group, consisting of individuals appointed by the Member States, which should help to define minimum parameters for the protection of minors in the media; secondly, the creation of a code of self-regulation by all operators in the sector; thirdly, the possibility of encouraging and to make available the devices of filtering both by television and the Internet.</seg>
<seg id=257>Unfortunately, I cannot accept the demands of the Liberals.</seg>
<seg id=258>The bulk of the legislative competence of the Member States and should remain so, which does not exclude, however, a dialogue for research from the consensus on some reference values to the path of dialogue with all interested parties at European level.</seg>
<seg id=259>There is no less of it than it is, in my opinion, with the parents to ensure that their children do not look at this kind of programme.</seg>
<seg id=260>Parents require particular that brings assistance in this area to them, which must include: specific parameters for the protection of minors in the field of media which are applied in the area of the entire European Union, the establishment and implementation of availability at an affordable price of filtering systems, legal provisions relating to the protection of minors and the commitment of the responsibility for the media, i.e. broadcasting corporations and productive companies of programmes that they are public or private.</seg>
<seg id=261>So when I hear, in the debates in committee, some people say that nothing is the harmful effects of violence in all its forms can have on TV, on children, I am surprised and I use a euphemism.</seg>
<seg id=262>With regard to the introduction of a code of self-regulation, it should be noted, especially in technical terms, that in some Member States the broadcasters already introduced codes of adjustment for television, which must enable parents to themselves off the present.</seg>
<seg id=263>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=264>In particular, my report replaces widespread international valid by restoring the decisions of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=265>It would be a minimum to allow this area of freedom to us which is a fundamental right of every European citizen.</seg>
<seg id=266>Some payments due in 1996, Mr President, have still not been carried out.</seg>
<seg id=267>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani for their work.</seg>
<seg id=268>I commend this report to the House as well as the amendments tabled by Mr Evans.</seg>
<seg id=269>Our human resources represent our common future in a world where knowledge is what is most valuable.</seg>
<seg id=270>It is not a green papers, white, black or red which can resolve the problems, but with concrete actions.</seg>
<seg id=271>But Parliament, and it is in its role, Parliament put pressure so that the researchers are still included in the text.</seg>
<seg id=272>Today, you visit us at a crucial moment for the future of European construction.</seg>
<seg id=273>But we know that the process is incomplete and that this incomplétude threat its vitality.</seg>
<seg id=274>The debate, to which each country makes its own sensitivity, its traditions, its culture, is the instrument that makes it possible to show them, to define them and to make them.</seg>
<seg id=275>Long live the European Parliament! strong the European Union!</seg>
<seg id=276>It is necessary to ensure that women take advantage creates employment, whilst avoiding a repetition of the same inequalities in the more traditional sectors: the less skilled jobs, part-time sometimes chosen, the precarious contracts and the difficulties of access to the decision-making jobs.</seg>
<seg id=277>The Council will be received a proposal of indicators for measuring progress in this area.</seg>
<seg id=278>Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach of equality by gender mainstreaming and specific guidelines.</seg>
<seg id=279>I am thinking in particular of the violence suffered by them, one of the priority issues of my government action, and I know that this issue is mobilising you also particularly.</seg>
<seg id=280>We know that measures of reconciliation of working life and family life support in particular women, although it is still necessary to carry out studies on the current situation of the family and the role that women play there, who is no longer the traditional role as the company has changed significantly, just as the family structure.</seg>
<seg id=281>Some people, including members of this House, sometimes seem convinced of the opposite, but it is a mistake.</seg>
<seg id=282>I would like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that the equality begins at home.</seg>
<seg id=283>I find it embarrassing position and ambiguous, and that deserves, it seems to me, consideration for the projects you are proposing to us, because it is not sure that we end to practice through all this.</seg>
<seg id=284>In this area, there is no equality.</seg>
<seg id=285>The image of the European Women, that one discovers over the pages of our report, of our directives, fits well with the Danish women who say in their majority not to the euro.</seg>
<seg id=286>I find it important that the report is aimed at the introduction of a digital balance between men and women in all sectors of society, on the labour market, for example.</seg>
<seg id=287>It is precisely for this reason that the report missed a major opportunity by completely ignoring the marriage and the family.</seg>
<seg id=288>This is something which the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities should also take into account.</seg>
<seg id=289>We have heard that the previous presidency first restructured then dismantled the Ministry for equal opportunities.</seg>
<seg id=290>The average wage of women continue to be less, on average 28%, compared to those of the people, which contributes to the fact that women form the majority of poor people, and what makes it difficult to their participation in social and political life.</seg>
<seg id=291>It is a remarkable result.</seg>
<seg id=292>We are seeing today an impoverishment of women workers throughout Europe, in France too, where 15% of them still live on less than 3.650 FF per month.</seg>
<seg id=293>All the countries did not follow this example, I hope that the example of France will be followed by other countries.</seg>
<seg id=294>The history of women is obviously very long.</seg>
<seg id=295>The candidates to be really helped bring itself to the level of the Community acquis.</seg>
<seg id=296>But, on this point, I would like your support.</seg>
<seg id=297>It is not yet the case, even if it is a good text after much thought, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has chosen after a long debate, not to table amendments.</seg>
<seg id=298>The Committee on Legal Affairs after a long debate, felt that it was not the only reasonable loud legal insecurity six years and that three years, the deadline, was a more appropriate time so that it is possible to determine, with adequate resources and an average speed, if there were any irregularities in a declaration.</seg>
<seg id=299>It is Amendment No 15 relating to fraud.</seg>
<seg id=300>The objective, namely to achieve a simplified but qualitative communication, as well as sufficient flexibility in the basic regulation by improving the procedure for recovery and by adapting the provisions on the presentation of customs, responds to one of the many requirements of the single market, and this objective is achieved by as many countries were inspiration from being able to participate quickly in international trade.</seg>
<seg id=301>She would like to thank Parliament and especially the committee chaired by Mrs de Palacio for the work and the interest - authorised by Parliament and the Commission – in the context of this issue.</seg>
<seg id=302>Welcome</seg>
<seg id=303>I would like that does not change the outcome of the vote which will be expressed, but it is really necessary to verify the translation of the French version.</seg>
<seg id=304>Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report.</seg>
<seg id=305>It is agreed that the knowledge of foreign languages is a necessary precondition for mobility.</seg>
<seg id=306>We also consider that the Member States must be able to decide for themselves, on the whole, the taxes which they wish to take.</seg>
<seg id=307>I consider it a little sad that we have no chance of getting a majority in relation to the need to formulate a term of limits for the conservation of documents.</seg>
<seg id=308>During the negotiations of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we were pleased with the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or philosophical beliefs non-sectarian, disability, age and sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id=309>My final point concerns the budget for this programme, that is to say 98,4 million, a figure which is obviously insufficient considering the proposed action.</seg>
<seg id=310>It emerges clearly from the reasons for the amendment to the directive proposes to intervene in the area of the provisions on age applied in the Member States, regulations which are however well-founded reasons of genetic psychology and have no impact on the working life.</seg>
<seg id=311>I also think that we could do without all that has been written in the new Article 12 (a).</seg>
<seg id=312>As regards the religion of the personal convictions, the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection proposed in this area.</seg>
<seg id=313>The Christian Democrats believe, as a whole, welcome the proposal for a directive on the introduction of general frameworks on non-discrimination in working life.</seg>
<seg id=314>This is, however, only indicative of occupation as a staff of an internal audit service and not of financial importance and, therefore, usefulness of such a service.</seg>
<seg id=315>The EU has decided to obtain common military powers with the aim of achieving the objectives of so-called Petersberg (combating the crises and solutions to conflicts outside the territory of the EU), but it does not have any common defence policy.</seg>
<seg id=316>- (NL) without weapons, the world would be much safer.</seg>
<seg id=317>The resolution does not want to drastically reduce the sale of arms to support a policy of disarmament, but to control them in order to ensure increasing the profits of industrial groups.</seg>
<seg id=318>The communication from the Commission acknowledges the problem but does not propose practical measures, because it is locked in the logic of the liberalisation of the market and competition, and the proposals which he can do not affect the substance of a harsh reality, especially for children, the unaccountability which enjoy the multinationals which, in their quest for profit, are not involved at all about the impact on their programmes and their products and transfer the entire responsibility for parents, inviting them to consume even new products to protect their children.</seg>
<seg id=319>Like the rapporteur, I believe that measures to protect young people against the programmes violent and harmful should not be limited to traditional television, but to apply to the whole of the media.</seg>
<seg id=320>With three hours per day, it is the most important human activity after the sleep and, for adults, work.</seg>
<seg id=321>Furthermore, women often occupy the 'flexible' posts; the temporary contracts or the low wages are typical sectors occupying mainly of women.</seg>
<seg id=322>With the first victims of cutbacks in public spending, privatisations in the health sector - for the right of access to care and treatment, not to mention the right to prevention programmes and information.</seg>
<seg id=323>B5-0792 / 2000, by Mr Marset Campos, Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, on the crisis in Peru.</seg>
<seg id=324>Mr President, I would have liked a debate on Latin America not be done only according to one or other of the current problem, but rather in the context of a debate well prepared in the committees.</seg>
<seg id=325>We must ensure that Peru achieves the objective set for it with Candidates who are adequate to the challenge of therein and which can be seen from the Peruvian people, namely a political renewal and a substantial democracy.</seg>
<seg id=326>The joint debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=327>However, we know that Afghanistan is not far away, that Afghanistan is the world ’ s largest producer of opiate, and so we know and we can imagine the role that these political mafias, not only political, also play in the expansion of the drugs trade.</seg>
<seg id=328>It calls on the Commission to take stock of the programmes of humanitarian aid in the direction of the Afghan people, so that no one is forgotten the territory.</seg>
<seg id=329>The suffering linked to this conflict are terrible.</seg>
<seg id=330>A budget line finance programmes of mine clearance and prevention for years.</seg>
<seg id=331>Allow me to respond to the warnings of Mrs Paciotti by saying that of course I will ask the Commission today to know what has happened and what must happen in the resources dedicated to demining.</seg>
<seg id=332>B5-0794 / 2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Colombia removal of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerrilla;</seg>
<seg id=333>We would like all not to have to speak again in Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=334>The Commission has already proposed to coordinate measures of such a package.There the Commission has already provided for in the next few days to release considerable resources for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id=335>So, once again, double standards, and I believe that it is to be regretted.</seg>
<seg id=336>This attitude of the Albanian opposition party consists of deliberately rejecting a solution needed to regulate an Albanian problem in Macedonia in totally incomprehensible to me.</seg>
<seg id=337>I think that the Macedonian carried out an extraordinary performance while managing to settle between them issues of an internal nature.</seg>
<seg id=338>That is why I also believe that this reconciliation can have, however, the Government, which has very courageously a solution to the issue of universities and many other problems, needs visible signs of success as well as strong support, otherwise the threatened peace in the region as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=339>The PHARE funds available for the year 2000 as part of the national plan can also be used as aid at university at the next academic year 2001-2002.</seg>
<seg id=340>I would like to point out that we all today, Greek MEPs, we now have responded to this situation.</seg>
<seg id=341>And all this, which concerns Greece, which is the first rank in the European Union for the sector of the Merchant Navy, is in fact about the safety of shipping in all its aspects in the Union.</seg>
<seg id=342>In recent years, many more people have died at sea, and not just shipwrecks of ferries, but in a manner far too regular, within our fishing communities.</seg>
<seg id=343>On the contrary, the innocent victims are used to promote wider objectives of the shipowners.</seg>
<seg id=344>We must realise and to us that it is also about the credibility of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=345>To conclude, I would like to stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the issue of legislation on the safety of ships for the carriage of passengers must have the highest priority in the European Union and that the most important thing is to ensure that these regulations are applied to the whole of the Community in a strict and uniform manner.</seg>
<seg id=346>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have arrived a little late for reasons which you know well, in order to make a brief statement on the two issues which are on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade and in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=347>Commissioner Verheugen will speak, as did Mr Solana, on the two issues which unite us this afternoon, that is, the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg id=348>We must be prepared to keep that promise, as soon as the will of the people is respected.</seg>
<seg id=349>Madam President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, it is with the reservation that I take part in this debate, because I did not want to see our Parliament seems only judge allowed to cast anathema on this or that, at a time when, after so many hopes very raised here a month ago, we are faced with the tragic consequences of this new outbreaks of violence in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=350>Madam President, my speech today is based not only on various analyses the situation, but also on the experience I have personally experienced last week, since I was incidentally in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip when the unrest broke out.</seg>
<seg id=351>Even if one is opposed to any violence, it is not possible to put on the same footing Israeli violence and Palestinian violence.</seg>
<seg id=352>I would like to ask the House at this critical moment, to make a declaration of support for the courageous people who have, today, defended freedom on the streets of Belgrade, thereby confirming the support we have given, we Europeans, it is not so long ago, to those who are fighting for their freedom in other cities.</seg>
<seg id=353>Europeans, Madam President, it would be well advised to take the leap the ball which has been made here by the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council.</seg>
<seg id=354>The status of Jerusalem is a tricky point in the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=355>For years, thanks to its apparatus of propaganda and the brutal pressure that is exerted on the media, he has managed to mislead the people of his country, but unfortunately also a large number of people in Western regime, to present a false picture of reality to them.</seg>
<seg id=356>While this tragedy draws to a close, this Parliament has to have, as a symbol of free and united Europe, to support crowds outside the Yugoslav parliament and to help Mr kosturica to fulfil his mandate.</seg>
<seg id=357>It is precisely this loud attitude as the stone which makes us fear the worst, and the news illustrates the words that I recorded a few hours ago.</seg>
<seg id=358>I wonder whether the Commissioner already provides steps which will make it possible to show that we regard Kostunica as the legally elected representative of the Serbian people and as a partner with whom the European Union will now have to deal with.</seg>
<seg id=359>The European Parliament would like to express its full solidarity at this historic moment to him when tyranny is dwindle and where the triumph of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=360>The next item is the report (A5-0237 / 2000) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2000 / 24 / EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted by the European Investment Bank to loans for projects in Croatia [COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000 / 0122 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=361>We must welcome the new political path which opened in that country after the presidential and legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id=362>Between the EU and Croatia, there is in particular an advisory working party which is aimed at making available to Croatia its powers and its technical assistance in the negotiation of the agreements governing mutual reports.</seg>
<seg id=363>Let us not forget that Croatia recently stood still the failure of a programme of privatisation, from which only a few benefited.</seg>
<seg id=364>The contribution of which we are discussing, in the form of a loan of EUR 250 million for the EIB for the period 2000-2007 cannot therefore be a milestone, but must be a stimulating help.</seg>
<seg id=365>So it is not quite accurate to talk about democratisation in this report.</seg>
<seg id=366>When, a century ago, Croatia and Slovakia became independent for the first time, they were satellites of the Hitler regime.</seg>
<seg id=367>We can of course differ from the question of guarantees and that of Croatia, neither of the debate yesterday evening, nor of the developments that have taken place in Belgrade.</seg>
<seg id=368>At a time when it appears that Milosevic fled and that the will of the Serbian people prevailed, we hope that the establishment of normal relations and partnership between Serbia and our union of democracies will be for soon.</seg>
<seg id=369>I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 6 October 2000.</seg>
<seg id=370>(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)</seg>
<seg id=371>My question is this: what speaks on behalf of the European Parliament on this Statute?</seg>
<seg id=372>I ask you, Madam President, to do everything in your power to accelerate the procedure in progress in the Committee on Petitions on a document presented by more than thirty social groups and NGOs in order to protest against this situation of blatant violation of Community legislation on protection from radiation.</seg>
<seg id=373>The post-mortem conducted in Georgia has shown that it is clearly a murder after probable torture.</seg>
<seg id=374>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the opportunity to take a major step towards your dream - which is, moreover, not mine.</seg>
<seg id=375>It is the basic regulation, on the basis of all the other regulations on genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id=376>It is clearly the foot in the plate, one after the other.</seg>
<seg id=377>(The sitting was suspended at 5.50 p.m. and resumed at p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=378>The next item is the report (A5-0291 / 2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Commission communication to the Council [COM (2000) 379 - C5 0508 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 (COS)], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the new social agenda.</seg>
<seg id=379>The fact of the importance of this open coordination method does not mean that this method must replace the social legislation, because we must set in Europe, of social rights, we must have the courage to define social measurement and to develop a social legislation which is essential in the context of a European internal market.</seg>
<seg id=380>In our opinion, we also support the dialogue and cooperation with civil society, and especially the women's organisations in the countries which are preparing for their integration into the European family, because we need to ensure that in time a uniform development which will follow the stages and the motives of the rest of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=381>The policy areas listed in the Commission's communication also been the subject of an overall agreement.</seg>
<seg id=382>I remember, at this stage of my speech, the holding of a European seminar in Biarritz on 4 and 5 December, seminar which I shall chair.</seg>
<seg id=383>Regarding the fight against exclusion, we have made great progress in defining on 17 October, with the Employment and Social Policy Council, with the appropriate objectives for combating poverty and social exclusion which will serve as a basis for national action plans.</seg>
<seg id=384>I have heard some people who have read the report to say that they agree with the diagnosis but not with the remedy proposed.</seg>
<seg id=385>The technological development and new methods of organisation also legitimate a flexible cooperation, more emphasis on the objectives and getting results and attach less importance to rigid regulations.</seg>
<seg id=386>It is on this side that it is necessary to seek, in our opinion, the obsoleteness accused those who do not expect brave new world of a market without hindrance.</seg>
<seg id=387>This certainly contributed to reduce the social unrest in our country and to support the investment plans of foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id=388>On the other hand, the method used seems more questionable.</seg>
<seg id=389>If we talk of a Charter of Rights and if we look favourably on the development of a European constitution, we cannot be achieved by double, and we must say that it is necessary to take all the necessary steps in this direction, even if it calls for a more detailed legislation.</seg>
<seg id=390>I would like to point out, critically, the lack of initiatives on the new requirements related to the security of employment, the consultation of workers and the reports of work.</seg>
<seg id=391>Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Minister, Mrs Péry, for the presentation of the social agenda.</seg>
<seg id=392>These points, as we know, are fought by the conservatives in Europe, which we in our group, are particularly attached to it.</seg>
<seg id=393>The third issue of the content is enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=394>The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=395>It would be necessary to complement measures from the Commission by a revision of the possibilities of individual access to health care, social security and pensions, the shortcomings of the organization of work, and perhaps also by a general reduction in working hours.</seg>
<seg id=396>Therefore, women will feel Europe close to them, and Europe will benefit from the interesting and innovative ideas which will shape through the relationship with this programme.</seg>
<seg id=397>We therefore expect an annual report of the President of the Commission within the framework of an annual statement in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=398>I am also pleased that there are plans for a better implementation of the guardians of children in order to facilitate balance between work and family life.</seg>
<seg id=399>My Group will take account in its final vote for it.</seg>
<seg id=400>(The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=401>I find the new approach of the Commission very positive, and the proposal for a decision on the programme (2001-2005), very thoughtful.</seg>
<seg id=402>I believe that the large number of amendments which are accepted testifies to the Community to spirit which exists between the Commission and the committee on women.</seg>
<seg id=403>Firstly, because I have received over the past year, many requests from companies, which feel rather powerless in relation to the decisions of merger that they must take, particularly where they owed appeal against the decision of the Commission in the Court of First Instance.</seg>
<seg id=404>I should also like to ask Commissioner Monti, when we will be able to hope for the publication of an effective and valuable public register of state aid, as well as the table, long-awaited, of the results.</seg>
<seg id=405>I would also like to say to Commissioner Monti that it is important that, in the next report, a larger section is devoted to the financial services sector.</seg>
<seg id=406>What I have just said is not only valid for the field of energy, but for the other areas in general.</seg>
<seg id=407>Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the good work done in the two reports, which have made a flattering judgment on your work and that of the Directorate-General for Competition.</seg>
<seg id=408>I stress this because the market cannot solve all and that, accordingly, there is not and cannot have competition without limits.</seg>
<seg id=409>Mr President, today, nobody calls into question, and I will not do so, the fact that state aid distorts the competition conditions and is a bad thing that does not encourage companies to be more efficient.</seg>
<seg id=410>We therefore intend to deny the fact that state aid has decreased over the period 1994-1998, while the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction, was already curious, to say the least.</seg>
<seg id=411>Today, we cannot, of course, Mr President, to ignore the past, although my opinion refers to heartfelt Commission report on competition policy, and must learn from them for the future.</seg>
<seg id=412>During the time I have available, I would like to mention, Mr President, the three points: the modernisation of Community competition law, the activities carried out in 1999 in the application of competition rules and the issue of state aid.</seg>
<seg id=413>The Commission has continued to intervene vigorously in particular in relation to the cartels and abuses of dominant positions, as in the field of concentrations.</seg>
<seg id=414>Mr Rapkay, it was extremely important for the Commission to have the support of the European Parliament for the continuation of its competition policy and I do not have the impression that this support could weaken.</seg>
<seg id=415>This mechanism can be activated at the request of a Member State or under Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, provision which remains in force during the third phase of economic and monetary union for the States which are subject to an exemption, currently Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id=416>The use of the capital market should remain the only option in the future.</seg>
<seg id=417>I therefore express the hope that this report is approved by this House in its present version, and that the internal market is also applies to the area of the vine.</seg>
<seg id=418>Today, its review is necessary given the developments of the plant health rules and the scientific and technical progress, took place in particular in vitro proliferation.</seg>
<seg id=419>I also believe that the reference, through this precautionary principle, with the possibility of genetic modification means, for example, reducing the intensive use of plant protection treatments.</seg>
<seg id=420>To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, to observe the precautionary principle, in spirit and in letter, so the plight of the articles and amendments which I have just mentioned have not been removed, it would be necessary, to demand that the wine growers, that we follow the opinion of Marianne Isler Béguin, so the Committee on the Environment, and vote their abolition.</seg>
<seg id=421>Mr President, if I may, Commissioner, can you give your opinion on the amendment of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is Amendment No 1.</seg>
<seg id=422>The only point on which we could discuss it is whether or not I should have noted as soon as the French government sent to me the decree of ending the mandate of Mr Le Pen.</seg>
<seg id=423>I would remind you that the vote will take place at 12 p.m earlier.</seg>
<seg id=424>In the field of Justice and Home Affairs, I am optimistic about a solution for the civil judicial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=425>The preparatory group will play its full part until 19 November, the date of the next meeting at ministerial level.</seg>
<seg id=426>We need a strong climate - as Mr Moscovici, and I have felt, at the level of Heads of State and Government, a very serious sense of collective responsibility and historic at an historic moment for European integration.</seg>
<seg id=427>We must simply, ladies and gentlemen, to ensure that now, in these matters of the qualified majority, not to find ourselves below spirit or climate in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg id=428>The smaller countries in the European Union are not subordinate to the largest!</seg>
<seg id=429>I would be grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify this point.</seg>
<seg id=430>On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica is an historic event.</seg>
<seg id=431>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, so that progress has been strengthened cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting, the major differences remain on the composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, as you pointed out.</seg>
<seg id=432>It seems to me that it goes in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id=433>Those who deny the enhanced cooperation enjoy the same freedom of movement as passengers in the back seat of a car.</seg>
<seg id=434>I have no more than you, to introduce me into the German home, but I believe that this position is deeply coherent and is also in line with what the Commission wants, if I am not mistaken.</seg>
<seg id=435>We have started to have discussions on this issue, which show that all the Member States want to keep the ceiling after enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=436>I believe that it will not be the case.</seg>
<seg id=437>The first: sometimes had the impression that in Biarritz, there was an obsession of the debate between small and large States.</seg>
<seg id=438>From this point of view, I believe that it is not enough to say that the Community method must be safeguarded.</seg>
<seg id=439>Even when the candidate countries joining the EU, each Member State must be able to retain a junior Commissioner 'or' senior '.</seg>
<seg id=440>The wording of Article 93 is all the more dramatic as once the first wave of enlargement has succeeded, we will be even more unable to move towards qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=441>They are indeed to convince the citizens of these countries the obvious merits of a new European Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=442>That would have been to disregard the spring of such a crisis to imagine that the fears maintained generations could take place without new sudden begins with the final appeasement, is a forerunner to the reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id=443>I am also concerned about the reply weakened to Parliament's request for a democracy.</seg>
<seg id=444>However, the blame lies rather to those who want to bring reforms of extensive prior to enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=445>On the one hand, the decision of the head of the Israeli Government to freeze the peace negotiations because of the violence which prevails in the region and to focus its efforts on the creation of a government of concentration on the opposition leader, Mr Sharon.</seg>
<seg id=446>It is with great satisfaction, of course, that we heard the victory by the Yugoslav population and the election of its chairman Mr Kostuníca.</seg>
<seg id=447>I would advise Mr Barón Crespo to ask Italian colleagues to explain to them why they are in government in Italy with a party that is said Communist openly and preparing to deal with the legislative elections with another party openly Communist, the year of Rifondazione Comunista.</seg>
<seg id=448>Progress takes a lead in this plan in the codecision procedure.</seg>
<seg id=449>The Commission is better able to provide the necessary impetus in future by chance than it has to vote by simple majority.</seg>
<seg id=450>The European Union does not need today visionaries who look until 2030, but who can see the problems that enlargement will bring in three to eight years to come, and which can find solutions to these problems.</seg>
<seg id=451>It is therefore an open work which did not fall from the top and which has not been imposed.</seg>
<seg id=452>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=453>The lack of this fundamental reference, at best it is not understood any more, at worst is maintained.</seg>
<seg id=454>Democracy is better to Europe, but the European democracy, is ill.</seg>
<seg id=455>Today, 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, the European Parliament says very simple and strongly says: the European Constitution, yes, you can, yes, we want it.</seg>
<seg id=456>It therefore expresses the idea that island is in itself a sufficient criteria.</seg>
<seg id=457>I will go to key concentrating on the salient points of the report by Mr Gil-Robles, of which I will just say that I found it excellent.</seg>
<seg id=458>Firstly, that of a simplification and clarification of the Treaties.</seg>
<seg id=459>I will not go further, because we are not, in any case, I am not here to discuss the report by the Institute in Florence.</seg>
<seg id=460>According to information - I will be the technical, excuse me – which was communicated to the Presidency, it seems that a clear majority of the language versions, in contrast to the Italian version, does not refer to the application of the cohesion policy, and in the least favoured islands and not in the islands in general.</seg>
<seg id=461>Mr Duhamel, you will probably agree with me that if there is no success in Nice, it will not have a place, at least not credibility, for a reflection on the future of European integration, in any case within the current framework.</seg>
<seg id=462>It is also crucial in the European Constitution in the distribution of tasks between the Member States is clearly defined and the European Union the dynamic of European integration should be included to cover areas in which it is essential to act jointly, such as foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=463>They could also be necessary to overcome persistent blockages.</seg>
<seg id=464>We need more clarity in the division of competences and the affirmation of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=465>Everyone knows that there are very different views on this subject in the various Member States and in the various social groups.</seg>
<seg id=466>Unfortunately, the final objective of a European Constitution would be exactly the opposite and obviously we cannot endorse it.</seg>
<seg id=467>In the strengthened European home, there will be people sitting in the military monetary, possibly tax table and then the other people who will be at hand.</seg>
<seg id=468>It is clear that the second version is not the right one and that, firstly, because the economically delayed regions are in any case covered by the structural funds and that, secondly, if that interpretation were good, it would not have been no reason to adopt the Declaration No 30</seg>
<seg id=469>Mr President, I will focus my poor little sixty seconds on the report by Mr Olivier Duhamel, who is a good report, because he dare to be clear, and the lyric of our rapporteur definitively earlier convinced us.</seg>
<seg id=470>In my opinion, the whole of Europe can be only political.</seg>
<seg id=471>It seems to us that the new Constitution should be ready to come into force for the next European elections.</seg>
<seg id=472>Consequently, the word 'least developed' applies both to the island regions and with other regions and, if we follow the proposal of Mr Barnier, it is appropriate here to amend the Italian text of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention.</seg>
<seg id=473>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=474>As the Member said that she would vote against, the amendment is rejected.</seg>
<seg id=475>Mr President, the amendment which is required here would lead us straight to chaos.</seg>
<seg id=476>- (IT) I welcome the adoption of the Trakatellis report by this House because it provides for the setting high standards of quality and safety for blood and blood derivatives.</seg>
<seg id=477>If the European parliamentary immunity is autonomous, the French authorities have informed us that the waiver of Mr Le Pen.</seg>
<seg id=478>I am particularly disappointed by the EP's vote on the report on the proliferation of young varieties.</seg>
<seg id=479>Some consider that alcohol, tobacco and drugs, is a product which can cause great damage to those who consume and their Union the others as well as considering it; on the contrary before a source of employment and important enrichment.</seg>
<seg id=480>The rapporteur reserves as a whole welcome the proposals of the Commission's White Paper on this subject, but it has fears about the possible implications of the reform, which is the main objective and to decentralise the application of competition rules.</seg>
<seg id=481>In the debate yesterday evening, if I could welcome Mr Jonathan Evans for his work, I have to say at the outset my profound disagreement with the too liberal, if not impregnation ultra liberal, on his report.</seg>
<seg id=482>Aid Ireland refocused its activity in order to attract in the Objective 1 area half of all employment of greenfield projects in the three years to come.</seg>
<seg id=483>Faced with the outcry that the consequences of this policy cause, the speeches, funding and other economic and tax incentives for the state to compensate for the situation in part.</seg>
<seg id=484>(The sitting was suspended at 14h06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=485>And we are therefore, in October 2000, on the eve of a decision on the start of the 2001 budget.</seg>
<seg id=486>But that did not prevent the Council from reducing agricultural expenditure of a total of 555 million.</seg>
<seg id=487>In addition, of course, we believe that it is not enough simply to, quite simply, create 400 posts.</seg>
<seg id=488>I can only urge the Council to follow us.</seg>
<seg id=489>That is why the administration of this House is there for the members and not the opposite.</seg>
<seg id=490>At present, it is the Court of Auditors which causes us less concern.</seg>
<seg id=491>Finally, we must treat budget of the Ombudsman.</seg>
<seg id=492>On the contrary, we are of the opinion that this area must be strengthened in relation to the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=493>We also propose that the House continues to be regularly informed.</seg>
<seg id=494>When we organise a legislative dialogue on social affairs, cultural or environmental - the Commissioner will admit that I am right, we join with the Commissioner for budgets, the Finance Ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets in order to request together so that no financial error is.</seg>
<seg id=495>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your warm welcome.</seg>
<seg id=496>The Council adopted at first reading the appropriations that seem to him justified for 2001, without taking account of the concerns of a tactical nature which serve the objective of sound allocation of appropriations for the Community institutions must continue.</seg>
<seg id=497>Before you do not give an opinion on the draft budget for 2001, I would like to stress a number of objectives which the Council and Parliament have in common and which can result in an agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=498>We are in a similar situation as regards structural policy.</seg>
<seg id=499>Mr Colom I Naval pointed out, the dialogue on this summer has also given a good result: in future, Parliament will have better information on legal bases which affect the level of expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=500>Let me remind you that financial planning last year for the Balkans did not expect 1.85 billion for the whole period running up to 2006.</seg>
<seg id=501>I ask you again to examine without prejudice this proposal which the Commission maintains, and to bear in mind that possibility.</seg>
<seg id=502>This material obviously served at the same time for the preparation of the 2001 budget and the discharge for 1999.</seg>
<seg id=503>Although I very much appreciate the work of this body as a Member of the Committee on Budgets, even though I believe both the work of the rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgets, I do not want to fail, as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to express two amendments which the Commission once again to plenary and whose importance is not inconsiderable, despite the modesty of the amounts involved.</seg>
<seg id=504>By these measures, we want to make judicial control again fully operational, to restore confidence in the legal security within the EU and to consolidate the rule of law, which is the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=505>Given the removal of this initiative without providing any measure replacement, the Commission has clearly present-day political will expressed in Lisbon and priority expressed by this House.</seg>
<seg id=506>This decision was astonishing at the very least, and it has given the impression that many of us that the whole of this programme, very important simply had become a bubble's skin that the Committee on Budgets and the European Commission return themselves.</seg>
<seg id=507>The third point concerns the common agricultural policy as defined in the draft budgets.</seg>
<seg id=508>If employment is the political priority of the Union, fishing, as an economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.</seg>
<seg id=509>I am particularly pleased that the funding of the Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000 programmes, whose future was decided at the end of last year, can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id=510>With regard to the aid to the Mediterranean countries, for example, the backlog concerns the budgets for several years.</seg>
<seg id=511>Mr President, during the debates of the last few years, I spoke on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, for which we have heard this afternoon Mrs Iivari.</seg>
<seg id=512>However, I would like to say to the House this afternoon that we should not lose sight of the fact that the European Union spends only 1% of GDP of the Member States and that most of this money is managed in the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=513>I now come to the general strategy.</seg>
<seg id=514>This brings me to the strategy of my group, because the basis for our conviction is the desire to give some European citizens value for money.</seg>
<seg id=515>On the contrary, we must do everything to ensure that this Parliament is an example of transparency, efficiency and good democratic control of the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=516>It is necessary for us to reflect on how to solve this problem.</seg>
<seg id=517>We want to support the process of democratisation and we want to achieve a balance between the traditional areas of foreign policy we need to address.</seg>
<seg id=518>The most difficult problems in the new budget relating to the external actions.</seg>
<seg id=519>It goes without saying that a careful management is needed, it has our support and we should not deceive ourselves on this.</seg>
<seg id=520>It is a very special initiative, especially at first reading, and this is a thankless initiative, because it cannot, in the current context, to get a majority of votes cast.</seg>
<seg id=521>That being so, the importance of the equipment for Kosovo is not without its problems.</seg>
<seg id=522>The budget policy must inspire confidence at the citizen to the European policy.</seg>
<seg id=523>All measures must therefore be supported to strengthen the small and medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id=524>The budget level of implementation;</seg>
<seg id=525>Bearing this strategic line in the approach to the budgets of this year and the years to come, the European Parliament fully takes its place in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg id=526>Indeed, with the transfer of 175 million, we made an estimate of 25 million more than was planned.</seg>
<seg id=527>As regards the MEDA programme, the Council stated that the commitments made do not cause any problem, given the eight years of payment arrears.</seg>
<seg id=528>I believe that Mr Duff was here this morning, when we discussed the European Council in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg id=529>My reply will be very simple.</seg>
<seg id=530>In May was the last of the 25 defenders of human rights to be murdered and recently the Colombian press condemned 'plan 100' of the paramilitary groups to murdering one hundred human rights defenders.</seg>
<seg id=531>The Council's attitude pleases me a little today than in July, as so often in crisis situations, the European Union seems to be the last to be found on the international stage and to have its voice heard.</seg>
<seg id=532>The question, Mr President, I will end here, is whether there is not a means of pressure stronger than that proposed by the President in his information and if the aid which we provide is quite different from that of the United States, that is, not directed towards the fumigation of cultures, but towards their replacement, and towards the social aspects rather as military.</seg>
<seg id=533>The questions which several Members and myself to deal specifically with the situation in Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=534>As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 6,7,8,9,10,11,12 and 13.</seg>
<seg id=535>Subject: taxation on financial transactions the demand for a tax on speculative continues to gain ground in recent months with the increase in the number of committees (Attac association for a tax on financial transactions and aid to the citizens) in France and in Europe, and the amendments to the French National Assembly and the Senate.</seg>
<seg id=536>I would also want an answer to the question of its influence on the volatility of the markets of currencies, and in particular the force of a tax of 0.1 per thousand on the speculators expect devaluations of about 20 to 50%.</seg>
<seg id=537>It also calls for paragraph 26 the establishment of an international organisation of conciliation to cancel the debt of the countries of the South.</seg>
<seg id=538>It is also what happened to the euro on a scale a year, that is to regret it or like it.</seg>
<seg id=539>I would add that Danielle Auroi said just now, in relation to the countries of the South, that certain estimates, made by specialists, give interesting figures: for example, a fork ranging from 50 to 250 billion dollars, which could be recovered from a Tobin-type tax, while at the same time the UNDP, a figure with a sum of USD 40 billion per year, this amount that could be enough to give minimum living conditions to the hundreds of millions of people who lack of all in the third world.</seg>
<seg id=540>In recent months, of cases have been discovered, in particular, in various places in France.</seg>
<seg id=541>I therefore ask the question, as a representative of the French Presidency is here, whether the slaughter of these cows will be paid on the Community budget or if you pay for it on the national budget and if you think it would be a good thing that it pays to the Community budget.</seg>
<seg id=542>Can I ask your indulgence and ask you to hear the answer?</seg>
<seg id=543>So the action of the two governments concerned is limited by this international law.</seg>
<seg id=544>I do not understand how the Commission can already say in February that it needs, and the Council in July.</seg>
<seg id=545>In doing so in the name of subsidiarity, the Union is, in fact, one of its duties, as has happened in recent weeks, both in the north of Italy as in Spain.</seg>
<seg id=546>As a Member of this most affected, how can I endorse the disbursement of GBP 11.5 billion paid by the British taxpayer - that is our current annual contribution - if it does not enjoy a broad approval of the public?</seg>
<seg id=547>A flexible attitude of the Council would make it possible to reach an agreement at second reading in order to complete the budget.</seg>
<seg id=548>If anyone needs to be convinced of this, that it is simply the proof.</seg>
<seg id=549>This strategy was already introduced by Joan Colom I Naval, the Vice-President responsible for buildings.</seg>
<seg id=550>The political messages in the budget for this exercise – and the Commissioner Schreyer referred to this - are many: the adaptation of the agricultural policy, of the new structural programmes, better implementation of the structural policies, the follow-up to the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit for the creation of a stronger and more competitive European Union and combating social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=551>The war waged by NATO too much destroyed and left behind it of too great suffering.</seg>
<seg id=552>In spite of what was agreed, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to achieve this objective within the existing budget without prejudice to the agricultural budget to sustainable rural sector in the current Member States.</seg>
<seg id=553>And let me make it very clear: it is necessary to give its chance Kostunica, and I therefore hope that it will ensure an amnesty in the weeks and months ahead; but in the meantime, I wish, however, that, politically, and the budgetary level, the political conditions be coupled with the introduction of these two new budgetary lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=554>The elections held in Yugoslavia shows two things: people finally had enough of the dictator Milosevic and they placed their trust in Professor Kostunica.</seg>
<seg id=555>I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners are released too soon.</seg>
<seg id=556>Otherwise, we would inevitably fall in ‘ financial engineering ', the redistributions and cutbacks, both in social spending and environmental and in cooperation, without being sure as far as the amounts intended for the Balkans are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id=557>In the context before us, it is a question of resolving major societal problems such as unemployment, for example.</seg>
<seg id=558>There is, of course, a very important point is the fact that we started in category four, with its approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to resolve the issue, not least because the Council does not wish to participate sufficiently in the reflection.</seg>
<seg id=559>The priorities are an important element of any budgetary work.</seg>
<seg id=560>That does not lead to a result before the expiry of the Treaty, but it would be worrying if legal framework post-ECSC allowed to maintain such practices.</seg>
<seg id=561>This brings me to my third remark on the task which is now in front of us.</seg>
<seg id=562>Mistrust of the political leaders of the EU continues to grow, as I could see me.</seg>
<seg id=563>I pay tribute to them for that.</seg>
<seg id=564>The provision in the discussion of all the institutions concerned has an exemplary cooperation with which we will be able - I really hope so - to reach an agreement at first reading.</seg>
<seg id=565>We who are committed to European values in a country Eurosceptic, we will now have a further reason for the EU, namely a more effective protection of the people, which is important for the citizens in a modern society.</seg>
<seg id=566>I noted that my own country was on the point of making a change in the law on personal data, which, as it stands, depriving the elected representatives of any influence on the decisions taken by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=567>Many other points also pose problems and deserve the judgment of the practice to be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id=568>The Commission would first like to recall the commitment we made all towards the citizens to guarantee the protection of personal data processed by the institutions.</seg>
<seg id=569>By this statement, the Commission will accept that the scope of the regulation is limited to the activities of the first pillar exclusively.</seg>
<seg id=570>In order to fulfil the political agreement has been reached with the Council and the rapporteur to allow approval at first reading, the Commission rejects any other amendment that are not part of the Paciotti report approved by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, except for Amendment No 69 which corrects Amendment No 41.</seg>
<seg id=571>Therefore, it is urgent that the personnel of the inter-service group are very quickly reinforced at the heart of the Secretary-General of the Commission, so that all the proposals of the Act of general interest can be accompanied, during their examination by the Commission on the basis of Article 299 (2) of a detailed fiche d'impact.</seg>
<seg id=572>The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market believes that it is important to stress that we can compare what is comparable.</seg>
<seg id=573>Given the importance of fisheries for the outermost regions, I can only be saddened by this observation.</seg>
<seg id=574>Since the creation of an inter-service group for the outermost regions under the chairmanship of Mr Delors, a long and fruitful way been done so far and I should like to express the heartfelt thanks of Europeans of the outermost regions to that chaired this group.</seg>
<seg id=575>Indeed, as the Treaty of Rome, reference was made to the French overseas departments, it was necessary to wait until 1989 and the programmes of specific options relating to remoteness and insularity, the famous POSEI programmes, so that the European Union finally conceded that the permanence and combination of structural handicaps of the outermost regions justify special treatment in relation to other regions of the Community.</seg>
<seg id=576>I have no doubt the proposals that the Commission will put to the Council will bear the stamp of these qualities.</seg>
<seg id=577>This issue is all the more relevant as we approach a eastward enlargement of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=578>This right to difference is nothing, what is more, that a symbol of the principle of equality, which also needs to be dealt with in a different way what is different.</seg>
<seg id=579>It is a document which we consider, my team and, like rich in ideas, proposals, which goes to the heart of the problems and which does not avoid any areas of concern to the EU's outermost regions.</seg>
<seg id=580>Your report, Mrs Sudre, stress, rightly on the need for action in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=581>As for the recovery of the diversification of the economy, we have made in several key areas.</seg>
<seg id=582>It is now important that a large number of projects submitted within the framework of SPDs, but, in parallel with this action on the ground, we must think carefully of needs, in the vicinity, specific to each of these outermost regions to this information society.</seg>
<seg id=583>Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting.</seg>
<seg id=584>I will of course inform your speech to the President.</seg>
<seg id=585>I am concerned about the risk of a general failure of a large number of machinery and rules which would then question the decisions of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=586>This food authority and the legislative proposals presented to us, to guarantee food safety, will benefit from the support from this House, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=587>The main task of this authority will be a scientific task of consultation, because the debate on food safety must be 'pure too'.</seg>
<seg id=588>Mr President, I would like once again to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and his openness to the opinions of the other committees.</seg>
<seg id=589>When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to put the precautionary principle into practice.</seg>
<seg id=590>On the issue always discussed to know to what extent we must allow him to consider nutrition, to really give advice and be consulted by those who are concerned primarily with risk management, we also said that, when it comes to safety, these issues should at least fall within the remit of consultation of this food safety authority.</seg>
<seg id=591>A central element of this last point is to ensure that the rich heritage of traditions which is ours can continue.</seg>
<seg id=592>The elements that will enable this respectability to emerge call neither laws or legislation, but unimpeachable integrity, academic quality, independence and duty of accountability, transparency and comprehensibility.</seg>
<seg id=593>A good scientific knowledge is certainly necessary to better assess the risks of the food chain, from farm to table.</seg>
<seg id=594>Mr President, the passion for the introduction of a European food safety agency, as our rapporteur would prefer to call it, is obviously considerable.</seg>
<seg id=595>As long as the programme which is properly funded and supported, it does not seem to be necessary to create an organisation, in particular, not an agency whose scope is limited to the 15 Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=596>Food safety is an essential condition for the consumer; indeed, they want to be able to eat healthily and it is up to us to take care of it.</seg>
<seg id=597>If we do not create any new framework directive, we will only be able to laugh about many things in the field of food safety.</seg>
<seg id=598>We must therefore amend the Treaty on European Union so that the Commission has the possibility of applying sanctions in the field of food, just as it can do so today in the field of competition.</seg>
<seg id=599>I support all the participating actors, who are political, administrative and other, who work in the context of the strategy 'food for all'.</seg>
<seg id=600>I do not agree with these words, because we can see that a man is more than a body.</seg>
<seg id=601>It must be true brain of coordination of the network of national agencies which, in turn, will have to activate and coordinate a network of centres of excellence in food safety at regional level.</seg>
<seg id=602>Also, I am of the opinion that your Amendment No 11 and my Amendment No 17 are perfectly compatible.</seg>
<seg id=603>The reform of food law in the European Union must be made at European Union level.</seg>
<seg id=604>His report does not propose both the changes as it does not stress a number of points.</seg>
<seg id=605>We clearly stated in the report, and I welcome it wholeheartedly.</seg>
<seg id=606>However, the creation of a European agency on food safety is very positive.</seg>
<seg id=607>It is to be hoped that, in the interests of European consumers, they will be respected.</seg>
<seg id=608>It is essential, I think, to define specific times in which it will be necessary to notify the Commission certainly causing a justified concern.</seg>
<seg id=609>The EU must have the highest standards of food safety for its citizens.</seg>
<seg id=610>The Commission now proposes the creation of a European food safety authority.</seg>
<seg id=611>I fear that Europe does not again expose themselves to the risk to obtain an enormous administrative apparatus, unable to act.</seg>
<seg id=612>Indeed, the yield is inversely proportional to the levels of bureaucracy and the level of costs incurred.</seg>
<seg id=613>Prevent double and parallel work in various institutions.</seg>
<seg id=614>However, it should be prevented that, in the shadow of the debate on the White Paper, in the public's fears of bureaucratic Europe is not strengthened which affect the quality of products without addressing effectively fraud which threaten the health of consumers.</seg>
<seg id=615>As you know, the Commission attaches the greatest importance to its strategy on food safety.</seg>
<seg id=616>The Commission intends to adopt a proposal for a regulation establishing the principles and objectives which will form the cornerstone of food law and will form the framework for future health protection measures in the area of food.</seg>
<seg id=617>Thank you very much, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=618>Turning to my report, I welcome the Commission proposal and to add that the Committees on Foreign Affairs and development have done much to improve it, particularly on certain points.</seg>
<seg id=619>As Mrs Bonino has clearly said, we have taken a step forward by the Commission proposal for a regulation.</seg>
<seg id=620>The proposal for a regulation of the Commission is extremely vague.</seg>
<seg id=621>It is necessary to organise properly equipment for mine clearance and to finance research work of detection and mine clearance and for the instruments which can be used simply on the ground in order to help the developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=622>In the last eight years, the European Union has spent more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget to the fight against landmines.</seg>
<seg id=623>But we cannot penalise the people whose government makes abuses.</seg>
<seg id=624>Firstly, I have already mentioned, I think it would be a mistake, on the basis of a noble idea, but all the same, counterproductive to membership of the Ottawa Convention sine qua non for the granting of Community assistance for the fight against landmines.</seg>
<seg id=625>I cannot accept Amendment No 19.</seg>
<seg id=626>Secondly, the international community is suffering from a lack of coordination of its efforts at a global level, especially in the countries affected.</seg>
<seg id=627>Mr President, the Socialist Group shares the pride which has just expressed at the moment Mr Van Orden about the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=628>You mention the Soviet bomb toys in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=629>I thank you for the quality of your report.</seg>
<seg id=630>Mr President, the Cambodian people call the mines the eternal quintessence.</seg>
<seg id=631>The population maintains a justified suspicion with regard to the forces in uniform, whoever they may be explained by long years of war.</seg>
<seg id=632>Mr President, I am pleased that there is finally a European law, in the form of a regulation on anti-personnel mines and that we now have a good report by Mrs Bonino on this subject.</seg>
<seg id=633>- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing with a very sad question today.</seg>
<seg id=634>It is no coincidence that the mines are, firstly, in areas of crisis, in other words in regions which could take initiatives of a different nature to overcome these crises.</seg>
<seg id=635>To two kilometres from Hamlet with Bosnia, in 1999, a panel indicates the presence of mines in an area which does not prevent the presence on the ground of a little boy.</seg>
<seg id=636>It is tragic that it is the civilian population that suffers from the failure of its leaders.</seg>
<seg id=637>On the eve of the 4 Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference, which will take place next November on 15 and 16 in Marseilles, I am convinced that your work with our delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries, chaired by Mr Obiols, will allow us to make progress in our project of dialogue and peace.</seg>
<seg id=638>All the mines are stored in storage.</seg>
<seg id=639>(DE) Mr President, since I agree with almost everything that my colleagues have said, it seems unnecessary to me to repeat it, so I give up using my speaking time.</seg>
<seg id=640>Your concept of the open cooperation is to fall into the institutional system dominated by officials of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=641>We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are taken at the closest possible level people involved.</seg>
<seg id=642>Since, however, the main amendments tabled by the PPE Group have just found a large majority, I voted for the report.</seg>
<seg id=643>Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the resolution on the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz, for two reasons: the first because I voted separately, in a nominal manner, for paragraphs 2 and 5, which enabled me to express my frank opposition in relation to these two paragraphs.</seg>
<seg id=644>In other words, around the table of the common European home, some would eat with the card and others with the minimum menu.</seg>
<seg id=645>Admittedly, there is always room for improvement, and democratic control should not weaken but in our opinion, the list of these rights and their inclusion in the Treaties did not constitute a priority issue in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=646>There have been debates about the referendums and of the amendments tabled on this subject.</seg>
<seg id=647>At the time of the 1999 elections to the European Parliament, voter participation achieved only 40%, if we exclude the countries in which the vote is obligatory, and those of the European elections was combined with national elections.</seg>
<seg id=648>In order to achieve the objective of a European Constitution – what we want, we need to avoid imposing rigid schemes and methodologies, which would inevitably lead to the failure of the desired objective.</seg>
<seg id=649>A real social constitution should align, by the summit, the best assets for the labour market, women and immigrants and the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=650>Without denying the laudable intention to improve, clarify and deepen the European Union, as well as simplifying texts to bring them closer to the citizens, I did not vote for this resolution.</seg>
<seg id=651>The allocation of the powers and responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id=652>I regard as crucial that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights leads to the Union's accession to the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=653>But the report by Mr Gil-Robles has my support, because it proposes that on some issues, sectors and areas, some Member States of the European Union to agree on a joint action.</seg>
<seg id=654>The will to ensure that an increasing number of decisions on important areas are taken by qualified majority is contrary to the basic democratic standards.</seg>
<seg id=655>Today, it is trying to prevent the relaxation of closer cooperation, and it will not end up losing part too.</seg>
<seg id=656>This report seeks to implement the position in this direction of our Parliament (resolution of 13 April 2000).</seg>
<seg id=657>- (SV) our opinion on the so-called flexible integration is generally positive.</seg>
<seg id=658>The UK Labour Members of the PSE Group welcome the favourable response given to the contribution they have made to the continuing work of the IGC on closer cooperation, without adhering fully to all the details of this.</seg>
<seg id=659>These islands must feel part of the European Union which, I hope, will make them a paradise for tourists and their inhabitants themselves.</seg>
<seg id=660>To the Middle Ages, these regions and their people did not belong to Europe and, even today, they are not really considered to be European.</seg>
<seg id=661>Indeed, the characteristics of these regions, resulting in general from insularity and distance from the continent of Europe, but also of their chronic dependence on a limited number of production or even of a production, require specific measures adapted to the excess of these constraints.</seg>
<seg id=662>Mr President, I am sorry if I still hold the presidency and the interpreters to listen to my last explanation of vote and would particularly like to express my solidarity with the translators and our explanations of vote, in my view the Italian ornella buson.</seg>
<seg id=663>Indeed, it seems clear that the aim of the Agency is to collect the national defence capabilities, or to paralyse them, putting them at the service of the objectives of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=664>This does not prevent the Commission and Parliament to christen this agency 'authority' s name, which is totally contrary to the philosophy which is supposed to inspire it.</seg>
<seg id=665>It is not entirely what is proposing the Bowis report, where one has the feeling that food safety is essentially considered a new pretext for feeding the well-known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission to the detriment of national bodies and security of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=666>Also, I think I can, by this statement, to condemn these unspeakable acts on behalf of the European Parliament has always advocated the respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all communities.</seg>
<seg id=667>Madam President, I understand the criticism of the rapporteur, however, in voting for the amendments of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, one does not vote only appropriations but also for or against a particular orientation of the policy.</seg>
<seg id=668>Please support the amendment a line 206, ‘ acquisition of estate property ', according to the proposed amendments will be adopted, so that we do not exceed our own ceiling confined to 20% of total administrative expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=669>Before the vote on the draft 929</seg>
<seg id=670>Section VI, Economic and Social Committee.</seg>
<seg id=671>Report (A5-0276 / 2000) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a regulation of the Council establishing the additional technical measures for the recovery of cod stocks in the Irish Sea (ICES Division VIIa) (COM (2000) 0190 - C5-0219 / 2000 - 2000 / 0071 (CNS))</seg>
<seg id=672>(Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=673>The export subsidies cause the flow at lower prices on the world market, excesses of food products, which creates a serious disadvantage in terms of competition for agri-food industries in many countries, for example in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=674>To gain the necessary financial means to an increase in aid in the Balkans, the Member States must carry out a redistribution of the sums available within the framework of the budget.</seg>
<seg id=675>However, Parliament managed to push through a number of important priorities, in particular an effort more in the fight against unemployment and poverty, on a number of important issues relating to the environment and equal opportunities, and so we voted against the attacks by the line with the LIFE programme and the European women's lobby.</seg>
<seg id=676>- (SV) We maintain our opinion in connection with the travel expenses are paid for MEPs, namely that only the actual costs incurred during the journeys which fall within the scope of their task must be to be repaid.</seg>
<seg id=677>I assume - and I hope that the Commission is seeking constructive solutions to this end, we will have to cover the period between 2002 and 2005 by means of a transitional regulation.</seg>
<seg id=678>- (DE) In its obsessive going to regulate and liberalise but mainly with a view to clamp down on real national parliaments, the European Commission tabled a proposal for a regulation for immediate application and compulsory, instead of a proposal for a directive, which must be treated with the cavalier cultivated in Parliament and the Council to enter into force on 31 December of this year.</seg>
<seg id=679>We will therefore support the Commission's efforts to reform this sector and we will oppose any new measures to support it.</seg>
<seg id=680>A development which made them dependent on the borrowed capital.</seg>
<seg id=681>Report (Nicholson a 0276 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=682>It is important to be able to ensure that the money allocated under aid are not used for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id=683>We firmly believe that the reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to be obtained mainly the cost of producing real pollutants (i.e. big industries) will have to pay to the detriment of their excessive profits.</seg>
<seg id=684>Report Moreira da Silva (A5-0271 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=685>It would be necessary to spend this money, by harmonising and coordinating the expenditure for research policy in all fifteen Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=686>This was only by precaution, we are right to want to learn more about these substances.</seg>
<seg id=687>The period of vote is over.</seg>
<seg id=688>This European format would replace the national format which is already used everywhere at present.</seg>
<seg id=689>The loss of data being used to draw up the for balance of payments statistics which would result from this amendment would be minimal.</seg>
<seg id=690>It should be reported to you that it is mainly the small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned with this problem.</seg>
<seg id=691>For years now, we insist that harmonisation of the efforts made in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=692>I believe that this report is of crucial importance for genuine integration of the citizens, small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro zone and to increase the acceptance of the Economic and Monetary Union.</seg>
<seg id=693>The free movement of capital in single currency cannot put up barriers or differences.</seg>
<seg id=694>However, the European Parliament and the Commission to attach so much importance.</seg>
<seg id=695>I support the dual policy which the rapporteur wishes to continue to encourage the too reluctant banks to act.</seg>
<seg id=696>We cannot force the banks to carry on a viable activity, but as politicians, we can do is to support the amendment tabled on behalf of the PPE-DE Group by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs claiming that measures are still being taken before the end of the year and preferably that these standards become reality when you begin to use the euro notes and coins.</seg>
<seg id=697>This is the direction in which the proposal is that I made to Mrs Peijs: bringing the banks around a table, not to impose constraints, but because we cannot increase the political pressure longer.</seg>
<seg id=698>It goes without saying that if the cross-border payment systems remain as costly as today, the credibility of these new of these new coins and notes will be attacked directly.</seg>
<seg id=699>We are of the opinion that this accumulation of statistical data on the national regulations of the European Union is a relic of the past are no longer justified in one area integrated, unified, and which is an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the market.</seg>
<seg id=700>Listening to the speeches of some of my colleagues in the Committee, who see here for longer than I have had the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, to which this Parliament is submitting for the fourth time, took part in this category.</seg>
<seg id=701>Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you in advance for the support that you will bring to my report.</seg>
<seg id=702>If we come back at European level, it will be necessary to increase the opportunities for the regions.</seg>
<seg id=703>Source of job creation, both in terms of quality and quantity, SMEs play a vital role for social cohesion and regional planning.</seg>
<seg id=704>The care he has taken to study the proposals and the dialogue that had the concern of conducting with many interested parties were an asset to better define and optimising the implementation of this programme.</seg>
<seg id=705>Thirdly, we must seek the European added value.</seg>
<seg id=706>It follows that the small and medium-sized enterprises can only live if unemployment is weak and if public budgets are free debts and sufficiently supplied to provide such investment.</seg>
<seg id=707>The companies need clarity.</seg>
<seg id=708>Above all, when a one-person business or a society with fewer than 250 employees has a project, it must be possible to receive financing not only to guarantee to 120%, but merely on the basis of a good idea.</seg>
<seg id=709>The national States, even the regional or local serve as already gigantic pumps with finances, intended to drain the taxpayers' money, the money taken from the majority of the population, including the most disadvantaged, towards the large companies and leaving to their owners and their shareholders.</seg>
<seg id=710>The schooled for small and medium-sized enterprises includes fragile thousands of tests which feed the large companies in staff and ideas.</seg>
<seg id=711>What I expect of the Commissioner, particularly amongst all the measures we have proposed here is that it facilitates and speeding up access to aid and information, so that the leaders of SMEs are able to use information with efficiency.</seg>
<seg id=712>All these will occupy a special place in the multiannual programme.</seg>
<seg id=713>Finally, I welcome the idea of giving us an annual meeting in order to take stock of the implementation of the programme.</seg>
<seg id=714>The recent incidents against the Greek minority in Himara make more imperative that measures to promote democratisation, strengthening the institutions and respect for human rights in Albania.</seg>
<seg id=715>An impressive number of Albanian leave their countries because of the uncertainty that prevails there, of the social problems, social and family structures prémodernes.</seg>
<seg id=716>We need preventive measures tailored to Albania and contributing to the construction and the reconstruction of the country in order to live with dignity in this region.</seg>
<seg id=717>Therefore travel documents from one authority with other and that the European Commission, for example, refuses to make public the report which concerns, amongst other things, also customs assistance mission (camwood), drawn up by the Albanians.</seg>
<seg id=718>Let us try to look the truth.</seg>
<seg id=719>Mrs Karamanou, congratulations on the enlarged visual angle which governed the concept of your report.</seg>
<seg id=720>It is a very important issue which is shaped by factors historical, social, political and economic.</seg>
<seg id=721>We will never know the exact number of victims.</seg>
<seg id=722>The joint economic activities create peaceful links between peoples.</seg>
<seg id=723>What I find unacceptable on the contrary, in this report, and I say this with frankness, it is that confuses the force and cause, i.e. a confusing a procedure of balanced a visa, and therefore the possibility of migration, to the cause of illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id=724>The important institutional changes which are the result of the Treaty of Amsterdam had an impact on the management of asylum and immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id=725>Thirdly and finally, the action plan and its method of implementation must be considered at regional level.</seg>
<seg id=726>Naturally, this requirement also invites us to show restraint in European regulations.</seg>
<seg id=727>It is now or never to focus especially on the force of Community action.</seg>
<seg id=728>I also advocate that proposals codified in the event of a modification of the current EU law are introduced in order to incorporate the amendments in the existing directives or regulations.</seg>
<seg id=729>The principle of subsidiarity, if it is understood, commits us in two directions: to make the decisions taken at the lowest possible level, but to acknowledge that the lowest possible level can be a very high level, when the general interests and threatened if they are not protected everywhere in a uniform way.</seg>
<seg id=730>This report is a model of brevity and clarity and I hope colleagues will take account of this seriously.</seg>
<seg id=731>The report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market did not cause the enthusiasm of its members.</seg>
<seg id=732>That is what I referred to in the report on the SLIM project, because the Community law, and Mr Medina has just demonstrated this with the reading of one of the articles of the Treaty, is difficult to understand, even for the experts.</seg>
<seg id=733>Therefore, certain aspects of the report enthusiastic me somewhat, because I would have preferred a report more 'communitarising' with regard to the internal market, and, above all, because the report does not go in this direction on this point.</seg>
<seg id=734>What is important for the Union's institutions is that we firmly committed to improving the quality of legislation, in particular, taking account of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=735>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=736>The persistence of this situation could have a negative impact on the citizens of the euro.</seg>
<seg id=737>Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and we are to retain any prepared very carefully the Karamanou report.</seg>
<seg id=738>Having said that, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to take advantage of our oral question and in this debate to address both sides – since our motion for a resolution is addressed to both sides, and I would like to make a few observations calmly.</seg>
<seg id=739>The people of the Union which we represent demand it.</seg>
<seg id=740>Well from water has passed under the bridge, the agreement, however, came to an end and was not taken back.</seg>
<seg id=741>I can understand the reasons for the Commissioner, but not those of the Director-General.</seg>
<seg id=742>We could say that, after the eleven less tie-ups, we continue to pay the previous agreement and the previous one of the previous one.</seg>
<seg id=743>Mr President, we had a similar debate here a year and the fact that it has taken a year to start negotiations shows how difficult it is to find fisheries resources for imposing fleets of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=744>During the second agreement, things were very clear.</seg>
<seg id=745>But as nothing is ever, not even the fishing resources must also be understood!</seg>
<seg id=746>So I particularly want to state clearly that, if the PPE-DE Group were separated from one another, it is not only for having supported have defended and have encouraged the fisheries agreements, but also to have encouraged their extension significantly.</seg>
<seg id=747>Thirdly, given that the fisheries agreement is suspended, the exploitation of the place of fishing in the Sahara by Community and non-Community fleets which are not subject to control by the Commission and to Member States continues: one is above all an important fleet in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id=748>I readily understand because fishing is a source of income and jobs important for this poor region - in relation to European standards.</seg>
<seg id=749>The other point I would like to emphasise is that the temporary aid paid to the fishermen and shipowners in compensation for this year without work end at the end of the month. It is an untenable situation for them, they prefer to work rather than to receive aid.</seg>
<seg id=750>A year ago that, as a Member of the Andalusian Party, I negotiations and I propose initiatives in the corridors, offices, in the Committee on Fisheries and hearings with the Commissioner that is taken into account the very special uniqueness of the Andalusian fishing fleet which fished in Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=751>Spain has developed in a remarkably positive the difficult neighbourhood which always existed between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=752>As a Spanish Member and Andalusia, I claim the right of thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families to maintain and defend, and so that this Parliament also defends, their jobs, which have been seen endangered for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id=753>We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=754>A history of almost twelve years, made reassuring words spoken by the authorities, tactics of tactics, hopes, also of personal needs, placebos for those affected, the persistent defence of old rights with regard to citizens, who have only sought their right anything else.</seg>
<seg id=755>As you know, the matter is very complex and concerns some 700 people working in more than 25 Italian universities.</seg>
<seg id=756>If the Italian legal system is reformed and amended, as was the case for teaching staff, we do not think that the Commission can intervene as any European citizen enjoys equal access to all categories of professions.</seg>
<seg id=757>The injustice lies in the fact that two people filling the same task and working side-by-side receive different wages and are subject to different conditions.</seg>
<seg id=758>In my view, however, there is nothing worse than to have to inform people that a ruling in their favour can only be a series of reassuring words and have no practical effect on their existence.</seg>
<seg id=759>I would remind you, I would remind the Commission that I hope for a response to the fact that, in the case of allué, the judgment delivered by the precise court which is contrary to Article 48 (2) of the EC Treaty that the law of a Member State limit the duration of the contracts of employment assistants in foreign languages in one year with the possibility of renewal, unless there is in principle any restriction of this kind against other teachers.</seg>
<seg id=760>However, I believe that these matters relating to the heart of the fundamental principles of freedom associated with European law, in particular freedom of movement, and no exception can be tolerated in relation to these principles.</seg>
<seg id=761>As indicated by the current debate, we still encounter obstacles, obstacles in the way of the internal market, and not just in this case.</seg>
<seg id=762>We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=763>(The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=764>On behalf of Parliament, I immediately sent to the President, Mr Thomas Klestil, as well as the Chancellor, Mr Wolfgang Schüssel, the messages of condolence and solidarity in the test that such a tragedy calls with regard to the victims, their families and the whole of the Austrian people.</seg>
<seg id=765>Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg id=766>I support the proposal of Mr Ceyhun, and I would be very grateful to the Council if he could tell us whether it intends to put forward a new proposal on this matter.</seg>
<seg id=767>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group considers this incident such an important as we believe that it would not be treated as appropriate in the context of the urgent debate.</seg>
<seg id=768>I have the feeling that you join the motivation, Mr Barón Crespo, if I have understood you correctly.</seg>
<seg id=769>Madam President, some time ago, we discussed in this House about the sanctions against Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=770>We urgently need a debate on this subject before the entry into force of the amendments proposed by the British authorities; the Commission must also indicate clearly what it is right in this respect.</seg>
<seg id=771>(A5-0314 / 2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic for adoption of a Convention on improving mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, particularly in the field of the fight against organised crime, the laundering of the proceeds of crime and criminality in financial matters (10213 / 2000 - C5-0394 / 2000 - 2000 / 0815 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=772>The statements must be followed by specific actions to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.</seg>
<seg id=773>The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot remain in the hands of a specialist agency under the sole control of the national governments.</seg>
<seg id=774>Furthermore, Article 8 of the draft convention limited solely to the essential interests grounds for refusal of mutual assistance which could invoke the necessary State.</seg>
<seg id=775>First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Marinho on his work and to say how the fight against economic crime deserves not only our support, but also our vigilance.</seg>
<seg id=776>To identify, continue to condemn the money laundering of terrorists and the trafficking of arms and drugs: yes, of course!</seg>
<seg id=777>Our task is to detect to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of organized crime.</seg>
<seg id=778>These things are in the amendments and, judging by the debate in committee, I trust that they will be approved by Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=779>It seems to me that this series of initiatives evolves in a way which is likely to destroy the protection offered by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</seg>
<seg id=780>But the reality is not so easy.</seg>
<seg id=781>Finally, Mr President, the PPE Group supports the compromise amendment which we have reached with Mrs Roure about the activities of lawyers.</seg>
<seg id=782>The second measure, the second instrument, is the harmonisation.</seg>
<seg id=783>Other speakers have welcomed this Portuguese initiative.</seg>
<seg id=784>This was the aim of the joint meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the ECOFIN Council on 17 October.</seg>
<seg id=785>The best way to strengthen parliamentary control and judicial control over Europol, consists in integrating Europol Convention fully in the legal framework of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=786>The creation of a Provisional Judicial Cooperation Unit is a step in the right direction, not to which the European Parliament is aiming for a long time.</seg>
<seg id=787>That is the meaning of the guarantees, namely to move this aspect of freedoms.</seg>
<seg id=788>The European Parliament is the Community supranational authority of the establishment of this report, and my speech is therefore proposing to you to support the validity of them by supporting our rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=789>It is only when the institutional model and the rules which will govern the European area of justice are specified that the citizens and Parliament will be able to decide on the measures that the Council is proposing.</seg>
<seg id=790>Eurojust is a logical step of this work, which aims to give the citizens a high level of safety, in an area of freedom, security and justice, by stepping up the fight against serious forms of organised crime.</seg>
<seg id=791>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is necessary to congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on the report she has presented to us, in line with the decisions taken at the Tampere Council.</seg>
<seg id=792>But as with Eurojust, there has been talk of the coordination of national public prosecutors and judges to combat all forms of serious crime - and here I agree with the approach of the rapporteur – we enlarge the concept: there is no longer just talk about cooperation for purely transnational crimes, we also talk of cooperation for the suppression of criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id=793>We will have the opportunity to commit ourselves to this provisional unit, as of 1 January 2001, but the Commission wants to promote the debate on what should be the final unity of Eurojust.</seg>
<seg id=794>On both sides, there was frank statement - I apparently - which, however, did not lead to inflexible opposition.</seg>
<seg id=795>The problems at the level of expenditure is too did not concern; other areas were much more worrying.</seg>
<seg id=796>It is unacceptable that we have no clear objectives and that we cannot measure the results; this would not happen to any other institution.</seg>
<seg id=797>A second point, Commissioner, with regard to the hierarchy of competence of planning, the truly unacceptable overlaps were observed.</seg>
<seg id=798>I want to stress that he has played a positive role in a number of problems.</seg>
<seg id=799>It is clear that this work in consortium does not establish a double in the joint financial responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=800>Therefore, we really have worked with the recovery of 3.4 million, and we can say that we have carried it out with more than 90%.</seg>
<seg id=801>Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg id=802>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after nine months of work and of a long-term search for compromise, so that the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=803>Even if it is happy today to say 'yes' to this Charter, I hope that this House will leave no ambiguity in the coming weeks, on the fact that it requires the Council that this Charter should be legally binding and that the latter must guarantee citizens' access to the European Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id=804>This position has, as you know, taken by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Biarritz, who agreed themselves, unanimously and without reservation, the Charter, and I can therefore only urge you, on behalf of the Council, to follow this position, perhaps by showing some reason to you.</seg>
<seg id=805>But it is above all by the strength of its content that the Charter, I am convinced of it, will now.</seg>
<seg id=806>For its part, the European Trade Union Confederation could complain about what it considers to be gaps, such as the absence of any reference to the right to a minimum wage for example.</seg>
<seg id=807>The fact remains that some individuals, and especially the members of the European Parliament proposed that an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is inserted into Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which has already referred to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=808>Our group unanimously approved the Charter, except for the British delegation.</seg>
<seg id=809>As the European People's Party, we are unanimously in favour of including as soon as possible of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties, so that it has the force of immediate law for the citizens of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=810>They showed that could work on European issues in a new, exemplary manner, higher than that of the Intergovernmental Conference, because it gives this work an open and democratic nature, enabling citizens to fully exercise their right to demonstrate and to take part in it.</seg>
<seg id=811>The right to health, social security, housing and minimum income are non-existent or only about solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=812>Fourthly, and it is particularly important to me, the Charter is based on the principle of the indivisibility of civil and political rights, on the one hand, and social rights, on the other.</seg>
<seg id=813>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this Charter is simply the umpteenth demonstration of the power of the EU and our Member States to increase the empty texts, declarations of intent.</seg>
<seg id=814>The Commission representative to the Convention of Turin added to the document legal consequences.</seg>
<seg id=815>Since the time of the market, the time of the Europe of rights may ultimately by the concept of citizenship in the European Union is a fairly new concept.</seg>
<seg id=816>The Charter is written as a text which can have a binding.</seg>
<seg id=817>I also note with great pride that a representative of the group to which I belong to the Finnish Parliament, Mr Gunnar jansson, has played a very important role in the drafting of the Charter.</seg>
<seg id=818>As I said yesterday evening - I repeat today, there are too many shortcomings in this area, throughout the Union, and sometimes carried by our desire to develop the judicial and police cooperation, we overlook the importance of ensuring that innocent people do not become passive victims, collateral damage of the war against crime.</seg>
<seg id=819>Madam President, the European Parliament's draft resolution on the Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the same ambiguity as the work of the House.</seg>
<seg id=820>The Italian Constitution, for example, the limit of good habit; the Convention provides for the limit of the rights of others, of the law and order.</seg>
<seg id=821>Mr President, today, in the vote that will take place at noon, we will put an end to a process that started in 1984, when the European Parliament approved the draft Treaty on European Union, which was already the request for a statement of rights, process that we pursued in 1989 with the resolution of Mr De Gucht.</seg>
<seg id=822>The Charter will produce effects it will produce some, or that it is not in the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=823>It is to be welcomed, and not to fear, as seems to think that Mr Bonde.</seg>
<seg id=824>It seems that all the struggles for the emancipation of disabled social classes of the century which ends were unnecessary and told us nothing.</seg>
<seg id=825>The Charter fills a gap in the law of the EC, it reinforces the protection of the people against the attacks of which they could be the subject from the European police force, the authorities are fighting fraud and of those to monitor competition.</seg>
<seg id=826>I do not understand those who are opposed to the Charter on the pretext that it does not contain all they would like to see included.</seg>
<seg id=827>Mr President, I will continue in the same way that Mr Gahrton.</seg>
<seg id=828>I would like to make a third point about the rights of third country nationals.</seg>
<seg id=829>As the Court of Human Rights, the Council of Europe also has a solid experience with regard to such forms of control we can take it as a basis.</seg>
<seg id=830>In view of the text of the Charter that we will approve – with a large majority, I hope - today, it is clear that we will achieve greater protection of fundamental rights and more topical than would have enabled this accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=831>That is why it is necessary to meet others not forward.</seg>
<seg id=832>This is crucial if we want to win the support of the European population with regard to the Charter.</seg>
<seg id=833>After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be my grid of analysis for this report and, as far as my average staff, intellectuals and means as colleagues who will be given to me will allow me, I will make an analysis right by right, country by country of respect for the Charter in the fifteen countries.</seg>
<seg id=834>Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would first like to endorse the comments made by Mr Moscovici, and to welcome the essential contribution that the Members of the European Parliament has contributed to the debate, with the Convention, in particular the role that Mr Mendes de Vigo played Praesidium of the Convention drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=835>I will quote only some of the main points of this debate.</seg>
<seg id=836>The Convention chose to enshrine fundamental rights inspired by the various instruments of the Council of Europe, treaties and constitutions of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=837>The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:</seg>
<seg id=838>As things stand at the moment, as it is based on our Parliament to tell the Turkish people as there are now three conditions for its accession.</seg>
<seg id=839>Furthermore, it would not have been possible to set conditions only by a decision of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=840>That is why I have taken note of the suggestions made by Mr Morillon on the conditions for the accession of Turkey and they deserve the greatest interest.</seg>
<seg id=841>I am pleased to say that, in the meantime, the Turkish Government accepted this partnership as a basis for future cooperation, which gives us hope achieve our aims, namely to help, through our policy, the forces of reform in Turkey to give new impetus to the reform process and get it sought for accession to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=842>For me, the most important point is that Helsinki started in Turkey, the Turkish public opinion, a debate on the conditions for Turkey's accession to the EU and that this debate endorses and supports the reform-minded forces in the country.</seg>
<seg id=843>This text is submitted to you for that.</seg>
<seg id=844>What it intends to do now is to give an impetus within the framework of a future accession.</seg>
<seg id=845>I do not know how the votes go but I would invite urged Turkey to deal with this issue seriously.</seg>
<seg id=846>The European Parliament will play its part in the promotion of relations with the political parties, NGOs and the press, as well as the development of its complex and sometimes tense relationship with the Grand National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id=847>Mr Morillon, your report is, in my view, completely realistic and responsible.</seg>
<seg id=848>At the time of your visit to Turkey last March, as now, at least you mentioned the problem of the Kurdish population by name.</seg>
<seg id=849>There are both great naivety and a large enough to consider that Europeans will bring the Turks, and I quote, 'with a radical change in their habits and mentality'.</seg>
<seg id=850>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report presented to us in me raises serious concerns.</seg>
<seg id=851>Recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the approval of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487 / 1 / 00 C5-0570 / 2000 - 2000 / 2233 (AVC))</seg>
<seg id=852>In any event, we will have the next time we will discuss the computer capacity, reported to us that we need greater control and thus better able to respect the human person.</seg>
<seg id=853>Recommendation Duff / Voggenhuber (A5-0325 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=854>As an indication, let us quote:</seg>
<seg id=855>The rights contained in the Charter are already included in the national constitutions and are defended by national parliaments close to the people and their cultures.</seg>
<seg id=856>For example, Article 19 1, which states that: 'collective expulsions are prohibited, does not say that this ban can be suspended in the event of war or serious breaches of the law and order.</seg>
<seg id=857>We give a brief explanation as of these three objections in order.</seg>
<seg id=858>The right for a government to dismiss its Constitution arbitrarily is the defining characteristic of a tyranny.</seg>
<seg id=859>But, I repeat it today, we have reason to be proud conditions under which we have taken this important step for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=860>A society is only rights, but no duties, becomes a selfish society.</seg>
<seg id=861>It is our priority fight so that the affirmation of fundamental rights is implemented in political choices.</seg>
<seg id=862>As far as the Convention method is interesting and fruitful to establish a basic text, seeking a broad compromise, as it does not justify depriving the European Parliament, common representation of the European people, the possibility of amending, of enriching the text.</seg>
<seg id=863>This Charter must be improved and our Parliament must propose a strategy for its updating and its enrichment.</seg>
<seg id=864>Therefore, it should not be adopted and proclaimed at the Council meeting in Nice, this summit should instead initiate a European debate on the Charter.</seg>
<seg id=865>Fortunately, the dominant trend of national governments seem marked were full of common sense, i.e. that of a Charter for purely political and non-binding scope.</seg>
<seg id=866>Created in as well as ‘ Here ’ s the Cologne Summit, this self-proclaimed 'convention', a name which reminds 1793 regrettably and terrorist excesses of the French Revolution implemented by another Convention.</seg>
<seg id=867>On the other hand, the method that was used, exclusion which were made and the ambiguity surrounding the very nature of this text cast a rather raw light on the new totalitarian ferment which are at the very heart of European integration process.</seg>
<seg id=868>Fortunately, the European Parliament has yet in this area only an advisory role, pending the full application of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but it is the means of making it play in the wrong direction, slowing down the right decisions.</seg>
<seg id=869>As for the procedure, the differing views.</seg>
<seg id=870>In fact, so it was a century ago, before and after it has been somewhat limited, this right is now a return in vigour.</seg>
<seg id=871>The last thing we want is that the single market to make it possible for criminals to be introduced there by the back door.</seg>
<seg id=872>We also support the future creation of a Convention facilitating the fight against organised crime and money laundering, as well as the various measures proposed for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id=873>Indeed, it creates a provisional unit consisting of representatives of the judges and police officers who pursue an activity of judge in our fifteen Member States.</seg>
<seg id=874>Mr President, as a Member of the joint parliamentary committee EU Turkey, I take a great deal with the issue of the prospect of Turkey ’ s accession.</seg>
<seg id=875>Turkey's position on the Cyprus issue is also unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=876>We agree, however, the criticism of the rapporteur, who believes that there is at present, an effective evaluation of the results of the activity of EIB loans, and that there are shortcomings in view of the public right of access to documents and democratic control of the activities of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id=877>Turkey, despite all its difference, were always and still belongs to full to European reality.</seg>
<seg id=878>Turkey ’ s accession to the European Union has become a matter more than ever on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=879>Mr Morillon says that Turkey should try not to see the European Union as a 'exclusive Christian club' who wish to exclude, it is Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=880>Turkey will achieve real democracy, when it comes to learn to live with its past, as a democratic Germany know how to live with it, and with her also to him have asked us to.</seg>
<seg id=881>As soon as the authorities in Ankara understand that the status quo is unacceptable for Europe and the rest of the world, significant progress can be made: the island can be reunited and a comprehensive, just and lasting solution in accordance with international law will be taken tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id=882>To tell the truth, why all that remains is missing from the report of the European Commission?</seg>
<seg id=883>It is within this balanced framework that we will have to press on with our action to support the rapprochement between the Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=884>If you treat the Armenian issue in relation to accession to the EU – Please pay attention to my remarks: to deal with the Armenian issue in relation to accession to the EU, the project which we have discussed today will not start. It is as simple as that.</seg>
<seg id=885>This is also the reason for our insistence that a balance sheet is drawn up the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, so that in Marseilles, specifically, we are able to make the necessary guidelines.</seg>
<seg id=886>However, we have managed to maintain the dialogue and on some sensitive issues: stability, terrorism, migration, human rights, for example.</seg>
<seg id=887>The fact remains that the Council made an effort, particularly since 1995, to give the Mediterranean with more resources, the scale of the challenges of the partnership.</seg>
<seg id=888>It is in fact - and I would also like to say this as someone from Central Europe – an extremely important issue.</seg>
<seg id=889>Mr President, as you know, there is a saying in the English language that when a fast-track profile does not appear on the occasion of a play, it looks like a representation of Hamlet without the first grave-digger.</seg>
<seg id=890>We want to see together the policies on the issues relating to the single market and to reach an agreement in order to introduce the cumulative origin, alongside the sub-regional free trade agreements for all the partners taking this path and adopting the harmonised protocol on rules of origin.</seg>
<seg id=891>We note with great satisfaction that the Commission for giving new impetus to the Barcelona process.</seg>
<seg id=892>I raised these issues because that is where we need to find the key to relaunch the process and that it is necessary to add to all this the enrichment of the political agenda in Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id=893>It is therefore necessary that our priority is to guarantee peace and security in the European Union in the Mediterranean and we must make every possible effort on behalf of this cooperation and ensure that the funds committed is effectively implemented, in accordance with - let us say – the selfish generosity of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=894>These are important issues and concrete I wish to raise, and I thank Mr Brok for allowing this debate before the Presidency and the Commission can discuss these issues.</seg>
<seg id=895>The world is moving in the direction of an inevitable globalization now in this context, it must be organised in large blocks acting as actors in the broad spectrum of global competition.</seg>
<seg id=896>It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries demanded only a quarter of the appropriations for MEDA I come to the end in 1999 and whose equipment was EUR 4.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id=897>In this sense, the proposal for a new impetus on the part of the Commission is positive and we fully agree with the two priorities that Mr Patten pointed out in his speeches and repeated in this House this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id=898>This is a warning to ensure that the European Union plays a much more active role in the Mediterranean, which historically and culturally, contributed to the wealth and the size of our continent of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=899>But even worse, at a time when in this Chamber we exchange peacefully points of view are sometimes very different, increasingly Palestinians were killed.</seg>
<seg id=900>Aid for reconstruction</seg>
<seg id=901>If we do not find the means, in December, in order to implement this regulation, this means that the debate we are holding today is an empty shell.</seg>
<seg id=902>It is often too bureaucratic and often involves too complex procedures, but we do not have and please let us not close our eyes, and I hope that the Member States do not do so either, on the role that it has played in this respect.</seg>
<seg id=903>The media in the region have often been responsible for the tragedy that has suffered; they must be free to work in accordance with the rules in force in our democracies.</seg>
<seg id=904>But I am also pleased, because I believe that Parliament succeeded, with an ongoing pressure, to bring about a successful outcome to a situation which was not very good at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id=905>I repeat: it really is necessary to avoid unnecessarily spending money on superfluous meetings.</seg>
<seg id=906>However, we must not focus solely on Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id=907>I also regret that programme number were put in the performance reserve, the reserve of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id=908>In Feira, he recognised the quality of potential candidates for accession to the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process.</seg>
<seg id=909>I recall the main priorities allocated to cards: the strengthening of the institutions in the direction of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction, regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=910>The European Union was right to react positively to the accession of President Kostunica to power.</seg>
<seg id=911>A first review took place on 6 November.</seg>
<seg id=912>As requested by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, that these initiatives the presidency of the European Council is going to take to play a more active role in order to ensure the full implementation of the UN peace plan?</seg>
<seg id=913>How to achieve this recovery without payment of this conflict?</seg>
<seg id=914>I can simply say that France and Germany - I do not speak longer as President of the Council – mentioned these matters in a bilateral Summit in vittel last week, and it was decided to set up a working group in order to remedy the problem.</seg>
<seg id=915>At the same time, the EU continues to provide an important material aid to these two countries, through its various programmes, especially TACIS.</seg>
<seg id=916>The honourable Member's question therefore gives to the Presidency the opportunity to dispel some confusion.</seg>
<seg id=917>And I would add a further point: it is particularly in these two texts, to strengthen the criminal framework for combating the organised networks of smugglers.</seg>
<seg id=918>In the report which the Turkish Council of Ministers adopted on 21 September and reform programmes, appear in the part of the legislative changes several projects: to register in civil code of measures to strengthen the effective equality between women and men in youth workers areas: better to combating domestic violence; better to condemn such violence, through the creation of special family courts, and finally to ban the possibility of a reduced sentence for crime of honour.</seg>
<seg id=919>So, the Presidency does not have an answer on this.</seg>
<seg id=920>Next week, it will have a meeting of the European Conference, with my invitation, in France, that is, with the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=921>Do you think that the ‘ Austrian 'model – namely decision-making majority bilateral - will in future be an instrument for making it possible to take decisions by ignoring the European institutions and to establish a new institution, or a new group, to be able to get round the unanimity rule in the Council?</seg>
<seg id=922>The Council has not received the letter but the Presidency, of course, answered Mr cem. the terms of this response has been given to all the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=923>Which Mr President-in-Office see it the position of Mr Tzem - Mr Moscovici did not answer that – which claims that it is not possible to take account of the Cyprus question, if we want to promote the partnership between Turkey and the European Union?</seg>
<seg id=924>We should be aware that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is more than just a fisheries agreement and, as he knows, if we had not managed such an agreement, and all that that implies, that could have hidden a deterioration in relations between the European Union and Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=925>And that is why I would like to express my scepticism about the outcome.</seg>
<seg id=926>As regards the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that this principle should allow the strengthening of cooperation between the Member States, but also the protection of the rights of the people.</seg>
<seg id=927>The supplementary questions must be made by other Members.</seg>
<seg id=928>Furthermore, the Commission, in the communication it adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union's oil supply, indicates that it intends to present to the European Council in Gothenburg, a plan for then- and the diversification of energy sources which should help to improve energy efficiency, particularly in the buildings and transport.</seg>
<seg id=929>In this spirit, we launched at the time of the vote on the resolution on the embargo, within the framework of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on 9 November, an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with the international bodies which defend human rights.</seg>
<seg id=930>It is therefore up to NATO to make the provisions which it will be necessary to ensure that such not be repeated.</seg>
<seg id=931>(The sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=932>When we talk about money, those who give the money all have the same privilege to clearly define the political objectives, and that is what the Commissioner has always done.</seg>
<seg id=933>This presence, in theory, can open up new prospects for the unity of the policy that we follow.</seg>
<seg id=934>If we regard the region as an area of political antagonisms in power, we will be on the wrong track.</seg>
<seg id=935>Parliament must be consulted and informed regularly; that is the second request of the rapporteurs, demand that we should all support.</seg>
<seg id=936>The Heads of Government also confirmed the Union ’ s determination to support this process by means of technical assistance and economic.</seg>
<seg id=937>It is Parliament which supported the Commission proposal to create a European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=938>As the House knows, we do not think it is necessary to include an explicit reference to this in the regulation.</seg>
<seg id=939>The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=940>The leaders agreed to extend and update the Eurasian cooperation framework 2000, which is the work programme for the next ten years.</seg>
<seg id=941>I think that reminds us in Europe, the important role that we play in Asia, and not only in terms of the economy and trade, although it must be said that one of the reasons for the restoration of Asia is due to the fact that we have kept our promise to keep our markets open to Asian exports over the last two years.</seg>
<seg id=942>I believe it was a very good political statement, but we still have a few problems to resolve.</seg>
<seg id=943>We know that the Commission considers the ASEM very seriously, and we support it in this attitude.</seg>
<seg id=944>It is necessary to improve the existing mechanisms at the level of transposition of Community law in order to increase legal certainty and to overcome the current slow.</seg>
<seg id=945>We must therefore encourage the creation of new regional organisations, starting where there is already a Community presence, as is the case in the Western Pacific and the Southern Pacific.</seg>
<seg id=946>It will be vital for the sustainability of fishing.</seg>
<seg id=947>I believe that the future of fishing in international waters dependent on these organisations and the whole of the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, briefly summarise ‘ to defend the position of the United Nations, both in the Convention of 1982 as in New York, which has been mentioned here, our presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing must be very active.</seg>
<seg id=948>That is why I believe that the Commission can play a leading role by going on the spot and encourage fishermen to cooperate with it and to propose a solution to which we can all join us.</seg>
<seg id=949>Furthermore, the Commission must take a number of tasks in these negotiations which must be carried out within the framework of the RFOs.</seg>
<seg id=950>Mr President, I have the same problems as Mr Nicholson, but in a form more acute.</seg>
<seg id=951>Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are the solutions which the Committee on Agriculture recommends.</seg>
<seg id=952>Sometimes we are able to ask ourselves whether the cyclical crises of the market is not, to a certain extent, the result of the speculative action of so-called structures of society who are therefore ensure control of the sector according to their interests.</seg>
<seg id=953>The additional aid to the EU proposed by Mr Garot in his report, in my opinion, is contrary to the good sense in these years of Agenda 2000, enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe and the reform of agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=954>I think it is quite remarkable that the rapporteur has shown that what we can do with a little administration when a defined project is followed, which is clearly in the report.</seg>
<seg id=955>On the one hand, the largest producers or those who are included in the business of downstream should keep out of this system, prefer the systems which they already have: individual savings, bank loans, compensation fund.</seg>
<seg id=956>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say first of all that, basically, and taking account of Austrian agriculture, I welcome the Commission proposal favourably to be regulation funds.</seg>
<seg id=957>I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.</seg>
<seg id=958>I understand that we want a common organization of the market in the area of intensive farming and a dismantling of agricultural policy because it is linked to the territory, where IT production is linked to the territory.</seg>
<seg id=959>There is already a COM in pig meat, and we should not make the mistake of dispute that when, basically, it works well.</seg>
<seg id=960>According to the Commission, it is right to point to a discipline only farmers who take part in the regulatory Funds, since they receive in exchange some guarantee of income, while those who do not participate in the funds do not receive this guarantee.</seg>
<seg id=961>(The sitting was closed at 11.15 10)</seg>
<seg id=962>The resources from the VAT account for 36% and the traditional own resources 15%.</seg>
<seg id=963>Another aspect of the reform is also closely linked to a priority identified by the Court is of greater importance given to the assessment of results and performance within the framework of an allocation of resources reflecting predetermined priorities and clear and measurable objectives.</seg>
<seg id=964>It is a good thing and I would like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, as well as the members of the Court of Auditors and the services of the Court of Auditors, to support the reform of the Commission with this report.</seg>
<seg id=965>In this connection, it is also of circumstances that I tell you that, for the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we proposed to amend the Treaty so as to be able to create a European Public Prosecutor to continue fraud affecting the financial interests of the Community I very much hope that this proposal will not simply be recorded at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice or will be slipped under the carpet, but that we will deal with it seriously.</seg>
<seg id=966>The reality described in the annual report is rather disappointing.</seg>
<seg id=967>The errors is too high to give such a guarantee.</seg>
<seg id=968>The amount earmarked for the activities of equipment is too low of 240 million.</seg>
<seg id=969>I would also have liked the report of the Court of Auditors was a little more user-friendly and that it had submitted some clear recommendations - for example, one or two recommendations per chapter.</seg>
<seg id=970>A Convention on the protection of the financial interests of the EU was adopted in 1995.</seg>
<seg id=971>The Commission and the Member States should grasp it in this direction and exploit its conclusions in order to strengthen the effectiveness of their methods of management of EU finances.</seg>
<seg id=972>I know that this report and the work that Parliament is about to begin within the framework of the discharge procedure will contribute to greater vigilance with regard to the Community expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=973>At the moment, I would like to keep quiet me, Madam President, and to wait for a Member of the Council comes here.</seg>
<seg id=974>As in previous years, the Court did not manage to identify the exact failures.</seg>
<seg id=975>Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union approaches and the Court of Auditors' report clearly shows that it still has to work to achieve, even in the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=976>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have recently concluded an agreement with the Court of Auditors, which was to be able to obtain in advance information on the report of the Court and to remain silent on this.</seg>
<seg id=977>I would like ‘ to harass' the Council and to ask him why the situation does not progress on Article 24 of the financial regulation.</seg>
<seg id=978>That is perhaps a little European common sense will make it possible to resolve the problem and to give George Bush the place it deserves in history – the dustbin.</seg>
<seg id=979>We do not have to look for scapegoats, not more in our institutions that in our States.</seg>
<seg id=980>Above all, on the procedure for the presentation of the annual report to Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am pleased to hear that the Members feel that the situation is this year is more satisfactory than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id=981>In any event, we will have the opportunity of looking at all.</seg>
<seg id=982>When the audit justifies it, we mention all that should be.</seg>
<seg id=983>Ladies and gentlemen, as you will certainly have noticed, the last part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors has been the victim of an unfortunate virus which go-betweens between his speech and this House.</seg>
<seg id=984>Certain amendments, such as Amendments Nos 1 and 18, which deal with questions of interest to UK basically and it must be said that all the groups in the United Kingdom, that they are socialist, popular or green, defended them with great vehemence and they were approved by the Committee on the Environment.</seg>
<seg id=985>Mr President, in March of this year, we adopted the directive on the funicular for passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id=986>We believe that, in this case, the obligations of the manufacturer which derive from the law on the safety of products should not burden the trade.</seg>
<seg id=987>We have heard the justification of those and the resumption of industrial arguments raised in committee.</seg>
<seg id=988>Since the seller can each time to inform the purchaser of the nature of the goods and reservations about information, that should be enough.</seg>
<seg id=989>Finally, I have one small thing to ask the European Commission on Article 4 relating to European standards and the question of whether these standards must be published.</seg>
<seg id=990>I am pleased with the exceptions are made for the charity shops and non-profit organisations like for second-hand goods sold on markets or within the framework of sales of individuals.</seg>
<seg id=991>The reliability of the safety of products and the aid sales represent an added value for the European label at a particularly difficult and crucial time.</seg>
<seg id=992>If we ask the Commission elsewhere in the near future to present a proposal on the safety of services, we cannot see why we should and would like to address here and now the aspects relating to the services, rather than waiting for the Commission proposal, because we can already foresee that difficulties of definition of the various regulations will arise and that the legal uncertainty will increase over time.</seg>
<seg id=993>Just a few words about the main aspects of this proposal.</seg>
<seg id=994>We make it possible to open up the system to third countries, particularly with the candidate countries: simplification of procedures for emergency measures at Community level in order to provide a rapid response on Council of a regulatory committee.</seg>
<seg id=995>This new demand in the case of does not imply any additional important responsibility this kind for shops.</seg>
<seg id=996>To replace the word 'produce' by the word ‘ supplier ', as Amendment No 11 is proposing, would create more confusion than precision, since the directive does not provide any definition of the word ‘ supplier'.</seg>
<seg id=997>Although the Commission is in favour of rapid establishment of the network, the methods must be discussed between Member States about it.</seg>
<seg id=998>Such certification can always be used as proof but cannot be regarded as intrinsically reliable.</seg>
<seg id=999>Having explained in detail why the Commission cannot accept Amendments 1,3,4,6,8,11,13,14,16,18,19,23,24,28 to 30,32,33,36, 34 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission can accept Amendments 2,9,10,12,15,20,22,25,26,31,35 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, since these amendments constitute an improvement and clarification of the Commission proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1000>Of course, for Mr Barón Crespo, an Italian Socialist cannot belong to the European Socialist Group.</seg>
<seg id=1001>In my view, there is no contradiction between Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37.</seg>
<seg id=1002>On the agenda, I leave it to the President of care to decide and I remind you that I am against, in any case, on each of the three amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1003>The Mediterranean countries except EU face admittedly with particularly acute problems of economic development there is a constant tension which had the inequalities between the regions.</seg>
<seg id=1004>With regard to respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, in a spirit of European harmonised policy on immigration, in addition to the legal instruments designed to guarantee fair treatment for them, it would be necessary to create instruments to financial aid for all those young people who, having completed an academic round, higher or academic, in European countries, would like to return to their countries of origin to start a business.</seg>
<seg id=1005>I would like to highlight a factor which I consider crucial frankly to tackle this problem: I refer to the inequality in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=1006>Albeit belatedly, the Commission has presented a programme on the Community strategy for equality between men and women (2001-2005), which differs many of the previous programmes, in particular the fourth action programme, which is completed at the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id=1007>Despite these reservations, I voted for this report, firstly because account was taken of a number of amendments tabled by my group and, secondly, because this report calls for the achievement of studies on the situation of women in the national labour markets and the inadequate access to social security systems, two issues which we need, relevant statistics broken down by gender.</seg>
<seg id=1008>My party serious reservations about the regulation of the sale of consumption by means of Community legislation, as it has reservations about the concept of mutual recognition of standards.</seg>
<seg id=1009>This misunderstanding is now disappeared, and the labour amendments offer the guarantee not to affect the charity shops and to see them excluded from the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1010>Finally, Amendment No 15 leaves a free hand to the Commission on the language regime of the Agency, which we regard as very worrying.</seg>
<seg id=1011>The simplification of the process of decision-making, the creation of decentralised operational centres (and not only in Pristina, equivalent separating it from Yugoslavia) and the management of dual structure between the management board and the Commission may prove to be positive action to combat the important bureaucratic shortcomings of the European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=1012>We will therefore vote against the Commission proposal and against the report of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1013>An adaptation of existing Community legislation in this area can therefore be considered to be justified.</seg>
<seg id=1014>Furthermore, the funds cofinanced by the Member States make it possible to grant more or less disguised State aid.</seg>
<seg id=1015>Despite the serious shortcomings, the Morillon report obviously goes further than the Commission proposal on the partnership between the European Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1016>We, we voted against.</seg>
<seg id=1017>Like the rapporteur, we must admit that Turkey has made progress on certain plans and positive signals that exist.</seg>
<seg id=1018>Since 1987, our Parliament has committed itself in terms of the recognition, and the adoption of this amendment is the coherence of the House on this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1019>The Union must make more proposals and see the accession of Turkey as an essential geopolitical strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1020>Such second thoughts are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1021>For several years, as a member of the delegation for relations with Canada, I have been able to observe the operation of one of these regional organisations, the NAFO (organisation of fishing in the north-west Atlantic,), in which the States of that region to participate, with Canada, as all those who use at the place of the traditional fishing zones, including France, Spain and other European countries.</seg>
<seg id=1022>It will not be satisfied that when its own fleet of gunboats, leaf European flag, makes respect its fisheries policy.</seg>
<seg id=1023>The important thing is to satisfy the desire for hegemony of the Commission by weakening the position of Europe, which would be completely at odds with a proper application of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=1024>Finally, following tough negotiations, we came to an end result which it is worth defending.</seg>
<seg id=1025>Therefore, this proposal, which seeks to replace three directives on waste incineration, seeks to improve the quality of air, water, soil, the health of the people, by reducing the emission of pollutants linked to the activities of incineration and co-incineration, and in particular of heavy metals, dioxins and furanes.</seg>
<seg id=1026>But I think it is also right to emphasise, as an innovation, that it is no longer just about the emissions of these substances in the air; it also concerns the emission in water and soil.</seg>
<seg id=1027>The proposal improved in the various tests.</seg>
<seg id=1028>The introduction of stricter limits as regards nitrogen oxide for new of co-incineration plants, such as the cement kilns represents both a step and an incentive for reducing emissions, even though the proposed standards do not reflect the best available techniques.</seg>
<seg id=1029>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, forgive - in particular Mr Blokland, for a few minutes late.</seg>
<seg id=1030>In conclusion, this directive is a major contribution to reducing the negative effects on the environment and the risks that they represent to human health.</seg>
<seg id=1031>The European Parliament will be honoured, on behalf of the refusal of discrimination and the fight against exclusion and in respect for everyone's responsibilities, to give impetus to the establishment of a mechanism which will make it possible to realise in practice the principle of solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=1032>There is, however, major differences from one country to another; it lacks us however detailed and comparable statistical data, which would make it possible to draw up a reliable state of affairs, to decide in which country systems are more powerful, and how are these weaknesses, so it is precisely for that reason my opinion, which was drawn up at the request of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which emphasises that it is necessary, before to establish certain rules with general value is that, as regards health insurance complementary, and the Commission to publish a Green Paper which brings together all the data dispersed, which will have been dealt with, as well as the relevant information.</seg>
<seg id=1033>Until now, they have been the subject of a taboo.</seg>
<seg id=1034>The risk that people in poorer health and that older people can fully gain access to private insurance because of the high risk only represent is unacceptable for the development of our society.</seg>
<seg id=1035>The other point of view, illustrated by the original subject of the rapporteur and shared by many colleagues, is to promote the regulations and codes of conduct to be found, between insurers, the forms of mutual cost guarantee to all the supply of good quality care and to counter the risks to see developing discriminatory practices and a selection of risks and customers.</seg>
<seg id=1036>It is not at all normal to me that it is the money that determines the turn of phrase in a pattern.</seg>
<seg id=1037>The new Commission proposal on Employment and Social Affairs which is the first to draw up an inventory in the form of a Green Paper then to decide whether we need a directive or a recommendation, seems right to us.</seg>
<seg id=1038>A debate is currently underway in the Netherlands on the structural changes in the system.</seg>
<seg id=1039>On this basis, it is up to the Commission to take an initiative and to articulate specific key points which will be used as guidelines for the health systems of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1040>It is therefore unacceptable to consider a 'one size fits all' solution to the problem of health insurance.</seg>
<seg id=1041>So I think we need to focus on the content of Mr Rocard's report - that we congratulate - who requests from the Commission in the service of a service, the development of a Green Paper which will allow us to see the current state of insurance in the Member States and also to look to the future.</seg>
<seg id=1042>The two systems are based on a model tripod comprising the state, society and the private sector.</seg>
<seg id=1043>The European Union has already drafted a certain rules in the field of supplementary pensions.</seg>
<seg id=1044>Mr President, I wish to thank and congratulate Mr Rocard on his report and to congratulate Mr Marinho for the opinion on his Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1045>This study will be able to form the basis of a Commission communication to the Council and Parliament containing initiatives or measures.</seg>
<seg id=1046>As regards the amendments of the Committee on Budgets, I can say with satisfaction that they have all been accepted.</seg>
<seg id=1047>We have supported the characteristics of the programme, as the multidimensional approach to the phenomenon of measures in the field of health, education, housing, cohesion and complementarity with other policies, as well as the participation of non-governmental organisations, but also of the same people who are victims of social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1048>That means that we must take advantage of the bottom-up phases of the round to return to a situation of balance or surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1049>I would point out in this respect the last Ecofin Council asked the Commission for the assessment of the stability programmes specifically resume as soon as next year this aspect of long-term public finances, relating to the ageing of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1050>One of the positive features of the programme of the Netherlands is special attention - as I said before - to the impact of the ageing of the population on the Treasury in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id=1051>Therefore, in the case of Germany, the budgetary result for the year 2000 will cause a surplus of 1.5% of gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg id=1052>If we add to that the development of the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, we have a significant negative impact in terms of inflation.</seg>
<seg id=1053>Furthermore, they aim to make compatible a public pay-as-you-go systems with private capitalisation systems and, of course, they are also compatible with support for the creation of a specific fund investments can offer long-term tax incentives and help to tackle the problem of ageing.</seg>
<seg id=1054>It is therefore the third principle that guides us: the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg id=1055>It should be pointed out that a number of regulatory proposals are currently under discussion, which will help to improve the effectiveness and validity of the Community system and, therefore, I hope, consumer confidence.</seg>
<seg id=1056>However, this relatively low incidence does not justify any kind.</seg>
<seg id=1057>Frankly, I was disappointed that the Prime Minister Jospin does not mention highly positive role played by the Community in recent years in his speech yesterday in.</seg>
<seg id=1058>We must clearly define the reasons for the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1059>The Commission's Food and Veterinary Office has already give the highest priority to control of the Member States in relation to the protection against BSE.</seg>
<seg id=1060>With regard to the safety of animal meal, let me remind you that there is already a wide range of controls aimed at ensuring that the animal meal do not present a risk of transmission of BSE.</seg>
<seg id=1061>Yes, as difficult to believe that may be, it took four years to get a measure which I regard as fundamental to the protection of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1062>Mr President of the Council, I urge the Council to at last be made known its position on the TSE regulation.</seg>
<seg id=1063>In the current situation, the only way to stop the cycle of BSE transmission is completely to ban the use of animal meal.</seg>
<seg id=1064>On this subject, I would like to point out that the liberal group to which I belong tabled an amendment which I hope to see.</seg>
<seg id=1065>The policy must change so that real responsible for this crisis are penalised and that specific decisions may be a first step towards the end of this dramatic crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1066>They would then have to be revised.</seg>
<seg id=1067>The labelling of beef which has been decided, which is a minimum labelling and which has only been in force for two and a half months, does not make it possible to properly remind the origin of the animals and we banned very late specified risk material.</seg>
<seg id=1068>It is essential that the public is fully informed about the characteristics of the outcome of which I speak.</seg>
<seg id=1069>At the time, Mr President of the Council, you did nothing, or almost, such as you have not done anything about the consequences of Chernobyl, nothing about the AIDS epidemic, something made in connection with contaminated blood, always with the same reason: not to panic public opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1070>The French beef ban will cause a huge increase in demand, but the offer is not unlimited and prices will suffer an extremely heavy pressure.</seg>
<seg id=1071>Consumer confidence has been lost, and to curb this phenomenon, it is necessary to extend tests BSE in cattle and sheep.</seg>
<seg id=1072>It is more important to me to go in the direction of the Commission proposal, namely to ensure that animal meal meet the highest safety standards.</seg>
<seg id=1073>For the rest, I agree entirely - just this once - with what my colleagues, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs Grossetête, has said.</seg>
<seg id=1074>Let us go, members of the Council and Commission, you have a large financial basis to follow a strong policy.</seg>
<seg id=1075>The problem should be regulated.</seg>
<seg id=1076>Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased to hear that, in this Chamber, which should at all costs be changed the CAP.</seg>
<seg id=1077>We denounced it, even here, with Jimmy Goldsmith, in its time.</seg>
<seg id=1078>For human consumption must be safe.</seg>
<seg id=1079>I find that France exemplary committed itself to take this step.</seg>
<seg id=1080>But we do not help it!</seg>
<seg id=1081>I am therefore surprised that corpses are still used or processed under these conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1082>The Phillips inquiry into BSE, has just been published in the UK.</seg>
<seg id=1083>I would suggest that the European Commission also apply the precautionary principle with regard to the French beef.</seg>
<seg id=1084>We need to know today, since we are still in uncertainty, which are the scientific data, which are the measures to be taken.</seg>
<seg id=1085>Furthermore, I have, of course, all these proposals, I am not insensitive.</seg>
<seg id=1086>If European citizens tell me that the legislation properly or has not been fully implemented, then we will have perhaps - the issue, but not for scientific reasons he will have to be made because the legislation have not been respected in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1087>The best way of not hearing us, it is not to recommend us.</seg>
<seg id=1088>The Commission considers that the first readmission agreements currently being negotiated with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco play an important role in the clarification and coordination of these policies.</seg>
<seg id=1089>What proposals does the Commission do in the matter on the basis of Article 31 of the Union?</seg>
<seg id=1090>(The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=1091>During this period, the aim was to reduce the deficit in order to obtain more appropriate monetary policy, lower interest rates and greater growth.</seg>
<seg id=1092>I always say that the euro will not be introduced on 1 January 2002, but it is already in our pocket; we do it with separate good-humoured currencies, but now we have it in our pockets.</seg>
<seg id=1093>The ozone limits laid down in Directive 92 / 72 were not exceeded in the capital, but it should be noted that no action was taken in the middle of the summer.</seg>
<seg id=1094>Subject: State aid to the audiovisual sector at a seminar of the French Presidency devoted to culture industries, a representative of the Directorate-General for Competition in the European Commission estimated that the legal requirements of investment imposed on the chains constituted state aid by the very fact that such investments have been made mandatory by the legislator.</seg>
<seg id=1095>It must be respected and protected ’.</seg>
<seg id=1096>However, it is not self-evident, since this new growth is very unequal and can be accompanied, as we have seen in the United States for ten years, persistent phenomena of insecurity, social exclusion, poverty, urban ghettoisation.</seg>
<seg id=1097>The governments of the Member States refused to accept this definition, which is a little too simple and too vague.</seg>
<seg id=1098>And in the difficult climate which results from it, more and more people are not in any more, are sidelined and excluded.</seg>
<seg id=1099>Mr President, we often hear in this House, like a tune, the glorification of the European social model, the social market economy, which opposes with pride – both believe it – to the wild model of the United States of America.</seg>
<seg id=1100>(technical)</seg>
<seg id=1101>It is an enormous figure.</seg>
<seg id=1102>Furthermore, in fact the political levels must be involved.</seg>
<seg id=1103>I support the need for knowledge of the causes of poverty, I support the preventive action against exclusion as mergers, industrial change, relocations, rural desertification, urban hyperconcentration, using innovative and practical responses, involving the social partners, local and national governments as well as the joint action of the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1104>This has been a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and on the role of the social and structural reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1105>It is a formal problem due to the fact that, in the Treaty, it is only refers to social exclusion and not to poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1106>I believe that these proposals are a pragmatic response to your request.</seg>
<seg id=1107>However, an approval of the overall strategy in detail does not necessarily mean an approval of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1108>If we create a clear and binding framework for the Member States, the various systems have to meet these requirements should have a longer period of put to the test.</seg>
<seg id=1109>Renewable energy will not the panacea for solving this problem, but nobody doubts that they will be able to make a good thing to alleviate it, diversify our sources of energy and to reduce our dependence on oil, which furthermore would not bother us at all.</seg>
<seg id=1110>I will come back here on three of our demands.</seg>
<seg id=1111>To define realistic objectives can only strengthen the confidence of the citizen in the energy policy to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id=1112>I believe that a strong renewable energy policy is a symbol for the future of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1113>Finally, the European countries must prove through these agreements which they will help to achieve the Kyoto objectives.</seg>
<seg id=1114>It seems to me unfortunate to exclude any category of waste which can contribute to the overall production of energy from waste – that is for projects of small-scale or within the framework of a more general calculation.</seg>
<seg id=1115>The training of peat mass by dioxide and in the production of wood fuel is comparable to that of other biomassbased.</seg>
<seg id=1116>Finally, I should like to inform Mr Chichester that with broad of my region, there is already well advanced project of windmills and that this is promising. So I invite him to come to see for itself.</seg>
<seg id=1117>The debate on the renunciation of nuclear power in Sweden and Germany, for example, has shown that, without environmentally friendly and competitive possible alternative energies, the debate turns this brief is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=1118>That is why the Member States must impose binding targets.</seg>
<seg id=1119>I am therefore optimistic about the future potential of renewable energy as far as the appropriate incentives are in place.</seg>
<seg id=1120>I believe that a lot needs courage to give renewable energy the place it deserves.</seg>
<seg id=1121>There is no doubt that a very large oil price rises more stark presents us with the problems of our energy dependence on fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id=1122>Therefore, we cannot accept Amendment No 28.</seg>
<seg id=1123>However, in doing so, the Commission does not forget that the terms used are not prejudge its right of initiative and that they must be compatible with the single electricity market.</seg>
<seg id=1124>On 26 participants, the national Commission of reconciliation of Tajikistan has only one woman, when the country has 25,000 widows.</seg>
<seg id=1125>Studies show that the presence of women in the ranks of the peace-keeping forces the peace of the United Nations, despite the limited number of better relations with the local people and the moral general of those.</seg>
<seg id=1126>The Theorin report deals with this subject in detail and contains many attacks which we call, as a Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, to remove in order to prepare an official document.</seg>
<seg id=1127>From a political point of view, I see in Amendment No 19 a failure or a tactical fall rather than a compromise in terms of content, which should in any case be unworthy of female cause.</seg>
<seg id=1128>They have been held prisoner.</seg>
<seg id=1129>Then a Portuguese example, where the doors of diplomacy open to women only after the ‘ revolution in April 1974 'US Ambassador to Indonesia, Mrs Anna Gomes, showed recently in West Timor, the role of a woman and its awareness of the problems and the suffering of the people, who addressed only 25 years a long fight for freedom, can be accepted by everyone, and particularly by the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1130>Very few Member States have done to date, tells me that there are two or three of them.</seg>
<seg id=1131>That is why we must also, in future, to take account of this dimension in the development of the European Union ’ s policies.</seg>
<seg id=1132>Unfortunately, the report does not define this, any more than it does not distinguish.</seg>
<seg id=1133>Please pass on our protest to the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1134>They have different experiences, which is essential to the way in which the policy is exercised, especially when it comes to handle crises.</seg>
<seg id=1135>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1136>I now come to the second point: if we want to regulate the sector, it is obviously necessary to examine a number of points.</seg>
<seg id=1137>Last week, I discovered an interest both on the part of the international trade union media as a number of trade unions.</seg>
<seg id=1138>Second objection. You are therefore in favour of the payment of salaries for housewives?</seg>
<seg id=1139>All those who are currently working on the black would get jobs under decent social conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1140>Furthermore, this project also enabled two to three families to come together to create a job of domestic aid together.</seg>
<seg id=1141>We were meeting in plenary session in the first October part-session, when we learned at the time of our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia, the courageous reaction of the Serbian people and immediately, you will remember, ladies and gentlemen, we have asked for the lifting of international sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=1142>In doing so, Europe has shown the vitality of its civilisation in the history of the world and a creative political power forward-looking.</seg>
<seg id=1143>There can be no doubt about the fact that the status of Kosovo is a democratic issue.</seg>
<seg id=1144>Furthermore, we would like to be able to demonstrate in Europe which we are able to develop only the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia, recognising the true democratic principles.</seg>
<seg id=1145>I must say that I – by hearing you - was very impressed by your control of a difficult situation Oh yes how, at the same time as by your determination.</seg>
<seg id=1146>It will be done in the next few minutes, Mr Watson.</seg>
<seg id=1147>Access to documents and information on the activities of the institutions enables citizens to put the European Union's bodies face up to their responsibilities and stimulates also mean greater efficiency.</seg>
<seg id=1148>A fifth important amendment, in my opinion, is that on the annual report which should particularly deal with documents having to remain secret, or at least that is still secret.</seg>
<seg id=1149>It is not clear on this point, and it is not impossible that can also remain in force more restrictive measures, especially on this point than we tabled amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1150>The Committee on Foreign Affairs, for its part, is opposed to the idea that the document on issues of foreign and security policy should be an automatic and comprehensive, an exception to this rule of public access to documents.</seg>
<seg id=1151>If we want the people really can defend their rights, these places of information require well-trained staff who are to some extent taken by hand people in search of information and which is used to them as guides within the complex labyrinth of the institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1152>These are essential if we want to prevent the so-called transparency is more than just a transparency for insiders.</seg>
<seg id=1153>We should be pleased that Parliament has succeeded in bringing together a large majority in favour of greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id=1154>Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1155>Mr President, openness and transparency within the European Union are not presented in a favourable light.</seg>
<seg id=1156>If that is the case, then it would be a bad calculation, they are the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens who are involved.</seg>
<seg id=1157>The concept of documents takes many forms nowadays and we will ensure that access is the broadest possible for the greatest possible number of documents and for the many different types of documents.</seg>
<seg id=1158>Mr President, we can see the Commission's position in terms of public access to documents by reading the internal manual which was given on 11 October, with the Commission officials in order to explain the way in which they were to deal with the requests from the Members with regard to access to documents.</seg>
<seg id=1159>This point of the regulation should be abolished or at least be supplemented by an obligation to take account of the interests at stake.</seg>
<seg id=1160>The old models of international cooperation with all their old habits and rules of the game diplomatic where all take place behind closed doors are no longer required in modern form of cooperation that has become the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1161>We do not need to confuse this objective and the role of Parliament, nor with future interinstitutional agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1162>I consider that a step forward has been taken towards the possibility of citizens to exercise their right to information and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1163>It is not the only one that I thank you, Mrs Maij-Weggen, itself of the PPE-DE Group, and who through the enhanced Hughes procedure is the second author of the report, also deserves warm thanks.</seg>
<seg id=1164>Transparency must become the cornerstone of all the activities of the European Union, but the right of access to documents is not enough in itself to make transparency a reality.</seg>
<seg id=1165>The European Parliament has asked for the European security and defence policy is in future integrated into the structures of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1166>In his speech before Parliament, on 3 October, President Prodi referred to the institutional triangle and pointed out that, in a European system based on checks and balances, the flexibility of the operation of each institution has contributed to the common interest.</seg>
<seg id=1167>I must admit that the challenge of this regulation is to give a precise definition of the documents.</seg>
<seg id=1168>I would like to stress that the Commission could, at the right time, almost all the amendments, such as the amendments 9,18 and 21 in part, and Amendments 23,25,26.1,28 F, 35,38,40.1,40.6,41.1,42,43.1,47,49 and 52.</seg>
<seg id=1169>I would like to vote sometimes in favour of the proposals made by the Commission, and that is why it is necessary that the Members have the list of amendments which the Commission can support and that of the amendments that she does not want to support.</seg>
<seg id=1170>Capital of banks</seg>
<seg id=1171>Finally, and this is a subject more controversial, the Commission invited vigorously to use the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1172>These amendments replace various proposals in the report, which will probably be rejected at the time of the vote and which will therefore be replaced by new amendments from this consensus.</seg>
<seg id=1173>Mr President, in the light of the excellent vote of support which this report has received, and given the answer from the Commission this morning, it is obvious - with all the parties on which we voted - on the basis of Article 69 (2), we should postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution, in order to enable us to start fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1174>Mr President, I am sorry to have said that the PPE-DE Group had also hoped that the vote was postponed tonight, but it is you, Mr the coordinator, who told me that you have preferred that the issue is postponed until the second November part-session, rather than to vote this evening.</seg>
<seg id=1175>The reason why I would suggest that we postpone the vote is – as Mr Goebbels – that this is a very important issue.</seg>
<seg id=1176>I do not know how many costs the roll-call vote, but they are certainly hundreds of thousands of francs, or Belgian francs, our budget.</seg>
<seg id=1177>I know that in France, the principle of the slaughter of whole herds was applied and that does not seem to be the best way to combat this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id=1178>To remove the animal meal in animal feed, not only that of cattle and sheep, but also of pigs, poultry, fish;</seg>
<seg id=1179>That is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1180>It is with regulations such as those that consumers will be reassured and that farmers will hear the message of solidarity that we want to convey to them.</seg>
<seg id=1181>It is necessary to go further from any urgency, it is necessary to change the common agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=1182>The ban on the use of animal meal in animal feed is only the first step in this way.</seg>
<seg id=1183>We regret that, on the other hand, that the amendments tabled by our Group were not adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1184>I think it would be logical that the working hours of those who work in polluting companies is reduced.</seg>
<seg id=1185>I will end by insisting once again that the generalisation of the exploitation of hazardous waste must not lead us to adapt to the production of such waste.</seg>
<seg id=1186>Indeed, if the pensions, for example, have been less poor, there would be less poor.</seg>
<seg id=1187>The report considers an envelope of EUR 100 million over five years to reduce poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1188>I fully support the proposal to implement a Luxembourg process (a) in the field of social exclusion, comprising guidelines and national action plans.</seg>
<seg id=1189>Indeed, the report calls for the establishment of qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1190>By submitting its proposal programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission responds to the appeal made by the Council to present 'by in June 2000' a 'initiative of cooperation in this field'.</seg>
<seg id=1191>Mr President, I abstained on a very specific reason: in my opinion, this report does not do, from an environmental point of view, progress which I hoped for and wanted.</seg>
<seg id=1192>I hope that such a system should be extended to all the cities of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1193>Some proposals of the European Parliament are unrealistic and cannot receive my support.</seg>
<seg id=1194>We must also succeed in future make better to know the best existing practice.</seg>
<seg id=1195>The relevant high wages of the environment are being offered the opportunity, in a free market, voluntarily to contribute to a cleaner energy, while for others, everything as before.</seg>
<seg id=1196>The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1197>These three reasons for this are as follows: firstly, because it is flourishing in the direction of the process of consolidating democracy and the strengthening of the requirement of respect for human rights, particularly with regard to the indigenous peoples.</seg>
<seg id=1198>Mr President, in this debate, we wish to express, as well as the other Members who spoke before me, solidarity and support of this House for the Central American Parliament, at a time when we are fighting for remains the priority within the framework of the European Union's external relations with the countries of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=1199>I do not challenge the reservations which could express our colleague and dear friend, the chairman of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, Mr Seguro, with regard to the issue of human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1200>Finally, in its dialogue with the authorities of Central America, the Commission is once again insisting on the importance which must be given to the process of regional integration, as an instrument for the consolidation of democracy and the development of the region.</seg>
<seg id=1201>To hold on to power, he did not hesitate to take nagging debate on ‘ the Ivorian ', causing an outbreak of xenophobia: hatred of the other, abroad, Burkinan or of the Malian, and yet there are many with living and working on the ground of Côte d'Ivoire for many years.</seg>
<seg id=1202>The introduction of a real democracy in Côte d'Ivoire cannot now be done without the establishment of an independent committee of inquiry on the crimes committed and without formal commitment to respect human rights and civil peace.</seg>
<seg id=1203>Some believe that the importance of democracy is relative when it comes to Africa, that they are complex procedures, that we must move away from time to time, but, I believe that there can be no compromise with democracy and the question which is raised today for Côte d'Ivoire is the same as that which is asking for example Guinea, where we know today that there are people who are imprisoned and that there is no democratic system.</seg>
<seg id=1204>I will conclude with the following: the dictatorships are not created, Mr President, that there are people who are suffering from poverty, which does not have access to knowledge, which do not have access to information.</seg>
<seg id=1205>It would be illogical that the European Union now needs new presidential elections in which all the candidates will this time take part.</seg>
<seg id=1206>In many parts of Africa, we are faced with ethnic and religious mixings very different.</seg>
<seg id=1207>These elections must allow the representation, at national level, of the political parties that have been excluded during the presidential election and compensate, therefore, even if only partially, the inadequacy of this first election.</seg>
<seg id=1208>On the situation in Burma.</seg>
<seg id=1209>The authorities have a major offensive against the Karen people and Shan, and as the rapporteur pointed out of the United Nations, there is no sign of dialogue between the sdpc and the NLD.</seg>
<seg id=1210>That is why we reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1211>I hope that by giving an urgent and priority to this issue, Parliament sends a clear message to the people of Burma, meaning that its plight is not forgotten, they are aware of the fact that in Burma, things worse rather than we do not improve, and we are determined to try to change the course of events.</seg>
<seg id=1212>It took a long time.</seg>
<seg id=1213>In Asia, there is a risk that the economic and political reforms are decoupled, that a liberalisation and economic progress can be achieved without liberalisation of the political sector and strengthening the rule of law, although I am of the opinion that, in the long term, the absence of the rule of law harms, trade, aid and investment.</seg>
<seg id=1214>Mr President, I can agree with the previous speakers on many key points, because much of what is happening in Vietnam today are unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1215>However, the Human Rights Watch publication, which Mr Swoboda mentioned, says that Vietnam recently made some effort to improve her situation from the point of view of human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1216>These extremely confidential documents are looking forward to us on the wings of the policy pursued by the Vietnamese authorities.</seg>
<seg id=1217>The Commission is still convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation can only be achieved through a dialogue between the military regime, the elected democratic opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg id=1218>The Vietnamese authorities also clear exert pressure on the press in the country so that it adopts a regime of self-censorship.</seg>
<seg id=1219>The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1220>We also urge the EU to assist and support, not only in the south-east of England, but also with all the other regions.</seg>
<seg id=1221>I ask you all to support our resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1222>It is urgent that the European Union stops being limited to exceptional speeches when the disasters arrived.</seg>
<seg id=1223>The Commission has taken two initiatives in this.</seg>
<seg id=1224>Mr President, a purely linguistic error of order has crept in one of the amendments to the joint resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1225>A postponement of the vote would mean postponing the mission entrusted to the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1226>(Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1227>The report is based on the observation that an ever increasing proportion of health insurance in Europe is covered by systems of supplementary sickness insurance.</seg>
<seg id=1228>I find it a little strange to want as of now forcing the Commission to a motion for a resolution and to ask him at the same time to draw up a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and supplementary sickness insurance.</seg>
<seg id=1229>At a time when the ageing of the population is well aware, it is essential that we try to improve the health care system in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1230>We cannot of course ensure that.</seg>
<seg id=1231>Mr President, there are compelling arguments in favour of the fast-track procedure for the implementation of the review of Basel on the capital adequacy.</seg>
<seg id=1232>As for the sense of urgency that Mrs Villiers added to the feeling of the need for the Commission using its wish for an accelerated procedure for the adoption of these measures, we are forced to note that the rapporteur himself acknowledges that this new regulation will have no influence on anti-competitive practices which, unfortunately, alas, are prevalent in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1233>We must also ensure that the decisions taken in Basle do not result in an increase in capital requirements, a second disadvantage for banks.</seg>
<seg id=1234>Having said that, I believe, and I would like to stress, that economic operators are also satisfied, an approach which is given to these regulations on capital, which strengthen the issues related to the risk.</seg>
<seg id=1235>These are some ideas on how we might achieve a swift legislative process, verifiable and effective within the framework of the current provisions of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1236>Indeed, it is time to recognise that the institution of the European Ombudsman 'sufficiently lived and that it has already given sufficient proof of their maturity to have its own budget.</seg>
<seg id=1237>The PPE-DE Group supports the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, have joined it to say that the powers of the Ombudsman must be extended, and that the sooner the better, particularly in the field of investigative powers of the Ombudsman as laid down in Article 3 of the decision of 1994.</seg>
<seg id=1238>An Ombudsman, of course, be subject to the rules of confidentiality, but for the citizens, it is good to know that or that occupy the position can have access to documents to them, as people do not have access.</seg>
<seg id=1239>The tabled report therefore had the aim of the recommendation by the Ombudsman to the Commission to allow the candidates and the candidates competitions organised by it to consult their corrected papers.</seg>
<seg id=1240>We believe that the Community institutions should carry out their recruitment of staff, in the same way that all recruitment procedures, with a maximum of openness and transparency, in order to avoid any suspicion of partiality, injustice or administrative incompetence.</seg>
<seg id=1241>I refer to an amendment on the requirement of the indisputable proof of the course of an oral tests, for example.</seg>
<seg id=1242>Mr Bösch explained here briefly to the amendments to the report.</seg>
<seg id=1243>I have two questions for the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal competition, and I received its share of the detailed and precise answers.</seg>
<seg id=1244>This is the beginning of a process of openness and transparency in the form of government.</seg>
<seg id=1245>Firstly, the correction of examinations organised by the Commission are always made anonymously.</seg>
<seg id=1246>It is, of course, July 2000.</seg>
<seg id=1247>Votes</seg>
<seg id=1248>(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)</seg>
<seg id=1249>(DE) during the evaluation of the own funds directive of credit institutions must be scrupulously to consider several interests which are in conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1250>Then came the idea of a European police college for the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=1251>It is the position defended by the rapporteur and shared by the European People's Party.</seg>
<seg id=1252>The social situation in most Member States of the European Union is currently of this nature that the need for cross-border cooperation between the various police is indeed important.</seg>
<seg id=1253>Most of the speakers so far seem to think that it is essential that the College has a permanent seat.</seg>
<seg id=1254>The umpteenth provisional decision, but nonprecarious, small present which the Council used to do in this House.</seg>
<seg id=1255>The rapporteur would like to see more crime prevention, of aid, innovative developments and border surveillance and also wants to change the internal security in order to include respect for law and order.</seg>
<seg id=1256>This was the ideals that they have presented to us and it was the kind of State there for which they type.</seg>
<seg id=1257>I would be in favour of a balance of the standards in certain Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1258>Since the first thoughts on this issue, which took place at European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission committed itself in relation to the Member States to promote an action intended to develop what we could describe as a European Commissioner culture, based on the highest standards of ethics, respect for human rights and freedoms, and effectiveness in the fight against crime.</seg>
<seg id=1259>It addresses rather for the development of a police college is mainly from the intergovernmental point of view.</seg>
<seg id=1260>For the reasons outlined above, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will vote against the report.</seg>
<seg id=1261>- (SV) I have voted against the report on the provisional establishment of the European police college.</seg>
<seg id=1262>It is clear that many of our courts are very slow and cumbersome and that it is very difficult for them to act quickly to these problems.</seg>
<seg id=1263>Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, the fact that there is linked to the Brussels II regulation which excludes children whose parents are in divorce pending, as well as children conceived of wedlock.</seg>
<seg id=1264>My mother had such a divorce and removal 85 years ago and it always talks about it.</seg>
<seg id=1265>I would therefore like to say to Parliament that, in the action plan on mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters, which we hope will be adopted before the end of this year, the Commission proposes that the first and the main priority is given to extending the scope of the regulation of Brussels, and hence of this legislation on the right of access to cover indiscriminately children from married couples and children from unmarried couples.</seg>
<seg id=1266>We shall now proceed to the vote</seg>
<seg id=1267>Nowadays, sport - it must be said - is closely linked to other economic sectors such as audiovisual industry or promotion and sales sportspeople.</seg>
<seg id=1268>What we need is an intelligent and flexible way to interpret the existing rules.</seg>
<seg id=1269>In other words, a genuine attack on democracy, even if we avoid looking at things from this point of view.</seg>
<seg id=1270>The Commission therefore shortly expects to receive an answer to his request detailed information on the measures proposed by the British Government.</seg>
<seg id=1271>The proposal was initiated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a statement before the examination of the budget, six months before the declaration of total budget spring 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1272>Again, I think that what Mr Simpson said was really used to reassure us with regard to the probable intentions of the British Government.</seg>
<seg id=1273>The congestion make us lose not only much time, but they are a problem for the whole of the environment and I therefore believe that if the British Government commits because the funds required for solving these problems, it is for the benefit of everybody and in particular of all European citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1274>We are more or less the only oil producers in the European Union and yet we are faced with the prices of high petrol and diesel of all the countries of Europe - the GBP 1.20 per litre of diesel fuel in the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id=1275>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1276>The European Parliament must tell them that it is their side, and I propose that, once again, to observe a minute's silence expressing our solidarity and emotion.</seg>
<seg id=1277>Madam President, it is to fully support it, since I am one of those who asked for the inclusion of this.</seg>
<seg id=1278>We have made good progress.</seg>
<seg id=1279>The Union will deepen its relations with all the groups and, as soon as possible, will also make contact with the new American administration.</seg>
<seg id=1280>Given the surprisingly brilliant report by Mr Prescott on how he had negotiated itself, how do we not only Mrs Voynet, but also, I believe, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, most of the other European Ministers for the Environment rejected that?</seg>
<seg id=1281>What can be fear is that the momentum is not lost, that the US negotiators do not change and that all is not to be relaunched in May.</seg>
<seg id=1282>This time, in fact the forests proved to be the main stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id=1283>If this warming continues, part of the territory of the countries of the European Union will be processed at sea or in the desert.</seg>
<seg id=1284>The standard of living is raised there and the price of low oil products.</seg>
<seg id=1285>I would like to congratulate Commissioner Wallström on the effort he has made to the Hague and wants to have more chance.</seg>
<seg id=1286>Certainly, it was not to have an agreement better than to have an agreement which is wrong and, in this case, the American proposal was a proposal to the reduction, totally unacceptable for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1287>The climate changes have important consequences in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=1288>I repeat this idea in his English wording: forest turns from being carbon dark to carbon sources.</seg>
<seg id=1289>Only this credibility will enable the European Union to direct the speech and the action of the COP 'B' in Bonn.</seg>
<seg id=1290>We must make our own evaluation what has happened and to prepare the documents for the contacts to be established with various parties and, obviously, with the ‘ umbrella group '.</seg>
<seg id=1291>Of course, the continuation of the forthcoming COP or the continuation of the COP will ratify the agreement in the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1292>Before the European Council, we will keep next Sunday, Pierre Moscovici and myself, a ministerial conclave, in which I asked Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, as well as a session of the IGC, on Monday at the General Affairs Council.</seg>
<seg id=1293>The minimum number of participating Member States should be set at eight while the clause of appeal to the European Council, which is currently a genuine right of veto, should be replaced by a right of recall.</seg>
<seg id=1294>We may regret this, but I am obliged to make this report.</seg>
<seg id=1295>The European Council will also discuss the progress of the accession negotiations, and therefore of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1296>The Lisbon European Council had approved guidelines to promote innovative and competitive European economy.</seg>
<seg id=1297>Consumer protection is a growing concern of Europeans, for obvious reasons that I do not need to develop.</seg>
<seg id=1298>We must be prepared for this huge enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1299>That is, in the final analysis, the yardstick by which we will have to judge the Nice Summit.</seg>
<seg id=1300>(Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1301>The first is that the candidate countries to adopt and implement the acquis; it is the task that they share with us.</seg>
<seg id=1302>We are deeply attached to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we do not just want to say so.</seg>
<seg id=1303>Admittedly, the text could have been better, and it will be possible to improve it and make it after Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1304>I find it simply unacceptable that several governments purely and simply swept table the issue of the insertion of a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1305>You do not even want to incorporate it into the Treaty, which shows that this text was to be put to one side.</seg>
<seg id=1306>We will speak with one voice grace within the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1307>Given the gloomy prospects of success of the Intergovernmental Conference, I believe that it would not be appropriate to add to the agenda this complex and controversial issue.</seg>
<seg id=1308>I appeal urgently to the French Presidency to do everything in its power to fulfil this particularly destructive gap.</seg>
<seg id=1309>The Commission, trade policy, drew up a proposal which must be considered.</seg>
<seg id=1310>Although the previous Treaty made some progress in the field of the extension of the formula, it also introduced this senseless formula of accompanied by codecision of unanimity for citizenship, social security, the rights of self-employed people and also of cultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=1311>The simple fact that this issue is put in itself shows clearly the absence of a policy of strengthening the links of mutual trust between the countries which make up the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1312>It is precisely in this situation that the Intergovernmental Conference bogged down for months, because nobody wants to abandon his toy.</seg>
<seg id=1313>The experience of this year which leads us to say that the developments to be given – after Nice, looking to the future of Europe – to the process of constitutionalisation of the Union should not be entrusted to the old method now of confidential negotiations between representatives of the governments.</seg>
<seg id=1314>If the majority does not become the rule, the decision-making process will be bogged inevitably, as has just pointed out precisely to Mr Prodi.</seg>
<seg id=1315>If this aspect of subsidiarity is very important, did not hear in the debate we are talking about today.</seg>
<seg id=1316>That is what we did, the 1995 enlargement was adopted, we have moved to the think-tank headed wisely by Carlos westerdorp, Amsterdam did, today we are on the eve of the Nice Conference and the situation has hardly develop, Mr President: we return to the institutional issues, without finding a solution which allows us to complete an ambitious task, I want to talk about enlargement to 27.</seg>
<seg id=1317>Let us not add to disappointment that will result in Nice, so naturally the Council appears to be unsuccessful, great disappointment that this House would cause among the people.</seg>
<seg id=1318>In the past, we have proved that it is possible to achieve this objective and, coming from a Member State which benefited from a project of transitional towards accession, I sincerely hope that we will arrive at an enlarged and peaceful Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1319>But it must be understood that, if you have the right of veto, all the others have too.</seg>
<seg id=1320>But it will be necessary to hold a first transition for the elections in 2004 because a number of new Member States will join before or during this legislature that will come up to 2009.</seg>
<seg id=1321>The President of the Council raised the question of closer cooperation and he said that we have made progress towards a consensus on this issue.</seg>
<seg id=1322>Mr President, first of all, Nice is on the necessary reforms and the leftovers from the point of view of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1323>If we had had this only some of the features of this mentality, if we insist on fewer things go badly on our continent and a little more on the things that are well, we would be rather happier than at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=1324>We should not only extension of qualified majority voting in force in the Council of Ministers to goods transport, we must include the services, investment and intellectual property competition related and therefore adapt Article 133 (1) of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1325>Indeed, the granting of such a right to the European Parliament would also give free rein to the arbitrary nature of the policy of party on this sensitive issue ultra.</seg>
<seg id=1326>So it is also necessary, as you said, referring to American optimism and for the way in which the Americans speak for themselves, we must also be able to develop what is and what progress.</seg>
<seg id=1327>I would also like to say that I do not believe that there is a problem between large and small countries.</seg>
<seg id=1328>We have worked hard, but we encounter this long-standing problem, and I do not believe that the process may be initiated by the movement of one country, because we encounter realities, once again, national policies, democratic, very strong in Twelve of the 15 countries.</seg>
<seg id=1329>Finally, Mr Védrine, you raised a situation perhaps too tense and spoke of a certain pessimism.</seg>
<seg id=1330>Generally, could you take measures to strengthen safety so that such events cannot happen?</seg>
<seg id=1331>I believe that we must take measures that we have never been so far, so that the guests of this House feel that as hosts, and do not have to fear threats.</seg>
<seg id=1332>Here, hospitality hospitality and respect there.</seg>
<seg id=1333>I would like to thank you for your contribution, Mr Tajani.</seg>
<seg id=1334>The best tribute to Ernest dialogue and his memory would be to respect its message – dìaleg as a catalan. can we all give its chance to the Basque country?</seg>
<seg id=1335>Of course, on the other hand, everyone can express its opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1336>B5-0550 / 2000 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Council, on the political situation and the humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=1337>When I speak of organisation, I also believe that the European Union are making great efforts and which, in my opinion, needs to be able to take responsibility for it.</seg>
<seg id=1338>Secondly, you will see in the resolution the clear will of Parliament to put back the security and defence policy on two pillars: the balanced civil crisis management and, in the event of failure, military management, the two pillars are complementary.</seg>
<seg id=1339>Mr President, given the delay which has been taken and my obligations, then, I will try to shorten rather the speech I had prepared.</seg>
<seg id=1340>These relations in particular will take the form of meetings between the North Atlantic Council and the copsi, and meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European countries candidates and / or allies.</seg>
<seg id=1341>Take, for example, what has happened in the Balkans, where we can say that everyone has played its part fully.</seg>
<seg id=1342>We also during this time held very informed the United States of developments are taking place under the European security and defence policy, which is a sine qua non to develop harmoniously, as is currently the case.</seg>
<seg id=1343>The second edition of the European Union ’ s annual report on human rights was presented to the European Parliament a forum on human rights will be held in Paris on 13 December.</seg>
<seg id=1344>This policy, as you say, not as an ambition to compete with the Atlantic Alliance, which is still today on the basis of the collective defence of its members, or to set up a permanent European army.</seg>
<seg id=1345>Furthermore, if I mentioned the figure of 100 000 soldiers, this does not mean that we aim to exceed the objective set at Helsinki, but we have a reserve in qualifications and other specialities which makes it possible to ensure that the 60 000 men of the objective of the Council would be achieved, whatever the operating conditions of their jobs.</seg>
<seg id=1346>Allow me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few words about the major political direction, approved by most of our public opinions, of this new task which Europe a tool of political influence he buys missed.</seg>
<seg id=1347>The problem we are now faced with is to ensure that, when we talk to consolidate the liberal democracy in Europe, we think of the entire continent of Europe, because that is the purpose of enlargement and the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=1348>We need to incorporate into a coherent whole three distinct elements: the Community policies, the CFSP (including the ESDP) and the action of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1349>In spite of our loud procedures, we do not need a force of 60 000 men to meet our objectives.</seg>
<seg id=1350>It is therefore urgently required to set up a solution of humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id=1351>I do not agree with the cynics which says that Europe is therefore certainly provide itself with an unsuitable toys, it is true that, in many cases, the rapid reaction force could not be mobilised directly.</seg>
<seg id=1352>The EU should not have its own defence with fixed staff.</seg>
<seg id=1353>To conclude, I will express concern that the members of my group and I feel in relation to the continuing deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan; I would like to urge the Commission and the Council to make every effort, to intensify efforts to achieve a peaceful and come to the aid of civilian populations, especially now, with winter approaching.</seg>
<seg id=1354>To put it very simply: where, when and under what conditions the European rapid reaction force will have to take action in the future?</seg>
<seg id=1355>It makes it possible to understand the appalling toll of these two months of Intifada: 270 dead, most Palestinian, and nearly 10 000 injured, often handicapped for life.</seg>
<seg id=1356>Hence his untiring efforts to establish an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction cannot depressing one any longer.</seg>
<seg id=1357>Secondly, contrary to what the previous speaker, I do not know whether it is possible and desirable that the European Union is doing more than it did not have to deal with the conflict and the escalation of violence in the Middle East, especially now, in this transitional period which the USA is experiencing.</seg>
<seg id=1358>Mr President, in my speech I shall focus on the report by Mrs Lalumière report, which I find formulated well thought-out and clearly.</seg>
<seg id=1359>But there is no political concept and there is still no real of common foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=1360>The only problem for the EU is that up to now it has not managed to obtain the interests of public opinion for this type of action, despite the fact that they are considerably more sustainable and more effective.</seg>
<seg id=1361>Mr President, it is still, of course, the budget and the question of how to distribute it.</seg>
<seg id=1362>I say this in spite of mass apparent guarantees which miraculously miraculously were made on the subject over the last few days.</seg>
<seg id=1363>For the time being, this power is seriously lacking to us and it will be necessary, at the end of the day, that the Member States consider their programmes of defence spending which differ greatly from one country to another.</seg>
<seg id=1364>Even those who question the usefulness, which could result from a decision as to create a European army so-called must consider the important political aspect of this decision and its influence on the cohesion of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1365>The presence of a Defence Minister for the first time in this House is such an historic event that we reserved the night sitting to you that our Members are not impressed too.</seg>
<seg id=1366>For all these conflicts, a non-military crisis management for prevention is better than a military management.</seg>
<seg id=1367>Is Russia want, in the long term, to stay together with an undemocratic regime?</seg>
<seg id=1368>Therefore, Europe will not be a new alliance, as I wanted to mention, I believe, by an incompletely informed development.</seg>
<seg id=1369>I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure, to wind up this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1370>Given the scale of the task, four committees were concerned and a new procedure was introduced, with four parallel reports.</seg>
<seg id=1371>All the measures proposed in the White Paper must contribute to modernise and make effective all the operation of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1372>It would therefore be appropriate for reform is an opportunity to limit their intervention in the only areas which do not involve an expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1373>The differences of opinion have arisen are not only political in nature, but even more reflect the cultural differences between the Fifteen.</seg>
<seg id=1374>The new internal audit service, under your direct responsibility, Mr Kinnock, the Vice-President responsible for reform, will have the main aims of the analysis of the functioning of the internal control systems which exist within the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1375>It was a pleasure to work together, and I believe that the fact that we were all four of them involved deepened and enriched the treatment by a fundamental reform of the Commission reform, which is essential for the future of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1376>They can expect to be transferred to other EU institutions, to be seconded national governments or working in the private sector.</seg>
<seg id=1377>Also, our constitutional Commission recalls that its commitment to a strong, independent, effective, transparent Commission and politically responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1378>As the Committee on Budgets, we consider that the activity-based budgeting, problem because of the lack of visibility of expenditure and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=1379>This will mark, in a clear way, the goodwill of this House with regard to the implementation of this reform with the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1380>Mr President, allow me first of all to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1381>It is a disgrace when it is believed that the European Union has set itself up as a champion modernisation of economic life.</seg>
<seg id=1382>Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteurs to support the work of the Commission, it has failed to come a global and coherent response from the Committee of Independent Experts, which is intended to respond to a policy of management and not only for better management of the institution.</seg>
<seg id=1383>This change in attitude must result in a transparency in the administration.</seg>
<seg id=1384>In my view, there is no structure whose importance is greater are fifteen nations, tomorrow twenty or more, a whole continent, the part of the world ’ s most industrialised, who live in the Union and, with it, the Commission and its structures.</seg>
<seg id=1385>The change is never easy.</seg>
<seg id=1386>In so doing, however, the Socialist Group believes that the current functioning of Community public administration is more effective.</seg>
<seg id=1387>The result is known and comes in the dedication and the competence of the majority of the elements of the Commission and its administration.</seg>
<seg id=1388>Many thousands of requests for projects expect an evaluation for over a year.</seg>
<seg id=1389>The debate, as we have seen, does not relate both to the principles, objectives or the appropriateness of the reform of the procedures, the pace, the timetable, the possible malfunctions or unwanted consequences of its implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1390>I would like to begin by informing the House - as pointed out by Mr van Hulten earlier – that the meeting of the College of this morning adopted the proposal for an interinstitutional agreement establishing an advisory committee on the rules governing public life, such that it sets out action 1 of the action plan of the White Paper.</seg>
<seg id=1391>I think that Mr van Hulten again insisted on this during the debate.</seg>
<seg id=1392>The main aim of this revision is to simplify the procedures, to increase transparency and improve the budgetary rules, which will in practice result in a reduction in the number of exceptions and special arrangements incomprehensible and, consequently, greater efficiency in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg id=1393>It is not very economic for the Commission that the texts provide a regulation 20% at cost X and 30% of the costs y and that there is then regrouping and verification of the documents in proof for small amounts.</seg>
<seg id=1394>The next item is the report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations [2000 / 2051 (INI)].</seg>
<seg id=1395>These aspects affect NGOs in.</seg>
<seg id=1396>Of course, that is not enough, but it has put us in spite of the shelter cartoons on the weakness of our development aid.</seg>
<seg id=1397>We will return to it, because that is in itself a framework of quality.</seg>
<seg id=1398>Mr President, I returned today of Mozambique, where the European Union has provided humanitarian aid high-quality following the floods, but the reconstruction projects for which funds have already been allocated are, once again, delayed in anticipation of a signature in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id=1399>Given these realities, the need for greater involvement and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is essential.</seg>
<seg id=1400>We now have a harmonised framework for the development of the country strategy papers and the indicative programmes of cooperation in all developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=1401>What is more, the creation of SEM did not put an end to the disparity that existed between eight voluminous administrative resources.</seg>
<seg id=1402>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, if I particularly wanted to with you today for this debate on the first maritime package in the European Parliament, it is because you will consider three important texts, which are an important first step on a subject that recent events have unfortunately put on the agenda today.</seg>
<seg id=1403>That could, moreover, from the point of view of the presidency of the Council, to discuss with the Member States to obtain an agreement in the Council according to your proposals and to adopt the text at first reading, if necessary by qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=1404>This targeted and rapid response, enshrined in the two Erika package of measures and the six proposals, launched an important momentum.</seg>
<seg id=1405>The lesson that this House in this morning's debate must learn is that we are forced to conclude that the maritime laws are all over the world, in a state of chaos, and that we must set about the task to sort all this out.</seg>
<seg id=1406>We must send a clear signal to the vessels which do not meet the safety standards and send the message that we will not tolerate any more in European waters or the European ports.</seg>
<seg id=1407>For small tankers, we adopt a position of compromise between the ceiling of 5 000 tonnes which set the IMO and that 600 tonnes of that the Commission set.</seg>
<seg id=1408>These data should be made available to the European authorities, the Member States and port, as well as public interest.</seg>
<seg id=1409>The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region, requires the creation of a Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution.</seg>
<seg id=1410>The environmental organisations are also involved in the cooperation at local level.</seg>
<seg id=1411>To amend the directive in the direction of greater rigour in its application, the harmonisation of legislation, particularly with regard to the selection of vessels subject to inspection, and the scope of the various types of inspection, is positive.</seg>
<seg id=1412>I would also like to point out that the urgency that you invoke now should not be included.</seg>
<seg id=1413>With regard to the limits of liability of classification societies, it is appropriate to me that the Council and Parliament to deepen the discussions, regardless of what will be decided today.</seg>
<seg id=1414>A black box, a black list, all the things which we are dealing with active, but I would nevertheless like to stress a few points.</seg>
<seg id=1415>Faced with this catastrophic situation and anarchic of maritime transport, Europe took up the challenge and eleven months after the Erika disaster, the European Union will be able to say that never procedure will not have been worked so quickly.</seg>
<seg id=1416>One measures how many liberal logic is in fact opposed to a high level of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1417>Whatever, finally, the technical measures that will be one of the major sources of insecurity will remain as long as there is no offsetting the Mancha zone and North Atlantic, the exponential increase in traffic linked to hypertrophy of the North Sea ports.</seg>
<seg id=1418>It would be to the credit of the President according to the Council to put things right, also in its own country.</seg>
<seg id=1419>Madam President, since the sinking of the oil tanker Erika, a package of measures was born, the political pressure, in order to improve safety at sea of vessels.</seg>
<seg id=1420>Greek ship sank, without the least storm in exist, Mr Gayssot.</seg>
<seg id=1421>Thirdly, I think it is clear, in matters of this kind, that there is no such relationship between our oil supply on the one hand and the fact that we always use fossil fuels on the other.</seg>
<seg id=1422>So let us have the political courage of our ecological ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1423>That is to say that, in this area more than any other, our responsibility is large, and we must, it seems to me, to silence any institutional clean love.</seg>
<seg id=1424>From the point of view of Finland, for example, it is important that Russia is involved in these agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1425>I think both the strengthening of the requirements concerning the construction standards of oil tankers, the improvement of rules for monitoring the ports, and also, therefore, the tightening of regulations relating to the classification of vessels.</seg>
<seg id=1426>Madam President, today we are talking about the maritime safety on the basis of three report on which I congratulate the rapporteurs warmly.</seg>
<seg id=1427>As for these three new proposals on maritime safety, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs, who have, in a very short time, proven how our Parliament is determined to adopt new measures to enhance safety at sea, controls, the construction standards and demonstrated that it is more acceptable only similar accidents happen again.</seg>
<seg id=1428>Madam President, our Continent was recently hit by a series of maritime disasters of large scale, particularly involving oil tankers.</seg>
<seg id=1429>More than 80% of accidents are due to human error, but there are reasons to human error, which are of social order.</seg>
<seg id=1430>One or a Member of Parliament used the term 'traceability'.</seg>
<seg id=1431>The directive on port State control is designed to verify compliance with international requirements and not to introduce new regulations.</seg>
<seg id=1432>Amendment No 18 links port state control to the rest periods of seafarers, even if the application of provisions on working hours of seafarers is already well covered by Directive 99 / 95.</seg>
<seg id=1433>I am pleased that the rapporteur has introduced a reference, in Amendment No 21, with the special system of control, and I give our assent to the main thrust of this step, but points out that the wording should be refined in order to clarify the position.</seg>
<seg id=1434>Amendment No 4 and part of Amendment No 18 on the point K are not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1435>I can assure you that if a shipowner believes to register a ship under these houses, it would do well to think very twice in view of our proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1436>The Commissioner spoke for 18 minutes, and during this time, he mentioned dozens and dozens of articles, and has changed the Commission's position.</seg>
<seg id=1437>Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council on a range of actions relating to the trans-European network of collection, production and distribution of statistics on the timetable goods will intra- and non-Community (EDICOM) (COM (00) 0458 - C5-0401 / 00 - 2000 / 0201 (COD)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)</seg>
<seg id=1438>By withdrawing our resolution, I am nevertheless convinced that our Parliament would have done better to its voice heard by spending, for the Council of Nice, a resolution specific and separate with so important and so difficult issues to the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than to deal with them in the context of a single resolution including also all the other items on the agenda of the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1439>(More than twelve Members having risen, the oral amendment was not adopted) (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1440>Report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, efficiency of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI))</seg>
<seg id=1441>I voted against in protest at the fact that the European Union has not yet managed to intervene as it should do so in this matter.</seg>
<seg id=1442>Although the draft revision of the existing directive on the control of ships like the Watts report do not meet the real needs, they represent some progress in the right direction for these reasons, we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1443>We therefore regret that the Commission proposal did not take up the idea of creating a genuine European body of surveillance, on the model of ‘ coast guard 'in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1444>The safety of ships, the protection of life at sea and environmental require beforehand that attacks the impunity that shipowners have, that we take a very stringent measures for the control of State of the ship and that one of the penalties imposed on shipping companies who violate safety regulations, it improves the conditions for seafarers, that we give them proper training and that guarantees of staff on board which meet the increased needs of vessels.</seg>
<seg id=1445>Unfortunately, the rapporteur Hatzidakis makes the opposite.</seg>
<seg id=1446>The Erika accident which took place in December 1999 was at the root of the emergence of the issue of maritime safety in the Community political agenda and it is under pressure from the European Parliament which the Commission proposed the texts that we have voted today, almost a year after this disaster shipwreck.</seg>
<seg id=1447>The current compensation fund were badly paid, and this was only too clearly in the case of the Braer disaster, following which the fishing industry in the Shetland Islands was compensated too little in comparison to the incurred damage.</seg>
<seg id=1448>I have already said, Madam President, that in the past I had the opportunity to sail.</seg>
<seg id=1449>The rapporteur's proposals aimed at the harmonisation at European level can only be positive.</seg>
<seg id=1450>This is an important part since it concerns the classification of ships.</seg>
<seg id=1451>It would be quite a great success, because a Europe that we need, on the eve of enlargement, is not rigid supranational Europe, hierarchical, distance, but Europe flexible and close to the people, therefore, based on respect for national democracies.</seg>
<seg id=1452>The fight for power that are issued more and more openly many Member States blurs the prospect of possible compromises.</seg>
<seg id=1453>The Nice Summit will have as its main task to guarantee the effectiveness of the institutions of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1454>In a week ’ s summit, I trust personally!</seg>
<seg id=1455>I am not in favour of an automatic link between QMV and codecision and, here too, I believe that any decision to extend the powers of codecision should be examined on a case-by-case basis.</seg>
<seg id=1456>By amending Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extension of qualified majority voting, currently in force in the Council for the trade in products, in other areas such as public services, intellectual property, health or education.</seg>
<seg id=1457>Therefore, Parliament avoids influence, it reduces the voice and keep quiet in the name of fidelity partisan, national and non-governmental, thus forgetting its obligations towards the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1458>I also voted against a text which requires the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty which will be adopted in Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1459>The fact of sharing the Union in A and B teams is wrong, and I therefore agree with the idea of allowing a third of the Member States to take precedence over the other.</seg>
<seg id=1460>Its new role put an end to the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.</seg>
<seg id=1461>There are many elements to which the Group of the British Conservatives can support in this report, in particular emphasis on the enlargement of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1462>The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament has decided to support the report on the establishment of a common European security and defence policy.</seg>
<seg id=1463>But also against the people of the European Union, which will, in any case, to finance the new defence expenditure which the report calls for, and which will not even have the guarantee that these military forces are not a day used against them, in the name of 'maintenance of law and order'.</seg>
<seg id=1464>It is too serious to want a State not wishing to take part in a mission is obliged to pay a financial contribution which will be divided between the Member States taking part in this war.</seg>
<seg id=1465>The average external military provide no solution, because it does not remove the origin of the conflict and does not change the public.</seg>
<seg id=1466>· the fact that military operations should be financed by a line from the Community budget and that the Member States would have to contribute financially to the operations, even if they do not wish to participate in it (paragraphs 49 and 50)</seg>
<seg id=1467>The EU should, on the contrary, favours to alter the priorities within the framework of the Petersberg tasks and it must focus its efforts on achieving civil and humanitarian tasks.</seg>
<seg id=1468>I support the report by my colleague Mrs Britt Theorin.</seg>
<seg id=1469>It mentions the need for this category only to pass on the request for a tax deductible of domestic services' and for 'adaptation of prices and costs to the financial resources available to private individuals'.</seg>
<seg id=1470>It is truly incredible that we still have to recommend that the 21st century that the Member States to guarantee domestic employees the right to social security and pension.</seg>
<seg id=1471>For many young people, the first contact with the labour market is likely to take the form of an employment in the black.</seg>
<seg id=1472>Things worse when it comes to women's distant countries which accepted this work by need and which have no other option to continue to provide for their vital needs.</seg>
<seg id=1473>The reform of the Commission will be judged on parties, hence the need for regular monitoring reports that the European Commission will present throughout the duration of the programme and the importance of the full assessment expected in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id=1474>In a more recent past, various scandals and problems led, in March 1999, with the resignation of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1475>Finally, I think it is vital to remember that through this reform which is essential for the future, we are all looking at the same time more rigorous and more transparency in the Commission in its day-to-day management, but also a greater sense of responsibility for its part, within the strict framework of powers and responsibilities conferred on it.</seg>
<seg id=1476>The British Conservatives support the assertion of paragraph 7 of the report that it is necessary to ensure the democratic accountability and the functioning of the system in three pillars.</seg>
<seg id=1477>(The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=1478>We have heard - and I would like to add immediately that I cannot believe in it - that the President of the Council and the French Republic will be present tomorrow over thirty minutes, so to speak.</seg>
<seg id=1479>Therefore, it seems to me to be excluded that we have a thorough and reasoned position.</seg>
<seg id=1480>Whatever it is, in itself, votes, and I am in favour of a resolution as suggested by Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others.</seg>
<seg id=1481>We have worked on these texts until at night, as the figures relating to the weighting of votes in the Council and the distribution of seats in Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1482>Madam President, I wish to speak in favour of maintaining the report by Mr de Roo on the agenda because it was very well prepared and must be subject to a common position at the last Council of Ministers for the Environment of the French Presidency which will be held next Monday and Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id=1483>Thank you, Mr Parish.</seg>
<seg id=1484>In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy - that Mr Brok chairs – he smoke while sitting.</seg>
<seg id=1485>The political basis is clear: to harmonise market, taking account of a high level of protection of public health and consumer protection, on the basis of the existing regulation and by promoting scientific point of view.</seg>
<seg id=1486>It is their conditions and design of life, in which the protection of health is an increasingly important place.</seg>
<seg id=1487>This rule can also apply to all récréationnelles but dangerous drugs as far as the consumer of drugs is the only one to risks.</seg>
<seg id=1488>Yesterday, in the United States, of the trials have gained against the tobacco multinationals for poisoning and lie on not toxicity of products.</seg>
<seg id=1489>With regard to export to the EU of cigarettes banned, for medical reasons, within the Union itself, we believe that the only sensible and logical solution is to put an end to it.</seg>
<seg id=1490>Rather than learn from the failure in Luxembourg, on 9 October, we persist in a legally indefensible attitude.</seg>
<seg id=1491>I have studied carefully the statements by the Commissioner sent to my colleague Mr Hume: 'no massive loss of jobs in this sector.</seg>
<seg id=1492>It is Parliament and the Council to approve this proposal for a directive and to examine, amongst other things, its proper legal basis.</seg>
<seg id=1493>I do not think we can also take a restricted manner, that is, irrespective of the content – and substantial content which highlighted Mr Maaten and others – it runs the risk that, if this Parliament and the Council accept the restrictive interpretation proposed by the leader of the European People's Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and the whole of the Community institutions to put itself completely at the mercy of the legislative level of development of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law.</seg>
<seg id=1494>The weak point of the proposal is that it places great emphasis on the promotion of free competition.</seg>
<seg id=1495>I will say in conclusion that, since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has the power of coordinating environmental consumer protection, and that he will obviously work closely with the Council and the Commission on these issues.</seg>
<seg id=1496>In fact, it has nothing to do with tobacco, but the ruling of the European Court of Justice could also have led to a ban on advertising alcohol or chocolate, as it is known that sugar can also be dangerous to health.</seg>
<seg id=1497>I really fail to understand that a majority of Members can like a relaxation of the rules on export in relation to the wishes expressed by the governments of the Member States governments – which are also many industry concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1498>It is a fact that 80% of smokers want to give up, but the tobacco industry establishes a few policies to help these smokers to stop.</seg>
<seg id=1499>If we keep trying again dictate to other countries the public health standards that they should apply by extending our sensible proposals for the internal market to exports, we will jeopardise the excellent work done by Mr Maaten.</seg>
<seg id=1500>We are in favour of the application of a uniform test method recognised by all EU countries, who must be implemented by a test laboratory approved in a country.</seg>
<seg id=1501>The effects of the consumption of tobacco on health today are fully recognised, and the legislators and public opinion share the feeling that it is now time to adopt draconian rules and regulations for this product.</seg>
<seg id=1502>Consequently, the Community rules would be in harmony with the future international agreements, which would prevent us the danger of trade barriers and would therefore increase opportunity consumer protection, while providing a high level of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1503>It would be better to wait until the overall question of additives is dealt with in the context of the Commission's first report.</seg>
<seg id=1504>On laboratory tests, dealing with Amendment of the approval of the testing is unnecessary since another rule guarantees the movement of goods which are in line with the provisions of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1505>Madam President, this report is that there is a simple: the current directives immediately of summer only have a five-year period of validity, after which they must come before the House to be renewed.</seg>
<seg id=1506>Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on the provisions relating to the summer, we are discussing today, is a good proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1507>I therefore believe that we should not extend us too long on this subject, since the Member States and the people already widely accepted the regulation immediately of summer and that this has been recognised as an integral part of our annual pace.</seg>
<seg id=1508>In my opinion, it is good that the issues of time zones and application of the directive immediately of summer remain within the competence of the Member States, in accordance with the proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1509>It would be more reasonable at the end of September to put an end to the summertime, some six months after its beginning.</seg>
<seg id=1510>However, we can endorse the idea of making appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report by 2007 mentioned in Article 5.</seg>
<seg id=1511>It was stated that no test leading to changes in the genetic identity of participants can be accepted.</seg>
<seg id=1512>If we approve it, we will have a regulation which guarantees therapeutic progress and the protection of patients as it stands does not leave, but that is why I have improved it in favour of this compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1513>These groups must be maintained in the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1514>I am also pleased that we managed to put safeguards in genetic and cell therapy.</seg>
<seg id=1515>I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his work, and to thank him for the efforts she has made to reconcile the conflicting points of view.</seg>
<seg id=1516>These programmes relate to the fight against cancer, the prevention of AIDS, the prevention of drug dependence and health promotion, and their adjournment would mean an end to the actions concerned and the work of the networks which have been set up.</seg>
<seg id=1517>It is very good to be able to make progress in the field, so as to progress as far as possible, to bring us closer greatly, and if a second reading would be necessary, to ensure that we are practically going to decide.</seg>
<seg id=1518>Furthermore, we must not lose sight of both the prevention and the promotion of vigilance will be increasingly important, and it will therefore be necessary to provide them with larger budgets and to attach greater importance to them.</seg>
<seg id=1519>Madam President, following the Trakatellis report on the extension of certain existing European programmes in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about the direction in which the European public health policy evolves.</seg>
<seg id=1520>According to my information, the Council also gave its agreement in principle.</seg>
<seg id=1521>In the European Union, paradoxically, the abolition of internal borders in order to promote the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is accompanied by the continuation of 15 borders in the fields of police and criminal justice, in which the Member States find it difficult to be released.</seg>
<seg id=1522>Finally, the initiative represents significant progress towards the creation of a European criminal law area, albeit partial and limited, but it meets the real needs of considerable mass European citizens who, when they are victims of an offence outside the territory of their usual state of residence, are up to now practically without recourse.</seg>
<seg id=1523>What have we ask for these groups of people?</seg>
<seg id=1524>We must at the same time ensuring a special training of professionals in direct contact with the victims.</seg>
<seg id=1525>The victims cannot be doubly victims, victims of crime and suffered victims of the system.</seg>
<seg id=1526>In this context, it is also important that the relatives of the family of the victim, are aware of the facts in a discreet and professional way if they make the like of it and can also count on the support necessary, preventing that they draw all the details in the press.</seg>
<seg id=1527>This principle is worth whatever the type of crime in question.</seg>
<seg id=1528>That is the level of the Member States, or that of the Union, we must never deviate from the basic principle according to which any individual must always take responsibility for their actions.</seg>
<seg id=1529>In other cases, it might be possible to obtain the necessary information in the language of the Union which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id=1530>I am very satisfied with the response in favour of Parliament to this first text on such a crucial issue, which allows the area of freedom, security and justice that we are gradually build to offer our citizens assistance in situations which are often difficult to live.</seg>
<seg id=1531>Vote on request for urgent</seg>
<seg id=1532>(Parliament rejected the request)</seg>
<seg id=1533>Therefore, during the night of 23 November to 24, we reached an agreement with the Council on the essential points of a budget, which is certainly not brilliant, but which is reasonable.</seg>
<seg id=1534>The Commission has also proposed a review of the sum of EUR 300 million.</seg>
<seg id=1535>But as I have learned from the discussions as it is much more difficult to achieve the wording of a negotiation position of the Council, to receive a mandate and bring about purely national egoisms within a common European decision so much is not very reasonable and justified.</seg>
<seg id=1536>I hope that work for recruitment office common, as we say in German modern, i.e. authority European recruitment, will really make progress, so that we can respond to the problems that will arise for all the institutions – in both the Council and the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions - in the next few years, namely the need for staff.</seg>
<seg id=1537>The Council refuse to carry out this review - it appears that we should have the facts right now - and I would like to prevent it: financially to use the flexibility instrument two consecutive years, in fact, in less than fifteen months and the first to less than six less approval of the financial perspective – vacuum the flexibility instrument because it prevents its renewal and its possible accumulation, which is provided for up to EUR 600 million.</seg>
<seg id=1538>This very large sum, which responds to the existence of very high requirements in 2001, in particular could be financed through the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to EUR 200 million.</seg>
<seg id=1539>It is taking account of this new element that the Council voted at second reading in a budget increase of 2.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1540>Finally, before you did not carry out the final adoption of this budget, I would like to highlight the Council 's determination to comply with certain basic budgetary rules, as regards retention of appropriations, legal basis and the classification of expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1541>And, unlike in Nice, the three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and Commission – are all, I believe, be satisfied with the end result.</seg>
<seg id=1542>Ladies and gentlemen, the resurgence of cattle infected with BSE requires immediate action in the budgetary context, and specifically for the protection of health, consumer protection, but also for aid for farmers affected by this situation.</seg>
<seg id=1543>Furthermore, the Council defined for the framework programme to aid reconstruction in the Western Balkans, a multiannual indicative amount, certainly, which is compatible with the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1544>The brave struggle, we managed to get a few million euros.</seg>
<seg id=1545>I thank Mrs Haug very much.</seg>
<seg id=1546>He thinks since this 1% of the budget of the European Union is well used.</seg>
<seg id=1547>If I understand what you said, we should not resort to the reserve because it is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id=1548>I therefore believe that we have seen very good things, in addition to many others, that I cannot mention now because of the short speaking time.</seg>
<seg id=1549>Although the agricultural appropriations, which account for almost half of the total budget, an increase of more than a 5% taking account of the letter of amendment, the overall increase in the budget is only of 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1550>We now see the great danger that the opposition is not increase over the coming years between MEDA, the plans for the countries of the Mediterranean and the Balkans, as we all know that there is an urgent need for funds in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1551>Just to overcome the difficulties which has done so narrow the path towards the goal to fulfil the commitments made in Helsinki towards the candidate countries without wrecking the Union, to allow the Europe of tomorrow to continue to function effectively.</seg>
<seg id=1552>They are real, even if they do not go as far as the Presidency, which has shown, I note that, on a purely national basis, a great openness, would have liked.</seg>
<seg id=1553>A new legal basis is planned for the status of European political parties and Parliament entrusted with the status of institutional candidate in Article 230 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1554>In recent weeks, three major progress has been made.</seg>
<seg id=1555>This is the meaning of the declaration adopted in Nice and the deliberations to coordinate at European level in the fight against doping.</seg>
<seg id=1556>Among the threats, there is, as we all know, global warming.</seg>
<seg id=1557>Furthermore, in Nice, the European Union set up a permanent authorities to the definition and the control of a foreign policy and common security: a political and security committee, a military committee and a European staff.</seg>
<seg id=1558>For this cooperation, for your support and also for your reception, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, the French Presidency thanks you.</seg>
<seg id=1559>(Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1560>(Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1561>We now need to examine the text in Parliament carefully.</seg>
<seg id=1562>(Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1563>I see this as a failure not only in relation to the declared ambition of the European Union to change the institutions to be able to properly welcoming the new Members by improving the efficiency of the European Union, and I see a failure also in relation to another important aim, which was mentioned perhaps too little, the approximation of the European Union and the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1564>The right questions, it is in our view that the impressive tide of people was carrying which, throughout Europe, converged in Nice on the eve of the Summit.</seg>
<seg id=1565>Firstly, the Fifteen signed on the term and tear-gassing under the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=1566>(Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1567>My group is disappointed by this Treaty and concerned for the future that we prepare ourselves, we are also opposed to it, with all our might.</seg>
<seg id=1568>Mr President, you have the floor.</seg>
<seg id=1569>I have already said on this point and I fully endorse what he said on the need to improve the public debate considerably I will not repeat what I said, but it is true that, all too often the citizens feel alienated by decisions taken in authorities that they do not know.</seg>
<seg id=1570>Mr President, I would like to know whether the competence of the European Parliament on summertime is a new conquest of the Nice Summit.</seg>
<seg id=1571>Perhaps inhibited previously by the complexity of clinical trials, laboratories will find, in the will expressed both by the States and by this House, the courage to develop the market for paediatric medicines, even if it is not large enough to allow a return on investment.</seg>
<seg id=1572>Is it necessary to renew the change of summertime was established at the time of the oil crisis, with a view to saving energy, and which had been extended until 2001?</seg>
<seg id=1573>The victims are not always protected as it should be within the framework of criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id=1574>Many passengers and holidaymakers will thus benefit from this European initiative.</seg>
<seg id=1575>Mr President, time for me to welcome Mr President of the Commission which is there and the Presidency of the Council that progress, and to stress that, probably never in this House, such unanimity has not been expressed on the results of a summit.</seg>
<seg id=1576>That is, that is, under the leadership of the French Presidency, in six months, has, it seems to me, all the same done its work on six essential aspects.</seg>
<seg id=1577>However, my biggest fear is that the United Kingdom, France and Germany are now able to reverse the delicate balance which had existed between States of different sizes and institutions for decades.</seg>
<seg id=1578>In fact, it is hard to see, in this decision of Nice, which is specific to facilitate enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1579>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be very brief in today.</seg>
<seg id=1580>Therefore, all that, when we vote on the Treaty of Nice, my vote could only be negative.</seg>
<seg id=1581>Mr President, the most important outcome of the meeting in Nice lies in the fact that, despite everything, we have reached a treaty, so that we can now prepare their place in the applicant countries.</seg>
<seg id=1582>The winner of this conference, they are mm.</seg>
<seg id=1583>Secondly, let us forget Nice, watch post-Nice – and let me place my trust in the project of great Convention made by Belgium for its Presidency, because it has been clearly demonstrated, we need to make the nine, we need to change the method, we need to speed up the history for 2004: it is too late, it is too far and are too dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=1584>Instead of that the spirit which prevailed in Nice, instead of wondering how to advance Europe really have to wonder how one could block, how we could achieve a system of decision at intergovernmental level, how we could boast itself, get back home, to have been an advocate of national interests.</seg>
<seg id=1585>In the face of what we are after Amsterdam and Nice, it is Europe ’ s princes, a Europe of national administrations, and not a Europe of political unification.</seg>
<seg id=1586>We cannot continue without qualified majority decision on the key issues.</seg>
<seg id=1587>It is true that – I would paraphrase Mr Bayrou – I have been in this platform for this morning; firstly alongside the President of the Republic, then by myself and criticisms head, it seems to me, moderate, friendly criticism, but all the same.</seg>
<seg id=1588>We must not forget that it is the first time, in fact, since 1957, what one reforms, that really is reviewing the grid.</seg>
<seg id=1589>We are in constitutional systems and the powers cannot be confused.</seg>
<seg id=1590>Thank you very much, Minister.</seg>
<seg id=1591>But it was not incorporated into the Treaties and has not been mentioned in Article 6 (2) of the Treaty on European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1592>Finally, there are some positive elements: the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty, the article on political parties and their status, the right of this Parliament to represent the other institution before the Court of Justice - it is also an important element of political control, the new formula for the European Commission, which is what is known as the 'Prodi law' in the Treaty, which strengthens the President and the new composition of the Commission - reasonable compromise that I accept and which will function, with time, and, as my colleague, Mr Tsatsos, pointed out, the way to the future.</seg>
<seg id=1593>Mr President, we have already committed ourselves to a rigorous evaluation of what has happened in Nice, but it is worth remembering that Nice started from a very limited agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1594>Let us see things: the Charter was not included in the Treaties, it is not even mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=1595>We want to prove to the Heads of Government that we can do better.</seg>
<seg id=1596>Despite the laudatory statements on its own subject this morning by the French Government, the IGC has not end well.</seg>
<seg id=1597>Mr President, the French Presidency is not present at this debate, it is not easy to criticise it.</seg>
<seg id=1598>Mr President, the Nice Summit was that the method of the Intergovernmental Conference had its day.</seg>
<seg id=1599>2001 budget (continuation)</seg>
<seg id=1600>That does not mean that we could do more and better.</seg>
<seg id=1601>These maximum obliges the Commission to set priorities within the limits of a specific budget as any authority to do so.</seg>
<seg id=1602>The vote which will follow this debate will conclude a long and difficult process of approval from the European Union budget for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1603>That is what we have done: we avoided a budgetary crisis back to Article 272, the financial perspective has been maintained, even if we use the flexibility instrument.</seg>
<seg id=1604>Let me just say to the Council that, on this game, we still have balloons and that, on this side, we intend to play until we have achieved a good result.</seg>
<seg id=1605>We do not want just a proposal for a revision for next year is already in the Colom resolution, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we share his critical point of view when she says that this way of solving the financial shortfall in category 4 distorts the multiannual nature of the objectives of the Union's external itself and the definition of the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1606>So that all this is possible, we will have to define, for the future too, of the priorities of major proportions.</seg>
<seg id=1607>This is the only way in which the money is made available to our citizens, will be used properly and wisely.</seg>
<seg id=1608>If we add to this already calculating the SAB ahead, one comes almost at 8%, whereas in all other areas – that this is the policy of training, the whole area of internal policies, including research, foreign policy, the administration and pre-accession aid, we only have a growth rate of 1.1%.</seg>
<seg id=1609>Since this cooperation is so good, we will certainly still have the opportunity to continue this in January, at the presentation of the supplementary budget.</seg>
<seg id=1610>Criticism of the relations between Russia and the Baltic States which still could not be settled satisfactorily must also us.</seg>
<seg id=1611>We are following with great interest the development of society and the internal policy on Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1612>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1613>Although President Putin guarantees us the development of democracy in his country, he is not automatically the guarantor of stable and democratic Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1614>We should not be insidious but on the contrary to build a Europe of economic cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1615>On the Caucasus, Mr Van Orden is quite right.</seg>
<seg id=1616>If Russia from outside is observed and that we receive direct impressions punctually Russian interlocutors, quickly runs the risk of speaking selectively of a Russian reality which is in fact the image that was itself of Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1617>In political terms, the common strategy proposes in Russia to initiate a permanent dialogue on security and defence policy and to establish a permanent mechanism for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id=1618>In this paragraph, I wanted to stress how important it is to mark the fact that Russia is really a political union with Belarus.</seg>
<seg id=1619>Do you think of supporting such a project, Mr Patten?</seg>
<seg id=1620>In this context, as Parliament knows, during the last summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi began an in-depth dialogue on energy.</seg>
<seg id=1621>I sincerely hope to go personally to Kaliningrad at the beginning of next year, and not only because Immanuel Kant passed all his life.</seg>
<seg id=1622>I once again congratulate the honourable Member on his excellent report, which deals with an extremely important subject, on which I am sure we will look again and again in this Parliament over the next few years.</seg>
<seg id=1623>You put me in a very difficult position.</seg>
<seg id=1624>Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is very important, because the mad cow crisis has far-reaching effects on food, the production and import food.</seg>
<seg id=1625>The Council expressed its concern at the many meetings with Russia, at all levels, to bring it in particular to avoid excessive use of force, as well as a possible extension of the conflict, to carry out independent investigations and effective on violations of human rights, to support the group of the OSCE assistance in carrying out its duty and finally to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id=1626>Mr President, on a point of order: it is customary in this House that when the questions were not the subject of a satisfactory oral answer, then they are dealt with in writing.</seg>
<seg id=1627>(Interruption by Mr Posselt)</seg>
<seg id=1628>This directive goes back to 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1629>It is in this sense that it will be necessary to work.</seg>
<seg id=1630>These groups are not the subject of course an exception in the new proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1631>The presidency and several Member States have already received European Committee of the sugar manufacturers various letters on the Commission's proposal which they will be taken into account in their deliberations.</seg>
<seg id=1632>Question No 6 by (H-0886 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1633>First of all I would like to say that, in my opinion, the President-in-Office of the Council did not answer the question by Mr korokas yet.</seg>
<seg id=1634>It is now necessary to set up this authority and I believe that the awareness of the European authorities is strong and that it will be necessary to go ahead.</seg>
<seg id=1635>Specifically, the representative of the Presidency, in fact, the ambassador of France in Algeria, has to meet Mr Ahmed taleb?</seg>
<seg id=1636>We welcome the measures proposed in this respect by the preparatory committee and decided by the General Assembly with regard to the system of accreditation of non-governmental organisations, with the preparatory process and the special session in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1637>The partnership has several references to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=1638>As the Council put forward it to the honourable Member in his earlier answer, the process of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters will allow for better protection of the rights of the people.</seg>
<seg id=1639>I would like to press it.</seg>
<seg id=1640>It provides in particular political control and the strategic direction of a military crisis management operation.</seg>
<seg id=1641>I would simply like to remind you that the system of the Treaty makes a difference in treatment between the tax and other indirect taxes, harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market - that is Article 93, and the rapprochement, provided for in Article 94 of the legislation which have a direct impact on the establishment and the functioning of the single market, including those relating to direct taxation.</seg>
<seg id=1642>Let us look around these three main areas.</seg>
<seg id=1643>If the traditional attitude obeying 'in doubt, remain enemy' persists, that could explode the Stability Pact from the south of Europe based on the principle of regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1644>We also need cooperation with Yugoslavia and more precisely a bilateral cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1645>Mr President, our group supports the work done by Mr Baltas on the report on the possibility of negotiating a stabilisation and association agreement with the Republic of Croatia.</seg>
<seg id=1646>Mr President, I had, in the years when I exercised the mandate of President of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, the opportunity to accompany many Croats in their efforts towards freedom and prosperity which they identify with their integration into the European institutions, like the other people of our continent.</seg>
<seg id=1647>In view of the results achieved by Croatia this year, I will admit that I do not doubt our ability to progress to high speed.</seg>
<seg id=1648>That is what we think, and the speed with which we adjust our policy with regard to Croatia in recent months witness.</seg>
<seg id=1649>We must in Croatia to bring the government and to the people of that country, every assistance in the coming years and we are very grateful to the honourable Member who wisely to urge us to proceed in this way.</seg>
<seg id=1650>In this connection, it is incomprehensible that thousands of members of Laskar Jihad could, in the spring, to go in the Moluccas in order to stir up the conflict again.</seg>
<seg id=1651>In Timor, militias hinder the return of refugees and rescue workers are made harass.</seg>
<seg id=1652>On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I shall confine myself to three points.</seg>
<seg id=1653>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen for her excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1654>However, in this respect, the country is no exception.</seg>
<seg id=1655>The continuing violence which the Moluccas, in Aceh and Irian Jaya are the theatre cause great suffering of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1656>Tomorrow, we will give the Sakharov Prize.</seg>
<seg id=1657>The latest news from the Indonesian archipelago obliges us, however, to ask ourselves whether the situation of President Wahid and its true is not yet more serious, more critical than the rapporteur's analysis suggests.</seg>
<seg id=1658>If we want to help Indonesia, we must act now with money and concrete action, and not only with words.</seg>
<seg id=1659>This report is extremely valuable because it warns us on the development of events.</seg>
<seg id=1660>It is clear that the difficulties in Indonesia will not be resolved in a day.</seg>
<seg id=1661>Protection of the financial interests of the Communities.</seg>
<seg id=1662>The obstacles to its independence, both in the recruitment of staff and in terms of its structure, must be abolished.</seg>
<seg id=1663>It is therefore essential that by an internal reform process, the Commission timetable finally its stated desire not to allow more fraud and to continue them accordingly.</seg>
<seg id=1664>I think it is that which should result from it, and which must also result in Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1665>We would like Member States to start negotiations on the adoption of a uniform legislation in the field of crime, but we reject our countries depend on a Federal Prosecutor EU.</seg>
<seg id=1666>I would also like to know why the publication of the Commission communication on this subject has been postponed until the day after the Danish referendum on the euro.</seg>
<seg id=1667>I tabled an amendment to indicating these countries by name, because it is time to make it clear that they are and that they are covered with shame.</seg>
<seg id=1668>I am sure that OLAF believes that it is in their interest to open the choice of his top leaders.</seg>
<seg id=1669>However, we must ensure, in the European Parliament, not to miss the beam in our it by focusing on the mote in it of neighbouring countries, the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1670>We are trying to extinguish the fire, but smoke makes us suffocate.</seg>
<seg id=1671>Nobody can understand it, me either.</seg>
<seg id=1672>For taking this matter, I would like to highlight four points that I consider essential in the work of the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=1673>As for the Parliament itself, its problem is the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1674>It is rather worrying also, Commissioner, that the Commission - the guardian of the Treaties, must be explicitly reminded the order with regard to respect for the rights of Members.</seg>
<seg id=1675>The latter can for example recommend to the Committee on Budgets to freeze or reduce the amount of appropriations for the budget lines concerned in next year's budget, or not to allow any credit transfer since it is a question of increasing the budget lines concerned and that, until the end of the internal investigations under way it can go so far as to demand that the President of the Commission's call for the resignation of the Commissioners concerned by the serious problems which have been noted, a European Caesarean to some extent.</seg>
<seg id=1676>The report demands detailed inventories of operational activities, closer examination of the budget lines and irregularities as well as an internal auditor of the parliamentary committee.</seg>
<seg id=1677>Commissioner, the legal basis relating to the transmission of information in the European Parliament is the EC Treaty and not the interinstitutional agreement.</seg>
<seg id=1678>Without amendments, the end result of this common position would be an inequality of weapons not only in relation to North America, but also in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1679>I really do not see why we should not end here as in all other cases to a compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1680>It is a proposal which have come a long - and, I fear - winding road, to overcome certain existing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id=1681>The first amendment relates to Article 4, which establishes that must be the competent authority to control the supply.</seg>
<seg id=1682>Now we have a proposal which would lead to a genuine lunchbox, a free-for-all with its procession of potential disputes at a delicate stage of the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=1683>In the United Kingdom, the regulation of the times, by means of the voluntary code of practice implemented by the Commission on takeover bids, is a real success: that is a good example of a pragmatic approach in an extremely complex problem where the legislation would be more appropriate.</seg>
<seg id=1684>But what is even more important is that it enables us to advance the Lisbon Agenda aimed at the creation of a competitive and dynamic European economy.</seg>
<seg id=1685>The important thing for us here in the European Parliament is at last that the contradictory interests, for example, the Board versus the shareholders, the major shareholders versus small shareholders, business versus the financial market, are regulated in a minimum form at European level.</seg>
<seg id=1686>Certain amendments proposed by Parliament making further improvements to the text of the Council's common position, because they propose points which could give rise to difficulties of interpretation and insist on a more rapid transposition of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1687>Indeed, it is not absolutely certain that the definition of fair price proposed is better than another, because the different definitions are currently used in the Member States are enough is enough.</seg>
<seg id=1688>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1689>Furthermore, over a period of three years, the artist will have the right to require professionals of the art market any information on the amounts which are due to him, which is sensible because they have to keep a register of buying and selling.</seg>
<seg id=1690>Therefore, it is the Austrian legislators who are targeted and not the European legislator who creates only positive framework conditions for artists and auction houses.</seg>
<seg id=1691>Furthermore, in the matter in hand, the need for a common position is all the greater if only a common position will enable the European Union to weigh at international level to ensure that the interests of artists can be defended at world level.</seg>
<seg id=1692>I trust in the wisdom and the understanding of this House.</seg>
<seg id=1693>In Germany, for example, in 1998, out of 7,000 artists who have transferred their rights, 274 only finally recovered money, not to mention that 40% of the resale right passed in bank charges for the sums owed.</seg>
<seg id=1694>In short, there is no need for harmonisation of this kind in the sector concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1695>A similar amendment was rejected at first reading.</seg>
<seg id=1696>They thought that the translations could follow in spite of this rather tough and difficult timetable.</seg>
<seg id=1697>Only, we have reached a point as we cannot off this debate any longer.</seg>
<seg id=1698>We have proposed in the Commission to do this one year earlier.</seg>
<seg id=1699>Our Parliament is naturally side of these values and it will continue to defend them.</seg>
<seg id=1700>The technological change and the fluctuations of the market will lead to changes in any case.</seg>
<seg id=1701>Here, we cannot find legal justification for an exclusion of competition.</seg>
<seg id=1702>The restriction of the universal service - the pillar of the postal sector – to 50 grammes is likely to bring the national controls of posts in a difficult situation in the sense that they will be difficult to provide a universal service at an affordable price to the citizens, regardless of their place of residence.</seg>
<seg id=1703>May I remind my Conservative colleagues the problems they had in the United Kingdom when they tested privatising the British posts.</seg>
<seg id=1704>We neither more nor less transformed the safety net of users of the postal service into a hammock in which the major players in the postal sector can continue vautrer and act in complete freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1705>I am delighted with it because, however, this concept of special services asked to put new technologies outside the scope of the universal service.</seg>
<seg id=1706>Madam President, Commissioner, we cannot tolerate and will not tolerate such a situation.</seg>
<seg id=1707>That is why the European Commission did not propose, as the second phase, a total liberalisation of this sector.</seg>
<seg id=1708>It is a development of this type which I hope in the other States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1709>Mr Bolkestein has recently condemned the not very liberal attitude of the French in the Dutch press, at least that is what the title of the article in question announced.</seg>
<seg id=1710>In this connection, we could mention Spain, which was fund of this type and uses it, to talk about the uncertain legal framework on which the Fund is based, the virtual criteria relating to its membership of the discretionary downstreams of its application.</seg>
<seg id=1711>We vote tomorrow, I hope that this vote will take place before the amendment tabled by Mr Atkins or that of Mr Sterckx, otherwise I will have to vote against this report.</seg>
<seg id=1712>Royal Mail participates in competition, and giving my mail to Malmö in Sweden.</seg>
<seg id=1713>Madam President, Commissioner, that the debate has taught us, or rather the controversy caused by Commissioner Bolkestein in its pursuit of a liberalisation of postal services, taken in the absence of any evaluation of the first stage and in violation of the rules laid down by this directive, under the guise of progressive terms and developing such as modernisation, liberalisation, monitoring of technological increases, rocks in a decline in social quality of a country.</seg>
<seg id=1714>The safeguarding of the universal service with compensation fund which would make it possible to initiate private profits for the benefit of the public service will probably failure.</seg>
<seg id=1715>These limits and these delays have also contributed to a debate in which we often confuses the means and ends.</seg>
<seg id=1716>We could not mention this, Madam President, not to mention economic and social cohesion.</seg>
<seg id=1717>Madam President, allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, because it actually completed a complex, difficult work and has endeavoured to strike a balance between the proposals, positions and completely different points of departure and arrival.</seg>
<seg id=1718>I fear that this proposal does not further reinforce the current situation of monopoly at the taxpayers' expense and increases the threshold imposed on newcomers.</seg>
<seg id=1719>I am also glad to see that our liberal friends of the continent set an example to the British Liberals.</seg>
<seg id=1720>Admittedly, I admit that liberalisation in itself is not a problem and that it may be good for consumers.</seg>
<seg id=1721>Justified because it follows the rationale of the founding Treaties of the European Union, which propose the completion of the internal market with free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id=1722>The universal service is the cornerstone of the policy of the Community in this area and all we do is aimed at creating a climate favourable to improve it.</seg>
<seg id=1723>The special services also constitute a sector where innovation and modernisation must be encouraged.</seg>
<seg id=1724>According to him, by the end of the decade, the opening up to competition of almost all of the postal market seems inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=1725>I think that we need reliable guarantee permanently in order to preserve the universal service and its obligations.</seg>
<seg id=1726>That is why I cannot and will not remain silent when the future of the sector is threatened by a possible decision which would result in not to answer as it should be the challenges that have been launched to all of us to Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id=1727>Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.</seg>
<seg id=1728>However, I would point out that the common organisation of the market has as its objective the guarantee of access to the Community market of its products.</seg>
<seg id=1729>I am pleased that we have been able to reach a unanimous vote in the Committee on Agriculture I thank them for my colleagues like Mr Fernández Martín, rapporteur for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, for his support.</seg>
<seg id=1730>We cannot fail to express our concern for the banana production of certain ACP countries, of small producer countries in the West Indies and some countries in western Africa which are traditional suppliers of the banana market and with whom we undertook that we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id=1731>Therefore, I hope that this report be supported as a whole by Members of this House, as was the case in the Committee on Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=1732>Meanwhile, the United States condemns the historical reference periods first but advocates their own historical reference periods now.</seg>
<seg id=1733>Powerful interests come into play, especially those of us who are not themselves of banana producers, but that the American capital hidden in commercial companies.</seg>
<seg id=1734>It sometimes seems that the Commission, in the proposals for the deregulation of trade and agricultural production with internationally, goes further than the Cairns group from.</seg>
<seg id=1735>It is a pity that the Commission and the Council continue in a solution could jeopardise this production seriously, especially after 2006.</seg>
<seg id=1736>The successive decisions of the WTO do not say that it is forbidden to us to give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers.</seg>
<seg id=1737>Therefore, the transitional period should be around fifteen years and in no less than ten years; the compensatory aid must include the guarantee of the incomes of Community producers and the flow of production in the outermost regions, it is also necessary to include the aid for entities which market in bananas are produced.</seg>
<seg id=1738>I hope it will see our arguments today, because this system proposed by the Commission, this tariff preference was for EUR 300, is likely to prove very useful in practice because the ACP producers will be rolling by the system known as the 'first come, first served.</seg>
<seg id=1739>Votes</seg>
<seg id=1740>(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)</seg>
<seg id=1741>The Commission rejects the other amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1742>Before the vote:</seg>
<seg id=1743>(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)</seg>
<seg id=1744>Report (A5-0376 / 2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the reform of the budgetary procedures and the audit institutions (2000 / 2008 (INI))</seg>
<seg id=1745>The majority of smokers do not know all the risks and do not support the real price of their choice.</seg>
<seg id=1746>I have always been adhered to this principle during my 35 years long parliamentary career.</seg>
<seg id=1747>I fear that their hopes are in vain.</seg>
<seg id=1748>It is a question of our ultimate attempt to put on cigarette packets of labels and the pictures which reflect the real dangers of smoking.</seg>
<seg id=1749>Lehne report (A5-0368 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1750>This analysis seems to me both relevant and justified, even today, and that is why I voted against this report in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id=1751>It is right that the Committee on Legal Affairs continues in the refusal of a ceiling and the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be less than 7%.</seg>
<seg id=1752>To oppose this directive is also for my group, a way of giving a clear political signal: we must not waste our time to create a Europe of unnecessary rules.</seg>
<seg id=1753>If it is right to denounce the Stalinist dictatorship of old, how can we give any confidence to Mr Putin, the sacrificer of the Chechen people, the godfather of the various mafias, which seeks to liquidate all the opposition, civil society, political parties (trade unions), in order to increase its own power?</seg>
<seg id=1754>Admittedly, Indonesia not deserve such a development of the relationship, because we cannot say that, in recent years, its leaders are characterised by their democratic great spirit and their great merits, but we must take into account the Indonesian citizens, and therefore of agreement for the development of relations and subsidies.</seg>
<seg id=1755>The unit will deal only with the criminal acts committed by officials of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1756>The Theato report on the Anti-Fraud makes it possible to discover that the European Central Bank, probably for better proving its famous independence, did not see fit to accede to the agreement on the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).</seg>
<seg id=1757>That concludes the vote.</seg>
<seg id=1758>Either we belong to the club, or we are not and we must therefore be packed with this decision.</seg>
<seg id=1759>It is not therefore called at all EEB – everything but American-based do not cause, ladies and gentlemen, a name change.</seg>
<seg id=1760>The tariff only system, however, is an important element, which will see the balance of the Commission proposal and is an important basis which must allow the Council to progress.</seg>
<seg id=1761>There are also measures for the labelling of these bananas in the national and regional programmes promotion of rural development.</seg>
<seg id=1762>Europe and the United States to work closely with the defence of the values that we share.</seg>
<seg id=1763>We are discussing a new WTO round and the implications for this cycle of the many bilateral trade initiatives which are the subject of discussion in the American hemisphere.</seg>
<seg id=1764>He quite rightly said, transatlantic relations have developed a lot in the last ten years – although mainly on the American side thanks to President Clinton, but I believe that history will remember that there was also a European contribution to these new relations – quite fundamental contribution - with the 1990 transatlantic declaration and the new transatlantic agenda adopted under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995.</seg>
<seg id=1765>It will therefore be important to undertake a reversing and in fact of dealing a transatlantic agenda for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1766>I will conclude with the Dominican Republic who said: 'the WTO was supposed to be an impartial referee applying common rules and where the various countries could learn to play the game.</seg>
<seg id=1767>Secondly, even if we can be pleased with the decline of communist sham, the collapse of the Soviet Union has only one superpower, the United States of America.</seg>
<seg id=1768>I know that it maintains a constructive dialogue with Parliament and the committees which deal with these issues.</seg>
<seg id=1769>The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:</seg>
<seg id=1770>These objectives, the secondary objective and objectives, will represent the touchstone of enabling us to consider the specific proposals presented by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1771>It is clear that such a solution – the registration in one country with the possibility of providing services throughout the Union - can cause an avalanche in countries where the tax rate is weak.</seg>
<seg id=1772>Therefore, it was agreed in 1992, was seen at the time as a minimum harmonisation, which provided that the standard VAT rate cannot be below 15%, the Member States have the possibility of applying one or more reduced rates cannot be less than 5%; exemptions being planned in this case.</seg>
<seg id=1773>We asked the European Commission to make sure that there is no distortion of the market and to report on this subject to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1774>In short, the aim of this proposal is laudable, but the method is ill-conceived and if we really want to encourage the e-economy in Europe, it would be good to exempt e-commerce our VAT rather than trying to impose our problems on others.</seg>
<seg id=1775>If we are to meet the need for a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases, we have to take all possible measures to reduce their production.</seg>
<seg id=1776>The only case for which no tax is still seen is that of a provision in the European Community from a third country.</seg>
<seg id=1777>Positive discrimination with regard to air transport must stop.</seg>
<seg id=1778>The airlines of third countries which are not Members of the Union are not subject to any taxation.</seg>
<seg id=1779>The compact CD are not so archaic and they should be taxed, whereas the programmes which would flow from the Internet would be taken off the tax!</seg>
<seg id=1780>However, the solution can only be technically unworkable and hinder the development of the on-line in the Union, precisely at a time when everyone wishes, on the contrary, their expansion.</seg>
<seg id=1781>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the European Union degrade themselves and lose in return.</seg>
<seg id=1782>We should seek to encourage the e-commerce and no new ways of taxing it.</seg>
<seg id=1783>The Liberals say to us that we need less possible state.</seg>
<seg id=1784>The Primarolo group drafted simple rules that we need to apply.</seg>
<seg id=1785>The group that I represent in this House, however, makes an objection and believes that it would be necessary to balance the situation between the newspapers, which enjoy a reduced rate of VAT, and the newspapers online, which do not benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id=1786>A tax on kerosene cannot therefore that exist within the framework of an international agreement, in order to ensure the balance of competition.</seg>
<seg id=1787>I particularly welcome the fact that the report highlights one of the key points that I made in my report for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, passed by this House a few months ago, namely that since it is politically difficult to reach an international agreement on the taxation of aviation, at least in the short term, should use alternative tools for us to obtain the same force, including a tax on emissions.</seg>
<seg id=1788>In fact, industry pays 100% of its infrastructure costs through the air traffic control and of airport charges, which amounted to USD four billion in 1998 - in contrast to other modes of transport, such as rail transport or by road, which are still much subsidised.</seg>
<seg id=1789>The current situation is bad.</seg>
<seg id=1790>In this connection, it should be noted that there is a bit of a problem about the emissions caused by air traffic, even if the percentage is not raised so much, there is increasing significantly and therefore we cannot underestimate it.</seg>
<seg id=1791>This system would be harmful for SMEs in and outside the Union, particularly if we consider the proposal for a reduction of the threshold of derogation to the excessively low level of EUR 40 000 annual turnover.</seg>
<seg id=1792>If we are too greedy with regard to the matter under discussion, we really jeopardise the future of electronic commerce, important for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1793>The principle wishing that suppliers established outside the Community and making services to customers within the Community should not be seen that in one place should not lead to a shift in tax revenue into the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1794>Since the debate has not yet been completed within the Council, and until the Commission wishes to conclude its issue of VAT and e-commerce fairly quickly, I think it would be wise not yet not to formally accept the amendments made by Parliament, but to try to harness the greatest possible number of these proposals in the Council negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=1795>I cannot therefore accept the amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1796>Thank you very much for all the issues which you dealt with this week.</seg>
<seg id=1797>Only three months after the accident, the Commission, for its part, has assumed its responsibilities by adopting a first package of measures, that the European Parliament fully agreed on 30 November.</seg>
<seg id=1798>With more than fifteen directives or regulations in force, indeed, it is urgent to standardise practices and to exercise greater control over the implementation of the Community, in order to avoid possible differences, important and unacceptable standards, within the Union in the field of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1799>Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his constant efforts in the field of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1800>I would like to remind the House that in terms of air safety, the compensation applied within the framework of European and American framework are not equivalent to the amounts applied in other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1801>Secondly, I would say that it is the French justice which could deny or freeze the social fund to compensate certain damage or others; it is the French justice which could establish responsibilities beyond those planned according to objective criteria for the current international regulation on pollution by hydrocarbons.</seg>
<seg id=1802>The Commission considers that such adjustments in the direction of the establishment of a fairer sampling system which also encourages a more rational and efficient use of the road network.</seg>
<seg id=1803>Faced with criticism, especially those in Ireland and France, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a new interpretation of it: it is now a tax for all users, including the British drivers of heavy goods vehicles.</seg>
<seg id=1804>I am determined to ensure that the food consumers to meet the highest standards, whether it comes from within or outside the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1805>Of course I understand the concern of the honourable Member.</seg>
<seg id=1806>I am sorry to tell you, Commissioner, that your answer is not appropriate to me.</seg>
<seg id=1807>The honourable Member's remarks are important.</seg>
<seg id=1808>In Nigeria, the whole ijaw indigenous showed Chevron to encourage the violence against them and of up to pay Nigerian soldiers to shoot the demonstrators at the naval base from Warri.</seg>
<seg id=1809>In his report adopted on 15 November, the Commission concluded that operating aid to granted under Regulation 1540 / 98 have not solved the problem of the prices charged by South Korea.</seg>
<seg id=1810>I believe that the whole intentions is very reassuring, but in the meantime, the fact is that our shipyards are closing their doors.</seg>
<seg id=1811>Question No 38 by (H-0868 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1812>I understand, Commissioner, that you do not want to change your decision, despite the fact that ten Member States oppose such duties.</seg>
<seg id=1813>This initiative is based on a Council Regulation amending the regulation, which defines the current GSP.</seg>
<seg id=1814>I represent some farmers and so I am very concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1815>We are working in committee, we did not take this week, Poul Nielson absence due to travel in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg id=1816>We are working on the safeguard clause and if Mr Clegg needs arguments, to speak with his beet, I hold them at its disposal.</seg>
<seg id=1817>I would like to thank Mr Liikanen for his reply, which is in all points very positive and welcome.</seg>
<seg id=1818>I will discuss it with my services when the budgetary resources for next year are defined.</seg>
<seg id=1819>At the moment, the efforts made by my services and I seek to limit the consequences of the distance between the parties and the future Court.</seg>
<seg id=1820>Following the example of specialized courts in patent law of Düsseldorf, Munich and other German cities, but also of London, a competent Community court for Community patent should be very specialised.</seg>
<seg id=1821>In order to prevent this provisional situation does not take a definitive nature, the Commission, on 13 July of last year, pointed out in a letter to the Member States affected their obligation to indicate which are their courts of competent as regards Community trade mark.</seg>
<seg id=1822>As the honourable Member knows, a complaint in itself does not have any influence on the progress of the project concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1823>Question No 47 by (h 0877 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1824>This means that the Commission does not make use of the legal means at its disposal which are only in the direction heard in the regulation.</seg>
<seg id=1825>The question is how to address these students to understand that, when they follow this academic round and complete it in Great Britain, they have the right to have results.</seg>
<seg id=1826>The King, elected for a limited period, could, for example, be chosen among the Finnish MEPs most deserving.</seg>
<seg id=1827>It can also be seen as a question of competition, since we can continue to practise of duty-free sales in the southern part of the Baltic Sea, the line between Stockholm and Helsinki, whilst they are banned on the line between Umeå and Vasa.</seg>
<seg id=1828>We have to remedy the situation by stimulating and encouraging the multilingual content, since it is an absolutely crucial issue for the success of the European area of content.</seg>
<seg id=1829>The problem which worries me most is that small businesses do not always have sufficient guarantees, or the commercial precedents set to offer the investors.</seg>
<seg id=1830>To conclude the ambitious development of this European e-content programme, we need to simplify and secure the procedures envisaged.</seg>
<seg id=1831>That is why measures of public subsidies in favour of the content industry in the EU (their usefulness showed) must also aim for a high level of culture and education and to cultural diversity.</seg>
<seg id=1832>In addition, there are the communication networks which need content to fulfil their virtual area constantly and which is taken for granted to subject the content, to squeeze them and exploit them without really worrying about the Rules of production.</seg>
<seg id=1833>Mr President, I welcome the launch of this programme - content and would like to draw attention to two aspects.</seg>
<seg id=1834>That is why I support the amendments which call for the adoption of specific actions in the field of new technologies.</seg>
<seg id=1835>Firstly, the Commission is pleased that Parliament stresses the social and cultural dimension digital content.</seg>
<seg id=1836>Assessment and management of environmental noise</seg>
<seg id=1837>Indeed I am grateful for the support that the Christian Democrats, and also part of the Liberal Group, have brought to this specific amendment, in order to begin to limit the level of noise pollution from aircraft.</seg>
<seg id=1838>It is only this year, six years late, and insisting pressure from the French government, the Commission presented its proposal for harmonised noise indicators are.</seg>
<seg id=1839>It is a moderate proposal Scandinavia has already stricter standards than those proposed for 2012.</seg>
<seg id=1840>Orly, Schiphol, Barcelona and others meet strict standards already.</seg>
<seg id=1841>Another important point made by us and which will be of all its importance in the context of the problems of noise caused by aircraft, concerns the need to lay down additional indicators of noise in addition to that mentioned by the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=1842>The lack of common standards in the European Union, we have seen situations of glaring distortion of competition between airports and a lack of equality between citizens of the various Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1843>This is why I find the amendments of my colleague, Bernd Lange so important.</seg>
<seg id=1844>First of all, I must say that I welcome this report.</seg>
<seg id=1845>It was the idea of principle behind Amendment No 36, although I think that this idea is not yet sufficiently matured.</seg>
<seg id=1846>We must check that carefully and adopt the combined approach in both areas, i.e. to fix limit values for each source of emissions on the one hand and on the other hand, to define quality standards for these emissions.</seg>
<seg id=1847>It took us more time and I regret that we did not have it, although in general, I support the framework directive.</seg>
<seg id=1848>As soon as the Member States provide comparable information, the Commission will take into account the question of limit values at Community level, as well as other measures in order to reduce the number of people affected by the noise and to refer it to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1849>Food additives other than colours and sweeteners</seg>
<seg id=1850>These are the three criteria.</seg>
<seg id=1851>Thank you, Mrs Grossetête, I feel solidarity of your cause, because if you have a carrot beyond the throat, all I have said a cat in the throat, as stated here, but the flu runs somewhat here.</seg>
<seg id=1852>Furthermore, in the event of chronic dietary problems, the risk of cancer is increasing.</seg>
<seg id=1853>It can also proved that the Commission did not have the appropriate instruments to intervene appropriately.</seg>
<seg id=1854>Tomorrow, a new step on the agenda of our colleague Mrs Paulsen, the Liberal Group, will then be feet again and will have the opportunity to improve the present directive.</seg>
<seg id=1855>The Member States and the Commission now have a better instrument to ensure that Community legislation on animal nutrition is properly implemented and to ensure that, if crisis situations are in third countries, prompt reactions are possible.</seg>
<seg id=1856>We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities and that until now, it was mainly the cities were ‘ the poor relations' in this matter.</seg>
<seg id=1857>The process of planning must be implemented in a way right and innovative.</seg>
<seg id=1858>The multiannual 2000-2004 programme for sustainable development in urban environment is an appropriate instrument to achieve this, as well as the implementation of Agenda 21 an excellent means of coordination and development of actions.</seg>
<seg id=1859>The reduction in transport and the abandonment of fossil fuels for local are needed to achieve a change from the point of view of climatic threats that we know today.</seg>
<seg id=1860>Many voices suggested that this budget was too low.</seg>
<seg id=1861>It is expected that the main partners in this context, the Commission and the networks of local authorities in which the legal liability is to develop and implement policies relating to sustainable development of urban environment.</seg>
<seg id=1862>The European Court of Justice and even the WTO bodies responsible for resolving disputes consider that the precautionary principle is applied in relation to the environment or public health, and sometimes even against Europeans, as demonstrated by the case pending of cheese made from milk straight from.</seg>
<seg id=1863>The aim should not be a restriction of the damage or its compensation, the aim must be to prevent any harmful effects on health or the assets of persons.</seg>
<seg id=1864>Since 1996, the European Parliament decided in favour of a ban on the use of meat meal in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only we had been listened to.</seg>
<seg id=1865>An absolute scientific certainty on the new products or substances does not exist and will not exist.</seg>
<seg id=1866>To conclude, if the precautionary principle must be implemented effectively and credible, it is vital to bring all key players, including the representatives of civil society in the political choices surrounding its implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1867>Finally, health and the environment must take precedence over other considerations, particularly those of economic order.</seg>
<seg id=1868>An essential condition related to the application of the precautionary principle is that the concerns about the possible harmful effects are equipped with a scientific basis.</seg>
<seg id=1869>Only yesterday, in Lisbon, an American professor George Carlo, who has been given a study on the effect of the waves on human health by Food and Drugs Administration, revealed that the use of mobile telephones is likely to cause the appearance of brain tumours, of Alzheimer's disease and injuries in the skin.</seg>
<seg id=1870>Mr President, the environment and public health are similar to a machine complexity is such that it is necessary to monitor and control its multiple functions in order to be able to intervene and prevent therefore problems.</seg>
<seg id=1871>The application of this principle must avoid at all costs linking innovation and economic activity that generates the timidity and industrial opposition to progress, to become a means to distort competition.</seg>
<seg id=1872>The House will have noticed that the Commission agrees with most of the issues raised in the motion for a resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1873>The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=1874>Article 2 sanctions the right to life and every time in Spain terrorism kills a person, it is the whole of the European Union who feels involved in what is one of its most important principles.</seg>
<seg id=1875>Our intention is not to replace the legitimately established institutions, but to encourage them to protect our rights and our freedoms without making concessions to terror.</seg>
<seg id=1876>Votes</seg>
<seg id=1877>It also recalled the observation of the Council on the classification of budget lines on the draft of the early retirement of the Commission and on the administrative expenditure of the fisheries agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1878>(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1879>I think that it is not present any more!</seg>
<seg id=1880>They will feel that the number of 23.428 is inadequate, however, they will be pleased with the area of growth which is open to them.</seg>
<seg id=1881>This omission, which started from the middle of last year, as we had feared a dramatic fall in the rate of adoption of projects and of payments so that the annual implementation of the authorisation of this Fund was less than 1% at the end of June 2000.</seg>
<seg id=1882>This text is an ideal preferential treatment to close the Secretary-General of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id=1883>Before I start, they said to me: 'it is Christmas, and us, in Bergamo, we celebrate Christmas and Saint Lucia.</seg>
<seg id=1884>In particular, we are very critical of the production of agricultural products and the use of information means of the EU to sell this surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1885>Mr President, I voted in favour of the report García-Margallo y Marfil, which concerns the taxation of services provided by electronic means.</seg>
<seg id=1886>Mr President, I will try, before 2004, to do something for Malta by making a statement in favour of it.</seg>
<seg id=1887>Even so, I say this with a certain solemnity: it is the maximum which I can accept of Europe, for me, too liberal!</seg>
<seg id=1888>The target date would encourage the posts to develop and modernise still their services and would facilitate planning and investment in the market.</seg>
<seg id=1889>They will continue to put pressure on the money they gain the distribution beyond the bounds of the 150 grams enables them to strengthen their position.</seg>
<seg id=1890>The liberalisation of postal services proposed by the Commission is neither suitable nor consistent, that is why I voted for the report and all the amendments which express the same direction.</seg>
<seg id=1891>De Roo report (A5-0378 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1892>Not being convinced of their compatibility with the WTO, we also have reservations about amendments 17,18,27,30 and 31.</seg>
<seg id=1893>A globalisation which violates the most basic human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1894>That would be contrary to the respect for national identity (Article 6 (3) of the EC Treaty).</seg>
<seg id=1895>It should be stressed that the linguistic minorities, instead of there being crushed by the globalization of the Internet, found new openings cultural and economic.</seg>
<seg id=1896>Mr President, in the absence of other results, the haggling of Nice will have clarified the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1897>The tone of the joint resolution is, from this point of view, far too one-sided.</seg>
<seg id=1898>Delaying the publication of the written conclusions - which are not yet officially available at the moment, four days later - shows the difficulty in writing clear decisions in confusion.</seg>
<seg id=1899>The only way in the future to avoid dangerous conflicts, it is still on the subject of traditional concept according to which Europe is based on mutual respect for the national communities.</seg>
<seg id=1900>The Nice Summit concluded Sunday by an agreement which should lead to a draft Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1901>The resolution on the Nice Summit, which has just been voted, does not reflect it.</seg>
<seg id=1902>Finally, I would like to refer to the social policy, on which I France at the presentation of its presidency, but which ultimately remains a hands full with very little of it, despite the declarations of intent and the lines of the documents to the extremely vague and clearly inadequate content in relation to the existing problems and to the enormous dissatisfaction, whose demonstration of workers in Nice will have been an important expression also.</seg>
<seg id=1903>Of course, nothing has changed for the really important issues such as taxes, taxes, social policy, asylum and immigration.</seg>
<seg id=1904>The striking fact of the debate on Nice is the image of a treaty finally without father or mother, since it is not over anybody. the French Presidency illprepared for excuses, rather than clearly accept the results of the IGC and their reasons and the political groups, which correspond to the governments of the Member States, increased their criticisms.</seg>
<seg id=1905>On the contrary, the power of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power.</seg>
<seg id=1906>If we had been able to see these consequences at the conclusion of the Treaty of Chicago during the year of my birth – 1944, no exemption from tax for fuel and other equipment for aircraft would probably have been agreed.</seg>
<seg id=1907>Zero risk does not exist, the scientists or at least the policies must apply the criteria of proportionality, consider the risks uncertain and assume their responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id=1908>This House but also fought so that this reduction in funds allocated to the innovative actions is offset by the use of framework of flexibility, as defined in a statement on the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1909>Everyone has a part to play, because we are moving is a global market in which it is undeniable, and in fact the innovations will enable Europe to keep its place among the big of technological change in new industries and, in particular, information technologies, on the assumption, of course, that they are given sufficient financial resources and a realistic and appropriate support.</seg>
<seg id=1910>During the previous speeches, some serious words were in relation to the budget of EUR 400 million is really only a minimum for funding and it will be necessary, during the second half of the year, to take advantage of the opportunities for additional appropriations offered by the flexibility instrument, as the report notes.</seg>
<seg id=1911>In my opinion, it needs to be automatically accompanied by the loss of European added value, contrary to the conclusion of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1912>As we all know, in the European Union, unemployment is concentrated on the least developed economically territories and technological, above all the territories of Objective 1, there is a need for innovative actions are not just a technical, but they come from an explicit desire to develop the economy and employment.</seg>
<seg id=1913>When I go in my home region, the East of England, and I see absolutely no local authority used the money that it received during the last period, I doubt that we have evidence of the effectiveness which we will need in future to welcome new communities.</seg>
<seg id=1914>Mr President, my first words must be to inform Markov of my thanks and appreciation for the constructive presentation, highly qualified and seriousness of the draft communication on these innovative actions of the ERDF for the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id=1915>Energy efficiency and the aspects of environmental policy are not forgotten in these guidelines they can give rise to innovative measures under the third issue, which concerns the regional identity and sustainable development.</seg>
<seg id=1916>We wish, however, that the projects are selected at regional level, as understood it and also Mr Berend in his speech.</seg>
<seg id=1917>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1918>That is why we call in this report and the three additional amendments that the Commission multiply the efforts to impose the international procedures of the WTO ’ s dispute settlement.</seg>
<seg id=1919>It seems to me that the Commissioner must show the industry to do everything in its power to respond to this external threat hanging over it.</seg>
<seg id=1920>Finally, of course, we hope that, on 18 December, at the meeting of the Group of Six OECD, vivendi 'ships' is examined.</seg>
<seg id=1921>But it seems that the finishing line is always postponed so that we never reach it.</seg>
<seg id=1922>As you all know, this procedure will take more than six months.</seg>
<seg id=1923>For the large corporations for their political lawyers, to demand less State only means than the state and its funding must be at their sole disposal.</seg>
<seg id=1924>But to do so, so that the process makes it possible to consolidate the shipbuilding industry and employment and to reassure the families which depend on it, it is necessary to pursue aid beyond 31 December 2000 because, on the market, we are not on an equal footing, there is unfair competition and dumping.</seg>
<seg id=1925>Improving the competitiveness of shipyards in the EU is encouraged by the Commission, but given the massive dumping of price applied by Korea, the possible improvement in productivity is not enough.</seg>
<seg id=1926>It also stressed that the existence of this mechanism was not to create distortions of competition within the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1927>The presence of the nuclear submarine having a damage in the waters of the Bay of Algeciras unfortunately been turned into a diplomatic conflict between a military power and nuclear colonial and a Member State second-class, according to the latest classification of Nice, which does not assert its rights and is put in front of child explanations.</seg>
<seg id=1928>When, by means of the medical part broadcast in the country 's owner - in other words, by means of the British press – it was discovered that the disease was serious, instead of changing this centre, they have changed the classification of the centre.</seg>
<seg id=1929>Of course we await with interest the response of the Commission to see whether the objective has been achieved.</seg>
<seg id=1930>Mr President, I too would first of all like to express my condolences to the families of the murdered councillor and the Members of the Partido Popular, and to reject the fascist barbarity of ETA and the groups which protect it.</seg>
<seg id=1931>I also think that it would be appropriate for the submarine Tireless is led to the United Kingdom should be rectified as quickly as possible, when the appropriate climate conditions allow.</seg>
<seg id=1932>The honourable Members asked whether the Commission considers that the Directive 89 / 618 / Euratom on information to the public on the applicable measures to protect health and the attitude to be adopted in the event of a radiological emergency and Directive 96 / 29 / Euratom setting basic standards relating to the health protection of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation applied in the case of the submarine and which measures had been taken accordingly.</seg>
<seg id=1933>If it is better than our advisers lawyer, I look forward to hearing it, so I go back to Article 37.</seg>
<seg id=1934>One aspect of the Euratom Treaty is the transport of radioactive waste of an EU Member State to another, but, like Gibraltar been part, of course, the United Kingdom, any transport of waste will be part of the United Kingdom to another without crossing another Member State of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1935>It is my view that is enough for him just to win the trust of the people living in the rock.</seg>
<seg id=1936>However, we see that a Member State which deals with public opinion in another Member State as it would to any state in the world, as if, in fact, it has no affectio societatis there fifty years after the start of European society, as if European solidarity was by no means progress.</seg>
<seg id=1937>It is a fact that, at a time, the only operating submarine in British waters was a German submarine.</seg>
<seg id=1938>There are discussed, but the citizens, to be based on their knowledge and intuition, direct their attention to the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1939>It is clear that the decline in investment in new military equipment linked to the restrictions of the military budget decided by the Labour government in the future more cases of withdrawal of military equipment for basic repair.</seg>
<seg id=1940>On the other hand, it extends, contrary to what some people would like this, with the classification of ports can be broken down submarines, or to the technical issues of safety of nuclear reactors and the conditions under which a submarine must answer to be sent to repair in another place.</seg>
<seg id=1941>It would be necessary, to help them more, ask the Community institutions to increase the financial resources, humans and materials of the UNHCR.</seg>
<seg id=1942>I ask the Commission to increase this aid with the UNHCR again and also to indicate the latter as coordinating body in all their contracts with NGOs.</seg>
<seg id=1943>It must therefore be able to have access to the civilian victims and its staff on the ground should be able to spread themselves safely and have the necessary resources to carry out their tasks.</seg>
<seg id=1944>On 22 November, the Commission adopted a communication on the establishment of a common asylum procedure and on the granting of a uniform refugee status valid throughout the Union; it is towards this objective which the common European asylum system defined in Tampere tightening.</seg>
<seg id=1945>I will conclude by paying tribute to the work that Mrs Ogata has done for the UNHCR and by welcoming Mr Ruud Lubbers at his new post.</seg>
<seg id=1946>We believe it is important to promote a political amnesty in Yugoslavia for the restoration of democracy, but it also seems important to us to condemn without doubt the resumption of incursions and terrorist activities to the border between Kosovo and Serbia, Albania, because they refer to an alarming what happened during the conflict in Kosovo, where Western powers have certain responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1947>Our resolution of compromise is clear in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.</seg>
<seg id=1948>I also call on the President Kostunica to explain what has happened people like Mr Ukshin Hoti, whose fate, that we are completely ignore, is of great interest to us.</seg>
<seg id=1949>I also agree with the use of KFOR, in order to avoid any attempt to violence in the Presevo Valley.</seg>
<seg id=1950>I agree with the measures now by KFOR to deal with the problem and I continue to call on all parties in moderation.</seg>
<seg id=1951>B5 0916 / 2000 by Mr Barón Crespo and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1952>This clause was agreed with the Moneda palace of in March 1990 and I know because I had the privilege to be present at the time of taking possession of President alwyn, after the referendum which put an end to General Pinochet ’ s regime.</seg>
<seg id=1953>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak on the joint resolution that we will obviously vote.</seg>
<seg id=1954>It is necessary for the international community to exercise its right of democratic oversight, not as interference in the internal affairs of an independent country, but as a political process, cautious and prevention.</seg>
<seg id=1955>The situation in the prisons and police stations is totally unacceptable, particularly because of the abuse and torture are widespread.</seg>
<seg id=1956>This approach would be exactly similar to that seen in Western Europe and the Minister hikmet Sami Turk, faced with these protests, deferred the transfer, so that a social and political consensus on reform of the prisons develops in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1957>There is urgency and that is why we decided to put this item on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1958>It is on trial on 8 January is accused him for having taken part in a meeting of Tunisian opponents in France, which also it denies.</seg>
<seg id=1959>When the campaigners and those responsible for these associations are to meet the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, their homes are surrounded by police and those who go there are being attacked in the streets by men as a civilian.</seg>
<seg id=1960>The second problem is basically only one example of the many persecution.</seg>
<seg id=1961>My group, like this House, is particularly sensitive to the human rights situation in Tunisia and the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1962>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us keep a little measure please.</seg>
<seg id=1963>The negotiations went very well, I am delighted that we have made much progress in these negotiations, which I hope will reach the conclusion that made reference to the honourable Member.</seg>
<seg id=1964>Several Members referred to the situation of the prisoners in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1965>B5 0912 / 2000 by Mr Van Hecke, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1966>We could not be, I believe, Mr President, Commissioner, to withdraw this attitude.</seg>
<seg id=1967>The military seized power in this context, which, as always, has worsened the situation.</seg>
<seg id=1968>This attitude is well in the continuity of the policy of French imperialism.</seg>
<seg id=1969>The Commission is also very concerned about the recent outbreaks of violence.</seg>
<seg id=1970>The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1971>Unfair competition can contribute to downgrade the quality of the working environment in the shipbuilding sector, to reduce the technical training and generate a loss of jobs and carrying out, later on, with a monopoly situation, which would be detrimental to the world trade.</seg>
<seg id=1972>Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting.</seg>
<seg id=1973>That is why I thank all my colleagues for the contribution they have made, particularly at the stage of the amendments, as well as the experts from the Commission which valuable aid to licence to finalise this resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1974>The adoption of the social agenda by the Nice European Council satisfies us greatly and we hope that the Member States will take this opportunity to promote the development and the coordination of social security systems and care for the elderly and to promote other measures which will ensure the reintegration into working life, as is the lifelong learning.</seg>
<seg id=1975>The promotion of lifelong learning, a subject mentioned by another speaker - is a subject which I also support.</seg>
<seg id=1976>Of course, the people of more than 60 or 70 years can still make many good things, but it is not right to depend for their income they provide.</seg>
<seg id=1977>In its monthly bulletin of July 2000, the European Central Bank has launched several urgent warnings on this point.</seg>
<seg id=1978>For my part, I believe that the Member States are better able to solve this problem by means of their legislative instruments.</seg>
<seg id=1979>With its proposals for a working life in old age, society is gaining a generation.</seg>
<seg id=1980>The promises on pensions should be held, pensions have yet to be carried out by the fund these countries without their rules being to the detriment of the common monetary policy in the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1981>We have seen the most important of social revolutions 100 to over the last 150 years, when our life expectancy has doubled.</seg>
<seg id=1982>It only gives its full meaning to the mathematical longer lives from which medical progress made.</seg>
<seg id=1983>They were made subsidise - all the company took part in it - of older employees left their jobs but no young worker was committed and many jobs have been lost.</seg>
<seg id=1984>The family policy and tax should on the contrary, ensure that women and men who have family obligations can freely decide whether or not to have a Community activity.</seg>
<seg id=1985>My brother and I joined there.</seg>
<seg id=1986>The next steps in the field of public health are addressed rather to health issues and care for the elderly and to promote a healthy old age.</seg>
<seg id=1987>Mr President, I accept the amendment tabled by Mr Pronk, both on 2 and 3, in which he asks that the text be modified and insists on the concept of demographic development, instead of an ageing population.</seg>
<seg id=1988>It does not duplicate advertising or promotional operations of the operators of the networks or those of public authorities.</seg>
<seg id=1989>Mr President, the Committee on Budgets has also been of the opinion that it is, in principle, in favour of the Commission proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1990>That is why it is very important to achieve a balance which could be achieved by measures for the promotion of sales outlets and advertising.</seg>
<seg id=1991>I think that with regard to marketing and sales, learning as a framework for the life should be placed at the centre of the education programmes because new technologies, the management of the search for outlets provide completely new opportunities for modern logistics.</seg>
<seg id=1992>First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Dary for his excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=1993>The next item is the discussions export speech.</seg>
<seg id=1994>There should be no special premiums and advertising for products which are not required.</seg>
<seg id=1995>We each have enough to eat, so if we make the promotion of a product that will obviously militate against the use of another product.</seg>
<seg id=1996>Amendments Nos 18 and 24, first part, by the time during which the themes and products which could be proposed will be assessed, are reduced by three to two years in order to improve the efficiency of the instrument of promotion.</seg>
<seg id=1997>In the Greek version, Mrs Haug juta is introduced as rapporteur to disproved, involving a man, and Mr marcuse ferler As rapporteur for women, involving a woman.</seg>
<seg id=1998>It is a good example of how small changes in practice can have significant effects.</seg>
<seg id=1999>It is temporarily last Friday in Strasbourg, in other words, Strasbourg loses 12 days of the presence of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=2000>Furthermore, I would like to wish all and, in particular, to those Members who took the trouble to assist, this Friday, with this last sitting of the year 2000 in Strasbourg, a merry Christmas and a new century which is good, but above all wise.</seg>
