<seg>Europe after breeds shared House</seg>
<seg>A common feature of all of the extreme right in Europe is its racism and the fact that they use the immigration problem as political lever.</seg>
<seg>the Lega North in Italy, the Vlaams block in the Netherlands, the supporters of Le Pen's National Front in France, are examples of parties and movements, about the common theme was: rejection of immigration and to call for a simplified policy in order to regulate it.</seg>
<seg>Whilst individuals such as Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen and come shark? (and must not, unfortunately, soon to be) Once again, the race question from European politics is not about to disappear.</seg>
<seg>An ageing indigenous population open borders and an increase in racist fragmentation of the European countries.</seg>
<seg>The big parties of the right and left the Centre set themselves, to the problem, in which they were its head in the sand and contrary to all expectations hoped may soon disappear.</seg>
<seg>However, it does not become, as the history of racism points clearly to America.</seg>
<seg>The race relations was reported in the USA over decades, and it is this very day, in the centre of the political debate went so far that racial segregation has just as important as the income to establish - if not even more important - about political affections and attitudes.</seg>
<seg>The first step in order in the race to deal is to understand the causes and consequences of racist hostilities, even if that means to detect unpleasant facts.</seg>
<seg>In the United States that have a large number of research in economic and political sociology, psychology carried out scientific research has shown that these people have clearly different race less each other.</seg>
<seg>The whites are less willing to support social expenditure because they believe that this strong minorities to favour. racist divided societies have less efficient governments, corruption and nepotism, more crime and less public benefits per dollar tax revenue.</seg>
<seg>That means that those answer does not have to read to eliminate the heterogeneity and to create rassisch homogenous communities, but we must recognise the reality behind this question, in order to be able to draw up a sound public policy on the race relations.</seg>
<seg>Of course, there is no agreement among us on this is to be done.</seg>
<seg>Some restate plans in order to prefer minorities in the allocation of jobs, access to vocational schools and public procurement contracts.</seg>
<seg>These measures regarded as a kind of compensation for the injustices in former start to do what is even more important role models, to coin / shape to help to overcome other and perhaps automatic discrimination remains.</seg>
<seg>Others reject such action and say that it is only one on competition policy not respect for differences in connection with a free market and family values in order to create jobs and help for minorities, that the families of the people together-remained colour.</seg>
<seg>The latter is for each policy crucially. one of the main causes of poverty in the United States is the major spread of budgets with alone? (visual parents are mothers) under the black people.</seg>
<seg>However, it is the right answer to the question of how we should deal with the races, an excellent job in the US policy.</seg>
<seg>Of course, minorities have made progress in the direction of greater integration and better economic success.</seg>
<seg>In the 1950er years were not even allowed black people in the bus to take place in front, today, are two of the most important players in US foreign policy colour.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, we can be sure that politicians right-wing in America further on the "race card as a practical way to take.</seg>
<seg>Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, the former assistant to Nixon and Reagan, which appeared in the last elections as an independent presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg>It has recently published a successful book entitled: "the death of the West subject: like extinction social classes and the invasion of immigrants in our country and our civilisation jeopardise".</seg>
<seg>But for every book like this, there are ten different with a serious analysis of the race question in America.</seg>
<seg>political analyses and debates on the race relations are terribly behind ago in Europe.</seg>
<seg>The question is often taken too much on zuwanderungsquoten and border arrangements which restrict them, and not on the related social problems and the opportunities arising from increasingly rassisch mixed Europe.</seg>
<seg>Of course a clear immigration policy is necessary in order to avoid the accumulation of illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg>But that cannot be norm controls at the border with Mexico is not everything, that is to say the American policy race question in the country.</seg>
<seg>Europe is rich and ages quickly; the Europeans are, generous care programmes abgepolstert prepared 'no longer "dirty work, let us say in agriculture or leather industry to transfer.</seg>
<seg>increased immigration is already doing inevitable.</seg>
<seg>Soon the Europeans are willing to accuse the United States to any error in its policy on minorities and every sign of racism across the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg>during the reading of the European press is often notes into racial superiority complex issues with the United States: the Americans have problems with against racism; we are immune, apart from a few mad neonazis, skinheads and such like.</seg>
<seg>In the last few weeks have shown that the race problem inside Europe from Paris to Amsterdam much deeper and reductions / goes back, as in the USA - to the sad fact that race relations is inherently difficult and that trusting and cooperative approach does not away-come easily on racial segregation.</seg>
<seg>If Europe does not start large parties, racial tensions in Europe more seriously and to examine and understand, race "one of their most important priorities do for individuals such as Mr Le Pen to see need to fill the gaps in their message of hate. Alberto alesina are a Professor of economic science at the University of havard; Francesco giavazzi, Professor of economic science, at the Bocconi University in Milan belongs to the group of economic advisers to the President of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg>The French exceptions fight.</seg>
<seg>The attention in Europe today is rightly focused on enlargement and the Constitution, which are prepared to time between the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>But the result of some gepl√§nkel galliens with the European Commission should determine the fate of the new, enlarged Europe, not less serious.</seg>
<seg>France has decided unilaterally to ignore the Stability and Growth Pact by a perspective deficit which is far beyond the limit value of 3% of gross domestic product? (of GDP), adopting.</seg>
<seg>The French people find themselves to the rational rigour of their thinking to property, but when it comes to financial provisions, not Descartes but lack of transparency is needed.</seg>
<seg>France was one of the leading critics of Ireland, when the Irish government reduced its budget surplus, which was at the time of 4% of GDP in the year 2000 by only 0.5%.</seg>
<seg>Other countries have violated the Stability Pact, but France is the first country to have this open to ha controversial contempt.</seg>
<seg>But something that should come as no surprise to anyone.</seg>
<seg>France is simply to your-succeeded its eingefleischten habits, namely to assess its own culture as something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg>For example, France is preventing persistent reforms of the common agricultural policy gea (?) by its right of veto.</seg>
<seg>As already know, the gea children represents a substantial and very undeserved gift to the prosperous European? (particularly French) farmers at the expense of farmers in the developing countries, fight for survival, and consumers in the European Union.</seg>
<seg>France tries to resort to an old policy to relieve namely unprofitable private companies in the margins of the collapse of the taxpayers' money.</seg>
<seg>The EU Commissioner for competition policy, Mario Monti, must not lose this fight subject: he needs the support of those who believe in the market and in the equal treatment of all.</seg>
<seg>In this case, the situation is quite simple.</seg>
<seg>The French Government plans to society Alstom alarmed, a company which a number of manufacture high-tech products including the HST which developed French high-speed things but recently went bankrupt.</seg>
<seg>The French Government maintains that it will never sacrifice in its plan to save Alstom, a plan with all known reasons of dirigisme subject: preservation of jobs, the protection of investors, etc.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the French Government has, since it deals with Alstom to manufacture high-tech society, which maintains the map and research and development, investment in R & D is good for growth.</seg>
<seg>Alstom by the nationalisation of the company to save is manifestly untrue.</seg>
<seg>The company consists of many different parts. some of it brings benefit is bankrupt, others: we have to do is obvious to break the society.</seg>
<seg>The profitable parts, such as the HST work will find easy to buyers; works which do not have a profitable should be closed.</seg>
<seg>The French taxpayers' money is better spent on the support of the redundant workers than on subsidies in order to keep alive unprofitable companies.</seg>
<seg>It is important that the European Commission does not authorise France to engage in competition policy like apparent in its budgetary deficits derogations.</seg>
<seg>The Commission must prevent public aid to private companies in France, just as it has brought such subsidies in any other EU Member State.</seg>
<seg>The Commission has already made some progress on this front, as we know, this German Government forced to lift guarantees for public banks.</seg>
<seg>Alstom in particular France and in general should not form exceptions; they should have to adhere to the same standards.</seg>
<seg>If the Commission will appear failed to act, the European Union still more like the playing fields of French officials.</seg>
<seg>France has already played a leading role in the EU's foreign policy, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dominique de Villepin works and is more and more in the same way as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Europe into action.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, France is violating fundamental provisions of the common economic policy and the award of public aid to private companies.</seg>
<seg>Does the European Commission intend what is still remaining loses its credibility as a subordinate district in Paris to look like?</seg>
<seg>A defeat in the Alstom affair would have far-reaching consequences for Europe, not only for its competition policy.</seg>
<seg>The war on oil</seg>
<seg>For decades has America under democratic and republican a number of clear energy objectives has led presidencies, to be consistent as stable have to reduce oil prices, namely the world as possible; the oil consumption in the country as painless as possible; the dependence on foreign imports, to share where it is always possible to reduce; and the oil imports in several countries of origin.</seg>
<seg>Although it seems to be different, under the Bush administration, none of these objectives have been changed.</seg>
<seg>Many commentators believe shrubs set a new course, because the invasion of Iraq seems to run counter to these objectives.</seg>
<seg>A large increase in oil production in Iraq will probably increase the dependence of the United States of √∂l compared to other energy sources, because the world oil prices will probably collapsing in consequence of the additional offer.</seg>
<seg>In particular, this would mean an increase in return of the US dependence on imported oil from the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>The irony of the fact, however, is that the USA under the vorkriegsprogramm of the UN oil for food "? (exercised in the UN and not Saddam Hussein the level of Iraqi oil sales abroad certain) greater control of Iraqi oil sector than they will do so in the future, in a democratically governed Iraq.</seg>
<seg>If the Bush administration, stable, safe and cheap oil imports from many quarters aspired to, then it would have simply embargoes against countries such as Libya, Iran, Iraq, Sudan to lift and oil from there hereinschwabben to leave it.</seg>
<seg>But the American interests in the Iraqi oil did not come from its economic and energy policy.</seg>
<seg>The Bush Government recognised that the Iraqi oil is above all a key geopolitical lever.</seg>
<seg>who always controls the Iraqi oil, controls Iraq.</seg>
<seg>Saddam's power was based on the control of the second largest oil reserves of the world.</seg>
<seg>He has clearly understood the role played by the oil for the exercise of power.</seg>
<seg>With the possibility of an invasion and a defeat in mind, Saddam threatened to set off the oil fields in Iraq.</seg>
<seg>A majority of the subsequent destruction and looting of Iraqi oil pipelines mechanisms and reflects the widespread recognition that control of the oil resources the rule on Iraq.</seg>
<seg>In the US invasion provides an important priority was given to safeguarding the oil reserves.</seg>
<seg>The aim was not to extend the aid and to lower prices for the Americans to separate but Saddam from its power base and to use and stabilise a new Iraqi Government.</seg>
<seg>In Iraq future depends directly on the fate of the Iraqi oil production.</seg>
<seg>But the whims of oil, particularly in such obscure circumstances are difficult to see how the Bush Government will be able to achieve their objectives in Iraq in the next few years.</seg>
<seg>The logic is simple.</seg>
<seg>The United States must use the oil revenues, in order to make it easier for American taxpayers the burden of the financing of the regime change in Iraq.</seg>
<seg>All the plans of reconstruction in the long term, will depend on the ability of Iraq to export oil in large quantities.</seg>
<seg>If Iraq does not give its oil, President Bush knows his promises to the Iraqi which do not deliver American people or to the world community.</seg>
<seg>Before the invasion of the capacity of Iraqi oil production amounted to three million barrels per day.</seg>
<seg>Iraq will not be able to make its production within the time frame which forces, in order to establish an Iraqi government, this level.</seg>
<seg>Any increase in the Iraqi oil production needs to develop the oil fields considerable investment funds, a legal representation and political stability.</seg>
<seg>Not even the Bush government seems to meet these conditions in the near future.</seg>
<seg>The most important prerequisite for political stability, the increase in production capacity is.</seg>
<seg>historical examples from Iran, from Kuwait, Russia, and even Iraq shows that there is still some three years after the rereaching of political stability in order to increase significantly capacity and made to keep higher level.</seg>
<seg>Iraq needs to negotiate several years in order to draw up a new Constitution, to set up a legitimate and democratic government, the distribution of oil revenue at its various regions new investment laws to be attractive and its economic for foreigners.</seg>
<seg>It needs more time to negotiate with the international oil companies and neighbouring countries to carry out technical feasibility studies and rebuild its oil fields, to initiate and explore.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, a period of three years seems even optimistic, because it means that employment is over this time which Iraqis their own democratic government will have to establish and political stability.</seg>
<seg>There is no need to mention that the situation may be quite different.</seg>
<seg>The tensions can still remain for years.</seg>
<seg>No one should be surprised if the Iraqi oil production is even in a democratic government suddenly to a complete standstill.</seg>
<seg>Experience suggests that labour disputes and similar problems, which can prevent the oil production in democratic countries represent a greater threat than in undemocratic.</seg>
<seg>If Iraq cannot increase its promotion capacity in the next few years quickly, this will affect both the US foreign and their energy policy.</seg>
<seg>How do the United States want to finance the reconstruction of Iraq in the long term?</seg>
<seg>Who will be responsible for receiving a fragile Iraqi democracy alive?</seg>
<seg>The United States can maintain its employment when it the Iraqi people not food, health care and other basic services on offer?</seg>
<seg>These are disturbing questions, you do not remain in principle unanswerably so long not a stable, democratic regime in Iraq, the constant stream of oil exports can identify and guarantee.</seg>
<seg>murderer as guardians of human rights</seg>
<seg>If it would not be so deeply sad, we would have to laugh at it subject: Libya was elected to the chairman of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg>When caligula made its horse senators, at least not in blood stuck his hooves.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the procedure was perfectly legal subject: the Presidency rotates every year from one region to another.</seg>
<seg>This year has been Africa at the number to elect the President and appointed Libya.</seg>
<seg>Only the USA and Canada have voted against it.</seg>
<seg>Their forever sustainable disgrace the European countries have abstained from the vote.</seg>
<seg>It is a characteristic of the Constitution of the moral corruption of the UN that this decision was made just now, at this difficult time for the organisation.</seg>
<seg>President Bush has called on the United Nations to show that it is serious about Iraq: it will otherwise decisions they suffer the same fate as the SDN was shameful, which faced in the 1930s of aggressive policy of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy completely powerless.</seg>
<seg>Libya, precisely in the Presidency of the un-organization to choose what is responsible for human rights, is a negative impact on the legitimacy and the moral authority of the whole organisation.</seg>
<seg>Let us remember subject: Libya is a totalitarian tyranny, the head of state, aluminium-gaddafi Muammar links with extremist policy often unpredictable behaviour by supporting the dictators of the world.</seg>
<seg>It is heading, one of the most repressive regimes in the world, in which there is not even the illusion of elections and where the opposition is weighed down immediately.</seg>
<seg>under its control Libya supported terrorist organisations throughout the world - by the IRA to different Palestinian groups of extremists.</seg>
<seg>The the UN sanctions for the role played by the country with the accident involving the adulteration to-passenger plane, Scotland Lockerbie over a decade ago have not yet been repealed.</seg>
<seg>In the last ten years, the position of the United Nations has been constantly undermined as a symbol for the ideal of a peaceful world community.</seg>
<seg>It was completely unable to prevent the war in the Balkans, and at least in one case, Srebrenica, waited a Dutch peacekeeping force the worst massacre in Europe since 1945 side with Bosnian Serbs murdered 6000 defenceless Muslims.</seg>
<seg>A Dutch education committee granted later that the Dutch un-troop was complicated into this war crimes.</seg>
<seg>rwanda. have scarcely begun genocide ordered the peacekeeping measures for the responsible un-functionary the withdrawal of the un-troops from the country and left the field to the bloodiest racist massacre since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg>The name of the official is Kofi Annan.</seg>
<seg>- probably in vain - the attempt by the UN to give now in the Iraq crisis the impression it speaks with the voice of reason and the international legitimacy is depressing and pathetic to be called.</seg>
<seg>But at a time when the un-waffeninspekteure in Iraq seems like the Salvation Army which they send to ploughing a gangsters ties, can the fact that Libya, the Presidency will take on the Human Rights Commission, perhaps in history as the error which sealed the failure of an organisation with as much hope was brought into being.</seg>
<seg>organisations do not normally than and we have certainly too much raison d'Etat to ensure that the UN is dragging itself.</seg>
<seg>But it is only a shadow of what it should be, and be possible.</seg>
<seg>The UN today is nothing more than a word on hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg>On the advance authoritarianism</seg>
<seg>Like the judges of the Indonesian central court in Jakarta last Thursday sentenced to one year's imprisonment.</seg>
<seg>As an editor-in-chief of information weekly magazine speed, I am, in accordance with the judgment error, a wirtschaftsmagnaten called tomy winata critics have made possible by having its involvement in the event of fire on the South-East Asian textile market in jakarta. also said, I am responsible for the spread of lies of riots have stirred up.</seg>
<seg>I and other similar cases already a reference to the end of a further short-lived democratic experiment in Indonesia?</seg>
<seg>'' I supposedly stirred up riots which took place in March of last year, when almost two hundred rioters who spent themselves as a supporter winatas, attacked the office of speed, it threatens to set fire to bear down the staff and reporters injured.</seg>
<seg>In an attempt to resolve the situation peacefully, however, I was persuaded me to discussions on the central police station in Jakarta too gone. my frightening was police station, under the control of the mobs.</seg>
<seg>I was beaten and came, while the police away-saw.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately, many journalists with audio recorders and cameras came to aid.</seg>
<seg>The publication of its admissions caused a public outcry which forced once again Parliament to organise a public hearing.</seg>
<seg>The police chiefs of the country and Jakarta were appear in court and the leaders of the mobs were criminally prosecuted under sound public pressure.</seg>
<seg>But winata missed a police investigation, and just because he said that his supporters would be without its previous knowledge and his agreement action.</seg>
<seg>Then, it was reported the tables and even charge against Ahmad taufik, the author of the article, against the editor teuku iskandar Ali, drawn up and against me.</seg>
<seg>The legal procedures for many years have been marked by a number of suspicious developments, which all of us winata.</seg>
<seg>First, in the case of developed by the police and the public prosecutor documents have been presented, which have been so clearly false that the police accused two responsible.</seg>
<seg>However, the Court is aware of our request for postponement procedure to legal clarification of the situation created by the Public Prosecutor and the police off.</seg>
<seg>The proceedings against the two policemen seems to be deported.</seg>
<seg>One of the police has been encouraged to commander of the newly created? (and the USA financed) anti-terrorist unit in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg>The other is to have been sent on a fortbildungslehrgang for police officers.</seg>
<seg>Then, in the six months of the procedure, the chairman of the Committee dreik√∂pfigen judge suddenly has been appointed as the head of a city court which is one hour away from Jakarta.</seg>
<seg>One of my lawyers said that it did not happen to him in his 35-j√§hrigen career with Court yet one exchanges that a presidency leading judge during the current procedure.</seg>
<seg>The richterin, despite its transport, actually worked in another case in the same House more than chairman.</seg>
<seg>Our procedure to a judge took over the Presidency, which have already been winatas in civil proceedings against speed had a judgement.</seg>
<seg>Finally, winata perjury lay down with its opinion when he denied speed to have given an interview.</seg>
<seg>A audio recording of the telephone interview was played in court; the reporters who had the interview, as well as two editors as witnesses stated under oath; the official note from the telephone company was tabled before the courts as proof of the RUF and an expert came to the conclusion that the vote on the audio of tomy the winata was.</seg>
<seg>The judges, however, rejected the request of speed, on the arrest and prosecution winatas due to perjury and guessed themselves / advised announcement to report that we did.</seg>
<seg>After that, the judges has also been a refusal to our request to postpone the Court ruling by the solution of winatas perjury case.</seg>
<seg>In view of such a defective procedure, my condemnation and imprisonment took place a little surprise.</seg>
<seg>However, I am confident that we will prevail in the end when appointing higher speeds comes before the courts.</seg>
<seg>The Indonesian courts of the higher level are cleaner and the President of the Supreme Court are similar a staunch defender of democracy and press freedom, speed could an innovative victory for our democracy, as the decision of the Court of Justice of the United States in the case of the New York Times against Sullivan.</seg>
<seg>The obstacle to this decision defamatorische charges raised. ensures that American journalists can benefit public persons responsible.</seg>
<seg>In any country in the world, one knows better than in Indonesia that opinion and freedom of the press are detectable indicators of democratic development and that the criminalisation of journalist an early indication of authoritarianism.</seg>
<seg>In the 1950er Indonesia years was a liberal democracy in 1956, President Sukarno taken with the support of the military drastic measures against the press.</seg>
<seg>critical voices have been raised, calmly and the consolidation of uncontrolled power in July was more straightforward 1959 Sukarno offered by decree guided the "democracy".</seg>
<seg>In the first years after sukarnos fall in 1966 all the standards of a real democracy, including the freedom of the press has been repaired? (except the Communists).</seg>
<seg>But 1970er began in the early years President Suharto against the press to take further action and, finally, various media to ban a number of journalists and arrest.</seg>
<seg>After we had brought under control, the press rapidly different political rights were cut off and the Indonesian democracy failed again.</seg>
<seg>Since the fall suhartos in 1998 is Indonesia's third largest democratic country in the world and the largest Muslim democracy in history.</seg>
<seg>two parliamentary elections and two direct presidential election - including the recent round - was free, fair and peaceful and have proof of the fact that Islam and democracy can exist side by side.</seg>
<seg>The enemies of democracy but never sleep.</seg>
<seg>radical Islamic groups operate indiscriminate bombing and groups with strong authoritarian tendencies in the inner circles of President Megawati created.</seg>
<seg>But just Megawati has suffered a defeat in the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg>Will the newly elected President susilo continue journalists?</seg>
<seg>Will my condemnation and procedures and condemnations of colleagues bring about the end of hard-won third democracy in Indonesia?</seg>
<seg>The answer lies in the support which per-democratic activists in Indonesia can gain and abroad.</seg>
<seg>The loss of Indonesia - a potential beacon of hope for all per-democratic activists throughout the Muslim world - would be a terrible defeat.</seg>
<seg>The moral of the death penalty.</seg>
<seg>The United States because of their refusal to abolish the death penalty often criticized.</seg>
<seg>Now many, the abolition of the death penalty state is a prerequisite for a civilised criminal justice system.</seg>
<seg>Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker contradicts.</seg>
<seg>The European governments are totally against the death penalty - - in the European Union, it is completely banned - - and some Europeans regard the use of the death penalty in the United States as barbaric.</seg>
<seg>Many European intellectuals argue that not only the death penalty in general, but has a deterrent effect on criminals.</seg>
<seg>While it could afford Europe with crime rates, which have been in the past 50 years well below that of the United States, for a long time to adopt most crimes relatively "mild" it has been over the last 20 years to a drastic increase in crime rates.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, these figures are in America, partly due to the further use of penalties to please.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the death penalty belongs.</seg>
<seg>I am in favour of the implementation of certain persons convicted as a murderer, because - - and only because - - I believe that various murderers are deterred.</seg>
<seg>If I were not convinced of this, I would oppose the death penalty, for revenge and other possible motives should not as the basis for the policy of a state to serve.</seg>
<seg>The empirical research on the death penalty took its outcome, which was published in 1975 in the American economic review in the United States with an innovative study ehrlichs Isaac.</seg>
<seg>In some following studies the deterrent effect as many smaller described in others than stronger.</seg>
<seg>The existing data are more limited, and that is why we should draw its own conclusions not solely on the basis of econometric evidence.</seg>
<seg>Of course we cannot wait with political decisions on any form of punishment, until this evidence is complete.</seg>
<seg>But even these quantitative restricted data give reason to believe that the death penalty has a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg>Most people, mostly murderers, fear death, especially when it is quickly and with some certainty for committing murder.</seg>
<seg>Mr Hume made in his paper on suicide that 'still nobody shipyard away a life which was worth the effort to obtain.</seg>
<seg>Because our natural fear of death is so important. 'similar to schopenhauer expressed it as follows: "if there was that the schrecknisse of life they are outweighed by the schrecknisse of death, people put an end to their lives.</seg>
<seg>But the schrecknisse offers enormous resistance of death. '</seg>
<seg>The opponents of the death penalty is often, the state should not be no moral right to take someone living even so appalling murderer.</seg>
<seg>Anyone who believes in the deterrent effect of the death penalty, but it is absolutely wrong conclusion.</seg>
<seg>In order to understand the reason for it, we assume that for every executed? (instead of, for example, to life imprisonment sentenced murderer three murders) can be prevented, and it is a much smaller number than in the papers ehrlichs or other work on deterrent.</seg>
<seg>It follows that any murderer not executed three innocent victims would have to leave their lives.</seg>
<seg>In fact the government would be indirectly '' so many lives if they did not use the death penalty.</seg>
<seg>save three innocent lives for each executed person seems to be a very interesting and if equivalent per holding two lives are even saved seems convincing cost-benefit ratio.</seg>
<seg>Admittedly, the debate on the death penalty is becoming less powerful with a smaller number of save lives.</seg>
<seg>But if per holding one life could even be saved, that would be a worthwhile equivalent if the saved life is a much better, as the taken, as it would normally be the case.</seg>
<seg>Many people resist a balance between quality and be saved life.</seg>
<seg>But I see no reason to make such a comparison.</seg>
<seg>We think the people of a professional and criminal, deprived kills. victims had a serious life and leaves several children and a spouse.</seg>
<seg>We accept, it would be possible to protect the lives of innocent victims by the implementation of such a criminal.</seg>
<seg>It is clear to me that it must have greater weight to save the life of the victim than taking a criminal one's life.</seg>
<seg>Of course not all cases are so clear, but the improvement in the quality of the two life must be part of any sensible social policy.</seg>
<seg>That also helps to explain why the death penalty should only be used in the case of murder, but not with smaller crimes.</seg>
<seg>If in return for executions, for example, a reduction in the number of cases of theft is to be achieved, far more speaks for a mild form of punishment.</seg>
<seg>Although considerable attacks are understandably rape as cruel murder in the rigour level very close and calls for the death penalty to be heard in these cases, I am not in favour of it.</seg>
<seg>a convincing argument to use the death penalty only in murder cases is the "marginal deterrent".</seg>
<seg>If attacks on the death penalty would be the authors would have an incentive to kill their victims in order to be taken even? (that is the main reason why the severity of the sentences in general should be attached to the rigour level of crime).</seg>
<seg>The difficulty lies in the fact that the death penalty threatened murderers would go further in order to escape their arrest, and once again the death figures could increase.</seg>
<seg>While the marginal deterrent is an important factor, I believe that the attempt by the murderer to evade his arrest - - or perhaps at the expense of their own lives - an indirect proof that criminals are afraid of the death penalty.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the risk is preparing to execute innocent people may be serious problems for me.</seg>
<seg>my agreement with the death penalty has been greatly weakened if the number of becoming innocent was in fact so great as is often said.</seg>
<seg>I believe, however, that the appointment procedures in the United States offer an exceptionally high level of protection, not so much against unjustified convictions, but very much against unjustified executions, so that, if it is at all, only very few cases executed of innocent people.</seg>
<seg>With the development of the DNA identification this protection was still enormously expanded.</seg>
<seg>Another subject: the debate on the death penalty is essentially a debate about deterrence? (its effect those given in the length of drawn appeals to lose can).</seg>
<seg>I understand that there are some people who are sceptical about the evidence, although I believe that they are both in this regard and on the common sense to this issue.</seg>
<seg>The idea of people, even a murderer to take the life is worrying, but sometimes most unpleasant measures are needed in order to avoid even worse behaviour, which cost the life of innocent victims.</seg>
<seg>The people against Putin</seg>
<seg>I participated in the selection of Vladimir put in as successor to Russia's first democratically elected President, Mr Boris'tsin.</seg>
<seg>Now KGB and mafia structures govern Russia and manipulate the justice system, it is accepted that'tsin he wanted his successor, in order to avoid a future criminal prosecution.</seg>
<seg>But we, the elected President Putin, had the task of finding someone to protect in order to continue'tsin President's reforms, and not in order he and his family.</seg>
<seg>Mr'tsin was quite fearless and sought not his personal survival, but the survival of democratic idea, which we introduced in Russia.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, this idea is now due to the successor elected by us in danger.</seg>
<seg>I do not have the responsibility for the support from me.</seg>
<seg>We were not close friends, but him and I worked in critical situations, and I have never doubted that his sincerity.</seg>
<seg>Putin acts after their convictions.</seg>
<seg>The problem is that its convictions - - including their faith in the fact that Russia can only flourish when it is governed by one source of power - - is wrong.</seg>
<seg>This is a great mistake to Russia in the political risk.</seg>
<seg>No one is of course in this leading role, without committing mistakes, even fundamental, and this applies in particular in turbulent times.</seg>
<seg>Mr'tsin was not an exception, but we recognize their mistakes.</seg>
<seg>When it withdrew at the New Year's Eve 1999, for example, there asked. forgiveness for the fact that it had started the war in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg>Putin seems unable to recognise and acknowledge its mistakes and to maintain a policy for a long time, after the failure of the world are clear.</seg>
<seg>One of Mr'tsins' mistakes were its failure to give moral priorities at the top of its reform agenda.</seg>
<seg>Russia would have to regret the Stalinism and gulags system.</seg>
<seg>Without exception, the whole nation regret would have had to feel, as the Germans regret felt since 1945.</seg>
<seg>This omission is important because so unqualified belief in a central authority could lead to a situation in which the state has been back-conquered by the security services.</seg>
<seg>In fact the national regret the gulags era should have meant the prohibition of the Communist Party and the exclusion of the former KGB staff of political office as a direct result.</seg>
<seg>Although such political trials are involved in post office-communist societies, since both victim role and collaboration with widespread and the borders were often vague between them, a good solution has been found - - as in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg>because nothing has been done in Russia have remained intact security structures and could be a political comeback, which you have now.</seg>
<seg>The political resurrections of the KGB structures under Putin and their efforts to bring divergent views on the quiet transformed Russia into a country of the defectors.</seg>
<seg>It is impossible to make independent politicians and independent media in silence, without turning independent finance resources off, which is why the Kremlin concentrated attacks on the 'arks oily so-called under Putin'.</seg>
<seg>chodorkowskis Mikhail arrest and process has been orchestriert for precisely this reason.</seg>
<seg>The security services which control the Kremlin, hope to destroy resources by boosting independent finance independent political life in Russia.</seg>
<seg>Without independent intellectual bases a climate of fear is spreading.</seg>
<seg>But fear is not only demeaning, it also creates a bad government.</seg>
<seg>Mr'tsin understood intuitively that fear and centralised decision making are from top to bottom, no way to govern a modern country was to reform the relationship between citizens and state.</seg>
<seg>Mr Putin does not yet understood that a centralised political system is equally unable to understand and correct mistakes, as at that time in the Soviet era.</seg>
<seg>As a not very cultivated man Putin Russia in full and deep sincerity means in the same decomposition which marked the collapse of the Soviet states.</seg>
<seg>People are beginning to understand this.</seg>
<seg>They recognise that cannot be implemented have desire to create a strong and effective modern state, because a modern state is not governed from above, but of informed citizens who force their rulers to see and correct its mistakes.</seg>
<seg>Putin seems to indicate the inability of his government.</seg>
<seg>This is one of the reasons why Russia since the latest as aggressively against its neighbour, Ukraine and Georgia and that is trying to maintain its military presence in Trans-Dniestria places the breakaway region of Moldova.</seg>
<seg>By making its influence abroad Russia's current close, the Kremlin believes to be able to persuade the Russians at home its omnipotence.</seg>
<seg>In view of the limited debates in Russia and the ability of the Kremlin to manipulate elections a change of government is the only option for those who want to keep the democratic idea in Russia.</seg>
<seg>It is pointless to keep illusions.</seg>
<seg>Those who oppose Putin must decide what they want, and explain the fact that, if the regime does not adhere to the Constitution, which is right to force them to every few resources to it.</seg>
<seg>The question of energy cannot be decided in Russia any longer solely at the ballot box.</seg>
<seg>As in the Ukraine, Lebanon and Kirgizistan are determined will it in the streets.</seg>
<seg>taxation and expenditure would increase (?)</seg>
<seg>excessive tax burden can reduce incentives and hamper growth.</seg>
<seg>Only a small taxation can have the same.</seg>
<seg>governments which have only poor tax revenue, do not have the money, in order to place fundamental public goods.</seg>
<seg>Even worse is the fact that in poor countries low tax revenues are being attributed less to lower rates than a profile to defective tax systems, which also lead to unproductive companies.</seg>
<seg>For example, India is the importance of a well-considered control system.</seg>
<seg>In Bangalore take ch companies in maintained green belts established world class universities with regard to high-speed information network.</seg>
<seg>However, outside these campuses open sewers coin / form not disposed of waste and badly in need of repair roads, the picture.</seg>
<seg>While technology companies terabyte send in a moment to data in remote continents, local public transport with almost medieval speed are themselves.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, companies in Bangalore pursue their own bus routes, have agreements with private providers of the water supply and to have their own generators, in order to protect themselves against the losses in public electricity network.</seg>
<seg>The state cannot eliminate the chaos, because it is shattered.</seg>
<seg>The Indian state debts amount to more than 70% of gross domestic product, more than half of tax revenue for interest repayments must therefore be spent.</seg>
<seg>They are not to be attributed to excessive expenditure in the past.</seg>
<seg>The public expenditure in India was around 15% of gross domestic product in relation to it being used on average in the OECD countries 40% of GDP for public expenditure.</seg>
<seg>The financial difficulties of India have their due more to a poorly conceived and badly managed control system.</seg>
<seg>Compared with international standards fiscal regulations and income tax rates seem appropriate for individuals and companies.</seg>
<seg>The tax revenue of the Indian Government of income taxes, to only EUR 3.7% GDP.In meet this value half of the income of South Korea and other Asian tigers.</seg>
<seg>around a quarter of GDP is allocated to agriculture, but wealthy farmers do not pay tax.</seg>
<seg>export-based companies in the software industry and in other sectors have tax exemptions for their profits, even though the staff of these companies certainly pay income tax.</seg>
<seg>Despite the rates of tax evasion is endemic.</seg>
<seg>This fraud can take place, because the government invests either in staffing or into systems for spying tax dodger, who have rarely enough to count on a prison bribes and often clear on their way out of the difficulties.</seg>
<seg>The tax evasion with the 'direct' profits tax revenue and reflects the chaos in the '' indirect taxes, which will come up in production and consumption.</seg>
<seg>More than 60% of indirect taxes in India has been allocated to indirect taxes are concerned, the proportion of indirect taxation of the total volume of 60% tax is once again.</seg>
<seg>the base rate was arranged with 16% of production value of a society.</seg>
<seg>In addition, there are still a number of privileges and immunities encouragement.</seg>
<seg>Therefore a verg√ºnstigter rate of 8% is used in categories such as food, competitions, cotton yarn and computer.</seg>
<seg>on cars are products containing additional air conditioning and tyre a 'special indirect tax' sed? (8%) by entering above on polyester fibres.</seg>
<seg>The "additional indirect tax 'aed? (, not to be confused with the SED) is accounted for by" products' of particular importance.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, many complex exemptions from excise taxes exist, in whose benefit companies with a whole year income of less than 10 million rupien and companies come into difficult or backward regions.</seg>
<seg>Overall, these reports are made in 70 broad categories which are divided into 259 discharges, 52 conditions and 7 lists once again, from which each again contain many points.</seg>
<seg>Tax relief would be open to abuse.</seg>
<seg>At a certain price struggle-low officials who assessment is considerable room for manoeuvre in the implementation of the conditions can be persuaded to interpret the rules out promising.</seg>
<seg>goods subject to a high rate Granite fine? (for example) become goods with a lower rate sold? (not fine granite, for example).</seg>
<seg>The evasion of indirect taxes, is still common as those of profit and income taxes.</seg>
<seg>If a company verbrauchssteuern evades and if the rate is high in the industry compared with the profits from tax competition is forced to fraud, if it wants to survive.</seg>
<seg>In increasing tax evasion governments' additional 'invented' or 'special taxes, and lead to a more tax evasion.</seg>
<seg>Also the profile of direct taxes are suffering.</seg>
<seg>backhanders, which create difference between the value of fine and not fine Granite and suppressed real incomes' "black money paid a financial official for favourable expulsions, which may appear in any income tax return.</seg>
<seg>The evasion of duties disabled not only the State in the provision of basic public goods, but also takes the incentive for companies to introduce more productive technologies which are necessary for a production in great style.</seg>
<seg>Since, however, been avoided indirect taxes more easily with the operation of many small production units, size can be a great advantages are not to be implemented.</seg>
<seg>In this context, it is worth mentioning that Indian companies in the software industry, where all the companies are exempt from excise duties operating efficiently.</seg>
<seg>India could follow the example of China, where the rationalisation of indirect taxes has created the conditions for a great boom in 1994?</seg>
<seg>Aren't or coalition governments in a strong democracy to such reforms in the situation?</seg>
<seg>In the last year of the BJP government led laws introduced in the drastic reduction of the budget deficit.</seg>
<seg>There was also a working group has been set up, which had to make the necessary changes in tax and spending policy.</seg>
<seg>In July of this year, the working party, which proposes to increase taxes to reduce? (and not the expenditure), by, among others, which are deleted most exemptions from excise duty.</seg>
<seg>The new Indian government under the auspices of the Congress Party seems to welcome these proposals.</seg>
<seg>If the Congress Party and the opposition to bring this project to end, they are set far-reaching a step towards the sustainable economic development of the country, a far and the idea to have clarified, according to which democracies are not capable of implementing measures which are necessary in order to promote development.</seg>
<seg>What isn't right with Turkey?</seg>
<seg>On 16 December Orhan Pamuk, one of the most famous writers of Turkey, before a court in Istanbul, will be in order, the indictment, "the national identity of offending itself 'place after it was for the open debate of the Turkish genocide 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916.</seg>
<seg>Pamuk must count on three years in prison.</seg>
<seg>It to persuade the efforts of Turkey, that one which opposes the official line to punish and complete buses with me that I was right when I rejected the accession negotiations for membership of the country in the European Union.</seg>
<seg>In December 1999, the European Council has given the European Union Turkey candidate status, which means that Turkey should accede to the Union, as laid down at a later date.</seg>
<seg>The Council has asked the European Commission to decide after 2004 until October whether Turkey had been adequately met the political criteria for membership - - including democracy, the rule of law and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg>This was one of the final decisions which the Commission under Romano Prodi took that I belonged to.</seg>
<seg>from their 30 members 29 meant that Turkey had been adequately met the criteria in order to continue.</seg>
<seg>I was the only deviationist.</seg>
<seg>The communication from the Commission on Turkey, to which Mr then responsible for EU enlargement Verheugen was drawn up, influenced my decision.</seg>
<seg>It has been mentioned that in 2003 on 21,870 Turks submitted applications for asylum in the European Union, which was adopted 2127.</seg>
<seg>In other words, the governments of the European Union in 2003 recognised that the Turkish government on 2000 of its own citizens have followed.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile, the Commission published a progress report on Turkey, to which he acknowledged that the reforms in the more Islamic Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan Government stopped have continued, although at a slower pace.</seg>
<seg>However, the report also has serious doubts subject: violation of human rights, including torture, have continued; the influence of the military are too great; freedom of speech was not always respected; not-muslim religious and cultural minorities were discriminated against; and violence against women has been fought not strong enough.</seg>
<seg>It is not much has changed since the accession talks started in October.</seg>
<seg>Apart from current persecution pamuks there are some examples of unacceptable behaviour.</seg>
<seg>In March, the police force 2005 interrupted by a demonstration for the celebration of International Women's Day.</seg>
<seg>In May, the largest teacher trade union was banned because it occurred to inform the 14 million Kurds in Turkey in their own language.</seg>
<seg>intolerance actually sees the point of the Turkish Government.</seg>
<seg>The Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdullah Gul recently called suddenly a press conference in Copenhagen off when he a Kurdish journalists in the public ersp√§hte and the Danes refused to ejecting them.</seg>
<seg>Such actions and positions justify my vote against from October 2004 sufficiently.</seg>
<seg>But if these shortcomings were restored should not yet Turkey to the European Union to be included, because it is not a European country.</seg>
<seg>Christianity, feudalismus, Renaissance, education, democracy and industrialisation made us what we are Europeans, but they have made the Turks not what they are.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, I am not convinced that the reforms in Turkey, which has been implemented at the insistence of the European Commission have continued after accession.</seg>
<seg>I even think that they have been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, the accession of Turkey would inevitably lead to the fact that the Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova would join, and perhaps Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.</seg>
<seg>The first three of these countries are certainly more European than Turkey.</seg>
<seg>If we leave the three Caucasian Republics sidelined, but the new Independent States of the former Yugoslavia, a European Union with approximately 35 Members includes would mean.</seg>
<seg>What a Union would that be?</seg>
<seg>The European Union is not simply a friendship club.</seg>
<seg>It is based on the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.</seg>
<seg>As guardian of the Treaties of the European Union must protect the Commission these four basic freedoms, that means that the Member States must, if necessary, sometimes convince and violence to change their legislation.</seg>
<seg>The alcohol policy in Sweden which law is Volkswagen in Germany and discrimination against foreign investment funds in the case of France, where the Commission has adopted unpopular.</seg>
<seg>But they are necessary.</seg>
<seg>When I left the Commission I sat on a batch of 1500 such infringement procedures.</seg>
<seg>In short, the European Union membership has meant that a State should adopt drastic measures which affect in its internal affairs.</seg>
<seg>It will be impossible to such different Members.</seg>
<seg>The European Union has become a victim of what the historian Paul Kennedy calls "imperial overstretching".</seg>
<seg>The European Union has been excessively greatly watered down.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the former French President Mr Giscard d'Estaing feared that the accession of Turkey to the dissolution of the European Union would lead, and therefore the former German Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt said: "Turkey would be more than the European Union comes to bear could. '</seg>
<seg>But the most important reason for the accession of Turkey is a question of democracy: the majority of the population of the European Union does not want it simply.</seg>
<seg>in Bolivia crisis in Latin America failure</seg>
<seg>Bolivia is in no way a typically Latin American country.</seg>
<seg>Apart from Haiti, it is the poorest country in the Western world, it is even greater instability and has a history over two hundred coups d'Etat since its independence back.</seg>
<seg>In a region with a strong indigenous past and present a compromised and isolated, Bolivia, apart from Guatemala is perhaps the only country in Latin America, indigenous peoples are in the majority of the people.</seg>
<seg>their topography and ethnic division provide autonomous forces and even secession efforts which endanger the national unity in more serious than in other countries.</seg>
<seg>In addition, it is, of course, together with Paraguay the only nation on the subcontinent without access to the sea.</seg>
<seg>It would therefore be extremely unwise to transfer of Bolivia current crisis the rest of Latin America.</seg>
<seg>Generalisations are far too easy subject: in other countries, the institutions are much stronger, poverty - - in particular the extreme poverty - - reduced / went back, and the prevention of natural resources is broadly based.</seg>
<seg>Even in countries such as Venezuela with large oil reserves and a tradition-conscious nationalist government current practice is to allow foreign investment in energy resources soon gone in the eight years of reign of President Chavez Hugo.</seg>
<seg>Although in many countries - - of Chiapas' after 'araucania from Amazonia is the home to ayacucho indigenous movements - - exist, they do not represent a real threat to the national unity anywhere in Latin America.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, Bolivia, is not a warning crisis, the ancient 'or' domino theory which both Lyndon Johnson Che Guevara and in the case of Bolivia followed, seems to be a valid or even reasonably sensible.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, this crisis of Bolivia refers to the 'democratic deficit' diseases, Latin America at the moment.</seg>
<seg>In Ecuador, Bolivia and Haiti the elected leaders have fallen from different reasons.</seg>
<seg>In Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua democracy is either poorly developed or not, and in Venezuela and Colombia is threatened by various causes.</seg>
<seg>None of these cases corresponds exactly to the others, it is threatening, harmful or conciliatory to differing degrees.</seg>
<seg>The question is, what can be done in this situation, which differs considerably from the encouraging view which set the picture even a few years ago.</seg>
<seg>At the last meeting of the Organisation of American States in away lauderdale Florida the United States took up a good idea of others and essentially brought them by their support.</seg>
<seg>History has begun a draft report on democracy in Latin America, a few years ago, the former Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs when Dante caputo and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP was asked?) to write.</seg>
<seg>They came to the conclusion that an early warning system for democratic crises in the region would help to act before things like currently in Bolivia got out of control.</seg>
<seg>caputo and un-team convinced that the Chilean President Ricardo Lagos to adopt and promote with some of his colleagues, the initiative.</seg>
<seg>He did, but the initiative was not very far.</seg>
<seg>Even in 2004, the UNDP report published on democracy in Latin America, it was not to mention.</seg>
<seg>The United States and the new Chilean Secretary-General of the OAS, Jos√© Miguel insulza, has once again the plan with the OAS in Florida sitting at the table, but rejected it because of the legitimate concerns of the Latin Americans, the idea would be directed against Venezuela, mixed with the anachronistic fears of the Latin Americans to breach the sacrosanct principle of non-interference.</seg>
<seg>Although the continent could not agree on the principle, attention is given to the idea of an early warning system.</seg>
<seg>At present, there are no what the United States can do about the situation in Bolivia and yet the situation there for all some dangers.</seg>
<seg>Evo Morales, opposition leader and leader of the kokapflanzenanbauer, may be badly advisory more honest, although, democratic ruler, but that is his supporters quite freely by authoritarian efforts?</seg>
<seg>Perhaps not Morales Hugo Chavez financed and other Bolivian critics of the regime, but Venezuela and Cuba is not really tried to interfere in the affairs of the country in which Che Guevara before almost 40 years have died as guerillaf√ºhrer?</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the Bolivian don't businessmen of Santa Cruz make the threat of a secession true, but as the oil and gas reserves of their region with the indigenous population in the Highlands rather than will share with Brazilian industrial from Sao Paulo?</seg>
<seg>before the events achieved such extremes, perhaps the OAS? (not the USA) had been able to intervene.</seg>
<seg>The region is still dependent on this intervention - - in time, consistently and on a normal democratic basis - - an intervention, which is different from the traditional US intervention and of Latin America of traditional indifference.</seg>
<seg>The fall of France?</seg>
<seg>The French, as you know, are sensitive if not defensively which the reputation of France in the world.</seg>
<seg>The French State spends a great deal of money on promoting the French language and culture and is acutely aware of the French that the global position of his country does not have the same value as no more than in the past.</seg>
<seg>So it is no surprise that the publication of a report by the European Commission in the last presidential elections in which has been maintained that France has fallen on the tenth place in economic priority list of European countries in a period of ten years of third, a soul-searching and controversial led. soon gave President Jacques Chirac his rival Lionel Jospin the blame for the 'are' of France.</seg>
<seg>The OECD and Eurostat, such data responsible European Bureau considered, this aspect of the debate by her opinion that France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom in more or less the same standard of living per capita enjoy all closed.</seg>
<seg>The public controversy left, however.</seg>
<seg>The demonstrations in this year against pension reform, growing dispute with the European Commission on the financial policy and gez√§nk with America because of the war in Iraq would relaunch discussions on the 'concern' French fall again.</seg>
<seg>At the moment, the usually-sold special paper in France is a controversy of nicolas baverez, la France qui tombe? (France in the origin).</seg>
<seg>baverez 'paper presents a plethora of prices of de Gaulle and Napoleon.</seg>
<seg>According to the rapporteur made France its past achievements in the seventies-years with the introduction of the express HST and train the Airbus.</seg>
<seg>It weighs heavy upon both margins of centre and Chirac for it 'common talent to win elections and to make France' the loser.</seg>
<seg>The success of the paper is even a reference to a sort of 'lamentable situation with regard to ".</seg>
<seg>But what sort of bad state?</seg>
<seg>baverez 'proof of nature is not convincing, as he believes.</seg>
<seg>It states, for example, a dwindling of jobs in industry as the most obvious proof of the fall of France.</seg>
<seg>The deindustrialisierung is all industrialized countries together.</seg>
<seg>France is even better than most of his rivals in the rich countries and it is different from Germany, the United Kingdom or the United States, which have the same global market share at the industrial sector which it had at the beginning of the seventies-years.</seg>
<seg>According to the foreign investment, a better level of competitiveness in France, is also very well.</seg>
<seg>A recent report by the Council for economic sanctions, according to the direct investment in France in the year 2001, increased to EUR 60 billion, almost twice as much as in Germany.</seg>
<seg>The price on the competitiveness of improved by 20%? (France) over the past three decades by means of increased productivity, which have caused a rapid wage growth.</seg>
<seg>The core of the long-term economic problems of France is, however, precisely the fear of loss of industrialism places.</seg>
<seg>In traditional sectors such as the car or space industry France is still a strong industrial power; in innovative markets in which small businesses disseminate new technologies, it falls.</seg>
<seg>For example, France spends only 30 billion dollars per year on R & D von spitzentechnologien compared to 51 billion dollars in Germany, 98 billion dollars in Japan and 265, 000 million dollars in the United States.</seg>
<seg>In short baverez 'analysis is quite simply in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg>In the course of the last 20 years, France has gone through a number of crucial reforms subject: economic and financial liberalisation, the abolition of price and exchange controls, the end of the credit restrictions, European liberalisation, reduced inflation and trade deficit, the introduction of the euro and the forced globalisation of companies in the country.</seg>
<seg>The French lamentable situation with regard to all that has to do with nothing.</seg>
<seg>France's problem is that it does not succeed in identifying the new world of which some have already.</seg>
<seg>The French state capitalism is dead and France, it is difficult to accept its dahinscheiden.</seg>
<seg>France would seem to be the only country in which a Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, feel obliged, one day later on television to apologize for his statement that "the state is not all powerful".</seg>
<seg>There are many reasons for this French can, one of the key is connected with the political actions of the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg>Until 1981, there was a clear distinction in France between right and left.</seg>
<seg>Since then, both the governments margins of centre and Chirac moderate their ideological rigour in order to make the difficult process of adjustment to Europe and globalisation.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps a round of "shock therapy 'la Margaret Thatcher twenty years ago, would have created a new political awareness.</seg>
<seg>But the agreement kleckerweise implementation of reforms made it possible for the French people to live in a world and think in another.</seg>
<seg>This is one of the main reasons for the disastrous political revolution which took place during the last election campaign before the presidential election, when the extreme right-wing party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen before the present Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has reached the second round of the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg>The rise extreme left, which could paper 10% of the votes for during the election campaign, it also from this political error.</seg>
<seg>France needs more of a political and an economic revolution, if it is to compensate for the reality. part of this reality is that '' loss of France is a fear that whoever produces the French people.</seg>
<seg>The value of European values</seg>
<seg>The governments of Europe took up the discussions on an EU Constitution once again, after they have been broken off last December by a dispute about voting procedures.</seg>
<seg>These differences of opinion are to be dealt with, of course, by compromises which are most probably found.</seg>
<seg>What we must be united, but there is a clear idea of what is to be achieved in the European Constitution.</seg>
<seg>European integration is based on solidarity and subsidiarity on two fundamental principles:.</seg>
<seg>Both these principles are at the interface between philosophy, politics, economics, sociology and law.</seg>
<seg>For years, they will be reflected in the legal and institutional framework of the European Union - in the Treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights? (where they are mentioned in the preamble) and in the current draft Constitution.</seg>
<seg>Both these principles are thus in history and the ideals of the European Union laid down.</seg>
<seg>But what are solidarity and subsidiarity really mean?</seg>
<seg>Let us look first at the solidarity that can be interpreted in two ways: at least as static solidarity with that it only about the distribution of income and wealth is and how that wider concept of dynamic solidarity with which the production is taken into account by income and wealth.</seg>
<seg>In the history of European integration, after the Second World War, the dynamic solidarity were at the forefront, both in economic development? (reconstruction) in the first stage, the European Coal and Steel Community, and in the Treaty systems, particularly in the Treaty of Rome.</seg>
<seg>That does not mean, however, that the dynamic solidarity was later no longer subject: the European Monetary Union, for example, is an expression of this dynamic solidarity.</seg>
<seg>Although some countries did not have a direct benefit of the introduction of the euro, they have agreed it, because they were convinced of long-term positive effects of the single currency.</seg>
<seg>In other words: with dynamic solidarity is strategies on it aims at investment and innovation and to promote economic growth and job creation.</seg>
<seg>But as the figures for GDP growth show, in the European Union, the dynamic solidarity has been weakened in the last ten years.</seg>
<seg>Particularly worrying in this context is the backlog of Europe in the area of research and development.</seg>
<seg>In the year 2000 the implementation of the Lisbon strategy adopted by the European Union, which is to create the most competitive economy in the world by the European Union, but it is of increasing importance to postpone threatened static solidarity, which is reflected in high costs of the welfare state and high taxes on its financing.</seg>
<seg>The increase in the static solidarity is the ageing of the population, who is justified, apart from slower growth for a structural imbalance in the national budgets.</seg>
<seg>One of the biggest future potential future impact of the European Union will be the development of solution models in order to change the static solidarity dominant today, which is geared to the elderly, in favour of solidarity which is dynamic young people into the centre.</seg>
<seg>Ultimately, the Union cannot afford that the current consumption is still on that level of investment, which is necessary in order to safeguard the prosperity in the future.</seg>
<seg>The principle of subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity as it allows two ways: either the vertical and horizontal subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg>The vertical subsidiarity describes the division of powers between the different levels of government: the sovereignty and therefore between the European Union and the national States, regions and communities.</seg>
<seg>The best-known application of this principle is federalism.</seg>
<seg>In the European Treaties this vertical subsidiarity is clearly established.</seg>
<seg>But it is sufficient in order to take the developing institutional and constitutional framework of the Union?</seg>
<seg>The horizontal subsidiarity describes the responsibility and freedom of the people, as well as social and economic power relations.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the relationship between the state and society and the market is one.</seg>
<seg>However, the market and their own rights and sovereignty areas which are not provided by the state and society.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the problem is to secure the autonomy of each area.</seg>
<seg>An example of horizontal subsidiarity is the European internal market, which has created a new type of economic freedom and increasing competition between companies, as the national safeguards for these companies have been abolished.</seg>
<seg>horizontal subsidiarity means that the State either in society and the economy, which may violated individual freedom and responsibility that it has to respect to the greatest possible extent.</seg>
<seg>In addition, horizontal subsidiarity means that a 'overriding power has to grant aid' where the individual freedom and responsibility are not enough to achieve the objective of safeguarding human.</seg>
<seg>This support should be implemented, but in a way which the natural resources of individuals, society and promotes the market.</seg>
<seg>But that is only possible if the role of the horizontal subsidiarity is clear and that is neither in the European Treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights or in the work of the European Convention.</seg>
<seg>In short, solidarity is rather redistribution? (as growth in such a way, the present generation expresses its solidarity with future generations) and subsidiarity means today, the distribution of political power and not the careful distinction between the state, civil society and the market.</seg>
<seg>Today, both values are defined in such a way that the state of the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg>So the concentration is often interpreted on market growth identification with the halfstrange values America.</seg>
<seg>But these values in Europe are deeply rooted and should also be brought to the surface.</seg>
<seg>The European Union should restore their economic dynamism, by adopting a model of solidarity and subsidiarity which is the market and the privileged and society which reduces the socio-economic impact of the State.</seg>
<seg>national institutions should be responsible for providing? (public goods like defence, legal and fiscal and monetary policy) society for social goods? (such as culture, education and aid to needy people) and the market for cheap goods? (with profit, growth and employment to do).</seg>
<seg>In the 21st century Europe must both principles, the values of solidarity and subsidiarity, deliberate, if it wants to achieve its historic objective of integration subject: freedom and prosperity to achieve that are necessary in order to overcome the differences and political divisions, which triggered the disasters in the 20th century.</seg>
<seg>It is in this spirit that the European Constitution must be drawn up.</seg>
<seg>The policy of values</seg>
<seg>The debate about the American elections did not reduce yet.</seg>
<seg>How did President George W. Bush managed to obtain, in both chambers of the Congress a Republican majority vote let three million more votes than Senator John Kerry?</seg>
<seg>With the answers to this little agreement, but two themes appear in the many statements.</seg>
<seg>One is personality.</seg>
<seg>In a time people more confidence in the President, whom they could do, had of uncertainty and threats than in a candidate country, whose capacity seemed not proven.</seg>
<seg>The second issue is values.</seg>
<seg>The people have voted in favour of a structure of values, and not for a specific policy.</seg>
<seg>Some (?) with kerrys so reported policy Bush gave their voice but actually agreed because they felt "and" in its general attitudes.</seg>
<seg>The United States are currently divided over the elections clearly.</seg>
<seg>A statement of blue? (more democratic) States in the East, the North and the West re-clamps an enormous? (republican) area in the centre and in the South.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the division is also reflected at local level.</seg>
<seg>deformities - - namely constituency unit surrogate constituency boundaries, to promote a certain political party - - are no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg>In fact the people tend to go to areas in which others share their values are republican or democratic.</seg>
<seg>Do these values are exactly what?</seg>
<seg>They have something to do with supposedly 'God guns and homosexuals - - with' God, weapons and gays - -.</seg>
<seg>religion plays a role and, among other things, literally the truth of the Bible, when it comes to creation history.</seg>
<seg>The possession of weapons is the crucial individualismustest and the use of weapons in wars is nothing atrocious.</seg>
<seg>'modern' gay and other practices are excessively rejected than.</seg>
<seg>Like the policy hacker Andrews, recently said: 'Bush application of it is drawn up in such a way that it will help the majority of around 60 million people with itself to be satisfied with that.'</seg>
<seg>The whole is an American phenomenon or is there in other places similar trends?</seg>
<seg>The answer is not that the policy of values currently can produce a majority as American phenomenon, but under no circumstances is generally accepted that.</seg>
<seg>Europe and other parts of the world are equally divided.</seg>
<seg>personality is undoubtedly important, and below the obvious political differences may hide value questions which has not yet arrived at the light of day.</seg>
<seg>But traditional political differences, which are based on disagreement with regard to fundamental values, play an ever smaller role in the elections.</seg>
<seg>For example, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, for which the next great leader before an election is personality ', is on the card' and speaks of policy, but it is above all a structure of values of small and medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg>When he speaks of 'modernisation', or 'in the 21st century, to get its own', he is able to make speeches, but mixture of change and stability.</seg>
<seg>This is the conservative opposition has yet found no effective response.</seg>
<seg>Even with issues such as tax reductions and stricter asylum regulations values in the measure in the have not brought the Republican Party like this in the United States has been able to do.</seg>
<seg>A similar picture results in Germany, where the obvious influence of the value policy is even less.</seg>
<seg>The debate in Germany is largely a political debate.</seg>
<seg>If the opposition of the government of discussions on the health reform or - - as happened last - - in the fight against unemployment is, it is with the challenge to reason that rather authority of values.</seg>
<seg>But under the well-known battlefields lurk value conflicts of political debate in the United Kingdom and Germany, as elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
<seg>The parties fight for those who can be put it, 'with' be satisfied, but do not accept them perhaps not entirely that it is partly a question of policy.</seg>
<seg>It is unlikely that religion in the European policy will point opinion polls, an important factor in that respect for the religious legislation is one of the few major differences between Americans and Europeans.</seg>
<seg>weapons also take a value in European consciousness. most Europeans consider their absence as important.</seg>
<seg>In Europe, a trace of pacifist values is unequivocal.</seg>
<seg>But the issue of political correctness? '(' gay) plays a role underestimated in Europe.</seg>
<seg>Europe, in particular, shares the Europeans' national ', since the question is raised in all European States.</seg>
<seg>This is a value problem, which is caused by fear.</seg>
<seg>People want to know where they belong, and turn it against the United States and Europe, or against Europe and to their own country.</seg>
<seg>In any case, we leave the political guidelines and that even the policy and enter the dark poor symbols and myths.</seg>
<seg>This is in any case the main risk, democratic countries face, because the policy of values is a dangerous development.</seg>
<seg>to companies whose greatest democratic achievement, banning the fundamentalism of the policy was, it introduces new fundamental boundary.</seg>
<seg>an enlightened public debate must be an argument about policy which is determined by a group of values.</seg>
<seg>To insist on it, and that is why a primary aim of the policy of freedom.</seg>
<seg>The time of interest rates is approaching</seg>
<seg>one swallow does not make a summer and a month of normal job growth and increasing prices in the United States, it does not mean that the Federal supervision of the American banks would have lost the fear of economic situation and deflation.</seg>
<seg>But the time will come into the interest rates of the world begins to rise because prepare central bankers on it before the inflationist tendencies to stop.</seg>
<seg>whenever it will be so far - whether in this autumn in the year 2005 or 2006 or 2007 - America and the world economy will be faced with financial susceptibility to reflect the success of monetary stimulationsmassnahmen for the past three years, with regard to the control of fallings decline in production and the absorption of unemployment.</seg>
<seg>Interest rates for short-term credits are remarkably small subject: only 2% in the euro zone, only 1% in the United States and in Japan zero.</seg>
<seg>The expansionist monetary policy is successfully been, but only as the interest rates on historic lows, harassed and investors were convinced that the credit costs will continue for a long time at their current levels.</seg>
<seg>The most important outcome of the monetary impetus has been a price increase of assets subject: everything that casts a dividend profits or rent releasing will by some attractive - financially much more valuable - if the interest rates is very low, and will probably be very low.</seg>
<seg>The big gap between the current prices for property in the United States, securities in New York and Frankfurt, London and long-term loans declared everywhere and what we should normally regard as its basic values.</seg>
<seg>So what will happen if the central banks start to increase interest rates?</seg>
<seg>In 1994, the increase in interest rates for short-term borrowing led to interest is in the long term - and falling prices for long-term loans - which was double its at least as usual prognosis models perspective at this time.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, interest rates in the peripheral areas of the world market has increased the developing countries, much more than interest rates in the large industrial nations.</seg>
<seg>The first risk, on which we must also provide for the year 2005 and thought - if the interest rates will in all probability increase the world - is therefore a new wave of financial crises in development markets.</seg>
<seg>For countries such as Mexico, Turkey, Argentina, Brazil, Korea and Thailand, Malaysia, the record of the 1990s has shown that interest margins are increasing, kapitalfl√ºsse remarkably quickly to reverse to be able, regardless of how good IMF representatives and analyses of large banks evaluate the policy of a country.</seg>
<seg>The interest margins of the threshold markets are currently abnormally low.</seg>
<seg>International financial flows - apart from supplies in the USA - are not yet at levels that would bring about resemblingness' with 'irrational Swan in connection, but this could have passed before the interest rates to rise to begin.</seg>
<seg>These are worrying prospects, because if the 1990s we have taught that nobody should overestimate the stability of international financial rivers.</seg>
<seg>The second risk is due to high assets within the large industrial nations.</seg>
<seg>The main way of thinking in the Federal supervision of the American banks - with which I agree, and obviously lies in the fact that the revolution of the information technology insists that the growth rate of the potential production output remains very high in the United States and is relatively large that the production of the CAP.</seg>
<seg>In fact, we can conclude that interest rates must remain strictly low during a very considerable period, if necessary.</seg>
<seg>I would add that confidence is high in the Federal supervision of the American banks and the last leftovers of risk premium of inflation of the seventies-years have been forced out of interest rates.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, interest rates, based on the 1980s and 1990s, low to remain, even after production conditions exhaust once again its potential.</seg>
<seg>These are of course all good news for those who have assets like long-term loans, shares and property.</seg>
<seg>Because the price increase in long-term assets was precisely the point with the lowering of interest rates: to improve the security owners us particularly affects the property owner stimulating the expenditure.</seg>
<seg>bad news is that, even if it is expected to remain low interest rates, a long time it not indefinitely will remain so low.</seg>
<seg>In a word: if the interest rates rose assets will fall.</seg>
<seg>These are precisely the times - especially when assets reduction quickly and far - in which we see how well our central bankers really fulfil its main task: the reduction of financial volatility and the promotion of economic stability.</seg>
<seg>While such deadlines we also note, like many people who have long-term loans, property or shares this do because they do not believe that the current prices are based on the basic data attractive, but because the prices in the course of the last few years has increased.</seg>
<seg>For decision-makers is a crucial problem because those obtained through long-term assets apparently constantly increasing prices are also those who will try to sell them as soon as the price trends seem to be moving in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg>In particular, the American deficit on the balance of payments is threatening as a major source of instability, should the prices for long-term assets are clear.</seg>
<seg>The challenges which the economic decision-makers will see themselves worldwide in the process in relation to the next year is certainly different from those with which they have been faced since the zerplatzen swell the NASDAQ.</seg>
<seg>The risks associated with inflation will probably be less dangerous than those arising from breaking down production and the threat of deflation.</seg>
<seg>As we have learned, in the 1990s, that does not mean that the forthcoming difficulties would be managed more easily.</seg>
<seg>contradictory prospects of America</seg>
<seg>Recently I have got to know something interesting subject: in America in international financial economists have at national level and macro economists in very different - - in fact - - conflicting views on the likely effects of the huge American deficit on the balance of payments.</seg>
<seg>The international financial economists are based on a financial crisis, followed by a painful and possibly constant recession in the United States for likely.</seg>
<seg>In contrast to the national positions macro economists is one that can be expected to kursverlust dollar not a crisis, but as an opportunity to speed up economic growth.</seg>
<seg>The situation is macro economist around in such a way subject: at some point in the future foreign central banks like this any longer will not be prepared to buy in droves dollar share papers in order to support the American currency.</seg>
<seg>If they stop their extensive dollar purchases, the value of the dollar will fall - - and the landing is hard.</seg>
<seg>With the depreciation of the US dollar, so the macro economists, exports to other countries more attractive and to improve the employment situation in America, there is increasing workers into the growing export sector to move.</seg>
<seg>The development would be like in Great Britain, as one of the currency link was established and the British pound against the German mark was devalued or, as in the United States in the late 1980er years as the dollar in relation to the pound, which has been devalued German marks - - and above all - - against the Japanese yen.</seg>
<seg>The international financial economists are geared to the future some dark.</seg>
<seg>In their view, the end of the dollar purchases by the central banks will lead not only to a devaluation of the dollar, but also to a high level of long-term interest rates in the United States, and the consumer spending and short time the capital expenditure will be reduced later directly.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the financial economists expect us exports of a kursverlust benefit of the dollar, but by the delays in the call for the export growth will occur or two years after the fall of the consumer and investment expenditure.</seg>
<seg>The jobs of eight or ten million people from the service sector in the export and the import-competitive area will shift, and on an increase of structural unemployment is to be expected.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, it could lead to a financial panic subject: for the large financial institutions in their short-term commitment and long-term assets it will be difficult to carry through an increase of USD long-term interest rates.</seg>
<seg>This imbalance can just as easily lead to financial pressure and the bankruptcy as at that time during the crises in Mexico and eastern Asia in the 1990er years and a few years ago in Argentina, the imbalance between the installations of the banks held in local currencies and their dollar commitment to financial congestion and ultimately led to the bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg>If international financial economists in drafting this scenario, macro economists answer all sounds like a case incapable of monetary policy.</seg>
<seg>Why should the American Federal Reserve Bank point allow long-term interest rates, simply because the other central banks have no more dollar salary?</seg>
<seg>shouldn't intervene rather than simply the fed and even long-term US Government loans to buy a long-term interest rates and thus contribute to a level which is compatible with full employment?</seg>
<seg>That is what the financial economists respond by saying that the Federal Reserve would not have force.</seg>
<seg>If it has the choice between full employment and price stability, the EDF will decide that the financial economists for price stability, since the memory of unbridled inflation is very much in the 1970er years.</seg>
<seg>As a kursverlust dollar leads to an increase in import prices and is therefore a negative impact on the supply side of the economy, the EDF will have to increase the level of interest rates and will not lower and loans will not buy, but will sell.</seg>
<seg>On both sides of the debate serious economists with great vigour, the extraordinary I appreciate, are involved.</seg>
<seg>I am not intelligent enough to decide which side is right, but I know exactly which side of the argument I hope that she is wrong.</seg>
<seg>Europe's free riding</seg>
<seg>In the United States Federal States which must pursue an inadequate budgetary policy count on penalties.</seg>
<seg>Their loans are worth less than those of better conducted federal states.</seg>
<seg>The higher debts which poor people have to provide - - is to a certain extent - - than discipline measure against the temptation to spend the money now and to settle the bill later.</seg>
<seg>Of course, discipline perfect by the market: the bond market "does not see 'liabilities? (implicit future pension payments as promised) is not on a large scale.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, this forced budgetary discipline in combination with the budgetary policies of the Member States has contributed to the fact that there were no major budgetary crises in the United States since the great depression.</seg>
<seg>We now turn to Europe.</seg>
<seg>before the introduction of the euro, there were financial crises which led to high inflation in individual States of southern Europe.</seg>
<seg>Due to the single currency, the way to solve a budgetary crisis is on inflation blocked, there is the European Central Bank (ECB)? on monetary policy is observed.</seg>
<seg>So even if the European countries can no longer regulate their financial deficits on inflation, it allows them to take up the single currency and its ausgabenorgien extend the debt capacity, which is actually due to the other EU members, for a while, in order to rush to live and braus and political responsibility on later on postponement.</seg>
<seg>In order to put a stop to these possibilities, the Stability and Growth Pact was brought into being: the public deficits must below 3% of GDP.</seg>
<seg>Last week, the rules of the Pact to Germany - - once the most rigorous budgetary producing countries of the European Union - - for the fifth time in succession and without? (large) excuses.</seg>
<seg>Finance ministers peer stone-bridge has indicated that he on sanctions against Germany expect of the European Commission, because otherwise the credibility of the Pact are at stake.</seg>
<seg>Unlike two and a half years ago, this time, Germany would not be against the sanctions.</seg>
<seg>stone-bridge but also made it clear that he count on the fact that the sanctions will be based on the anticipated deficits of 3,4% of the GDP of largely symbolic nature and no penalties, which for the government or economic would entail significant costs.</seg>
<seg>The Stability and Growth Pact - - still do not work - - anywhere around in such a way, as originally intended.</seg>
<seg>What about the market discipline?</seg>
<seg>Will the willingness of the German Government to meet even more debt smaller and larger deficits, because the market recognizes and penalise those countries which accept a weakening of its financial policy position?</seg>
<seg>The answer is "no".</seg>
<seg>Interest rates for the public debt of the twelve Member States in the euro zone denominierten in euros are very similar.</seg>
<seg>It does not seem to care the market so that the Member States have different potential, to set in motion the exports in order to lukrieren those financial flows, which would be necessary for the various current or forecast state quotas for the debt repayment or.</seg>
<seg>Willem Buiter of the University of Amsterdam and Anne filter arch of the University of London believe that the willingness of the ECB undermines to accept, in the end, all the debts of the euro zone as collateral the ability of the market as a driving force of budgetary prudence to work.</seg>
<seg>As long as a small part of the German debt as security for a short-term credit or heart of a security pension business for improving the liquidity to serve its value is much more of these conditions will be certain to which the ECB adopted these as safety, of its value.</seg>
<seg>The fact that the ECB deals with all these debts equal sources of liquidity it is granted more power than any analysis on the differences in national long-term risks.</seg>
<seg>In the long term this development is dangerous.</seg>
<seg>In order to maintain a reasonable chance of long-term price stability, it requires both market discipline and sound budgetary management.</seg>
<seg>is if the immediate sanction of the market behaviour which can be allowed to shut down or recklessness later, there is a lack of institutional provisions to count in order to give a voice to future generations, is in serious risks - - perhaps not today or tomorrow, but sometime intended and then for a long time.</seg>
<seg>Over the years, the introduction of the single currency and the way it has been like to ever greater concern has been managed.</seg>
<seg>The policy throughout the euro zone is placed on deflationary.</seg>
<seg>One omitted to carry out transfers which would be necessary in order to make the single currency acceptable to those regions whose position and which has already been in recession, if the ECB intensify its policy.</seg>
<seg>The institutional basis for a stable long-term budgetary policy is being undermined.</seg>
<seg>And now Buiter filter ore effectively and see that the ECB has too little room for manoeuvre on the market in order to reward economic immigrants and punish the spendthrifts.</seg>
<seg>There are still no fault lines and for the next time that is only to be expected.</seg>
<seg>However, if we do not change the ground in the euro could well turn out in motion.</seg>
<seg>Milosevic and Hussein jurisdiction as farce:</seg>
<seg>War crimes trial were once a serious matter.</seg>
<seg>We recall the photographs depressed by Herman g√∂ring and Hess Rudolf sitting in the dock in Nuremberg.</seg>
<seg>Some Nazi sizes were hanged even after a relatively short but fair process.</seg>
<seg>At present, the legal proceedings against the most rejected political leaders of our world to the farce.</seg>
<seg>The trial of Saddam Hussein and his cronies from the Ba'ath party are characterised by a continuous series of embarrassingnesses.</seg>
<seg>The accused is trying with a posse after another and Hussein shows every possible form of ignoring the Court to show except the judge the naked back.</seg>
<seg>It is difficult to imagine a result that, in the eyes of the Iraqis or the world will be legitimate.</seg>
<seg>alldieweil changed the process against Slobodan Milosevic to the funeral boring - - after four years of testimonies and a waste of more than 200 million dollars.</seg>
<seg>In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government to haggle nearly a decade, therefore, as the process is to be made to the family elements of the Khmer Rouge.</seg>
<seg>The mass murderers who came to power in the twentieth century, were - - if they did not decease, while they were still in power - - to be condemned, with risings of people killed or for their crimes be brought to justice.</seg>
<seg>You can be proud of the fact that the last Communist ruler of Romania, Nicolae ceau≈üescu, and his wife, without even the semblance of a fair trial were shot?</seg>
<seg>The formal brimborium of genuine courts is always better than the question of law, even if at the end, in both cases, death '.</seg>
<seg>There are now two reliable methods to deal with a number of tyrants.</seg>
<seg>A nation can put their former leaders themselves to court, as the argentinier into the 1980er years with the disappearance of more than 5 000 of its citizens responsible generals did.</seg>
<seg>At international level, the Nuremberg model is further crimes in order - - certainly in the dubious circumstances that winners powers - - sometimes penalties for crimes such as "against" humanity for future processes - - who, for it at the time when they have been committed, no proper definition given.</seg>
<seg>There was a time when the benefits have been clear, both national and international processes.</seg>
<seg>taking place in the local community processes made it possible to achieve through close involvement in the process grief work.</seg>
<seg>When judges and juries could bring the people of the accused but also greater sensitivity in the assessment of the blame, because they were aware of the difficult circumstances in which the outgoing dictator took its decisions.</seg>
<seg>Argentina's proceedings against the generals was a successful ritual with the arduous transition from the military junta to democracy, but the experience ended in tears and voluntary concerns.</seg>
<seg>Even after their condemnation of the generals were still sufficiently powerful in order to force the completion of the process and then the pardon by them following the President.</seg>
<seg>This very day the Argentine policy of process which is past has caused by the legal consequences of those 20 years is labelled.</seg>
<seg>also at international level, the decision by the UN Security Council has been welcomed for the establishment of the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia ICTY (?) with great confidence.</seg>
<seg>The ICTY took, under the direction of Antonio Cassese, a number of fundamental choices.</seg>
<seg>Then the judges had the misfortune to be able to carry out their boldest dream - - the negotiation, before the court against the arch rogue Slobodan Milosevic.</seg>
<seg>It is not clear how the Serbs have referred to a process in their own country with Milosevic.</seg>
<seg>Many would have been dependent on the political party, which would have dominated the Court.</seg>
<seg>At international level, we have not been afraid too much one of policy, but in law.</seg>
<seg>Milosevic process should be more than fair, is a symbol of the justice of the UN.</seg>
<seg>It has allowed Milosevic to defend itself - - from the point of view of the length and efficiency of the procedure, a huge mistake.</seg>
<seg>The number of witnesses, whom the accusation referred to in order to testify again and again, the same horrific story from Serbian aggression and brutality, did not recognise borders.</seg>
<seg>It will take months in order to determine what went wrong and dragged on for four years, why the process scandalous.</seg>
<seg>My instinct tells me that the well-meaning court officials allow themselves to be influenced too much of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission - - a model which is proclaimed in the legal faculties as desirable alternative to revenge law.</seg>
<seg>In the South African procedures, the most important question was not according to the future of the accused, but after the last of the victims.</seg>
<seg>Every victim was encouraged to tell their history and listened to the accused.</seg>
<seg>In the case of during the twentieth century have suffered massacre can such a processing decades require.</seg>
<seg>The victims to talk to encourage and accused of granting the right to delay by anpreisen of their own political cuts / services on the procedure is a recipe for do not end wishing delays outside.</seg>
<seg>a lesson from the trials against Milosevic and Hussein to have learned to make is that we must not place men or women before the Court in order to have their charismatisch attractiveness to an end.</seg>
<seg>They will gain the procedure - - especially when it allows them to defend itself - - and the courtroom to justify their career to use.</seg>
<seg>We should place tyrants only to court if they are clearly thwarted.</seg>
<seg>It is ironic that it was an advantage of Nuremberg courts that they were subject to the representatives of the winner powers.</seg>
<seg>This has been a constant reminder to g√∂ring, Hess and their being a stooge that the allies had authority and the Nazis were unalterably thwarted.</seg>
<seg>The clear objective of the procedure was always the punishment of those guilty, not the influence of future historiography.</seg>
<seg>The tragedy of the trials against Milosevic and Hussein consists in the fact that the 'I' t√ºpfelchen was still lacking in its history and history - - before a court case was.</seg>
<seg>The hesitancy on the part of the responsibility, which is a result of this, has led international - - as national - - to procedures, which facilitated fantastereien of rehabilitation and return.</seg>
<seg>In the case husseins could become the fantasterei even reality.</seg>
<seg>Economic dividing lines in Iraq</seg>
<seg>Iraq is all observers as a State divided between sunniten Shiites and Kurds.</seg>
<seg>But just as a basic dividing line runs along the widening gap between rich and poor - - a dividing line which has contributed to the current uprising, religiously motivated battle as to the resistance against the military occupation claimed by the Americans.</seg>
<seg>When Iraq have been released, above all, many poor people hoped for a charismatischen leader, that would save them from the harsh reality of their everyday lives.</seg>
<seg>These people have not grow up in fear and had any idea how democracy would affect their society or how human rights groups and civil rights movements could make a contribution to the organisation of the future.</seg>
<seg>soon in Iraq was confronted with a new social dividing line.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, were those who had understood how it is done in a democracy, energy and its objectives a reality.</seg>
<seg>They have learned the language of democracy to speak as one in this process to money and influence is independent organisations and how it uses to defend the rights and privileges.</seg>
<seg>On the other side of the dividing line, the great majority of the helpless Iraqis remains, including the widows and divorced women or abandoned by their men who do not have one, which provides for them and their children.</seg>
<seg>For these people, democracy and human rights do not mean anything at all.</seg>
<seg>They do not have education, are poor and ill.</seg>
<seg>As victims of an education system which have collapsed over more than a decade, they can only on a few knowledge, to help them in the maroden Iraqi economy could find an employment.</seg>
<seg>During the rule Saddam's did not give it to any efforts to improve the standard of living of the poor.</seg>
<seg>I visited the enormous slum areas in Iraq and found families who lived in housing, where there was hardly a roof over their heads, which have been seriously affected by insects and where the waste water leaked from the door.</seg>
<seg>at night and day they live in the dark.</seg>
<seg>These families need nothing other than food, reasonably acceptable accommodation and the prospect of a job, but they are waiting for death and fear of the cries of their verhungernden children.</seg>
<seg>When I met the women in these homes, did they over-accumulate me with questions: will the democracy produce food and homes for us?</seg>
<seg>It will consider men to strike their women?</seg>
<seg>Our children will gain the nationality?</seg>
<seg>We will then have a right to divorce of husbands who left us?</seg>
<seg>My answer to all these questions was "".</seg>
<seg>Yes, democracy gives you the right to a decent housing, education and work, your children will acquire the nationality and it is on an equal footing with your men.</seg>
<seg>You will, however, hard work and will have to make every possible effort to give your rights.</seg>
<seg>So the women replied: "Saddam in-blued us 35 years to live without jobs and kicking in fear.</seg>
<seg>What can we do now ".</seg>
<seg>In these beg-poor areas where most Iraqis live, people die bitter temptations.</seg>
<seg>Many of them can be achieved by policy or the government.</seg>
<seg>They fall off in force, theft and sabotage.</seg>
<seg>Inspired by the attempts of the wrong heroism they could not be clear during the long reign of Saddam to enforce it brings the poverty for money from acts of violence.</seg>
<seg>Poverty exacerbates the trauma of the obsessive by wars and gr√§ueln coined / shaped history Iraq, which make people blunt in relation to killing.</seg>
<seg>Although many young men allow themselves to be sometimes by the conditions in Iraq to violence, I am convinced that we must have a proper jobs and shelter to them at our disposal in order to stop it.</seg>
<seg>Above all jobs would help young people to make their lives new by serious work.</seg>
<seg>We must not obscure the army of unemployed by fictitious, no-work-jobs'.</seg>
<seg>We must offer people to jobs, giving them the opportunity to make a contribution to the reconstruction of the country.</seg>
<seg>All human beings are concerned, by nature, be a useful member of society.</seg>
<seg>But the culture which has convinced under Saddam Hussein, to obtain the Iraqis that political links are the only way of power and money and to overcome this attitude it needs time and dynamic economy.</seg>
<seg>This means that the authority of the new Iraqi Government must be limited to the growth of the private sector must at the same time, to make possible a comprehensive understanding of democracy and human rights be promoted.</seg>
<seg>religious groups are prepared to make a contribution to this process.</seg>
<seg>We can also the technocrats who served rehabilitating under Saddam Hussein, so that they too have the opportunity to serve their country.</seg>
<seg>Clearly, we do not have to grant loans poor families, which make it possible for them to develop a genuine life.</seg>
<seg>Above all, the government must not stop trying to convince them and show the Iraqis of the values of democracy and freedom, how important the precondition for the achievement of his dreams of a better life.</seg>
<seg>It will not be easy in a country where many people consider breaking the law as heroic deed.</seg>
<seg>Iraqis but we have also learned the lesson that power must not be concentrated in the hands of a few people and that the creation of fair conditions requires the fight against all forms of corruption.</seg>
<seg>If the situation is to serve as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, the Iraqis must learn to make this fight their fight.</seg>
<seg>Islamic identity</seg>
<seg>Everywhere you can see today how Islam is being used as a political force and abused (?).</seg>
<seg>Some Muslims use it as a call for action; many in the West and elsewhere? () understand it as' demand for other 'demarcation and exclusion.</seg>
<seg>As a Turk I feel both sides of this debate immediately.</seg>
<seg>The reason why Islam in the light of the West appears as' a completely different "religion is based on the fact that the West has a systematic entinstitutionalisierung of religion.</seg>
<seg>the religion of course not disappeared from the modern western life, much more is the requirement that religious institutions make on the behaviour of the individual.</seg>
<seg>In the modern world religion is a much more personal and mirror-image-more ritual experience than ever before.</seg>
<seg>but also within Islam a process of entinstitutionalisierung religious experience is already taking place.</seg>
<seg>the politicisation of Islam is the competence of the religious classes of Islam, ulema.</seg>
<seg>In the West, the religious experience in Islam is becoming more personal.</seg>
<seg>The result of this is the interpretation of religious texts by the individual Muslim, also on the part of the political activists, intellectuals and women.</seg>
<seg>Another is the coarsing of religious knowledge and the theory of the korans is abused and taken out of context, in order to support political objectives.</seg>
<seg>Who decides what is allowed in Islam and which have prohibited?</seg>
<seg>Who has the authority to interpret religious texts?</seg>
<seg>Who can declare a fatwa 'state' or a 'Jihad "?</seg>
<seg>Today, enterprise and terrorism constitute a new source of legitimacy, or force them instead.</seg>
<seg>So what does not mean non-specialists Islam or, and it was decided to abandon the authority of religious schools and special training.</seg>
<seg>Islam is interpreted today primarily by political actors and cultural movements and not by religious institutions.</seg>
<seg>This entinstitutionalisierung made, instead of being a local and national social volume to switch to an imaginary connection between all Muslims for Islam wherever possible to forge itself where they feel oppressed and harassed.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, Islam, followers zerstritten previously been deeply can sometimes subject: spiritual sufi and respect for the Sharia law Muslims; Shiites and sunniten; Conservative Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran.</seg>
<seg>At the same time when its believers and left in the cities, including those of the West has drawn the rural areas, including Islam is guessed / discussed in motion.</seg>
<seg>Many of these development seems somewhat negative and stress that people are socially uprooted, which leads to the alienation and for some to terrorism.</seg>
<seg>But social mobility is also the condition in order to gain a modern perspective.</seg>
<seg>Of course the exodus Muslims experience in a sense of removing or a complete break with their social origin.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, their religious experience are deprived of all, gemeindlichen theological and national institutions in a new way.</seg>
<seg>The religious experience will instead to a form of social idea within which people back to develop a sense of belonging in the new and unfamiliar environment to Islam.</seg>
<seg>The repudiation of modern life, do not separate the approach to this exemptions going back on religious identity.</seg>
<seg>Radicalism is usually originates in groups which, because they have seen mobility and expulsion, are familiar with what was forms of political thinking and urban life in the West.</seg>
<seg>The extraordinary environment confused, they find their support Islam.</seg>
<seg>But if this support will prove its worth, Islam must free in the face of modernity from its traditional unterw√ºrfigen, passive and gentle attitude.</seg>
<seg>By taking a veil or Bart, or at school right to call for their prayer areas in the workplace and stress special food, Muslims are to acknowledge openly as such.</seg>
<seg>They show that everyone in their environment that they assiduously comply with more and more precisely than their religious duties which restrict their religiosit√§t in their private lives.</seg>
<seg>For example non--muslims see a sign of deterioration and oppression of women in the mohammedanischen usually wearing the veil.</seg>
<seg>Instead of a stigma the veil of Muslims have now become the indication of the positive commitment their Islamic identity.</seg>
<seg>mohammedanische young women in Europe illustrate this transformation very closely.</seg>
<seg>girls who wearing the head shroud in French and German schools, are in many respects? (on the youth culture, its modus awareness and its language) for their schoolmates closer ungebildeten mothers tied to their homes.</seg>
<seg>by wearing the head shroud in public opinion in Europe, these young girls unintentionally change the symbol and the role of the mohammedanischen women.</seg>
<seg>This trend goes far beyond the head shroud.</seg>
<seg>all Muslims in the West have a double sense of belonging to a dual cultural capital.</seg>
<seg>They define themselves by their religiosit√§t, but they have acquired a comprehensive and secular knowledge.</seg>
<seg>Because they have a double cultural capital, they can move freely and fairly between various activities areas - between at home, education, youth organisation and urban leisure offers.</seg>
<seg>Muslim and Islamic to be, are not the same.</seg>
<seg>What we are experiencing today the transformation of the mohammedanischen identity is an Islamic.</seg>
<seg>The religious even individual Muslim shift from the private into the public domain.</seg>
<seg>The question which arises is whether everyone, the search for identity with head bag and to a wide public acceptance of the Islamic religious practices can be fulfilled, or whether the positive commitment requires a grunds√§tzlichere rejection of modernity to Islam.</seg>
<seg>A new era for the Islamic science?</seg>
<seg>When science and mathematics enjoyed a few hundred years a period of great inventions, a region of the world, especially was.</seg>
<seg>The leaders of these disciplinary measures were admired, medicine made rapid progress and the average human beings were curious as system functions.</seg>
<seg>As different to expect this region was not given worldwide respect.</seg>
<seg>On the other half of the well-known planet scientists have been punished even destroyed.</seg>
<seg>mathematics was outlawed as godless and inaccurate and subject to the religion later.</seg>
<seg>The standard of living is small.</seg>
<seg>The flourishing region has the Islamic Middle East ignorant, while Europe continues to poor.</seg>
<seg>Both regions have certain science of religion? (historians have different views on the role and the nature of the religions in this context), but erbl√ºhte in only one of the two.</seg>
<seg>Now the Islamic roles of the Middle East and West are of course exchanged.</seg>
<seg>Since the Second World War, the United States is the world leader mean in science.</seg>
<seg>Throughout this period, the most cleverly students from their own countries were withdrawn from universities and higher persuaded to join research better opportunities.</seg>
<seg>Until recently, more than half of all university students in the United States in the fields of mathematics, science and technology was born abroad.</seg>
<seg>Many of these skills remained after the university qualifications, and both the industry and government came to their advantage from it.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile, Islamic cultures have entered a historic period in which science has been identified and avoided with Western influence.</seg>
<seg>Even in countries in which oil revenue could promote research considerable, Arab masters did not support such an investment, with the result that their societies did not flourish as far as they would have it can.</seg>
<seg>Recently, a demand for greater political respect Islamic nations led to invest in technology in view of nuclear ambitions of Pakistan and Iran is particularly clear.</seg>
<seg>These weapons have political weight, but science behind it is commonplace and old.</seg>
<seg>The respect which results from developing evidence is much more important than the products of discoveries of the past.</seg>
<seg>Imagine the influence which was produced by the Institute of Pakistan, who is the world leader in cancer research.</seg>
<seg>Would the political rhetoric shift if researchers in Oman discovered a key to the fight against AIDS?</seg>
<seg>This is a missed opportunity.</seg>
<seg>However, there is another, and not just for Islamic societies.</seg>
<seg>The United States has dropped in the recent past, serious lack rides.</seg>
<seg>Science has replaced throughout the government by the President down by 'affairs' of faith.</seg>
<seg>The reports of point researchers have been amended by political officials if the facts, contrary to the official conviction.</seg>
<seg>By a religious affected government encouraged, educational systems shift its focus of science on 'values ".</seg>
<seg>Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 entry visas has become more and more difficult too has received, which impedes the influx of young talent to American universities.</seg>
<seg>large research organisations protested without results.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, the tax laws have been amending at short notice to give investors to growth in wealth deterrents against long-term investment in research.</seg>
<seg>half a billion dollars were made for the war in Iraq, an amount which is about support for the whole of the basic research in the last thousand years.</seg>
<seg>Even if the United States fundamentalist Middle Ages, they risk clearly about the loss of their global domination in research.</seg>
<seg>Japan has recognised the link between political power and science in the eighties-years.</seg>
<seg>I have morita industrial akio Japan, the President of Sony, and the right aero ishihara politician consider a number of speeches which collect 1986 and a book entitled the Japan can say no to that issue.</seg>
<seg>You have outlined a national strategy, which has emerged from influence on the world leadership in science.</seg>
<seg>The main idea was that military power could be made obsolete, if the 'food chain have controlled' for the military technology by other nations.</seg>
<seg>The title of the book relates to Japan projects to say "no" to the American military influence as soon as Japan controls the decisive military technology.</seg>
<seg>It is quite possible to build a knowledge-based economy by the use of oil wealth.</seg>
<seg>This was evidenced Texas, as most southern US Federal States understood, economically and poor in decline.</seg>
<seg>Although it has been in the hands of oil revenue, the provision of dollars instead into an economy alone does not increase the prosperity as much as one might think.</seg>
<seg>in Texas decided to use its oil money for a training foundation.</seg>
<seg>This funding is around today that the Harvard to university and on 15 universities is distributed.</seg>
<seg>The result is exciting subject: the production in the area of aviation and space industry has disappeared from California so well flourished in Texas.</seg>
<seg>research centres and groupings in the area of telecommunications are in droves from Texas, even of the Canadian telecommunications giant nortel.</seg>
<seg>Although the processing industry is in the United States in crisis, Texas has one of the strongest production-oriented economies in the world.</seg>
<seg>There is no reason why the same result could not be achieved in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>Firstly, the Islamic world to rediscover its proud heritage and take on board.</seg>
<seg>This debate on Iraq, Iran</seg>
<seg>No country in the Middle East focuses on the events in post-war Iraq than Iran.</seg>
<seg>With its western neighbouring link Iran, the geographical proximity a long history of bloody conflict with Iraq Saddam Hussein, religious and emotional ties with the Iraqi marsh Arabs and the concern about the policy of the United States in the region.</seg>
<seg>In view of the ongoing tensions with the USA Iran is especially in view of a possible longer sustainable us presence in Iraq is concerned, as well as by the dominant role of America with the future shape of Iraq after Saddam Hussein.</seg>
<seg>It is quite difficult for outsiders to follow the internal debates in Iran but it and it is these debates are made, even if a greater international public opinion is not at first sight to see.</seg>
<seg>In this debate on Iraq after Saddam Hussein three fundamental approaches are clear.</seg>
<seg>The took the view that Iran is with the United States in Iraq must cooperate inevitably after Saddam, even though it only concerns the rights of the Iraqi marsh Arabs to protect.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, we should agree to Iran that a new government in Iraq this section of the population will not make hostile to treat and friendly bilateral relations.</seg>
<seg>Another fundamental interests of the pragmatists the conservation of the territorial integrity of Iraq and the repatriation zehntausender belong in Iran of living Iraqi refugees.</seg>
<seg>The moderate the pragmatists wants the Iranian Government pressure on America exercises in Iraq has been living members of the Mujahedin? (e) and the MKO Khalq Organisation will break.</seg>
<seg>In return, the Iranian Government should offer its support to the maintenance of peace, stability and security in Iraq.</seg>
<seg>In a word, took the wish to limit the iranian-american relations with an agenda which is primarily national affairs Iran.</seg>
<seg>This approach is broadly supported by conservative forces in Iran.</seg>
<seg>Another approach provides for a more active role in the reconstruction of Iraq and Iran.</seg>
<seg>The supporters of this policy are of the opinion that Iran could well established, owing to its infrastructure of staff and institutional links to facilitate the reconstruction of Iraq.</seg>
<seg>In the long run, it means that the United States and the international community, the value of an Iranian cooperation will recognise.</seg>
<seg>In return for Iranian cooperation, the infrastructure of the MKO should be eradicated in Iraq a promise to it could be linked to Iran may be hard against activities of the aluminium-kaida expelled and to their families living in Iran.</seg>
<seg>It is mainly to the supporters of this position, however, that it is guaranteed by the American side to Iran that it does not become the target of American military action.</seg>
<seg>In short, it is in favour of an open and clear cooperation agreement subject: Iran supports stabilisation in the current transitional phase in Iraq and promises to maintain cooperative relations with each of the Iraqi Government, and that should be given to the guarantee for an improvement of the regional and international position.</seg>
<seg>This view, particularly by Iranian reformists - within and outside the government - and internationally oriented technocrats and economic people will represent.</seg>
<seg>The Group of the European Radical Alliance to the possibility of cooperation with the USA is finally pure fantasy.</seg>
<seg>They believe America would only be to jeopardise the safety and Iran to undermine its national interests.</seg>
<seg>In the eyes of the radicals want the us at least greater changes of the Iranian Foreign policy to violence.</seg>
<seg>In the worst case, then, the Americans have argued vigorously for a change of regime in Iran will occur.</seg>
<seg>They will be actively against the allocation of nuclear knowledge of Iran and may even attempt to undermine the whole military potential Iran.</seg>
<seg>This radicals consider the American invasion of Iraq as part of the American strategy to isolating Iran.</seg>
<seg>This means that they must answer Iran with aggressive defence of its own interests, form strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers and make its influence felt in Iraq in order to prevent an 600, anti-iranian government in Baghdad.</seg>
<seg>hardliners from all groups to support this approach.</seg>
<seg>The fall of Saddam regime was the easy exercise in the Iraq crisis.</seg>
<seg>The difficult part is now subject: peace and stability to guarantee to win the war against terrorism, and to convince the Muslim sections of the population that it is not the intention America to impose its oil to suck off Iraq and the Middle East, to make its image.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile, the rejection of the United States in the form of suicide attacks and other forms of terrorism will very probably increase.</seg>
<seg>Iran is to remain a major force in the region, because its political dynamics and its Muslim identity are massive response throughout the Muslim world.</seg>
<seg>What is happening in Iraq, will have a major impact on Iran and the USA would be well advised to look at this in mind.</seg>
<seg>The American threats or the proposals of a new war fuel in Iran and frustration of resentment and strengthen the most radical forces.</seg>
<seg>If the United States wishes to avoid such a development, they should the influence their own radicals limit and see that in Iraq best by a more extensive cooperation with Iran is to the benefit of the American interests.</seg>
<seg>The road from Iraq</seg>
<seg>Finally, the point is made in Iraq, at which all seem to want the same subject: the withdrawal of the coalition armed forces from the country.</seg>
<seg>The message on a document on the troop withdrawal, recently leaked from the British Ministry of Defence, underlines this desire.</seg>
<seg>The only question is how we can follow it.</seg>
<seg>As long as the coalition forces remain, violence will escalate.</seg>
<seg>But they are also an escalation will only come more quickly.</seg>
<seg>The real question is therefore how we will reach the point at which the Iraqi police and army can show that it is capable of maintaining law and order.</seg>
<seg>It is still a long way, until this objective is also just achieved.</seg>
<seg>Despite the courage of the many Iraqis who join the army and police, no one should be surprised if some motives, which are not entirely pure.</seg>
<seg>In northern Iraq old invoices are carried out and, in areas such as irbil which have traditionally ethnically mixed, a de facto ethnic separation is introduced.</seg>
<seg>In other areas, the law of the Sharia law is enforced by force.</seg>
<seg>How can the Iraq drawn up uniformed services, to which we can trust of an effective and fair enforcement of the law, irrespective of gender, religion and level of ethnicity?</seg>
<seg>The traditional answer is to recruit people to train and to give them the "right values'.</seg>
<seg>But it is not enough time.</seg>
<seg>Other possibilities are necessary.</seg>
<seg>Without a deeply entrenched value system Iraq needs civil society organisations on the ground, the police and the army to take responsibility.</seg>
<seg>These could take various forms, but it is really important that they actually involve and the power structures at Community level, at regional and national level are supported people at local level if they highlight abuse.</seg>
<seg>If there is a local test whose value is national encouraged and recognised, most members of the uniformed services behave accordingly and probably - - if they do not do so, they can be more easily identified and dealt with accordingly.</seg>
<seg>This may sound after excessive optimism, but in Afghanistan, a country which looks like Iraq in many ways, there are groups who work on this objective.</seg>
<seg>The cooperation for peace and harmony cpau (?) provides a model, as this can be done.</seg>
<seg>Just as in Iraq, the dismantling of the violence for ordinary people in Afghanistan has the highest priority.</seg>
<seg>The cpau worked in the last three years throughout the country to establish peace committees at Community level which are supported by peace in the Environment Council villages.</seg>
<seg>The initiative it has to do with a culture in which force so that children have learnt is deeply rooted in the past where by arithmetic dead Soviet troops.</seg>
<seg>The Commission therefore try to bring together all parts of the Community, but also teachers, tribal leaders belong, religious leaders, women, police, soldiers, judges and businessmen in order to find new ways to peaceful conflict resolution.</seg>
<seg>But so far not formally monitoring was part of the role of the committees? (this is planned for the future), brings the mere fact that the police, the army and the law to the committee, we are in contact with the rest of the Community - this is returns and inspires confidence.</seg>
<seg>Some results are important.</seg>
<seg>In a factory local Commander of military made of courtesy was last for a few hours and remained in the end for the whole week.</seg>
<seg>In the end it apologised for his violent past and undertook to disarm his 2000 men strong private army.</seg>
<seg>Now it is visiting the offices of the committee regularly.</seg>
<seg>In Iraq at the moment to start projects such as the humanitarian liaison centre? (humanitarian meeting centre) in Kirkuk to fulfil a monitoring role on the ground by providing the possibility of ethnic mixed populations, their problems to speak and help with the solution to receive them.</seg>
<seg>But judicial decisions, even if they were adopted, are all too often not implemented because of intimidation.</seg>
<seg>Much good work has been done by American and British forces for the strengthening of civil society.</seg>
<seg>We do not hear anything about the workshops for the authorisation of women or the successful organisation of local elections in the small scale throughout the country.</seg>
<seg>But the mobilisation of civil society is an enormous challenge, especially when, as in Iraq, must be done quickly and on a large scale.</seg>
<seg>military forces are still used but also incentives for disarmament, there is also the prospect of economic opportunities which are more fruitful than crime and blackmail.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately, the structure of the civil society skills is just as cheap as important.</seg>
<seg>The humanitarian liaison centre is quite Kirkuk with annual costs of $75.000.</seg>
<seg>With $10 million could be created a further 100 of these centres, and many other "change would be".</seg>
<seg>The challenge is appropriate to undertake this approach to extend it and are completely behind courageous people who accept the challenge, the powerful the responsibility to draw.</seg>
<seg>Otherwise, it is unlikely that the Iraqis are given the security they so urgently need, after so many years of suffering.</seg>
<seg>democracy at the Nile?</seg>
<seg>The surprise decision hosni Egyptian President Mubarak for a constitutional amendment which was to make a direct election of the President with several rivals, could prove in Egypt and the entire Arab world as a major step towards democracy.</seg>
<seg>For the people of the West, who are used to pluralist democracies, may be difficult to understand what an enormous change with it in a country could be linked, which is for more than 50 years of military rule.</seg>
<seg>In the current system Egyptian citizens may appear once every six years on the day of the presidential election at the ballot box and give the only name on the ballot paper their agreement or not.</seg>
<seg>That explains why anybody like Mubarak each time over 90% of the votes, although in different turnout.</seg>
<seg>Syrian and Iraqi leaders has been issued with such systems still better, but this undoubtedly because names and addresses the voters on any ballot paper had to attend.</seg>
<seg>We often argued that the process of democratization in the Middle East will not progress until Egypt participates fully in it.</seg>
<seg>Egypt has not been able to take the path of democracy to cut without changing the constitution - - the pharaonischen powers of its President and restrict its term of office.</seg>
<seg>Mr Mubarak is already in 24 year of his term as President.</seg>
<seg>his announcement is designed to ensure a presidential elections with several rivals an important first step.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the regime is expecting to be able to use this process to their advantage but the course of events is perhaps not so easy to check if people feel to be equipped with power.</seg>
<seg>The real spirit of democracy would have left the bottle.</seg>
<seg>In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this region, which has problem-loaded now on the path to democracy.</seg>
<seg>Turkey on one side of the Middle East and Morocco, on the other, are already on the road.</seg>
<seg>This time is the real pressure from the strict timing and the positive results of the recent elections in Iraq to Palestine and, to a lesser extent, in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg>During the unprecedented demonstrations against the Syrian team in Lebanon as a result of the murder of the former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri no end is in sight.</seg>
<seg>also Egyptian groups organised risky oppositions moving in the last few weeks are increasingly and other forms of civil disobedience to the day.</seg>
<seg>Their anger was fuelled by the arrest of opposition health attacked head eiman only at the end of January.</seg>
<seg>The ruthless approach of the government had movement, which calls for an end to the Mubarak regime to a resumption of the national "kifaya? ('enough).</seg>
<seg>The widespread view that Egyptians would be passive and back-shrank from activities, suddenly no longer appeared to be maintained.</seg>
<seg>an alliance of local, regional and international forces some against daily tyranny on the banks of the Nile.</seg>
<seg>The recent wave of pressure from the population seems to have shaken the regime.</seg>
<seg>Just one month ago, Mubarak dismissed demands for a constitutional reform '' unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg>But whatever constellation of events always caused their transformation, an initiative to amend the right to vote should be welcomed.</seg>
<seg>It is a necessary - - although insufficient - - first step for the amendment of the way of political system in Egypt.</seg>
<seg>The Egyptians are sceptical about reforms in relation to excuse waged in Tunisia, where its aluminium-abidin long-term President Ben Ali has created a caricature of a constitutional amendment which made it possible kompetitive in elections, but then to virtual ballot led by a few choose "other candidate" started.</seg>
<seg>In previous presidential election in Tunisia achieved Ben Ali 99% of the votes, with this choice was of a routine 96%.</seg>
<seg>We therefore hope that this means Mubarak more serious in their right to vote reform.</seg>
<seg>As a gesture of it must only make the immediate release of eiman and take measures in order to put an end to the state of emergency running since 24 years that an election campaign actively discouraged.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, Mubarak should push for a restriction of the term of office of President on two occasions five years.</seg>
<seg>confidence-building measures, including an open and equal access to the media, are equally necessary which are currently under state control.</seg>
<seg>I have said that I intend to stand as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections in order to such a debate on these fundamental reforms.</seg>
<seg>I would gladly withdraw myself, however, again in my private life if free and open elections were guaranteed in the autumn.</seg>
<seg>In serious implementation of these measures mubaraks legacy in another light would be seen.</seg>
<seg>Together with the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine a long overdue Arab spring of freedom could be heralded.</seg>
<seg>historic elections in Egypt?</seg>
<seg>On 7 September choose the Egyptians their new presidents. belongs to the ten candidates for 24 years of Commissioners hosni President Mubarak.</seg>
<seg>Although his re-election is almost beyond doubt, one has the electoral process in many places, with great interest.</seg>
<seg>In this election 6000 national election observers and hundreds of foreign journalists are preparing this week in Egypt.</seg>
<seg>Although it is in line with the additional criteria for what is a fair round, important aspects of the credibility are lacking in stark way.</seg>
<seg>Despite the promises we are a long way from equal opportunities.</seg>
<seg>Mr Mubarak is still too many trump cards in hand: recognising value, a de facto monopoly on the state-controlled electronic media, as well as about 85% of the written press.</seg>
<seg>Some opposition candidates one week before the elections is still waiting for the broadcasting of their choice spots on the Egyptian television.</seg>
<seg>All the members of the parliamentary committee for the presidential elections were appointed by Mubarak and with the new electoral legislation has to be independent challengers every opportunity.</seg>
<seg>Following a ruling of the Court of Justice the 8 000 Egyptian courts have to monitor the elections and confirm the results since the year 2000.</seg>
<seg>This ruling was an important step towards fair elections, since the professional association of judges to assert their independence in the last 50 years and access to some extent against the attempts of the executive authority.</seg>
<seg>Therefore the Mubarak regime had at various fraudsters resort to judge combination out boats.</seg>
<seg>We adopted, for example, to the "judiciary" thousands loyal government officials, who could show a conclusion in law, but it did not have experience of Court for the real judges the hands tied because, with a protest through boycott of its monitoring duties would have been given this task once again the police forces of the notorious Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
<seg>In the past, the judge combined with foreseeable effects added.</seg>
<seg>In the parliamentary elections in the year 2000, the governing party in the mubaraks constituencies supervised by approximately 38% achieved real judges of the votes, while the voting figure rose, where the quasi-judges at work were to 86%.</seg>
<seg>This year, it promises to be quite different.</seg>
<seg>In the spring, the judges held a national general assembly. we agreed to monitor the forthcoming presidential elections and parliamentary elections (?) only if the government protects the complete independence and exclusive monitoring of the selection process to the judges.</seg>
<seg>on 2 September made it their final demands: the choice has to be able to be monitored by civil society groups, the definition, who is a legitimate judge for electoral purposes, must not be changed, and no urn must be removed, without the votes before a legitimate judge and the result was counted was confirmed and submitted by this.</seg>
<seg>Up to now it looks like stalemate, because the chairman of the parliamentary Committee on the Egyptian television stated publicly that he is opposed to any form of monitoring of the electoral process by citizens.</seg>
<seg>Another interesting development on the eve of the elections is the violent public debate on whether we can now give its voice or boycott the presidential election.</seg>
<seg>Several opposition parties asked their members to stay away from the choice of protest against the all too restrictive election regulations which provide Mubarak a huge advantage to the other candidates.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, the supposedly strongest individual opposition in Egypt, the Muslim community brother reminds their supporters of the vote and urges them to adopt a dilemma in order not to support any "despotic, corrupt leader '.</seg>
<seg>That is an implicit but clear rejection mubaraks autocrat, of the last 24 years.</seg>
<seg>around 34 civil society organisations prepare despite repeated representations by the government of thousands of young Egyptians for the monitoring of elections.</seg>
<seg>These groups are of the opinion that the national and international monitoring of elections should be no problem, if the government does not provide for at least to manipulate the ballot.</seg>
<seg>The regime shelves that any monitoring by foreign people a violation of the Egyptian sovereignty and national election observers would be an insult to the integrity of the judges.</seg>
<seg>The basis was taken away from this argument straight away, when the judge combination to admit its support of the civil observers have given.</seg>
<seg>Whether the Mubarak regime is now at home and abroad, because of the growing demands for free and fair elections in panic or whether we are simply not able to remedy the party the habitual fraud the current indications of the election on Wednesday not augur well.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile, the Egyptians experience for the first time an exciting foretaste of resistance to tyranny and enjoy a newly discovered area of freedom.</seg>
<seg>Europe's dollar envy</seg>
<seg>monetary issues can come into focus not only commercial transactions but also diplomatic and political z√§nkereien.</seg>
<seg>If this happens, economic transactions will be more difficult and subject to greater insecurity.</seg>
<seg>the politicisation of the money in the depression of intermediate wartime affected economically disastrous itself.</seg>
<seg>But it was even in recent times unpleasant currency rightly wars.</seg>
<seg>In the 1960er international financial order came to years into the centre of the political tug-of-war.</seg>
<seg>Each side has quite different theories and explanations of what took place.</seg>
<seg>The Europeans - in particular the French - complaints about what is called the 'General Charles de Gaulle' exorbitant privilege of the US dollar.</seg>
<seg>The general and its financial guru, Jacques rueff, said, the United States, the status of the dollar as a general reserve currency under the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates would use in order to seek to allow deficits and for their overseas military abenteurertum? (responsible at the time in Vietnam).</seg>
<seg>France has reacted to financial reform with the call to encourage: in order to put an end to the special role of the dollar and tried to a large extent gold standard discredited once again.</seg>
<seg>We Europeans have a long debate on the advantages of monetary union in order to be able to work with this achievement in the eyes of the dollar.</seg>
<seg>But from the American position of the international role of the dollar was a trap.</seg>
<seg>Other countries could change their exchange rates and maintain this way for a greater competitiveness for exports.</seg>
<seg>The US Government has been powerless in the face of an underestimated yens and fed the belief that the rest of the world will the dollar used in order to attack of America production basis.</seg>
<seg>The government Nixon came to the conclusion that the only way to save the American economy is the monetary unilateralism, such a drastic extension of money that other countries were forced to adapt their exchange rates.</seg>
<seg>These battles forgotten for a long time, appear to be very current rise again.</seg>
<seg>The world is no longer in the regime of fixed exchange rates, but is, the greater the dollar reserve currency - a kind of ongoing Bretton Woods.</seg>
<seg>For us, the role of the dollar as a reserve currency is a potential threat, while it seems to non--americans as another case of the American neoimperialen search for supremacy.</seg>
<seg>In this decade China, Japan has taken place in the 1960er years held. it retains its exchange rates, low in order to activate the growth of its exports.</seg>
<seg>China is a goal of us complaints about unfair competition and their efforts to force an adjustment of the exchange rates, which would prevent us from it, Chinese toys, equipment and to buy clothes.</seg>
<seg>The producers in the USA has decided that in China b√ºstenhalter produced pose a threat to the American way of life.</seg>
<seg>In the meantime, the Europeans, particularly the French (?) complain about the great us deficit and the de Gaulle's argument that the rest of the world is to be responsible for America's wars, is still in operation.</seg>
<seg>A number of Europeans, the Asian central banks should propose a larger part of their currency reserves in euros hold. that are an echo of the unsuccessful attempt, in which the general America wanted to force through the buy-out of gold against the dollar to its knees.</seg>
<seg>The 1960er years ended with the collapse of the 'in' system and greater financial turbulences. was also an inflationary increase prices of goods.</seg>
<seg>All have been damaged and America role in world affairs were shocked.</seg>
<seg>A similar collapse today is likely to produce a completely different effects.</seg>
<seg>The system of free exchange rates is now greater and the burden of adaptation is different distributed.</seg>
<seg>Most of the Americans do not suffer from the clear dollar crash, since the seller from abroad must adapt their prices in the US market.</seg>
<seg>The Asian economies grow strong and gather in their central banks demands on the United States.</seg>
<seg>They will probably continue this policy, since the alternative would lead to a sudden setback for the competitiveness of its export sectors on the American market, extremely important for them.</seg>
<seg>That leaves longer time their balance of payments deficit, it cannot be maintained in the long term to concern with regard to the United States.</seg>
<seg>The economically prosperous regions of the world, North America and Asia - are in this way linked in a pact which will guarantee the central role of the American dollar until further notice.</seg>
<seg>The Americans will meet further debt, because the Asians so wish of them.</seg>
<seg>The Pact to terminate would be against the interests of both sides.</seg>
<seg>This is not American unilateralism, because it means that cooperation with Asia.</seg>
<seg>But for the Europeans, who are excluded from this Pact, it looks like monetary and economic unilateralism.</seg>
<seg>In the meantime, the rise of the euro is in relation to the dollar for considerable pain with European goods exporters.</seg>
<seg>But Europe cannot do much in order to provide relief.</seg>
<seg>Europe will actually be in the new currency is more victims.</seg>
<seg>In the 1960er answers which have been trumpeted years - the reinvigoration of the gold standard, or the introduction of a single European currency - no longer seem to be very helpful.</seg>
<seg>A single currency, has proved to be an important protection.</seg>
<seg>Only the old form of European response, psychologists might call it 'dollar' envy - will increase.</seg>
<seg>There will be appeals to the European Central Bank to extend the monetary basis as if the imitation of the dollar, would be the answer to all industrial, structural and demographic problems which trouble Europe.</seg>
<seg>But this brief reflection should remind us that of Europe are not dependent on manipulation of the currency problems.</seg>
<seg>The protest against the new version of an exorbitant American money prerogative should be seen for what it is: a way to genuine European powerlessness to resign ourselves.</seg>
<seg>It will therefore remain with the dollar envy and it will increase if the international value of the greenbacks melts there without clearly adverse effect on the people who print and use it.</seg>
<seg>The epidemic of political influence</seg>
<seg>Just as the Americans have taken note of the citizens of other countries in the world that the policy plays an important role in the case of the employment of certain public offices.</seg>
<seg>Only a few are sometimes surprised?) (disappointed when the order of a senior judge or diplomat will take place after the opinion of his loyalty to certain political principles of the Party of the President and Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg>There is, however, almost complete agreement on the fact that science will take a privileged furthermore, the United States is starting in this respect, however, for a cautionary example for the rest of the world to develop.</seg>
<seg>appointments in the field of science should be based on objective criteria such as education, skills and performance.</seg>
<seg>Of course it is legitimate to ask a future American Minister of Health to its view on abortion.</seg>
<seg>But it is totally inappropriate to present members of staff scientific advisers a test of their political allegiance.</seg>
<seg>Similarly, the membership of peer review committees - a central body of scientific progress - should be completely free from accession obstacles which do not relate to scientific qualifications.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, wissenschafter in the USA are faced with ever more obstacles of this kind.</seg>
<seg>In the autumn, the scientific journal published scientific several articles on this subject.</seg>
<seg>In one of these contributions to the total transfers of staff from a consultative committee of the American National Centre for health and the environment, a sub-section of the Centre for Disease Control was and preventing CDC (?), without any prior consultation with the director / conductor of the institution concerned.</seg>
<seg>Similar cases involved the Consultative Committee of the CDC to lead poisoning and prevention, as well as the ethics commissions advisory committee on national human research to protect sanctions and advisory committee on genetics testing.</seg>
<seg>The extensive disease at the moment of political influence, in whose crews adviser committees are fully occupied and again candidate a loyalty test will be presented, seems to be for some observers hat.</seg>
<seg>officials in the American Department of Health 'call' usual practice.</seg>
<seg>Now, it is not normal practice in America, at least it has not so far proved that.</seg>
<seg>In any case, is not really worrying that the Bush administration is investigating candidates for its compatibility with their 'values ".</seg>
<seg>The most serious aspect of this development is this ideological radically review penetrates into areas which were previously immune to this kind of manipulation.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the most flagrant example of spreading epidemic of political influence was the transfers of staff from a committee of American Institute for health and safety at work, who themselves with the financing of studies on violations in the workplace employed.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps sometimes consultative committees were subjected to this kind of influence in the past.</seg>
<seg>They recommend to implement the political strategies or not.</seg>
<seg>But for study financing committees responsible?</seg>
<seg>In October 2002, publish science a leader David michaels and some of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg>For them it was a former high officials, some of the committees consulted mentioned: on the basis of his personal experience it provided valuable information on this subject.</seg>
<seg>Their contribution was one of history, but which has subsequently been even more interesting.</seg>
<seg>It was a flood of letters in which wissenschafter reported of similar experiences.</seg>
<seg>a candidate for the coordinating committee of the American health Institute for research of muskeldystrophie told how it was examined by a Member of the White House.</seg>
<seg>After we had made themselves on their opinion different strategies of the Bush administration, which you had anything to do with the work of the Committee, it has been asked whether it supports the policy of the President about embryonic stem cells.</seg>
<seg>Another sender, an excellent Professor of psychiatry and psychology, talked about a call from the White House in which one informing him of his nomination for the American National Council against drug abuse.</seg>
<seg>The caller stated that he would have to make review him another to determine whether he any views are ', which would be difficult for the President'.</seg>
<seg>According to the comments made by Professor a number of questions were put to it, and the staff of the White House constantly raised a scoring.</seg>
<seg>An example: "you now have two out of three: President without taking account of the consequences for moral reasons against needle exchange programmes [for addicts on intravenously consumed drugs'].</seg>
<seg>The question then took an even more unpleasant turn.</seg>
<seg>The official asked the candidate whether he would have elected bush. as he knew that this was not the case, put behind it subject: "Why didn't 'you support the President?</seg>
<seg>That is the procedure in dictatorships and not in democracies.</seg>
<seg>scientific consultant committees are balanced there and thoughtful discussions on the policy to make.</seg>
<seg>If the desired political outcome is in the first place, we have gained a lot, but this will not be lost.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, the decision that research projects are to be supported, has always been a matter of objective investigation by professional colleagues and not by politicians.</seg>
<seg>The American law actually need relevant in this respect, the Federal Advisory Committee act - that committees must be built up "balanced and by bringing authority improperly not to be affected to be allowed".</seg>
<seg>The American Minister of Health Tommy Thompson department and the staff of the White House should set an example to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg>That can be done: very simply by applying the law.</seg>
<seg>murder in Moscow</seg>
<seg>It is time to clear up the fiction according to which centre office-communist Russia would have become less lawless by Vladimir have 'dictatorship of the law ".</seg>
<seg>The murder of Anna politkowskaja, one of the most courageous and best journalists in Russia, a woman who has dared to bring the brutal murder of the Russian forces in Chechnya to the public is the last proof that President Putin did not establish any more than an ordinary dictatorship, with all the accompanying normal infringement of the law.</seg>
<seg>This recognition is there in time for the world, especially for Europe.</seg>
<seg>The German Minister for Foreign Affairs, proves that it is working on a strategy for the Russian-German relations in which the indifference is to be established to have lawlessness as national interest of the most powerful Member of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>However, this indifference will appeasement if it encourages Putin to postpone its lawless methods on the international stage as current with its campaign to ruin Georgia economically.</seg>
<seg>The murder of politkowskaja triggered a sinister d√©j√† vu subject: as the time when the KGB at the height of their power was people simply disappear into place in Russia.</seg>
<seg>The killing politkowskajas is the third political colour murder within three weeks.</seg>
<seg>enwer siganschin, chief engineer of BP are Russia, was shot to 30 September in Irkutsk.</seg>
<seg>Andrey Kozlov, Deputy Governor of the Russian Central Bank, the campaign against fraud has just finance was killed on 14 September.</seg>
<seg>The fact that the Russian Public Prosecutor tschajka JURI transferred, as in the case kozlow the investigations in the murder politkowskaja case, does not give cause for great hope, as this would be the case if genuine democracies representatives of high law circles are consulted.</seg>
<seg>The integration of the highest Russian Government circles is almost a guarantee that the murderers are never taken.</seg>
<seg>The murder of Mrs politkowskaja is a particularly grim omen, when one considers that it deals with it one of the most powerful critic within the Russian President.</seg>
<seg>In his articles on one of the last independent newspapers in Moscow, novaya gazeta and in their books' in place in Russia chechnya. "and" the truth about the war "politkowskaja wrote about the loss of freedom, which has to be a typical feature of the Presidency.</seg>
<seg>Both the expulsion of the previous medienzaren Boris out beresowsky and Vladimir Gusinsky, as well as the arrest of the √∂lmagnaten Mikhail chodorkowsky show what would happen to exile, detention or the graves have Disliking subject:.</seg>
<seg>I do not reproach in government to put politkowskaja on an order murderer to have killed.</seg>
<seg>As an investigative journalist politkowskaja has not only with Putin to pursue a policy of kidnappings to ransom but also with many different made unpopular, not least with the current Chechen Prime Minister ramsan kadyrow she accused.</seg>
<seg>But if Vladimir put to people with the murder of politkowskaja in the lift their house in the city of Moscow have not even do anything, ignoring the laws have created a climate in which this murder took place.</seg>
<seg>Like the murder of Mr Thomas Beckett in the Cathedral of Canterbury many centuries ago was clearly committed the crime in the belief that it would ask the king.</seg>
<seg>In view of this, for which politkowskaja was - - for the responsibility of a democratic press to analyse the Kremlin and its policy - - the government should have ensured that the journalist zust√∂sst nothing wrong.</seg>
<seg>Put in Russia over the last six years already 12 leading journalists lost through murder.</seg>
<seg>None of these crimes have been cleared up, that would be different if placed in 'dictatorship of the law "more than a pr-strategy.</seg>
<seg>The six years since Vladimir Putin's appearance in the region have been a period of deeply contradictory signals.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, the world is looking at a young, formed Head of State who promises to modernise Russia and to bring the country, especially with regard to law enforcement and judicial practice to international standards.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, the President has silent if its former colleague in the Russian security service the FSB? (former KGB) on did not threaten that life and limb offers any security and a number of famous cases of espionage against journalists, scientists and environmental activists in motion machine.</seg>
<seg>Amongst these 'neo' journalist Grigori Pasko gauges espionage, arms control expert Igor sutjagin, diplomatic moisejew Valentin, physicist danilow Valentin and others are.</seg>
<seg>The supposed civilizing influence the role of Russia as a partner in the West is - - such as, for example, its Presidency with the G8 summit in pc. Petersburg - - seems to have any effect in the Kremlin kabale missed.</seg>
<seg>The confrontation with Western values is once again a Potemkin village day, Russia is promoted a front of laws and democratic institutions, behind this window blind is, however, the same blanks in arbitrary embezzlement.</seg>
<seg>The threat to the world that have lawlessness is exported.</seg>
<seg>All abroad close a form of kriminalisierter diplomacy raging.</seg>
<seg>In this context we consider have attempt to manipulate the presidential election in Ukraine or regularly put forward and has withdrawn criminal charges against the opposition leader Julia tymoschenko.</seg>
<seg>One need only think of the conditions in the secessionist regions in Moldova and Georgia, which can only be because the Kremlin supports this.</seg>
<seg>We consider, like the Kremlin tried to blackmail by its neighbours threatening its energy supply.</seg>
<seg>every police officer knows that criminals are becoming increasingly dreister when criminal behaviour is ignored.</seg>
<seg>It is high time that the world is Vladimir Putin as what it is: a man that Russia back into darkness leads.</seg>
<seg>The world must remember the old Latin principle qui tacet consentire videtur - - who is silent seems to agree - - and we must ask itself whether it is wise to bear the formation of a lawless energy superpower with Putin silent.</seg>
<seg>This empire pipeline to Russia</seg>
<seg>Gerhard Schroeder, which was less than a month ago of German Chancellor, agreed to become supervisory board chairman of the company which continues to build a gas-pipeline of Russia in the Baltic to Germany and in Western Europe.</seg>
<seg>In many countries Schroeder has now made a conflict of interests because of the process.</seg>
<seg>its obvious moral nature is reinforced by the fact that Russia is precisely at this moment to turn off the gas supply of Ukraine if the country does not meet the requirements for price of national gas giant of the Kremlin, Gazprom.</seg>
<seg>Russia's strategic order is obvious: the Ukraine to stop Europe also means of gas supply limited to a large extent, because some of the largest European gas-pipelines by Ukraine are starving the gas.</seg>
<seg>The Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic States are obviously evaded, the new pipeline the Kremlin promises even greater influence in the region is to state.</seg>
<seg>President Vladimir Putin and his government from former KGB crews must make themselves with the decision as hard they exclude Russia centre office-communist neighbours, no more concerned about Western Europe.</seg>
<seg>Mr Putin should actually provide Europe with this new imperial weapons?</seg>
<seg>Worse still, Russia might draw this weapon against an EU instructed on energy?</seg>
<seg>The fact that a former German Chancellor will lead the company which could give Russia a means to hand in order to manipulate the European Union economy shows Europe dangerous indifference in the face of putting in neoimperialistischer ambitions.</seg>
<seg>No doubt of Russia are responsible media about the increasing European dependent on the Russian energy.</seg>
<seg>It smoulder towards even this subject: after our Community gas company standardised and increased Russian leader writer says, Europe on human rights will be silent.</seg>
<seg>This attitude with Mr Putin is more indirectly by its commitment to the expression, one of them in such a way called "independent" policy to pursue.</seg>
<seg>The fact that he understands that Russia should be "independent" of the moral and human rights concerns of Western democracies.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps some European leaders actually believe that the maintenance of convenient wealth of the Union to justify our silence on human rights and other issues which are annoying the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg>Of course we can adopt a position, in short, to 'business' affairs to be quite prepared to the expropriation of YUKOS, but if the Kremlin gives our values or criticism of Russian bad actions - - for example in the blood-stained Chechnya - - with a price, the Europeans seem to keep their mouths, as the possibility of higher energy prices, or even a blockade, as they are still the Ukraine in relation to take.</seg>
<seg>While Putin reshuffles its Court and the Duma to its will assume that the hopes of the European Union for a growing 'communitization' of Russia should be abandoned.</seg>
<seg>The Russia which builds Putin, has transformed by post office-soviet hopes for freedom in an oil and gas bulwark for the new model of the former KGB elite.</seg>
<seg>Indeed Matthias warnig, the Director-General of the pipeline consortium, is what Schroeder will preside, an old friend put in.</seg>
<seg>In the Wall Street Journal reported in this year, that warnig leading Russian branch of the dresdens Bank was an officer the state security services, the East German secret police, and Mr Putin learned in the late 1980ern know when the Russian President has deployed a KGB espionage gauge in East Germany.</seg>
<seg>that the Russians have a government in the former KGB staff, for whom a lack of compassion and intolerance are in relation to differing views the standard, reflect the exhaustion of the trubel over the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg>Now the Kremlin seems to think that what is good for ordinary Russians is good for independent nations towards small and poor countries: no pity is referred to as soon as Russia has the tools to isolate and them with the prospect of an energy barrier threaten to intimidate them.</seg>
<seg>As a former head of state of the newly independent Lithuania I have received such threats often.</seg>
<seg>The European Union signed many agreements with Russia, including one for a 'common area of freedom and justice'.</seg>
<seg>The Kremlin understands very well to be such a idealism.</seg>
<seg>The control of Eastern Europe was inadmissible always on the basis of partnership agreements' and the 'Soviet invasions of 1956 Hungary and Czechoslovakia 1968 fraternal' were 'operations.</seg>
<seg>However, we consider, like Mr Putin this' common 'abused barbaric treatment of area: the Chechens, the businessman Mikhail chodorkowski in prison, foreign NGOs in distress, one of the mitanf√ºhrerinnen of orangenen revolution last year, timoschenko Julia of Russian military prosecutors for invented accusations accused.</seg>
<seg>If Europeans take their common area for human rights and freedoms seriously, they must recognise that these values are not shared by adding p√∂stcheninhabern into place the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg>The same is true if Russia is regarded as an ally in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg>It is really to be threatened conceivable that the home of the 'red terror "is reliable support with countless unpunished crime from the Soviet era, whose sees trail of blood in its wake of Lithuania in the Caucasus, Iran and North Korea from the world?</seg>
<seg>It is more likely that the estimate heads of the Kremlin will only use every crisis as an opportunity to increase their destructive power and influence.</seg>
<seg>For decades, my home region at the mercy of the Bosman was issued.</seg>
<seg>That is why I cannot sit back in silence, while Europe hineinstolpert blindly into new policy of appeasement.</seg>
<seg>We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe have taught by our heritage that behind every diplomatic action of Russia imperial efforts hide.</seg>
<seg>The Western Europeans, who have been spared this heritage should heed our warnings.</seg>
<seg>The dependence on Russia - - even if it is now in the face of the so-called 'charismatischen Gerhard Schroeder' - - will only lead to disaster.</seg>
<seg>A bullets and elections in Iraq</seg>
<seg>When the Iraq war has begun, 2003, the Bush Government followed very ambitious plans subject: in Germany and Japan after 1945, a long and peaceful team had been planned, while expanding oil production should ensure increasing prosperity and democratic structures have been built bit by bit.</seg>
<seg>The basis must be a liberal, even Postmodernism Constitution which guarantees 25% of Mrs seats in Parliament.</seg>
<seg>In today's Iraq there is no peace and no prosperity.</seg>
<seg>The condition on which we shall vote on 15 October, contains the 25% -regel, otherwise, is to be done, however, far from it, liberal.</seg>
<seg>The key provision? (Article 2) that no law "the unchallenged rules of Islam 'may contravene contravenes the basic principle of the political sovereignty and will prevent the legislation to meet international standards.</seg>
<seg>For example, the age of sexual majority cannot be included with girls for nine years, because Mohammed had a nine years old woman.</seg>
<seg>It follows that girls of nine years in criminal law is also regarded as adult and are subject to the death penalty, for example the crossing of a religion.</seg>
<seg>In the wider context of the Shiites can put its ayatollahs aid of this regulation in Iran on the elected Parliament, because only have the right to determine the "regulations" of Islam.</seg>
<seg>outsiders and the few Iraqi Liberals are mainly on the Islamic regulation concerns, but the widespread Sunni resistance to the Constitution is directed against other provisions subject: the exclusion of the 'saddamistischen Ba' athist party "from political life and of the government and the federalist rules which give the 18 Iraqi provinces autonomy and allow them to agree to regional governments.</seg>
<seg>The exclusion rule is a personal matter for the Sunni elite - - including thousands of businessmen, experts and even artists, because apart from a few exceptions were all of them Ba 'athist Members.</seg>
<seg>In theory, the ban in the Constitution could be interpreted in such a way that it applies only to the future.</seg>
<seg>But in practice the administrative rules applied to time so that 'high level' so-called Ba 'athist Members are excluded from any government activity and thousands of them are concerned.</seg>
<seg>The sunniten would probably accept the federalist rules if they only applied to the Kurds.</seg>
<seg>You know that the alternative is not the return to the centralism, but the secession of the three predominantly Kurdish provinces dahuk Arbil and, as sulaymaniyah in order to base an independent Kurdistan with its own treasury, army? (the peschmerga) and oil production of Kirkuk - - with the second largest oil reserves in Iraq - -.</seg>
<seg>The sunniten rejected the same federalism for the Shiites, since they consider them related Arabs, who will do again the Sunni rule in the past and that - - it is always accepted, it makes its own government.</seg>
<seg>That would make the new Constitution possible because the provinces with Shi-ite majority in the South, which have the greatest part of Iraqi oil reserves could form their own regional government.</seg>
<seg>In the Middle East usual style disappointed sunnitenf√ºhrer who are dissatisfied with the Constitution, are now threatening with violence.</seg>
<seg>But the federalism is not the reason why Sunni Islamic extremists and commit fatal attacks.</seg>
<seg>their resistance is more fundamental subject: you do not accept the principle of a democratic majority government.</seg>
<seg>Instead, they would like to restore the rule of Sunni minority.</seg>
<seg>For the Islamists Shiites deserve all death anyway, just like abtr√ºnnige.</seg>
<seg>One of the leaders muqtada Sadr Shia, is also very strongly opposed to federalism.</seg>
<seg>his supporters are predominantly ungebildeten, the poorest and most violent Shiites from the slums in Baghdad and the environment, whose 'mahdi militias "2004 further-fought even then, even against the American troops, when the Americans protected against Sunni Shiites aggressors.</seg>
<seg>As a very young priest who from his father died Ayatollah - - even a populist - - takes its authority Sadr meets the resistance of the living ayatollahs of Iraq, which knock his ignorance and brutality.</seg>
<seg>As regards the religious authority Sadr cannot possibly take it up with them, so he will take a arab-nationalistic stance against them and often reminds us of the fact that the high priest, sistani Shia Ayatollah, perser and no Arab.</seg>
<seg>In the same way, he calls its supporters in mind the fact that the El of hooking cim which state the Supreme Council of Islamic revolution in Iraq sciri (?), and their 'badr militias "subsidised exiles in Iran, many of which were in the long and difficult Iran-Iraq war on Iran has fought for the Americans' them 'returned.</seg>
<seg>Sadr is against federalism, because a regional Shi-ite government would follow his enemies sistani and sciri and then says it under Iranian influence would turn out.</seg>
<seg>In order to underline his message sent its Sadr men in order to attack the badr militia, which has managed to him in Baghdad, where the mahdis are many in Najaf, where Sadr is hated in the last year, the resulting destruction, remain fruitless it - - until its men were massacred by the Americans.</seg>
<seg>It was bad enough to cope with Sadr bandits but as a simple political calculation results in that it will probably be the central figure for the outcome of the elections to the Constitution in October.</seg>
<seg>In order to reject and new elections for a national assembly force the Constitution, the opponents of a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces need.</seg>
<seg>The sunniten is probably only in two areas, but if Sadr instructs its supporters in the slums in Baghdad to vote together with the local sunniten with "no" that would probably decide the capital of the State opponents, which would guarantee the rejection of the Constitution.</seg>
<seg>As a political ganove Sadr is naturally prepared to be bought.</seg>
<seg>Last year it was sought for murder.</seg>
<seg>Now it wants to be recognised as a statesman it wants money and, at least implicitly, humiliation sistanis and sciri.</seg>
<seg>It will probably be haggling, perhaps that is already started.</seg>
<seg>But some of the Shias whom he attacks with words and a bullets, have thousands of armed one among themselves and think that only a bullets should be offered to him.</seg>
<seg>The collapse of the secret police</seg>
<seg>As Prime Minister of Hungary had to decide Ferenc gyurcsany when a recorded declaration that his government trialogue led to excesses, open new democracies of Eastern Europe, which is not always easy.</seg>
<seg>Just like Hungary, Romania has endeavoured communism to increase transparency and honesty in one of the societies of the world's most completed.</seg>
<seg>While we have tried, the continuing secrecy has led to a massive extension of corruption and abuse of authority.</seg>
<seg>But it - - finally - - has a real movement towards more openness, this progress by the European Union has been recognised when it gave the green light to Romania's accession to the European Union for the beginning of 2007.</seg>
<seg>Apart from achieving the European Union regards this as a "functioning market economy", there are important political and legal changes which I, as Minister of Justice monitored and which cover areas as varied as increased transparency and control in the establishment of political parties or the full umkrempelung of the judiciary.</seg>
<seg>judicial reforms help to eliminate corruption.</seg>
<seg>against the former and current members of government, MEP, lawyers, judges, prosecutors, police, customs officials and other employees of the public service as well as directors of privatunternehmen was raised accusation.</seg>
<seg>In this respect, new forms of standard introduced on which everyone, which must be an official position in the government, in Parliament or in the judiciary in holding public or local administration, its assets and its financial interests.</seg>
<seg>The new statements are the most detailed in Europe, and, above all, they are published.</seg>
<seg>Romania's progress in one month in this report which it is confirmed that shows that citizens' access to public information is just as good in Eastern Europe in old-established democracies.</seg>
<seg>The report silence? (transparency and openness and silence) actually interprets the open society initiative? (justice right initiative for an open society, www.justiceinitiative.org) was written that the new democracies can teach old, in some cases, a certain parties: the national authorities in Romania dealt with some information questions of the citizens as similar authorities in France or Spain.</seg>
<seg>Particularly in Romania 60% of the recorded questions have been answered, compared to 31% in France and 24% in Spain.</seg>
<seg>In the other countries which fared and Peru and Mexico, which were also adopted both in 2002, just to Romania, laws to the obligation to provide information of public facilities.</seg>
<seg>But it is not always easy in transition democracies to reach sensitive information, as I know from my previous work than human rights lawyer at the Romanian Helsinki Committee.</seg>
<seg>Often we had to go to court in order to force on Romania's law to freedom of information for 2001, the publication of information.</seg>
<seg>Even if we had won, for example, a case in which it was access to the record of heard telephone calls, which had been approved by the Attorney-General, ignored the public prosecutor the Court so simple.</seg>
<seg>We have tabled a civil action against the public prosecutor and judges imposed a penalty for every day on which the information was withheld.</seg>
<seg>But just as we respect the media, we had received data - - was reported in which many wire-tappings had been approved in the last ten years, against whom they were directed and how long.</seg>
<seg>With the publication Romania has begun to distance itself from its securitate controlled past.</seg>
<seg>Now that I have sat in the government, it is aware that it is sometimes difficult to share information to the public.</seg>
<seg>But if painful reforms are necessary, there is no alternative.</seg>
<seg>We could not have implemented the economic and political reforms which qualified for EU membership, if we had not exposed the policy on the monitoring of the public and had not accepted the increased public participation in decision-making, which goes hand in hand with this openness is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg>This has also become an essential condition of democratic governments throughout the world.</seg>
<seg>When the United States 1966 decided their law to the obligation to provide information, public services, they were in the exclusive society in Sweden and Finland.</seg>
<seg>Today, around 65 countries have such a law.</seg>
<seg>In Romania, those who have fought for a law to the freedom of information, this fully exhausted.</seg>
<seg>As part of the study of justice initiative is readily information questions were answered the Romanian Government and issued information, whose publication would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</seg>
<seg>The Romanian Ministry of Defence published., for example, the number of Members of the army, who died 2003, as well as their causes of death? (including 13 suicides, two shooting and two deaths in the operation in Afghanistan).</seg>
<seg>Similarly, the Court has been asked of Bucharest for the number of judges, who have received sentences since the beginning of 2000, including the reasons for any imposed sanctions.</seg>
<seg>The Court handed the question to the ultimate judge Council on, that was a complete answer: a quadripartite list of all sanctioned judges, with details of the reasons and penalties.</seg>
<seg>Such information is both a product of the continued reforms and a force for them.</seg>
<seg>It is not always easy for the members of government, and even a tug-of-war about confidential documents is under way.</seg>
<seg>The benefits which transparency brought in the former Eastern bloc, but not to suffer.</seg>
<seg>At the same time of Romania show experience that the discretion of the authorities still poses a threat to the worths of democratic systems of government and that, both in existing and new democracies only permanent vigilance to ensure that this matter inclusively-calibrates again.</seg>
<seg>The protection of the lebensb√§ume</seg>
<seg>Nobody is by the day, without using a product which comes from a forest.</seg>
<seg>a far higher level than most people are aware of the document on which we write water flowing from our cocks which medicines, which are sound, wood, which we build our houses and furniture, from the forest.</seg>
<seg>forests provide us with the fresh air we breathe, and provide habitats of threatened species.</seg>
<seg>They also provide leisure-time facilities, which are becoming increasingly important in our complex world.</seg>
<seg>approximately 1.5 billion of the poorer rural population in the world depend directly on forests in order to satisfy their basic requirements for food and firewood.</seg>
<seg>However, the deforestation is continuing.</seg>
<seg>Every year we lose 14.6 million hectares of forest - - an area which is as great around four times as Switzerland.</seg>
<seg>irresponsible forest management, which will be strengthened by weak national regulations and enforcement and markets, which reward illegal clearing, currently deprived of their most valuable together in the world and the most vulnerable forests.</seg>
<seg>As soon as forests are starting to disappear, usually follow any amount of environmental, social and economic scourges which affect us all in various ways.</seg>
<seg>The Indonesian island Sumatra is a good example of this.</seg>
<seg>paper and cellulose companies currently manage the unrestricted and illegal destruction of the forests, which include the richest plant variety in the world.</seg>
<seg>It is probable that plants have not yet as well as endangered species will disappear like the sumatranashorn, Sumatra elephant or the orang utan.</seg>
<seg>If the forests sumatras disappear, people from whole communities without a proper housing and without a decent livelihoods will appear.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, disadvantages for responsible businesses result from the distortion of the global markets from the trade in illegal and products produced cheaply.</seg>
<seg>through illegal clearing tax revenue is lost every year to developing countries at a value of USD 15 billion.</seg>
<seg>The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the demand for wood for the reconstruction of the tsunami continues to increase the already unsustainable requirements in the last year at sumatras forests.</seg>
<seg>Similar threats to become clear in the Amazonas forests and Congo Basin.</seg>
<seg>The recent Millennium √∂kosystemstudie of the United Nations Millennium Ecosystem? (orientation, ma) shows that forests in these and other critical regions will continue to disappear due to mismanagement rise to drop / go back and, if not serious action is taken.</seg>
<seg>From information of the Brazilian Government, it appears that the deforestation of irreplaceable Amazonas? (forests, among other things, through the transformation in agricultural land) has increased in the last year to 2.6 million hectares, which makes the whole area of Amazonas entwaldete on 17% increase.</seg>
<seg>But the fight against deforestation is not lost.</seg>
<seg>Various organisations, green campaigners and societies, who are concerned about the state of the forests worldwide together at present in order to reverse the deforestation and improve the forest management.</seg>
<seg>For example, the World Wildlife Fund WWF find (?) and the World Bank of Brazil government wants to take an initiative to be implemented through the 17 million hectares of new protected forests into national park.</seg>
<seg>The alliance of WWF and World Bank has its partners to create trust fund in order to manage these sites permanently.</seg>
<seg>Similarly, an exceptional, cross-border cooperation for forestry protection and responsible management resulting from a summit between the leaders of the countries in the Congo region.</seg>
<seg>This has led to an initiative of the State Department of the United States to the promotion of the forest protection in the Congo, with a budget of 53 million dollars.</seg>
<seg>Since the first meeting of the political leaders in the Congo region 3.5 million hectares of new protected areas have been created.</seg>
<seg>In view of the effects of the tsunamis last December in Asia and in view of the seriousness of ma submitted data and the entwaldungsstatistiken from the most important forest areas of our efforts must be continued.</seg>
<seg>The World Bank and the WWF recently stated that they will work together to reduce the overall entwaldungsrate until 2010 by 10% and that they will work with other public and private institutions to implement ambitious targets for forestry protection.</seg>
<seg>WWF studies show that we can cover world requirements of forestry products and, at the same time maintain important environmental and social values in the foreseeable future, if the world's forestry resources are allocated to different uses and species protected areas, amongst other things, for responsibly managed trade farm forests and forest again aufgeforsteten landscapes.</seg>
<seg>wirtschaftsbosse, governments and citizens' organisations must fulfil its role in the implementation of this vision.</seg>
<seg>Are the Saudis fanatics?</seg>
<seg>terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia remind not only to place the opportunities for the continuance of the governing Royal House every aluminium-saud but also raised the question whether it is a fundamentally with the Kingdom dysfunktionalen and destructive state action.</seg>
<seg>It seems as if the Saudi society would have led to a wave of violence, which is fanaticism its inspiration from the extreme religious orthodoxy.</seg>
<seg>The fact that 15 to 19 hi-jackers dates from the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States from Saudi Arabia, strengthened the long view the UK, there would be a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.</seg>
<seg>In many respects, is also true but, on the whole, this position cannot be transferred to the general public in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, would be a serious mistake to believe that the attitude of the Saudis was perfectly defined by fanatischem in relation to the Islamic religion.</seg>
<seg>between 2001 and 2003, I belong to a group which has carried out a major study value in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt and Jordan.</seg>
<seg>The results show an astonishing nuanciertes picture of the value of attitudes in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg>Compared with the asked people in the countries of the Middle East, Saudi Arabs were generally less religious and their attitudes to issues such as democracy and arranged marriages reveal a moderate tone.</seg>
<seg>The religiosit√§t is natural in all four countries heavily embodied. over 90% of those surveyed indicated that they believe in God, in a life after death and in heaven and hell.</seg>
<seg>However, the Saudis appear to be less religious than the Muslims in other countries.</seg>
<seg>82% compared with the Iranian, 85% that Jordan and 98% the Egyptian continuously only 62% of the Saudis as religious.</seg>
<seg>The Americans also seem to be far more religious than the Saudi arabs. in America define themselves 81% than religious.</seg>
<seg>These derogations should be partly due to country-specific differences, as religiosit√§t is defined.</seg>
<seg>For example, religiosit√§t Americans define perhaps unlike people from the Middle East, in addition, the Americans have perhaps a weaker linked to their faith than people in Islamic countries.</seg>
<seg>Also, some differences between the Muslim countries could be declared.</seg>
<seg>However, the difference is so great in the religiosit√§t defined between Saudis and the Iranians Jordanians Egyptians, and on the other hand, that it is the prevailing idea of Saudi Arabia as a very conservative and religious society information.</seg>
<seg>practice is actually a clearer language than words: only 28% of the Saudis indicated weekly in services to participate in itself 27% the Iranian, 44% that Jordan, 42% the Egyptian and 45% of the American admitted.</seg>
<seg>Although these results are contrary to the traditional concept of the Saudi culture, they are less surprising than it seems.</seg>
<seg>Religion sociologists have long argued that the general religiosit√§t reductions, if the environment is heavily dominated by religious or religious institutions are too closely linked to the state.</seg>
<seg>When national authorities are strict rules of engagement, people are tending to rebellion and wedge from formally sanctioned religious institutions.</seg>
<seg>So it is no wonder that Egyptians and Jordan who live in countries without state fr√∂mmigkeit offered more religious than Iranians or Saudi Arabs, who supported virtue in one of the State police 'must' live.</seg>
<seg>Even with the subject of marriage represented Saudis surprisingly many Liberal views.</seg>
<seg>In the case of the question to make an even distribution resulted. marriages almost half of respondents were of the opinion that a marriage, after consultation with parents should be closed, while 48% preferred love as the basis for a marriage.</seg>
<seg>In the light of gender segregation entrenched and the dominance of the Patriarchate this result seems to constitute a great need for more individual option in decisions which are traditionally responsibility for the family.</seg>
<seg>Finally, the Saudis has proved to be a strong advocates of democracy, which is contrary to the general idea of the Saudi conservatism.</seg>
<seg>For 58% of all asked Saudis democracy is not the best system of government, 23% and 18% this opinion was not delivered its opinion.</seg>
<seg>That, in a country in which there is no secular and nationalist tradition of democracy is a majority seems illogically.</seg>
<seg>The guarantee of democracy with a number of other Liberals attitudes is actually in context, which we found in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg>advocates of democracy is tending more tolerance fewer religiosit√§t, more s√§kularit√§t compared with others, to a more critical assessment of the Community and of greater concern about the Western culture invasion.</seg>
<seg>In addition to the opinion polls, in the course of history, it turned out that liberal ideas to gain popularity when a country is governed by a despotic monarch and religious establishment.</seg>
<seg>Thus a strong liberal current developed late 19 in response to the religious despotism of Sultan abdulhamid in the 21st century in Ottoman Syria.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, a antiklerikale secular movement in the name of the constitutionalism, has, in response to the absolutist alliance between the schahs of kadscharen dynasty and religious establishment in Iran.</seg>
<seg>In view of these agreements between historic precedents and the current situation in Saudi Arabia, we should not rule out the possibility of reforms.</seg>
<seg>Today referendum data shows that the Saudis could very well begin to ask for more transparency in the policy and a less interventionist religion.</seg>
<seg>museum Europe</seg>
<seg>In the 21st century Europe Asia late 19 mainly seen either as a source of inspiration for the artists or as a focus of its imperialist ambitions.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, considered the Asians Europe either, as in Japan during the meiji time than model of modernity or in China as a barometer of lapse.</seg>
<seg>a century later have turned the Japanese wirtschaftswunder the image of the Europeans of at least a small part of Asia in a place technological and industrial progress.</seg>
<seg>At present, in the first years of the century, the way changes 21, as in Asia, Europe and Asia is carried out in Europe, drastically. Asia economies thriving, while the European Union is going through a deep sense of identity and zuversichtskrise.</seg>
<seg>The Asians, such as the former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, warn the Europeans in the meantime - - that they should retain their past course - - Europe will be rapidly in all areas irrelevant except tourism and quality of real estate.</seg>
<seg>A well-known Chinese businessman who shares his time between Hong Kong and London, expressed even more clearly.</seg>
<seg>With a private meeting of prominent business leaders in Paris and a few weeks ago, he said: 'Your European develops you to a third world country and it spends your time with the wrong issues - - constitution, welfare state pension crisis - - and it systematically give the wrong replies to the questions you raise.'</seg>
<seg>Europe's views on Asia in general and China in particular are more complex and achieve from a hellsichtigen adaptation to a new and respected competitor to purely ideological rejection.</seg>
<seg>When, in May, in France, in 1968, the students took to the streets in order to invent a new world, they? (or at least some of them) dreamt of a Maoist China - - China, which was in the middle of the brutal and pointless cultural revolution.</seg>
<seg>Their absurd and Baroque wretched prayer localness has just as a product of their ignorance of the crimes Maos as the result of boredom within a prosperous society in which unemployment was virtually unknown.</seg>
<seg>In contrast with this their successors now openly criticise Asian capitalist model.</seg>
<seg>Yesterday was a lodestar for China anti-capitalistic utopian revolutionaries; today it has developed into an ultra-liberal nemesis for a new generation of utopian reactionaries - - the defenders of the status quo in Europe.</seg>
<seg>recently in the streets of Paris demonstrating students want to become in such a way as Chinese and Indian; to reject the logic of globalisation and to refuse to give up their hard-won social security.</seg>
<seg>Europe's economic China and India have quite different.</seg>
<seg>In the meantime, they are fully aware that their easily nostalgic post-colonial view of these countries has overtaken as major export markets and comprehensive reservoirs of cheap labour.</seg>
<seg>China and inden become real competitors who deserve respect, if not almost honour.</seg>
<seg>quality, costs and delivery times in car production about are enough in the meantime closer to the European level.</seg>
<seg>Europe is respected, such an advantage in the field of theoretical sciences in the pharmaceutical industry, but evolving world class companies in India are growing in particular, able to recruit graduates of the m.i.t. or Harvard to defend themselves, and at the same time, the lower labour costs and, therefore, its global competitiveness.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, the political leaders of Europe the challenge posed by Asia recognised, but it failed to use these as a reality irresistible test in the process of globalisation and - - in social and economic terms - - as a weapon reputation.</seg>
<seg>One can say with balanced view that European politicians, with a few exceptions, such as Tony Blair said to have its view of the world too slow to the revolutionary pace of change in Asia to be adapted.</seg>
<seg>Caught between its lack of a long-term strategic vision and the Regulation on short-term interests, mainly political leaders of Europe have to acquire the respect of their Asian colleagues - - contrary to the European companies which are much more outstanding with the Asians.</seg>
<seg>Of course, European Union in Asia - - a continent to point which has so far to bury its past and the ghosts of the door nationalism - - often as a model for reconciliation, peace and prosperity considered.</seg>
<seg>But this exercise will survive if Europe continues to fall economic sanctions?</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the Asians will come to see the European model as a kind of political Venice - - a site visits one of its previous Glorie nostalgic in addition-given and which we admire museum-like because of its constitution.</seg>
<seg>The red parties and the blue,</seg>
<seg>The separation of Colin Powell us Ministers of State by Condoleezza Rice shows that America's last presidential election leads to further strong response.</seg>
<seg>But it is not only important for us to understand what states this election on America, but also for the world.</seg>
<seg>The presidential elections this year shows that America has a healthy democracy, but also that some could be better.</seg>
<seg>Contrary to the election of 2000, with President Bush, the majority of votes missing and the vote in committee the elector just won, he won this time with a projection / lead from 3.5 million votes.</seg>
<seg>Although some democrats are still banning third, there are a few serious doubts about the legitimacy of President Bush's victory.</seg>
<seg>America is divided into red states of? (Republicans) and blue? (States democrats).</seg>
<seg>If 100 000 votes in the red state of Ohio changed, John Kerry would be a President? (albeit with a minority of the votes).</seg>
<seg>The elector Committee was adopted on America's constitution, in order to protect small countries in a federal system, it would mean, however, that the election campaign in particular challenged at around a dozen States concentrated in which public opinion is divided.</seg>
<seg>A more fundamental problem is that it seems to be unschicklich Presidents without the majority of votes.</seg>
<seg>It is therefore time for a serious debate on a constitutional amendment for the abolition of the elector Committee.</seg>
<seg>Some observers also complain about the polarizing, negative rhetoric and advertising which characterised the election campaign.</seg>
<seg>But this should be viewed from a historical point of view.</seg>
<seg>At the time of the founding fathers newspapers were extremely biased, George Washington and was dismayed by the rigour of the political agenda.</seg>
<seg>In its early history, the country has for a long time been divided into exactly the same narrow majorities - - like today without it only at the time of the civil war and reconstruction, to be the violent rhetoric of the election campaign has shown how close the contest.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, the three national broadcast discussions important points which have been raised in a serious format, despite the negative election advertising on both sides and cumulative were pursued.</seg>
<seg>In general it is likely that the President-in-Office is re-elected with growing economy.</seg>
<seg>In this sense, surprised at President Bush's re-election as small a majority.</seg>
<seg>This is mainly due to the unpopularit√§t of the war in Iraq.</seg>
<seg>It Kerry try war, the von Arbeitspl√§tzen last job creation, the inadequate health care and Bush reduction in taxes for group with high income to the central point to the election campaign, but have the feeling that some observers from never result in a clear message.</seg>
<seg>Bush countered with security concerns about terrorism and kulturpopulismus with issues such as abortion homosexuals marriage and right.</seg>
<seg>At the end kulturpopulismus outdid security and the wirtschaftspopulismus.</seg>
<seg>The interpretation of the election was affected by inquiries carried out? (after the vote) in which voters were asked them what was most important issues.</seg>
<seg>Most? (22%) answered with "moral values" compared to 20%, which called for the economy and 19%, which have expressed their terrorism.</seg>
<seg>Conservative social politicians interpreted these results in such a way that they have won the election of President Bush and that their programme should dominate the next term of office.</seg>
<seg>But an Pew inquiry carried out a week after the elections showed that category covered "moral values' abortion and homosexuals marriage law apart from a wide range of issues.</seg>
<seg>questions in fact show that 25% of the population support homosexuals marriage and 35% in favour of legal before-similar communities for homosexual couples? (Kerry position).</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, it applies to 37% who are against homosexuals marriage, particularly in the red centre of the country, that the issue has contributed to the mobilisation of the Bush supporters for the elections.</seg>
<seg>A more important question is whether the United States are hopelessly divided.</seg>
<seg>The geographical wahlkarte with red and blue States led to Internet jokes and comic strip on the two blue coastlines which divide themselves off the red centre of the country.</seg>
<seg>Some people call this' coastopia ".</seg>
<seg>The separation is not so clear, however.</seg>
<seg>Many states in both camps with only limited as paints won a card at the level of the constituencies, and not the States, a large part of the country are quite blue.</seg>
<seg>"urban and rural areas' against suburbs describes the situation better than" Coast against centre ".</seg>
<seg>Public opinion polls show that most of the Americans actually moderate in the centre of the political spectrum collecting themselves, and not at the foreign two sieve.</seg>
<seg>But political elite tends such as party activists and members of Congress to be more extreme than the public.</seg>
<seg>This is the first confusing, since it must be an incentive for migrant to be correct-rich centre.</seg>
<seg>But many members of Congress represent constituencies, which are safe for the parties and their re-election is threatened by internal-party elections, which aktivistischeren and more extreme party groups are monitored.</seg>
<seg>This trend is reinforced by the spread of the cable television, which attracts spectators aid more controversial 'Infotainment' programmes and via the Internet blogger participating in bitter polemiken without any technical filter.</seg>
<seg>reforms to change the borders of the Congress districts in order to strengthen competition in them, would contribute little action Congress to improve the problem to be for changes to vote which may increase the risk of their family.</seg>
<seg>The result is a scarce middle that Bush was elected for change, less than he seems to think.</seg>
<seg>In view of the difficult issues in the foreign to reassure fiscal and social policy, it would be wise to look at the very centre of his conservative basis remains unclear whether a policy of beliefs or pragmatism will prevail.</seg>
<seg>exemption from dependency on oil</seg>
<seg>kanzlerin Angela Merkel high priority to bring up for discussion the climate change on Germany's agenda for the European Union and g-8-pr√§sidentschaften which begin in January.</seg>
<seg>a concrete proposal is so general that the political leadership in the world leaders to consider and be able to accept and so clear that other governments and business: it can be included in the next G8 summit simply setting a date from which gasoline-claimant cars are no longer permitted in large industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg>Such a decision would have a clearly positive economic and geopolitical effect.</seg>
<seg>The real reason for today's energy concerns are not the shrinking world oil reserves, but rather that internal oil production from the point - consumers - Europe, the United States and China - - at the moment will closely reduction / go back in which the growing Asian demand pressurizes the market.</seg>
<seg>This reserves will be increasingly concentrated in the Middle East, simply because the events will quickly be exhausted in all other areas.</seg>
<seg>I would add that large oil exporters are not prepared to subordinate their investment policy to the requirements of the market.</seg>
<seg>Saudi Arabia is trying to implement its oil production potential investors with independent while Iran deterrents against red tape and corruption.</seg>
<seg>Iraq is suffering from a lack of security and foreign investor in Russia a line through the bill is constantly being made.</seg>
<seg>These four States have half the oil reserves confirmed and two thirds of the world that could potentially be exported.</seg>
<seg>All this not production costs, is the basis of the high oil prices and the fight for oil contracts in Central Asia and Africa.</seg>
<seg>In the adoption, high oil prices are because they serve the environment, some basic facts of international politics are overlooked good.</seg>
<seg>First of all, oil imports in many of the poorest African and Asian countries represent a much higher proportion of public expenditure than in industrialised countries, which means that economic growth and social development are at risk, when new crises are to blame.</seg>
<seg>income from oil production hamper reforms in the major exporting countries.</seg>
<seg>Thanks to their oiled financial strength feel like the regime in Iran in Venezuela and less and less binding international rules.</seg>
<seg>laggardly using nations, such as China, are well known to turn on violations of human rights on a lucrative business with authoritarian regimes and to secure for oil-rich imitate so old habits of the industrial West.</seg>
<seg>Only the political and economic heavyweights in the world, the large industrial nations which continue to be by far the largest consumer of hydrocarbons, can put a change at global level.</seg>
<seg>The change must begin in the transport sector, which is responsible for more than half of the current oil consumption - - a percentage, which is likely to increase in the future.</seg>
<seg>The g-8-l√§nder should inform therefore to allow cars by 2025 gasoline-claimant at nothing new.</seg>
<seg>This decision would not be directed against the individual mobility to produce but against the waste of a limited raw material, which is more needed in order synthetic substances.</seg>
<seg>The political leadership heads should not prefer a certain technology.</seg>
<seg>Instead, they should create incentives for the car industry for developing alternative technologies for goods which are based on fuel from biomass, ethyls during a transitional period, hydrogen and even natural gas.</seg>
<seg>countries which play a political role, will produce a leading position in the energy technology for the internal industry as an added value and will secure future markets.</seg>
<seg>The likely substantial reduction in CO2 emissions to finally bring the breakthrough which is needed in the international climate policy.</seg>
<seg>But also the economic development comes into play: the preservation of our 'dependence on oil' will poorer less developed and developing countries more of them to leave, as well as the prices down to press and geopolitical energy competition alleviate it.</seg>
<seg>geopolitically the benefits would be similar natural, since the capacity has been considerably reduced large oil exporters to blackmail the industrialised countries.</seg>
<seg>This would improve the negotiating position of the international community in the Middle East and possibly strengthen the social forces in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia aimed at serious political and economic reforms from within.</seg>
<seg>When technologically and one of the great car manufacturers Germany has placed and highly developed country in order to reach such an initiative.</seg>
<seg>Merkel, those in physics achieve a doctorate and its political career as a Minister for the environment - - it has the Presidency began in 1995 at the first meeting of the UN framework convention on climate change - - perhaps has credibility when speeches this subject than anyone to the European Union and g-8-kollegen.</seg>
<seg>The time for courageous action from the leading position has come.</seg>
<seg>The myth of trade and aid</seg>
<seg>Buzzwords has become global trade and aid.</seg>
<seg>More aid? (including the cancellation of debt) and greater access to the markets of rich countries for products from poor countries seem right at the top of the international agenda.</seg>
<seg>In fact the present debate does not address what is to be done, but just as much and how quickly it will be done.</seg>
<seg>The clear lessons have lost out of the past five decades of economic development.</seg>
<seg>The most important of these is that economic development is largely in the hands of the poor nations.</seg>
<seg>Countries which set up good performance in the recent past, created this by their own efforts.</seg>
<seg>aid and market access played a decisive role rarely.</seg>
<seg>We take a developing country which has free and preferential access to its greatest neighbours, which incidentally is the greatest economic power in the world.</seg>
<seg>We assume that the fact that this country millions of citizens can send extent foreign investments workers across the border, generally speaking receives and is completely integrated into international production chains.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the banking system of the country is supported by the best prepared to contribute its rich neighbours in the worst case as financiers.</seg>
<seg>much better globalisation can hardly be or?</seg>
<seg>We are now a second country.</seg>
<seg>This country is faced with a trade embargo on the largest market in the world, is neither foreign aid funds or any other support from the West, is excluded and is prevented from international organisations such as the World Trade Organisation to take up with the IMF and the World Bank credit.</seg>
<seg>As if these foreign disadvantages would not be enough to weaken this economy even their own high barriers to international trade sanctions? (in the form of national trade, import tariffs and quantitative restrictions).</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the readers guessed, it is material countries subject: Mexico and Vietnam.</seg>
<seg>Mexico over 3 000 km shares a border with the United States, which does not provide for preferential access to markets for goods and people, but also for a right to resources of the American Treasury? (peso crisis which became clear during the 1995).</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, America respected until 1994 maintain a trade embargo against Vietnam produced until 1995 diplomatic contacts and stood still Vietnamese imports years after a most-favoured-nation treatment too.</seg>
<seg>Vietnam is still excluded from the World Trade Organisation.</seg>
<seg>We believe that their economic reforms.</seg>
<seg>Since the North American Free Trade Agreement? (NAFTA) was signed in December 1992, Mexico has grown on average economic by less than 1% per capita and per year.</seg>
<seg>This value is not only the economic superstar far lower growth rates of Asia, this is only a fraction of Mexico own growth achievement in the decades ahead of the debt crisis in 1982? (3.6% per year and 1981 between 1960).</seg>
<seg>of Vietnam economy is between the beginning of its economic 1988 and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States about every year 1995 5.6% per capita grown. since then, continues to grow in the rapid pace of 4.5%.</seg>
<seg>Vietnam has undergone a dramatic reduction in poverty in Mexico, while the real wages have fallen.</seg>
<seg>There has been an increase in both countries through the international trade and foreign investment, but arise where it matters most, completely different images subject: in the case of the rising living standards, especially for the poor.</seg>
<seg>These examples show that our own efforts of a country to its economic fate is much more important than anything else.</seg>
<seg>All the opportunities offered by the US market Mexico, could not compensate for the effects of the political mistakes in their own country, particularly failure to reverse the real value of the peso exchange rate and productivity gains achieved the inability, those in a small area of export activities as the rest of the economy to be extended.</seg>
<seg>At most it depends on the fact that a country choose the right strategy for growth.</seg>
<seg>Vietnam without a strategy, which focused on it, its economic broadly to subjects and the production capacity of local operators to increase, followed the advantages of Mexico.</seg>
<seg>The further experience of the post-war period supports the conclusion that the internal policy is most important.</seg>
<seg>South Korea has managed the breakthrough in the early 1960s, not as the foreign aid at the highest level, but when it has gradually been regulated.</seg>
<seg>Taiwan has received no foreign aid or preferential access.</seg>
<seg>China and India, economic superstar flourish today, mainly due to their reform efforts.</seg>
<seg>It is tempting to attribute a few African successes - - Botswana and Mauritius - - to foreign demand for its exports? (diamonds and / or clothing) but there is already history to end.</seg>
<seg>Obviously, both countries without access to foreign markets would be much poorer.</seg>
<seg>But, as in other cases of successful development it is not their external benefits which take away from others, but it is their ability to use these advantages.</seg>
<seg>It considers that only the shattered remnants of European which other countries from their wealth of natural resources.</seg>
<seg>In Sierra Leone the word 'diamond "hardly causes images of peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg>also have only a few of the free industrial zones which are proliferating in the world which has produced results which have been observed in Mauritius.</seg>
<seg>None of this releasing the rich countries from their responsibility to help.</seg>
<seg>The world for being able to make unfriendlier corrupt dictators, for example by them more financial information exchange and international treaties which sign these dictators, not to recognise that.</seg>
<seg>also an increase in the number of workers from poor countries, which must work in rich countries and greater scope for growth policy would be based on a long-term basis by a relaxation of the WTO rules and the dependence on the United States better development.</seg>
<seg>It is anything but clear that an extension of market access and the increase in subsidies represent the most productive use of valuable political capital out of the North.</seg>
<seg>development should not focus on trade and aid, but on an improvement of the political environment in poor countries.</seg>
<seg>Anyone who now depends on whom?</seg>
<seg>If the great Argentine economist Raul prebisch were still alive, it would certainly ask itself whether the world is in turmoil.</seg>
<seg>His very influential 'dependency' theory that those poor countries which are too dependent on raw material exports can never achieve non-industrial implementation, which is essential for sustainable economic growth.</seg>
<seg>Instead, they are caught in a cycle of world prices falling constantly decreasing income widths.</seg>
<seg>prebischs priority political reaction, protectionism, has shown for the many Latin American and African countries which followed his views as catastrophic.</seg>
<seg>But the fact is that prebisch seemed to be over many years in the longer-term trends with commodities prices correctly.</seg>
<seg>ruthless increases in efficiency, agriculture and the exploitation of natural resources, going down the prices of raw materials, particularly during the 1980er and 1990er years.</seg>
<seg>Apart from a few exceptions, developed the economies of those countries which have focused on raw material exports, appalling, while many Asian countries's lack of raw materials pushed forward.</seg>
<seg>Today, however, what has happened in Asia giants - - India and China - - the world economy, oil, gold, the price of wheat and virtually all go off other raw materials.</seg>
<seg>There will always be cycles - - which are oil prices to fall, for example, probably before they start to rise again - - but the long-term trend for many raw materials will continue to show clearly up for a long time.</seg>
<seg>Many of the participants in the trade negotiations and other political decision-makers still apparently did not understand - - although prebisch would immediately have noticed - - is that this dramatic turn of events brings enormous impact on global balance of power.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps no other aspect of globalisation will actually bring the leaders of our world in the coming decades before major challenges.</seg>
<seg>The questions that arise, are manifold.</seg>
<seg>Are the rich countries of our days ready for an era of the kodependenz into which it does not despair raw materials are less than the developing countries of the industrial imports and technology?</seg>
<seg>They are prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence for the raw materials producers, now that there are clearly more prosperous?</seg>
<seg>How will the two superpowers worldwide, China and the United States, with the fact that important raw deal material-exporting regions of Africa - - on the Middle East of Central Asia - - are spread with poorly organised national States?</seg>
<seg>Some appointed prophets represent the problem as limited natural resources, for which the world at an alarming rate was critical raw materials.</seg>
<seg>There are now many supporters of the hubbert 'theory of the oil production, which means that we have the upper limit of the promotion capacity that the sources drain and that, from now on, all will become even worse.</seg>
<seg>However, as the leading oil states yergin historian Dan, the prophets of decline has at least four times that the world oil should go.</seg>
<seg>Every time radical technological progress has led to the fact that this threat gone up in smoke.</seg>
<seg>At the end of the nineteenth century in the oil industry still maultiere were used for digging.</seg>
<seg>Today, nobody think a little about 3 000 metres from the bottom of the sea for oil.</seg>
<seg>There have been similar progress in the field of metal mining industry and agriculture everywhere.</seg>
<seg>No, the world will not face the fact that you are the raw materials.</seg>
<seg>What is more, it is that the integration of two and a half billion people in China and India alone? () into the world economy, a demand change causes which should exercise a distinctly stronger upwards pressure on prices than him all technological progress will probably be able to regulate.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the raw material prices will rise - - at least for the next 50 to 75 years, and perhaps for people starting up in the coming years in the mining industry on Mars.</seg>
<seg>Will the formation of a new balance of economic power which is due from it destabilise world policy?</seg>
<seg>The first world war was clearly partly caused by fear of Germany that other colonial powers would have a very large proportion of the world's oil fields and raw materials is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg>In a similar way Japan was afraid for the stability of its supplies of oil and other natural resources from abroad in the second world war.</seg>
<seg>Do similar tensions between resources-poor China where water shortage? (even become a problem it is) and the West to occur?</seg>
<seg>Fortunately, this is perhaps not at present, particularly in view of the sober and pragmatic approach of the Chinese leadership to solve the problems of its resources.</seg>
<seg>The Chinese are directed towards regions such as Africa and hope to find a balanced trading partners.</seg>
<seg>They do not share that political transmission awareness of the Americans, who do not just carry on with your trade, but they also the true faith bekehren want.</seg>
<seg>Then there are the American leaders who are still to be independent in the United States the power supply.</seg>
<seg>This is, however, all in all, a joke immoderately: they may be, they never become independent.</seg>
<seg>In a majority of the Arab world sees the invasion of Iraq as a cornerstone of the real us strategy to ensure the stability of their energy supply.</seg>
<seg>If this is true, we can only hope that America is a plan B.</seg>
<seg>In the meantime, the prices of raw materials will continue to rise, while the oil exporters in the meantime gaping America's balance of trade deficit bear the greatest amount.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the real strategy of the United States is trying to make so high debts of the raw material-exporting countries that they feel compelled to observe America with whim?</seg>
<seg>This, however, is a phrase which would never have imagined prebisch.</seg>
<seg>hard line in the elections in Iran</seg>
<seg>of mayor of Tehran Mahmud ahmadinedschad admitted the election as hard-liners, the next President of Iran relations with the West will deteriorate and international isolation of the country will increase.</seg>
<seg>As regards the internal affairs, this is surely better for the Islamic regime than a more moderate result.</seg>
<seg>ahmadinedschad clearly has a broad basis of followers.</seg>
<seg>But the fact that it had a populist election campaign, it said, to help the poor performance of condemning the government and set themselves near as a candidate for the opposition, is irrelevant subject: it was the choice of the regime, and in the end it received official aid even against other rivaling representatives of the hard line among the candidates.</seg>
<seg>The regime off its matter outstanding.</seg>
<seg>She has a more pragmatic haschemi rafsandschani which did not agree with some of the current political measures than a definition of the 'founding' has made its own man and the rebel.</seg>
<seg>The government has used the anti-establishment feeling in order to recover its own rule again.</seg>
<seg>The fact that the last President Khatami was Mohammed, a supporter of the reform process - - although more shy, that in the long term - - achieved nothing, underlines how carefully the masters of the political situation umgekrempelt.</seg>
<seg>ahmadinedschad is a representative of the younger activists of the revolution against the Shah a quarter of a century ago.</seg>
<seg>He was directly involved in the kidnapping American hostages in Iran, although the precise extent of its involvement is questionable.</seg>
<seg>At most, the fact that it is the two groups close, concerns the main representatives of the most extreme elements in Iran is subject: to the core of the guardians of the Islamic revolution and the basidsch organisation.</seg>
<seg>The first is a parallel, regime-faithful army, the second an organisation for the intimidation of opponents and others, which are aimed at an open society.</seg>
<seg>However, the concern is reduced over the fact that an even more radical government came to power in Iran by two factors.</seg>
<seg>First of all, ahmadinedschad will concentrate on internal affairs and will try to improve the standard of living of the poorest Iranians - - where success is unclear.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, the same group, since the revolution in power will essentially continue the ideology and foreign policy.</seg>
<seg>The President had less energy than it seems, and is particularly overshadowed by the Supreme Leader ajatollah Ali chamenei.</seg>
<seg>However, the choice ahmadinedschads makes it quite clear that a challenge Iran for western policy and stability in the Middle East is.</seg>
<seg>Firstly, it signals, above all to the most extreme elements in Iran and the customer's country? (terrorist Lebanese Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad, as well as other smaller groups, those on Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Arab countries) that they have followed the green light for attacks.</seg>
<seg>You probably assume that Iran supports them, whatever they do.</seg>
<seg>Seen from the outside, Iran is often relatively cautious in secret, but he is the world leader in terror sponsor.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes individual Iranian officials formulated in isolation certain operations and coordinated, now they will perhaps still feel free to do so.</seg>
<seg>In addition, ahmadinedschad is openly Iranian crash programme for the production of nuclear weapons.</seg>
<seg>Most of the Iranian politicians - - at least those who by the Government allowed to work openly - - support the programme, however, prefer a more relaxed and more cautious approach.</seg>
<seg>rafsandschani made, for example, the structure of improved economic relations with the West on an initiative at the nuclear front.</seg>
<seg>With ahmadinedschad as President nuclear Iran is more likely that the weapons being used in Ruritanian way.</seg>
<seg>That does not mean that it would fire, but rather that it will increase it for the purpose of intergovernmental blackmail perhaps to use and thus threats to the crisis.</seg>
<seg>Since the Iranian authorities daily declare its desire to rejoice prematurely Israel against the card and the United States ahmadinedschad fight? (trampled on its way to vote on a picture of the American flag), have increased the risk of a confrontation.</seg>
<seg>Finally, ahmadinedschad is probably undermined stability in Iraq in dreistere way and his victory will encourage Iranian officials and radical extremists in Iraq.</seg>
<seg>Iran sends already agents in Iraq and supports customers who want the country has changed in a clone.</seg>
<seg>The Iraqis, including the Shia Muslims who Islam attach the same direction as the Iranians, generally reject such an intervention.</seg>
<seg>A more militant Iranian attitude may strengthen the reibereien on Iraq and there will be other anti-American acts of violence.</seg>
<seg>In short, the result of the elections in Iran is dangerous, although its exact destabilizing effect will depend on how ahmadinedschad is, and how much power is given to it by chamenei.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, dealing with an Iran, which is based on the criteria of the intransigent regime radical so openly extremely and even represents a challenge not only for the United States, but also for Europe.</seg>
<seg>Will the European countries are trying to pretend that ahmadinedschads bellicose rhetoric and provocations would be all the same, and as if a diplomatic solution could be found to the nuclear ambitions Iran?</seg>
<seg>With rafsandschani it would have been easy to conclude a real agreement or to maintain the appearance of cooperation.</seg>
<seg>But ahmadinedschad with a high degree of appeasement will be necessary in order to continue with even the slightest diplomatic processes.</seg>
<seg>Some Iranian reformists and exiles, you have the choice ahmadinedschads with the argument that it is the Ukrainian Government shows the true face of regimes and all western hopes for a compromise destroyed.</seg>
<seg>It also, however, the success of the regime can be reflected to neutralise the dissatisfaction over a quarter of a century of radical Islamic rule.</seg>
<seg>Regardless of the outcome ahmadinedschads victory means that everything that has to do with Iran is probably even more difficult.</seg>
<seg>take from the poor to give to the rich.</seg>
<seg>President Bush seems to be about to wreck America's budget for many years to come.</seg>
<seg>with President Bush's appointment we have seen so far only had the eye budget surplus.</seg>
<seg>Today, enormous deficits in the budgetary landscape due to a mixture of irresponsible tax reductions, from the disease of the economy, introduced by the Republicans, the blow-out of the stock market bubble and an enormous increase in defence spending threaten.</seg>
<seg>It is even worse as Bush administration and Congress under the auspices of the republicans are building the budget misery even further.</seg>
<seg>The damage that they will cause, is likely to weaken and the loss of the world economy will help the United States.</seg>
<seg>Traditionally the Republican Party for America was balanced national budgets.</seg>
<seg>That has changed in the government reagan. under it recommends Conservative Republicans tax reductions at the expense of great budgetary deficits.</seg>
<seg>President Reagan promised the American people both tax reductions and military high arms and the continuation of the expenditure policy recommended by them and all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg>The outcome, not surprisingly - was a huge number of budget deficits which pointed out to remove years.</seg>
<seg>both Presidents, both senj. George Bush and Bill Clinton had to impose new taxes, with the legacy of the auszumisten Reagan era.</seg>
<seg>The tax increases were probably accessories to President Bush's senj. defeat at the polls with President Clinton in 1992.</seg>
<seg>Clinton chose to are going well on the way to a balanced budget, it did this partly in order to secure the financing of the programmes for the social pensions on a long-term basis.</seg>
<seg>In the year 2000, when President Clinton separated from office, the budgetary situation was the best for decades.</seg>
<seg>Then the President George Bush jr. appeared to be revived on Reagan with comprehensive tax reductions, huge increases in military expenditure and the continuation and extension of the popular expenditure policy.</seg>
<seg>The result was predictable.</seg>
<seg>In January 2001, the cumulative budget for the years 2002-2011 result was estimated at a total surplus still 5,6 trillion dollars.</seg>
<seg>These planned surplus has evaporated mid-2002.</seg>
<seg>In view of the changing economic situation and the shadow that a possible war in Iraq ahead-throws, one would have expected that the Bush administration and the Congress under the auspices of the republicans dealt with recommendations for further tax reductions more carefully.</seg>
<seg>But no, you have the highest priority to further tax reductions, which are primarily the rich to property.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, the government wants clear increases in the military expenditure.</seg>
<seg>Now is the attention once again to the presidential elections in November 2004, certainly not sensible reductions in the non-military spending programme will be made.</seg>
<seg>It seems that it will remain with the substantial budgetary deficits.</seg>
<seg>Even if the expenditure on internal policy to continue to maintain the same proportion of national income, the cumulative budget outcome should meet in the next ten years to a deficit of 1.5 trillion dollars.</seg>
<seg>However, this figure would be too optimistic, because it takes account of the cost of a possible war with Iraq is not sufficient, not even a further round to lower taxes and not the risk of higher interest rates in the years ahead.</seg>
<seg>Why do the republicans are so little about the confusion which they make?</seg>
<seg>Some republicans are more important to tax cuts for the rich than almost everything else.</seg>
<seg>Others believe that high deficits to greater reductions in expenditure on domestic government would force and so the influence state would restrict what they really want in the home.</seg>
<seg>The problem of the latter view is that most taxpayers programmes for Internal Affairs will not be so easy to give them support and, consequently, greater restrictions on expenditure.</seg>
<seg>A much more interesting question is: why the Americans to vote in favour of such political programmes where they should know what difficulties, it will probably lead.</seg>
<seg>An answer mentioned many voters will simply not see the threat of budgetary problems.</seg>
<seg>A better answer shows that most of the Americans were not actually voted for such programmes.</seg>
<seg>The turnout at the elections of 2002 was with only 40% of the votes cast, have disappeared about half of the Republicans, i.e. approximately only 20% of the electorate.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the prospects do not have to be so hopeless.</seg>
<seg>The war in Iraq can be prevented.</seg>
<seg>The proposed tax reductions can be watered down or abandoned.</seg>
<seg>But I say this enormous budget deficits in the coming years ahead in the USA and abroad and growing unease about the overall economic situation in America.</seg>
<seg>capital from abroad should decide to want to finance the budget and balance of payments deficts America still not so favourable conditions.</seg>
<seg>The dollar will probably become weaker and fears of inflation could step out more clearly.</seg>
<seg>All of this will allow us to react less self-assuredly politicians and flexibly to economic shocks.</seg>
<seg>The poor both within the United States, as well as abroad it will suffer most from when President Bush and the Congress will inform the American people and the world that because of the major budgetary deficits is no more money in order to be able to deal with the problems of poverty and those in the health and education.</seg>
<seg>If the Americans simple wake up and do not do now is to think seriously about the budget risks can make themselves rich again with a gift of many billions of dollars, whereas the country and the world will have to take in the coming years of hard at the consequences.</seg>
<seg>lessons from the financial policy lack in the United States</seg>
<seg>George W. Bush has more than any other President in American history to make the economic policy of the United States on the basis of his or her mentor Reagan exceeded.</seg>
<seg>In a three-year term of office it destroyed a fragile political consensus which to produce a decade and which had lasted again to create another decade may last.</seg>
<seg>Bush, America's health at risk long-term economic and social stability.</seg>
<seg>Since the long-term challenges for the budget, which are making the United States so disastrous, are not unusual, financial policy schnitzern important lessons for other countries can be drawn from America.</seg>
<seg>The problem of the financial policy is that politicians can cause a temporary increase in their popularity by making huge national debt, which largely to retain the future on tax reductions and an increase in public spending, without any problems.</seg>
<seg>This trick can operate a few years; sooner rather than later, however, to force rising budget deficits and government debt is a painful political U-turn.</seg>
<seg>However, a cynical politicians can buy so his re-election and possibly with the crisis broke in retirement.</seg>
<seg>We should think that the voters for global hundreds of such episodes of financial policy irresponsibility in recent decades allergic reaction to this type of fraudsters would react.</seg>
<seg>Bush but it goes through once again today: he buys popularity by increasing enormous tax gifts distributed and at the same time, the military spending and even the expenditure on education and health.</seg>
<seg>The result is a budgetary deficit at a value of more than 5% of the gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg>It is even worse that the long-term prospects for the American budget was already a cause for concern, before Bush began its ill-advised policy.</seg>
<seg>The average age of population of us; this is a through an increase in the costs of health care and pensions results for the future.</seg>
<seg>Careful calculations show that the future income achieved on the basis of tax policy favoured by President Bush is expected to fall below the cost of pensions, health care and other public expenditure is expected by the public by some 10 trillion dollars.</seg>
<seg>At some point in the future a strong increase in taxes, deep cuts in public expenditure or both together will therefore be necessary in order to correct President Bush's actions.</seg>
<seg>So why does the public support its policy?</seg>
<seg>The reason is that the public is hardly understanding or interest in these long-term consequences, albeit in the long term, including the Americans will suffer as a result.</seg>
<seg>The richest taxpayers are of course pleased, because they benefit most of these tax reductions.</seg>
<seg>It is incredible, but almost half the tax reductions will benefit the richest 5% of the American taxpayers, and these rich taxpayers obviously expect that the remaining 95% - the middle class and arms - who is to bear the greatest part of the future spending reductions and tax increases.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile, Bush convinced many voters of the middle class, and that they can also be satisfied - without them to say that they reduce for their small tax reductions with much greater in the future public services will have to pay if the policy of his government will prevail in the long term.</seg>
<seg>If the Americans would have a political memory, then it would be responsible to them that her this tax, roller coaster travel "in the last 20 years, have already experienced.</seg>
<seg>When Reagan was elected, he promised also massive tax reductions and a substantial increase in the military expenditure.</seg>
<seg>The result was an enormous budget deficit in the middle of the 1980er years.</seg>
<seg>The tax reductions made Reagan extremely popular and contributed to his re-election in 1984.</seg>
<seg>Finally, it has taken to turn over a decade, of reagans's second term of office on the presidencies of quoted George Bush senior and Bill Clinton Sen, concerns the budgetary deficit back into a budget surplus.</seg>
<seg>Of course this made the granting of new tax increases needed which George Bush Sen. the re-election of cost and one of extremes of the 1990er years have political landscape.</seg>
<seg>History is repeating itself almost with security.</seg>
<seg>Some ideologists right-wing within the Bush administration believe that the budgetary deficits of our days will force in the long run deep cuts in public social expenditure.</seg>
<seg>They hope for a dismantling of programmes such as social security and medicare.</seg>
<seg>In the American public, however, these social programmes have broad support.</seg>
<seg>The strategy to reduce political rights first taxes in order to force then cuts in social programmes will therefore fail, and which will finally to increase taxes once again.</seg>
<seg>others in the Bush administration argue that tax reductions are important to get the United States from recession.</seg>
<seg>This argument is wrong.</seg>
<seg>of America economy would be restored without these tax reductions, perhaps even in a sustainable way.</seg>
<seg>Apart from this, it is a great mistake to develop a long-term tax policy on the short-term economic cycle.</seg>
<seg>for other countries from these two basic lesson result.</seg>
<seg>The first is that the impending budgetary deficits in the United States of America will be limited to international influence sooner or later.</seg>
<seg>The Americans have supported the Iraq war is only because they did not have to pay him with tax increases.</seg>
<seg>As soon as the Americans have to decide whether they want to finance their foreign adventures of higher taxes, they in very small measure will be prepared to support expensive military operations abroad.</seg>
<seg>It will actually come in the wake of the public debate on the financial policy chaos left by President Bush to an in-depth internal division of the United States.</seg>
<seg>The second lesson is that countries should take account of the increased costs, which causes an ageing population in its draft budget.</seg>
<seg>The long-term budgetary situation is often not aware of the taxpayers or Parliament.</seg>
<seg>Governments should be required to submit proposals, together with their annual budgets long-term assessments of the budgetary situation in order to counteract the tendency to short-term and politically motivated manipulation of the budget.</seg>
<seg>The United States can serve countries other than early warning.</seg>
<seg>The White House to others, the same warning, which give a magician on television, you are subject: attempts to its viewers this not at home '.</seg>
<seg>The political stock market</seg>
<seg>Many economic and financial analysts complain that the stock markets have been manipulated by developing countries often affected by their governments and more politically as cyclical.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, implicit adoption seems to exist in stock markets in industrial nations that an initial strength of economic nature are driven and forecast the value of that development is comparable with a growth forecast for trees.</seg>
<seg>This description of the stock markets in developing countries is not wrong only partial, because the same description applies to stock exchanges in industrialised countries.</seg>
<seg>The best analysts know that a forecast of development of the stock market value of every country in essence means to predict how well it is to be adopted on the stock exchange investors the will of the government in the current political landscape.</seg>
<seg>We take stock market in the United States, the world's largest with distance.</seg>
<seg>After the general view of the government companies remain unaffected and end the returns on investment at the US stock exchange the fundamental elements of a strong capitalist economic system.</seg>
<seg>This is one of the reasons why a magnetic appeal on portfolio investment from all world exercises the United States.</seg>
<seg>But the profits which allow the American stock markets be so attractive, are an expression of a sensitive political balance.</seg>
<seg>In particular, tax rates affecting shares, varied in changing political pressure in the course of time.</seg>
<seg>During the second world war, in other words around the political support for major assets left and the Government taxes to kapitalgewinne dividends, increased drastically and high incomes in general.</seg>
<seg>When the second world war has been thorough recovery of the world economic crisis in the thirties-years, Roosevelt and the Congress of the raised a tax on excessive profits, in order to ensure that shareholders would not benefit too much.</seg>
<seg>In 1980, when there was no war, the stock exchange was elected in a low voters Reagan us, a man who many too much the right wing which are required in order to President.</seg>
<seg>It has been requested - and lower taxes on kapitalgewinne dividends, and income.</seg>
<seg>political interference in the stock market is not confined to kapitalgewinne dividends, and tax revenue.</seg>
<seg>wealth tax, use of you, import duties and VAT - which are paid either directly or indirectly by all companies - to be able in an enlarged measure company profits and the stock market to influence.</seg>
<seg>Wherever stock markets do not flourish is it a coincidence that governments do not give them under any circumstances increase taxes so far to leave to make company profits for withdrawal of taxes destroyed.</seg>
<seg>The policy of the securities markets does not end with the taxes.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, almost every government activity and in turn affects company profits on the stock market.</seg>
<seg>After the collapse of the stock market in the year of the US Government 1929 exposed many activities of the kartellbeh√∂rden and made it possible for companies to gain monopoly power, which would increase its value.</seg>
<seg>This policy delayed the recovery of high unemployment, but was not even enough to keep the political forces who are being exploited for the benefit of the support of the stock market.</seg>
<seg>It was also one of the most important things, President Reagan was destroyed much of the rest of the power of the American trade unions, which has fought for their slice of the cake company.</seg>
<seg>reagans's smash the air traffic controllers' strike of 1981 was a turning point for the American trade union movement - and on the stock market, the spectacular stock market boom, began in 1982.</seg>
<seg>Since the speculative bubble in the share prices reached their climax in the year 2000, the US government support, in particular, the stock market particularly strongly through repeated reduction of interest rates.</seg>
<seg>This was, of course, justified public measures for the recovery of the economy, not to support the securities market.</seg>
<seg>However, it is an interesting reference to the importance of the US stock exchange that share quotation fall was regarded as one of the most important factors which weighed on the economy.</seg>
<seg>The reaction of the authorities have not been limited to monetary stimulationsmassnahmen.</seg>
<seg>The accounts of the United States shows that the effective control item on company profits? (the percentage profit, which is paid in the form of taxes to the government) its peak during 33,7% in the first quarter of the year 2000, which has the highest level of the stock market and the economic situation in general, on the fourth quarter falls 20,2% in 2003, when the market has a low.</seg>
<seg>This reduction is to a large extent clear measures advocated by the Congress for tax treatment once again, as well as the concept of companies that they cannot evade tax in the present economic and political environment more aggressive.</seg>
<seg>I would add that the maximum tax on dividends from shares has been lowered after boron-loweringrapidly 35% to 15% long-term investors, who has produced an important new advantage and compound interest effect which strengthens the dividends reinvestment after taxes.</seg>
<seg>This reduction in tax was justified as an incentive for economic situation, which of course we can maintain from practically every measure seeks to support the securities market.</seg>
<seg>However, it is the balance of political forces which decides on the credibility of such a justification.</seg>
<seg>One could say that the same variables, including the negative attitude towards high taxes and the weak trade union movement in the United States since the past 200 years is at work, and we can therefore assume that they will be so in the future, and high stock exchange profits to produce and huge capital flows to attract foreign investment.</seg>
<seg>Those who believe that investment is maintained for many decades in the US securities market the same strong growth trend is quite right.</seg>
<seg>However, we should realise that we prognosticates.</seg>
<seg>In the explanatory statement is not the only thing perspective economic developments, but policy - and even cultural values - economic policy and performance coin / shape.</seg>
<seg>The global home of one's own</seg>
<seg>From all investment centres of one's own are most closely linked to a certain place disintegration local economic conditions and hence to flourish or subject.</seg>
<seg>On our your television we have very quickly global developments, but our home of one's own market which is almost exclusively in the hands of local amateurs, is enshrined in our own backyard.</seg>
<seg>This could change quickly.</seg>
<seg>In a month the product Chicago stock exchange will bring commercial exchange CME (?) in cooperation with my company macromarkets as well as fiserv and standard & poor's futures and options treaties on the home of one's own prices in ten American cities on the market.</seg>
<seg>The case P & S / shiller immobilienpreisindizes forms the basis of these treaties - - the development of this scientific work, which my colleague Karl case, and I have done before almost twenty years.</seg>
<seg>We committed ourselves immobilienfutures for many years, but until now no stock exchange wanted to create a futuresmarkt on the basis of these indicators.</seg>
<seg>The futuresm√§rkte will make it possible for investors to invest in the world by buying shares indirectly into American centres of one's own.</seg>
<seg>An investor in Paris or Tokyo Rio de Janeiro can, in New York, Los Angeles and read vegas in centres of one's own to invest, which are inhabited by their owners.</seg>
<seg>As a result of a fundamental principle of the financial theory - - the 'diversification' 'or' spread risks - - we can assume that the interest in the new Treaties will be very high.</seg>
<seg>For example, people and companies are in New York exposed to excessively high local property risks. you should therefore this risk by the sale of futures at home of one's own price reduction in New York.</seg>
<seg>at acceptable prices people will play a part of the risk of Tokyo by the purchase of these New York futures at home of one's own prices.</seg>
<seg>The New Yorkers still live in their homes of one's own, but it is strewed their investment risk worldwide.</seg>
<seg>There was not a real market for futures on one's own homes since 1991, any more than the London to date and option stock exchange? (firmiert now under the name of the euronext.liffe) failed to develop such a market in Britain.</seg>
<seg>At that time, we could not achieve sufficient trade.</seg>
<seg>The stock exchange schmiss party, but no one left.</seg>
<seg>The British are betting markets and some online trade markets could not achieve a lasting success.</seg>
<seg>This time it will be different?</seg>
<seg>The launch of a new market is, of course, an uncertain venture. people always can only be pleased at parties, even if many other people are there.</seg>
<seg>Even if there is no one, no one is also gladly. is it in markets with a few investors.</seg>
<seg>There are too few transactions to attract in order to achieve those products which are necessary to investors. enough along with mad parties is the success of new markets, sometimes a mystery, but we know very well that it works out at times.</seg>
<seg>There are signs of a growing interest in the trade in one's own futures at home prices, especially since the debates emphasise the importance of the risk diversification of a 'bubble' property.</seg>
<seg>After the CME announced its plans, it was reported home to bring their competitors Chicago stock options that we also plans to futures and options contracts for the most important regions in the USA on the market, and it is the basis for median prices for centres of one's own, published by the American association of real estate agents.</seg>
<seg>But apart from the huge public interest in property investment and the security of the property risks another crucial point is to be clear for the success of futuresm√§rkten subject: prices must be open and investors have the importance of these prices to be aware.</seg>
<seg>I believe that it will count on many of these futuresm√§rkte soon on a considerable price drop in some American cities, defence within the next year.</seg>
<seg>Will the prices of dealers in such a way backwardation named '' rule: that is, the price of futures at the market today is lower than the current price of the home of one's own.</seg>
<seg>This backwardation will not happen on the first day of the trade in futures, but well within a few months.</seg>
<seg>This backwardation may be necessary on some markets, if these its operation to be fair to be transferred.</seg>
<seg>We all know that there has been a huge property boom? (in many of these towns and elsewhere) in the last few years.</seg>
<seg>international investors will probably not want to invest in these cities, if there are no expectations on the futuresm√§rkten on a price reductions as the inhabitants of Tokyo from bitter experience know.</seg>
<seg>However, if this backwardation is high enough, could also investors who believed that the property market is declining, of which eigenheimfutures expect a good return, because they have already acquire these at the futuresmarkt at a lower price.</seg>
<seg>However, the New Yorkers, who want to secure their property investment, to a certain extent if attitudes are to be changed to have when it comes to sell futureskontrakte in which prices are already taken into account.</seg>
<seg>They will just have to get used to the idea that the market and prices expected that they can insure only on the part of possible future preisminderungen which go beyond these expectations.</seg>
<seg>Such a change will reign if we actually know the future market prices.</seg>
<seg>Up to now, the future development of the property prices was merely a question of different views.</seg>
<seg>If the markets can produce an international consensus on the future home of one's own prices in the cities of this world, we will be able to deal with the risks in these cities better and, with it, the respective √∂konomien - - and our own life - - will stabilise.</seg>
<seg>What message are the markets?</seg>
<seg>The stock markets in the majority of the world had to adopt clear kursverluste since around 10 may. that most of it occurred in the two weeks to approximately 23 May; but the trains are on average, since then continue to decline.</seg>
<seg>Do these problems at the international exchanges relate to problems for the world economy?</seg>
<seg>Let us look at the most kursverluste.</seg>
<seg>With the most important national indicators, the largest crash took place in India, where the share quotations from 10 to 23 may have about 16,9%.</seg>
<seg>The debacle on the other side of the world has been almost as great, and the most and only two days tiefstst√§nde departed from those in India subject: in Argentina trains given by 16,1% in Brazil, for 14,7% in Mexico and for 13,8%.</seg>
<seg>The European markets have suffered heavy losses.</seg>
<seg>In Sweden, the courses between 9 and 22 may have fallen by 15,2%; in almost the same period in Germany they have to 9,7% in France by 9,4% and in Britain and Italy to 9,3%.</seg>
<seg>In Asia trains in almost exactly the same period of relative maximum conditions fell on relative lows - - in Korea by 11,5% in Hong Kong is 9,3% and Japan by 8%.</seg>
<seg>Many commentators who are trying to tighten these procedures at the developments in the United States.</seg>
<seg>But in the United States, the share between 9 and 24 May that has just 5,2%.</seg>
<seg>Neither seems to make China fall behind in the world, because the train has even there during this period.</seg>
<seg>The standard declaration of the economists places the monetary policy in the centre.</seg>
<seg>In the course of the great fear of deflation in the year 2003, the central banks have reduced global interest and released in it speculation-conditioned upswings both on the market share and to the House.</seg>
<seg>Now, however, increasing interest is so unpleasant, which proposes that this aspect will be pursued in the future.</seg>
<seg>This is certainly an important pellet truth.</seg>
<seg>The US Federal Reserve lifted interest on 10 May, and its chairman, Mr bernanke proposed the possibility of further increases in interest rates.</seg>
<seg>On 17 May announced deteriorating inflation data, which points to the fact that a further tightening-up of the monetary policy is imminent.</seg>
<seg>The economists to look at the world as logical and controllable - - and trust that they will understand what into it take place.</seg>
<seg>But in doing so they assess the role of the Central Bank frequently about.</seg>
<seg>In fact the increase in interest rates in the United States has just one in a whole series of increases in interest - - the 16 as a result.</seg>
<seg>No other important central bank has increased the next kursverlusten / 7, 8 on the stock markets by. June the interest when several did? (the European Central Bank and the central banks of India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).</seg>
<seg>Another factor is the oil price, which has increased between 22 March and the second is about 24% and set up several of the absolute maximum conditions.</seg>
<seg>This is certainly an important event, and it is clear that it could have repercussions on the stock markets throughout the world.</seg>
<seg>oil price increases contributed to virtually all economic recessions since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg>However, the oil price increases, do not fall within the timeframe in the middle of May, when the figures given most clearly.</seg>
<seg>who argues that caused the kursverluste rising oil prices on the stock market means that the stock markets reacted with delays in a few weeks.</seg>
<seg>Now stock markets do not necessarily act very logical and so delayed reaction to the oil price shocks could be present.</seg>
<seg>As with all the other prices on the financial markets is also increasing attention here.</seg>
<seg>When oil prices shoot up people pay attention to news associated with the oil prices and talk more about the oil prices - - which is a growing awareness of such messages.</seg>
<seg>The crisis in the Middle East who controlled the message in May, has to do with the oil prices.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the investors noticed ominous references and the threat of vocabulary of different political actors because of the oil price increases strengthened.</seg>
<seg>So the Israeli vice-premier Shimon Peres in response to hostile statements by the Iranian President Mr Mahmoud ahmadinedschad declared on 8 May subject: "The President of Iran should also bear in mind that Iran may be swept away by the MAGP. '</seg>
<seg>Similarly, the newspapers reported on 13 May, for example, at the beginning of the sharp fall in prices on the stock exchanges that ahmadinedschad during his visit to Indonesia - - the most densely populated by the majority Muslim country in the world - - considered by the topuniversit√§ten students of two of the country with ovationen rules.</seg>
<seg>This message must have been interpreted as proof that ahmadinedschads confrontation course in the nuclear question for this pays off politically - - which may have given impetus to the idea that the tense situation in the Middle East too even higher oil prices could lead.</seg>
<seg>These reports must be much further away from the appearance of the stock market as the monetary policy.</seg>
<seg>But the public reaction to it - - together with the recent rise in oil prices - - must be responsible for a good part of the amendment of the market psychology.</seg>
<seg>The willingness to take risks changes during the time and events such as ahmadinedschads and Peres' statements can cause such changes.</seg>
<seg>Such things happened in difficult quantifiable: it is the analysts with their attempts to predict the development at the worldwide stock markets which ahmadinedschads statements may also give a great deal of attention bernankes like that.</seg>
<seg>your attention to the position of the public and their interaction with price changes should not ask the economists concentrate embassies and speculation-dynamic worldwide.</seg>
<seg>Finally, they would admit that economic events are less and less predictable? (the economists themselves all-knowing) than they would like them to be.</seg>
<seg>But such a focus intuitively results in a sense.</seg>
<seg>What really is the investors?</seg>
<seg>ahmadinedschad is a charismatische bernanke shape; it is not.</seg>
<seg>ahmadinedschad pursuing an Ruritanian course; bernanke does not do so.</seg>
<seg>and, perhaps, most important subject: ahmadinedschad is not a destabilising influence, bernanke.</seg>
<seg>The world's case of the share prices in the middle of May actually refers, whatever its letztliche reason may be, an unstable market psychology.</seg>
<seg>It is difficult to believe that it is only to be set at the views of the suspected monetary policy and not at a more comprehensive and more far-reaching problems that are fundamental for the global economic development - - including the power supply and political tension.</seg>
<seg>Why we should pay more for fairness</seg>
<seg>Marks & Spencer, a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 branches in Great Britain, recently stated that she wanted to change the whole range of coffee and tea in 38 lines of fair trade, a marketingsymbol 'ethical' for production.</seg>
<seg>The chain is already reiterated in its 200 caf√© kaffeestuben exclusively tea and coffee with fairtraide respectability.</seg>
<seg>It will also increase their buying quantity shirts and other goods from fair trade cotton.</seg>
<seg>The publication took place during the 'fair trade' a fortnight, 14 campaign for fair trade products in which, amongst other things, told the British farmers in developing countries to lectures in different places, as fair trade helped their communities.</seg>
<seg>The movement towards a more ethical consumption gained in importance in the United States, where consumers increasingly organically grown, locally produced food as well as eggs from free-range hens to turn.</seg>
<seg>In the United Kingdom a survey showed that half of the respondents recognised and knew the fair trade symbol that it refers to products which offer our farmers in the third world better economic conditions.</seg>
<seg>There is no comparable us study, but similar data and discussions with my own students to point out that the number should be considerably reduced.</seg>
<seg>traders who ask the fair trade mark to pay a price which covers the cost of sustainable production and ensures a minimum wage for producers.</seg>
<seg>For example, the minimum price for coffee amounts to 1.26 dollars per pound, no matter how deeply the market price falls.</seg>
<seg>If the market price increases on this value, fair market price increases, so that the pound of five per cent is higher.</seg>
<seg>Small farmers need to organise themselves for their part in cooperatives or other groups which make a democratic participation possible.</seg>
<seg>plantations and factories can use the fair trade mark if they pay decent wages to their workers, health, safety and environmental standards to meet, trade unions and other forms of labour organisations to allow, good shelter do if workers do not live at home, and neither child labour or forced to take up.</seg>
<seg>Not all compatible with fair trade is.</seg>
<seg>brink Lindsey, Director of the according to the free market orientated Cato Institute's centre for trade policy studies, believe that the campaign for fair trade coffee is a 'and' means impasse.</seg>
<seg>It is with some justification that the real reason for the fall in coffee prices is not the thirst for profit of multinational companies, but the enormous increase in coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam, in combination with new technologies which make it possible to cultivate coffee with fewer workers and therefore more cheaply.</seg>
<seg>From lindeys point of view, we should encourage the coffee farmers, if we want to help them, either, to give the cultivation of coffee and more profitable plants grow - - and quite rightly points out that barriers to trade and subsidies from the rich countries are obstacles which must be abolished - - or quality products, for example, to be specific coffee which achieve higher prices.</seg>
<seg>At lindeys argument but it is odd that the campaign for fair trade coffee can be regarded as exactly what it recommends subject: the coffee farmers are being encouraged to cultivate a special coffee which provides a higher price.</seg>
<seg>The representatives of the free market do not object to companies which, quite frankly snob use appeal in order to promote their products.</seg>
<seg>If people want to pay USD 48 Jamaican blue mountain coffee for a pound is because the James Bond favourite coffee, the economists have nothing against the fact that the market is distorted.</seg>
<seg>Why are they so critical if consumers choose to spend USD 12 on a pound coffee from which I know that he has grown to donating trees, without toxic chemicals under the shadow of birds can survive - - from farmers who can afford it now, to feed and to send their children to school?</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the economists should answer the fact that, if we want to help people to feed and educate their children, USD 10 for a fairly traded coffee could not to pay what tastes exactly the same thing, and it is a relief organisation in such a way saved $2 which provides poor children with food and education.</seg>
<seg>That is a possible strategy, but fair trade has certain advantages.</seg>
<seg>The farmers know that they must provide a product that like the consumers, both in geschmacklicher terms and in the cultivation.</seg>
<seg>If their product and sells itself, they can be proud to have produced something which is desirable in the world.</seg>
<seg>From the point of view of the producers, it is better to have a premium by the sale of fair trade products than to receive a mild gift which independent you received from if they had worked or not, and in spite of the quality of the product.</seg>
<seg>a higher price to pay for a fair trade label is not 'illegal' market-more than to pay a higher price for Gucci label and it reflects better ethical priorities.</seg>
<seg>Fair trade is not a national subsidy.</seg>
<seg>Its success depends on the call for the market, not political lobbying.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately, this request to the European market is growing rapidly.</seg>
<seg>It is to be hoped that it will be similarly high in all industrialized countries and wherever people to freely choose their expenditure in the near future.</seg>
<seg>pigs, calves and American democracy</seg>
<seg>With regard to all the headlines about the victory of the democrats in the American Congress in November elections an important result of these elections almost collapsed.</seg>
<seg>And although this partial result has demonstrated the lack of the political system in the USA, it corrected my belief in the sympathy of American ordinary citizens.</seg>
<seg>In the Federal State of Arizona can present due to a sufficient number of signatures in support of a legislative proposal on the direct vote to citizens.</seg>
<seg>With the heurigen elections were to involve pregnant sows or rearing calves or keep the ban on pollution which prevent the animal to move freely to lie down or its Member masses stretch.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps those who are not familiar with the methods of modern agriculture industry wonder why this legislation could be necessary at all.</seg>
<seg>Under the same conditions as it 50 years ago in animal husbandry, everywhere and in some countries like them today to conduct, have all animals have had enough in order to move and stretch.</seg>
<seg>Today, however, spend roughly 90% of all American sows - - mothers of those piglets reared and slaughtered for the production of pigmeat bacon cubes ham, and - most of their life locked up in Box conditions which are no more than 60 times 220 cm.</seg>
<seg>In so doing, they are neither can nor lay down stretch their masses Member or go to more than one step forwards and backwards.</seg>
<seg>Other sows so short chains it is closely that they also cannot turn.</seg>
<seg>Also in veal calves production are all their lives in small blows closed, where they do not turn to lay down, individually or stretch.</seg>
<seg>The aim of these animal husbandry methods is operational savings - - they facilitate the animal management and make the attitude of thousands or tens of thousands of animals under a roof. are necessary less and less qualified staff.</seg>
<seg>In addition, these methods prevent animals waste energy by too much movement or fighting amongst themselves.</seg>
<seg>After protests of animal protection organizations, the European Union has adopted some years ago at the Scientific Veterinary Committee report on this type of livestock farming in order.</seg>
<seg>In the committee's report, we came to the conclusion that the animals are not to be able and have nothing whatsoever to do them to move freely.</seg>
<seg>To this end, we could have come, of course, also in normal use of common sense.</seg>
<seg>After the publication of this report, the European Union set deadlines by which time closure up the animals have to be banned.</seg>
<seg>for breeding calves the ban has already embarked on 1 January 2007 that.</seg>
<seg>individual box conditions for sows, which are already banned in the United Kingdom and Sweden will be illegal in the whole of the European Union from 2013.</seg>
<seg>gradually to be implemented measures are not even their wings to improve the living conditions of laying hens, which are usually followed closely gathered in line cages in which to spread.</seg>
<seg>In the United States country many measures of this kind are nowhere in view.</seg>
<seg>If my European friends in the past asked me why the USA and Europe in relation to animal welfare are so far behind, I knew no answer to this.</seg>
<seg>If the issues have become more urgent, I had to admit that an explanation is probably the fact that animals are to the Americans less important than the Europeans.</seg>
<seg>In the year 2002, however, tabled Florida animal rights activist a legislative proposal on the banning of box for sows conditions to the vote.</seg>
<seg>The surprise of many of the proposal has been adopted, 55% of the electorate.</seg>
<seg>Last month in Arizona despite expensive gegeninitiativen of the agricultural industry, the ban was then approved, also by small box conditions for sows and calves to 62% of the votes.</seg>
<seg>Neither Florida or Arizona are particularly progressive States - - in both defeated George W. Bush 2004 John Kerry its competitors.</seg>
<seg>The results are so close to the conclusion that the majority of the Americans, they should have the opportunity to vote on it - would ban the attitude of pregnant sows and calves in close blows.</seg>
<seg>The Americans seems animal welfare in exactly the same way, a request to be as Europeans.</seg>
<seg>In order to explain the gap between Europe and the United States in matters of farm animal protection, we should take the political system in its entirety.</seg>
<seg>In Europe we have managed to communicate the concerns of the voters in the field of animal protection to Members of Parliament in the respective countries and to the members of the European Parliament, has led to a corresponding national legislation for the protection of animals and to European directives, which take account of these amendments.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, applications in the field of animal protection did not have measurable impact on the Congress in the United States.</seg>
<seg>Neither complex country or at the level of the Member States there is legislation on the protection of animals.</seg>
<seg>The reason for this is to be sought, in my opinion, that representatives of the agricultural industry will be able to make millions of dollars instead move into the pockets of that Congress who would like to be re-elected to.</seg>
<seg>In the field of lobbying campaign donations and could not keep up the animal protection movement in spite of broad public support for these targets.</seg>
<seg>In the American electoral system money is more important than the opinion of the electorate.</seg>
<seg>The group discipline is low and Congress to find the money for their re-election - - and these elections in the case of this House of Representatives every two years.</seg>
<seg>In Europe, where the group discipline is great and not the candidate countries, but the parties finance election campaigns, money plays a minor role.</seg>
<seg>In the USA, where people are so proud of its democratic traditions, pigs and calves are hardly the only losers.</seg>
<seg>What is new about the new Afghan all-party army?</seg>
<seg>? (possibly started by the Afghan Interim Government) the murder of the Afghan aviation Minister by a mobilisation shows that the Afghan society is deeply divided.</seg>
<seg>The first reform in the Afghan army will only aggravate these gaps.</seg>
<seg>The Minister of Defence, in karsais Hamid transitional government in Kabul has already appointed the top officials of this new army.</seg>
<seg>The Minister, General Mohammed fahim, a tadschike from the northern region pandschir, took over the command of three months ago on the troops of the Northern Alliance, which took Kabul after American bombers had paved the way for it to them.</seg>
<seg>A total of his appointments are a direct threat to karsais intentions to unify the country.</seg>
<seg>Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic state in which the paschtunen with two fifth forms the majority population.</seg>
<seg>In any case, a fifth of the population are hazara and tadschiken.</seg>
<seg>Of the 38 officials are now raised by the fahim in general are thirty-seven tadschiken and a usbeke.</seg>
<seg>Each member of the 15 to 17 million count, ethnic group of the paschtunen drawn to the military service will therefore serve as a command structure, which is almost exclusively of tadschiken.</seg>
<seg>The language of the paschtunen differs from that of the tadschiken, however, just as much as English of Spanish and millions of paschtunen in able-bodied age is at best fragmented knowledge of the Tajikistani language.</seg>
<seg>The geographical origin of the new military leadership is equally restricted, as their ethnic profile.</seg>
<seg>Five of 38 officials come from the region of the North of Kabul, to which the province? (parwan where Bagram airport is) and the neighbouring pandschir valley, which are former centre of the Northern Alliance.</seg>
<seg>That means, in other words that 27 leaders from that twenty-nine Afghan provinces as a whole has closed the door for the new military leadership of the country.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps such a narrow group could weaken the impression that it is with a clique, or if it would be at least one representative cross-cutting more than a dozen Afghan parties.</seg>
<seg>But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg>Of the 38 18 top officials come from the jamiat e islami, an Islamic party, which was used for a long time by the former theological professor, Mullah burhanuddin Rabbani.</seg>
<seg>It is precisely this Party governed in the middle of the 1990s, of the last century, for a short time in Kabul and caused that chaos and bloodshed which caused most Afghans to welcome the arrival of the Taliban.</seg>
<seg>almost as many Members of the army leaders come from the Communist camp.</seg>
<seg>16 of the 38 officials were long linked to this party, which in the late 1970s tricks of the last century to the Soviet invasion between 1979 and 1989, which has cost two and a half million Afghan life.</seg>
<seg>Today, the Communists are around in Afghanistan, as well as, like Hitler's National Socialists in the Czech Republic and Poland.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the people of Afghanistan did not join the Communist Party for very different reasons, and by no means all were convinced ideologists as elsewhere.</seg>
<seg>But six of fahims generals were professional staff of the Communist Party and has even after the invasion of the Red Army in the services of the Communists.</seg>
<seg>These six men and still have three further communists who served in the Afghan army, kollaborierten than officers in the ten years of occupation of Afghanistan with the Soviets.</seg>
<seg>Just imagine how the French have reacted if a quarter of the French police officer had kollaboriert after the Second World War, during the occupation of France in the armed forces.</seg>
<seg>In Afghanistan news spread propaganda by mouth rather quickly.</seg>
<seg>soon, to the Afghan nationalists? (almost all Afghans to belong) will know the political background to fahims generals, if they have not already done so.</seg>
<seg>Even the crushing evidence for the one-sidedness and selective organisation of the army command could still be indifferent to some extent if the generals have at least professionalism and commitment to patriotic values in their work.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, however, only ten of the 38 fahim have done officers of a military nature.</seg>
<seg>It was previously a pilot.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, twenty-four? (the background of four generals is unknown) in the civil field come - either from the academic field, from Communist Party tubes or, as in the case of a former mullahs, from religious area.</seg>
<seg>What are the effects of these statistical data on the reality?</seg>
<seg>First of all, that the commanders of the international peacekeeping forces will meet in Afghanistan, as well as American military and diplomats in the event of a meeting with the Afghan Vice-Secretary of defence, on dostum Abdul Rashid appropriations for his brutality and corruptness notorious warlords and Communist, who are still with old friends in the Red Army in Moscow.</seg>
<seg>It also means that the commander of head of the Afghan army, just as the chief of staff and the head of the information are also Communists, whose loyalties are unsafe and which most Afghans mistrust.</seg>
<seg>Do you know this country torn by war with such a team again?</seg>
<seg>Is the presence of such a dubious crew appropriate in Kabul for it, the confidence of three quarters of the Afghan population, which has been neglected in the appointment of the army command to win?</seg>
<seg>Isn't or this list of appointed, rather than the expression of a style of management according to the motto 'everything for the winners' is the danger of such an approach?? (at some point in the future), rekindle a bloody backlash of those their interests in such a cynical way was turned into?</seg>
<seg>Before they agree to this unscrupulous control after power by a small and unpopular minority, the United Nations, European and American decision-makers should consider answers to these questions.</seg>
<seg>The irrationality in honour of</seg>
<seg>Three high on the new Nobel Prize for economic subject: Daniel kahneman of the University of princeton and Vernon Smith of George mason university in Virginia.</seg>
<seg>Like many nobelpreise these honors honour not only the fertilizing work of kahneman and Schmid, but also the thinking schools, whose leadership they contribute.</seg>
<seg>kahneman is psychologist. he showed the way in which individuals are systematically rational, far less than orthodox economists subordinate to them.</seg>
<seg>its research shows not only that individuals are sometimes very different from the prevailing economic theories predict, but also that they do this in such a way regularly, according to plan and in such a way that we can understand and interpret because other hypotheses. these hypotheses to compete with those who use the orthodox economists.</seg>
<seg>For most of the market participants, and especially for simple observers - - this is no great news appears to be.</seg>
<seg>The trade in the Wall Street who act in shares, of which we know that they are waste, exploiting the irrationality, which kahneman Schmid and pointed out.</seg>
<seg>A majority of the manie which led to the financial bubble in the economy was based to exploit the psychology of investors.</seg>
<seg>In actual fact, this irrationality is no news on employment economists.</seg>
<seg>John Maynard Keynes did not explain long ago the stock exchange as an area in which individuals rational action has fought for this, the bases of the marketplace to identify, but rather as a kind of beauty contest with which it is best to advice, according to which the selection panel will decide.</seg>
<seg>The Nobel Prize one of the criticisms made of the simplified market economy lessons celebrating this year, particularly as the price over the last year, of which I was three winners? (a) did.</seg>
<seg>The winners of last year, stressed that different operators have different (?) and incomplete information and that the inequality of their status of information has far-reaching implications for the functioning of the economy.</seg>
<seg>In particular, the winners of the last year showed that markets in general efficiently and playing an important role for the government does not remain working.</seg>
<seg>Adam smiths invisible hand - - the notion that free markets have resulted from the invisible hand to the economy - - is not to be recognised, because there are not, at least in part, there.</seg>
<seg>That is not for anything new working day after day on the market and therefore make? (their assets that they draw benefits from the inequality of review of the market or that they overcome these).</seg>
<seg>for over 20 years' models of rational expectations are 'market' economists in their spell. the models go out of the fact that all market participants have the same? (information if not a perfect) and entirely rational to act that the markets operate completely efficiently, and that there can be no unemployment? (if not greedy trade unions or governments, such as the establishment of minimum wages to cause); a kreditverknappung never happens in them.</seg>
<seg>The fact that such models particularly prevail at the universities of American despite all evidences rebutting also shows under that ideology on science triumphed.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, students of such structural study programmes now work in many countries because, as politicians and try to ideas which go so far as to call it a market fundamentalism to implement programmes.</seg>
<seg>In order to make it quite clear: the models of rational expectations have considerable economic theory; the result, in which its supporters applied to economic thinking, helped to identify the weaknesses of many fundamental hypotheses.</seg>
<seg>good science to recognise its own borders, but the prophets of models of rational expectations do not show humility as such.</seg>
<seg>Vernon Smith has been a leader in the development of the experimental economics. it is based on the idea that we have seen many economically statements in certain agreements in the laboratory.</seg>
<seg>One reason for this is that the economy is such a difficult subject and that there is so little agreement among economists, hence that economists control cannot carry out experiments.</seg>
<seg>experiments. nature is, of course, in most cases, changes in it so many things so quickly that it is often difficult to untangle the cause of which was.</seg>
<seg>In principle we can carry out controls in a laboratory tests and draw conclusions from it more credible.</seg>
<seg>The critics of the experimental economy have to bear in mind that the subjects mentioned ways of thinking in the experimental situation, those from outside the attempt situation is certainly. you think that experiments are not as clearly not so neatly and the conclusions in the natural sciences.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, economic experiments provide valuable insights into a number of important items, such as the improved management of auctions.</seg>
<seg>The most important result has been that the irrationality of market participants, which was at the heart of the work kahnemans was confirmed again in the context of laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg>On the rather strange results those which refer to altruismus and voluntary addiction, belong to the experimental economy.</seg>
<seg>In any case, experimental situations (?) that the subjects are not so selfish as the hypotheses of economists show require - from a group is excluded - those of the economists themselves.</seg>
<seg>As it is now, because the economic attracts individuals who are by their very nature more selfish as discipline, or because the economic and it contributes to form and it makes more selfish individuals?</seg>
<seg>The answer is: with great safety a bit of both.</seg>
<seg>Probably future experimental research will help each other to resolve the question of the weight of the two hypotheses compared.</seg>
<seg>The Nobel Prize stresses how important it is that all people and economies in the same way as it is, to study and not as we would have liked.</seg>
<seg>Only if we understand the real behaviour of people better we can hope to draw up a policy which effectuation that our economies work better.</seg>
<seg>President Bush's bad faith in the energy policy</seg>
<seg>In one of the surrealeren meetings of the World Economic Forum in Davos experts explained this year from the oil industry that melting the polar caps - - what happens faster than it had predicted somebody - - is not only a problem, but also a chance subject: large quantities of oil are now perhaps available.</seg>
<seg>The experts, who also acknowledge that the United States? (the International Convention on the law of the sea, which of course, who has access to offshore oil and other rights of raw materials in the sea regulates) to be signed, do not pose a risk with international konfliktpotenzial.</seg>
<seg>But once again, they refer to the advantages: the oil industry does not have to ask the Congress in its search for further oil reserves, never finish, for the right, Alaska too loot.</seg>
<seg>President George W. Bush has an eerie gift to ignore the great message.</seg>
<seg>For years, it is becoming increasingly clear that some of its energy policy is not right.</seg>
<seg>In a previous energy law which was dictated by the oil industry, even members of his own party said that 'any lobbyist had forgotten it'.</seg>
<seg>While it promotes the advantages of the free market, Bush is only too happy to give the energy industry enormous benefits if excessive deficits are coming to the United States.</seg>
<seg>There is market failure in energy issues, but an intervention by the government should go in precisely the opposite direction than the Bush government has proposed.</seg>
<seg>The fact that the Americans do not pay the full cost of the pollution resulting from its wasteful use of energy - - especially from its contribution to greenhouse gases - - meant that energy from price is offered which has again excessive consumption.</seg>
<seg>The government must promote environmental protection measures are in the system of prices - - by energy taxes - - an effective way.</seg>
<seg>But instead of environmental protection to promote, Bush pursued a policy which leaches out America first and makes it still dependent on external oil in the future.</seg>
<seg>There is no question that the great demand is oil prices up and for many in the Middle East is a secondary gains which do not include America's friends.</seg>
<seg>Now, over four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, Bush seems at last to have aroused in the reality of increased dependence on oil prices America; the shooting up, it was difficult for it not to take the consequences.</seg>
<seg>But once again the fluctuating steps of his government will make things worse in the coming years.</seg>
<seg>Bush is still refusing to do something for environmental protection and it has provided that his constant prayer technology will save us with very little money.</seg>
<seg>What are we to think of President Bush's recently declared commitment to make America in 25 years 75%, regardless of the oil from the Middle East?</seg>
<seg>for investors the message is clear: no longer invest in the Middle East, the source of oil and by far the lowest cost of the world in the development of reserves in.</seg>
<seg>But without new investment in the development of reserves in the Middle East the unbridled growth of energy consumption in the United States, China and elsewhere, means that the demand will exceed the offer.</seg>
<seg>That would not be enough, risks Bush with its threat to impose sanctions against Iran, that it is in the supply of one of the largest oil promoters of the world to breaks.</seg>
<seg>Especially since the world oil production achieved almost its full potential and the prices are already more than twice as high as in the war in Iraq, this is the only clear winner of Bush even higher profits for the oil industry - - Middle East policy.</seg>
<seg>However, we must take into account that at least Bush he recognised that there is a problem.</seg>
<seg>But, as always, a more accurate picture of his proposals points to a further conjuring trick of his government.</seg>
<seg>to promote not enough that it refuses to recognise the importance of the global warming, environmental protection, or to make sufficient funds to research in order to real change - - President Bush's superb also promise to reduce dependency on oil from the Middle East has less importance than it appears.</seg>
<seg>Since only 20% of the US oil from the Middle East, it could achieve its objective by a slight shift in their buying policy.</seg>
<seg>However, one would think that the Bush government must certainly say that oil on a global market is action.</seg>
<seg>Even if America were independent to 100% of the Middle East oil, a reduction in the supply of oil from the Middle East could have devastating effects on the world market price - - and on the American economy.</seg>
<seg>As so often at the Bush Government does not exist as an explanation of the official policy.</seg>
<seg>Bush does make political tricks, by giving support to anti-Arab and anti-iranian feelings in America.</seg>
<seg>Or is this just another example of incompetence and chaos?</seg>
<seg>After what we have seen in the last five years, the answer is probably that more than just bad intentions and sheer impotence are at stake.</seg>
<seg>The Chinese roadmap</seg>
<seg>China is before the adoption of the eleventh f√ºnfjahresplans. the way for the continuation of the most remarkable economic changes in history is opened.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, the welfare almost a quarter of the world's population promoted the world has never been so sustainable growth and poverty reduction in such a scale never before.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes the long-term success of China is due to its almost unique combination of pragmatism and vision.</seg>
<seg>While the majority of developing countries at the Washington consensus towards unrealistic increases GNP urged China, it was made clear once again that a sustainable and more fairly distributed, raising the standard of living is aimed at.</seg>
<seg>In China that we have reached a stage of economic growth, in which it is enormous - - and intolerable - - burdens on the environment is.</seg>
<seg>Without policy changes the standard of living in the long run at risk.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, a priority of the new f√ºnfjahresplans on environmental interests.</seg>
<seg>Even many of the more disadvantaged areas of China grow at a rate which would be a miracle, if not different regions would grow more quickly.</seg>
<seg>While the poverty could be reduced, but the inequality of the growing gap between town and country, as well as between coastal regions and the Interior has increased.</seg>
<seg>The development report this year by the World Bank explains why not only poverty but also the inequality should be a request and at the eleventh f√ºnfjahresplan of China has decided to take this problem.</seg>
<seg>The government has talked about several years of a more harmonious society and the plan sets ambitious programmes, in order to achieve this objective.</seg>
<seg>In addition, it recognizes in China that the difference between developing countries and more developed countries is not only in the Gulf of resources, but in a gap of knowledge.</seg>
<seg>We therefore drawn up ambitious plans in China to close this gap, not only in order to create but also at a basis for independent innovation.</seg>
<seg>China's role in the world and the world economy has changed and on this fact in this f√ºnfjahresplan account has been taken.</seg>
<seg>future growth will be based not so much on exports, but on the internal demand, which results from the need to set in motion of consumption in motion.</seg>
<seg>In fact China with a rare problem: has to contend with a surplus of savings.</seg>
<seg>People in China, partly due to save the weaknesses in the state social security system and a strengthening of the social security systems (?), as well as the health and education system to the reduction of social inequalities will contribute at the same time, the sense of well-being of the citizens will improve and present consumption will set in motion.</seg>
<seg>We almost always - China - and even exceeded its own high expectations up to now - - could these adjustments to enormous burden for a world economic system lead, which is already unbalanced by the huge American and budget deficits in the balance of payments.</seg>
<seg>If China is saved less - and if we, as announced by public side, a more varied strategy has been pursuing for the investment of its reserves - - who will finance the American deficit on the balance of payments of over 2 billion dollars a day?</seg>
<seg>This issue is not present at the moment, but it could soon be so far.</seg>
<seg>Despite the clear vision of the future, the challenge lies in the implementation of the strategy.</seg>
<seg>China is not an enormous country and it would have come this far, if there were no widespread decentralisation.</seg>
<seg>However, its own problems arise from the decentralisation.</seg>
<seg>greenhouse gases, for example, is a global problem.</seg>
<seg>While America means that it cannot afford to do something against the Chinese leaders act more responsibly.</seg>
<seg>In a month after the adoption of the action plan have been introduced new environmental taxes on cars, petrol and wood products subject: China used a market-based mechanisms in order to make the environmental problems of the country and the world under control.</seg>
<seg>The pressure on local government officials to generate economic growth and job will be enormous.</seg>
<seg>They will be subject to the temptation to say if America has already cannot afford a clean production in China, how will it work?</seg>
<seg>A vision in action to implement the Chinese Government will need good strategies, such as environmental taxes have already introduced.</seg>
<seg>With the development of China towards a market economy, problems resulting from the country in which the industrialised countries to fight: particularist interests which veil selfish reasons behind a thin veil from market ideology.</seg>
<seg>Some are for the "trickle-down economy in the so-called ', therefore, support for a system in which the prosperity to filter from top to bottom, subject: it does not make ourselves of arms is, because in the long run will all benefit from economic growth.</seg>
<seg>Others will oppose competition policy and strict management laws darwins selection theory: we can only achieve its miracles.</seg>
<seg>In order to counter strong social and environmental policies, growth arguments are made subject: higher fuel taxes, for example, would destroy our outbursts of the car industry.</seg>
<seg>With such, supposedly growth-driven strategies we would bring not only no growth but also would threaten the whole vision of the Chinese future.</seg>
<seg>There is only one way to prevent the subject: open debates on economic strategies in order to expose errors and to find room for creative solutions to the many challenges, with China is facing today.</seg>
<seg>with George W. Bush of the dangers of excessive secrecy and decision-making shown in a small number of kriechern.</seg>
<seg>Much of the extensive debates and discussions of the Chinese leadership? (even to foreigners) in the search for solutions to the major problems, the conflicting of Bush tactics, but by most people outside China we do not really goutiert.</seg>
<seg>Do not market-keep House adapt itself.</seg>
<seg>We cannot leave it simply to autopilot, above all when the advantages are to achieve as large a broad effect as possible.</seg>
<seg>The management of a market economy, however, is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg>It is rather a balancing act, which has constantly to react to economic changes.</seg>
<seg>The eleventh f√ºnfjahresplan of China is a roadmap for how these reactions have to take.</seg>
<seg>The world is in honour and hope for China, as the life of 1.3 billion people will continue to change.</seg>
<seg>tocquevilles democratic lessons</seg>
<seg>It is only right and proper that the world is debating today 200 years after the birth Alexis de tocquevilles, due to the war in Iraq, the nature of democracy.</seg>
<seg>The glory Tocqueville is due to the fact that he rejected the reactionary nostalgia for the past and our fate regarded the triumph of democracy - - and warned against the risks at the same time the democracy for freedom is.</seg>
<seg>Should we share his concern more?</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville democracy not only regarded as political domination form, but above all as intellectual system generally., given that it is the customs and practices of a society is the concept of a sociological and psychological dimension.</seg>
<seg>democratic systems, argued Tocqueville, determine our thoughts, wishes and passions.</seg>
<seg>Like the renaissance one and, in the 20th century, homosexuals sovieticus' democratic people 'is a form of human existence.</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville was of the opinion that the systemic effects of democracy can lead to the fact that the citizens themselves to refuse the reason.</seg>
<seg>They would only have to judge whether events and values but not to accept the truth is that the raw and simplizistischen views of the masses.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps is actually Tocqueville mentioned the grip of 'social' power on the opinion, on democratic systems at the most severe - - a concept which will increase the demagogy and media manipulation of the modern world in front.</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville believed that it does not give the long-term effective ways to restrict this trend.</seg>
<seg>Neither local democracy or small companies, mutual national control functions, citizens' rights could stop the fall of critical thinking which democracy seemed to cause.</seg>
<seg>schools could be a little more than decomposing enclaves in the power of the social impact on the way of thinking.</seg>
<seg>Similarly, there is even if Tocqueville believed that the pursuit of virtue in terms of antiquity or religious beliefs, sometimes raises the soul, a conflict between the two and democratic ideal if they were officially offered in public life.</seg>
<seg>In this sense, to tocquevilles such as the neomarxistischen theorists of Frankfurt school, as well as Arendt Hanan which were afraid all above all the disintegration of the explanatory statement in modern societies, belong to intellectual heirs.</seg>
<seg>The French philosopher Marcel Gauchet has indeed been d√©mocratie contre? (light m√™me democracy against itself) a recently published book entitled 'la.</seg>
<seg>The democratic way of life, then these authors face are tending to destroy independent thought and suppress the 'progress' culture; the result is a mediocrity, which makes the vulnerable citizens in relation to the enemies of democracy.</seg>
<seg>However, while the history of murderous regimes which zujubelten intimidated and deceived masses, strotzt only in such a way that the greater danger to democratic nations is that their citizens to withdraw in favour of an immediate need satisfaction in apathy and short-term thinking.</seg>
<seg>The past - - despite the rituals, aimed at a memory of historic moments - - by an addiction blur the next time and under the new one.</seg>
<seg>Even the supposedly formed ruling class subject this bet√∂rung.</seg>
<seg>The central issue of the democratic spirit is its lack of historical awareness.</seg>
<seg>Do the shortcomings of democracy really think how Tocqueville said, which is only realistic but - - those who were not able to be maintained - - which is open for us, a fate-devoted pessimism?</seg>
<seg>I do not think so.</seg>
<seg>There are means in order to fight, which we might call 'stupid' democratic growth of today.</seg>
<seg>The first line of defence is the pursuit of an education system that is genuinely critical heads out by nowadays? () the largely neglected fan of literature, history and philosophy.</seg>
<seg>If we want to inform and consult critical citizens how / as democracy they need our schools must stop this phenomenon, which in any case approach and to start the pupil heighten the analytical capacity.</seg>
<seg>The biggest obstacle in the way of this form of education are the mass media in their tendency for the cultivation of superficial and flooding.</seg>
<seg>Many people spend today a larger part of their lives in front of the television than in the classroom.</seg>
<seg>The passivity which the media is encouraging development in a way runs counter to that active commitment which characterises democratic citizens.</seg>
<seg>However, it is difficult to imagine that the mass media? (apart from demanding newspapers) would become of their own accord instruments of an education, the critical skills of citizens extended.</seg>
<seg>This concern about the media is not mere elitistische disregard of popular culture.</seg>
<seg>The issue is not the popularity alone - - was finally Mozart popular at the time, and shakespeares of arms is caught like the rich on - - but the rejection of the mass culture to provoke cause for thought.</seg>
<seg>This failure is the result of a general indifference and passivity of the public.</seg>
<seg>- a globalised media culture, which is unable to promote the ability to critical analysis or incur a higher feelings, has been a long time in advance.</seg>
<seg>It is a culture which threatens democratic freedoms by its achtlosigkeit because it fails to make any sort of responsibility - - it is in relation to society, history or community.</seg>
<seg>It is too late to do something against a culture which is killing the spirit in this way?</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville ignored the elite of its time for its complacency in view of the entwurzelnden power of the mass democracy.</seg>
<seg>short-sightedness our leaders will help to make its worrying prophecy reality?</seg>
<seg>Europe for all</seg>
<seg>old-established members of the European Union seem to doubt at present, the future of the Union, on the other hand, we look in Ukraine with hope and admiration for the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The basic objective of our foreign policy is to participate in the progress of the European Union because it is said that the Ukraine national unity is not an end, but it is a start.</seg>
<seg>The European unity is indivisible subject: if a nation is excluded is unfree all.</seg>
<seg>We Europeans are unentrinnbar caught in a network, our stories are connected.</seg>
<seg>Every aspect of our common culture, if not the last century of common suffering confirms this.</seg>
<seg>As far as a European country directly, everything is indirectly.</seg>
<seg>We know the narrow conception of two of Europe - - that the betuchten and that the have-nots which the chosen and the forthcoming - - never again do.</seg>
<seg>All those who live on the European continent, cannot do, they must not be excluded from the Union.</seg>
<seg>The current great European peace and today's European prosperity depend on it.</seg>
<seg>Of course, some people murren that Ukraine is not Europe.</seg>
<seg>They are to come to Kiev and talk to people, young and old, with factory workers, farmers, women, lawyers, doctors and teachers who have been stated and have remained in the last winter for weeks in the cold and snow in order to defend their freedom.</seg>
<seg>They aren't linked with those of the General de Gaulle in the French resistance aid?</seg>
<seg>Aren't you one of those who died in the fight for the Spanish Republic into the 1930ern which resulted in Budapest 1956 and fascism in Spain and Portugal into the 1970ern end?</seg>
<seg>They aren't inspired by the same spirit as Poland Solidarnosc movement and the peaceful moderation in 1989, which brought the samtene revolution in Prague?</seg>
<seg>This is the true European spirit, and no doubt can break it.</seg>
<seg>My those Ukraine is too retrograde for membership of the European Union, I would say: they are also to be in my country and consider the mothers who remain late in the evening at work and their children at their firm computer to explain how to use a computer.</seg>
<seg>They are going to go into the language schools in every town and city in which young people prepare for Europe by learning French, German and English.</seg>
<seg>Those who have doubts about the European stance of the Ukraine, should understand that Europe is not a question of hardware and motorways. it is the unstillbare demand for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.</seg>
<seg>I believe that our future is promising so far as Europe is proud past and that we do not have our fate as forgotten borderland periods in a very troubled region, but that we will shape of Europe as macher peace and unity.</seg>
<seg>Self-determination is no longer equivalent to achieve isolation, because national independence means today only the return on the world stage with a new status.</seg>
<seg>new nations can develop as fruitful relationship with their former occupiers as France and Germany - - a relationship based on equality and mutual interests.</seg>
<seg>Such a relationship is trying to develop my government to Russia, and by achieving this, we can contribute to the enlargement of the European area in which there is peace.</seg>
<seg>Of course, it is premature to do more than to express the high reputation which enjoys the prospect of membership of the European Union with us.</seg>
<seg>We know that our share of this vast building is not occur overnight.</seg>
<seg>We know that the major achievements of the European Union are to be found not in documents and declarations, but in innovative steps to improve the lives of all Europeans and ensure their safety.</seg>
<seg>It will be to do not simply cheap or quickly to develop a Ukraine which is worthy of EU membership.</seg>
<seg>But we will develop as the European Union and will be complete.</seg>
<seg>We know that this is a great challenge, but the price is worth the effort, and Europe should know that this is our objective.</seg>
<seg>The renovation work of Ukraine consists partly of a creative fight to achieve in order to put an end to a nightmareful century, fascism and communism - - ideologies which were born in the heart of Europe - - tried the upper hand.</seg>
<seg>Just a few months ago, our children and parents in towns faced throughout the Ukraine armed forces, knurrenden dogs and even death.</seg>
<seg>The young journalist Gongadze who wanted to inform the public about the corruption of the old regime was abused, only a few years ago and cut back by the racquets of the regime.</seg>
<seg>But our orangene revolution of the last winter shows that the Ukrainian people won.</seg>
<seg>I therefore despite the current concerns and difficulties remain consistent with my faith in Europe.</seg>
<seg>I refuse to accept despair as last answer to the confusing and cruel history of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg>I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is tied in with the asteriskless so tragically night of the communist heritage that we can never see the bright dawn of peace and the real European unity.</seg>
<seg>If the European Union citizens think about the place of Ukraine in Europe, they should give them behind the front, as you can see, they should also look more closely.</seg>
<seg>They should look at the past devastated wasteland which Communism, past caused by poverty and social differences with which our cast-off former ruler tried to extend its mismanagement.</seg>
<seg>Instead, we should look at the face of our President juschtschenko Viktor which has been distorted last year in the election campaign by a poison attack and the words of the great French Mr Malraux remind you, for that is the most beautiful ',' those are injured themselves.</seg>
<seg>The Muslim civil war</seg>
<seg>Is the gap between sunniten Shiites and at present in the Middle East deeper than the enmity between Israel and the Arab?</seg>
<seg>In view of the reaction of certain Arab governments to the decision of the Hizbollah to attack Israel could be means.</seg>
<seg>Even as Israeli bombs in Beirut and tyrus crashed, condemned Saudi Arabia, perhaps the most conservative Arab-Muslim state of all the actions of the Shia openly Hezbollah, which would have started the conflict with Israel.</seg>
<seg>Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict a state which regards itself as a leader of the Arab-Muslim peoples, supported Israel so openly.</seg>
<seg>In addition, it is not by Saudi Arabia break with the Hizbollah an individual case.</seg>
<seg>Egypt and Jordan also condemned the Hizbollah and their leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah opted for their draufg√§ngertum.</seg>
<seg>What is behind this remarkable development?</seg>
<seg>Do we are witnessing a fundamental change in the relationship between the Arab and Islamic sektierertum nationalism?</seg>
<seg>Does the Shia Muslims of Sunni government of Saudi Arabia, concerns and fears are more than it is committed to the Arab unity and the cause of the Palestinians?</seg>
<seg>The Arab condemnations of Hezbollah point to the fact that the gap between the Muslim religions, which strengthens the daily violence in Iraq has clearly increased throughout the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>President George W. Bush desire, the rigid societies in the Arab world, should hold the modernisation forces against the traditional elements in the Arab and Islamic societies begin.</seg>
<seg>Instead it seems to have provoked the atavistischsten forces in the region.</seg>
<seg>This opening Pandora's box could have usher in a new era of general and even h√§sslichere violence, perhaps it can only be called 'Muslim civil war'.</seg>
<seg>The gap between the Marsh Arabs and sunniten existed since the beginning of Islam, but I would join the geographical and ethnic isolation of not-arab Shi-ite Iran, as well as the rule of sunnitisch--arab countries on its Shi-ite this rivalry minorities into the background.</seg>
<seg>The tension separate far in the course of "Islamicisation" resulting from the Iranian revolution, because the denomination-bound identity of the Arabs as sunniten into the background have continued to blame, while a general 'Islamic' self-confidence opt-out.</seg>
<seg>All modified Al Qaeda Sunni, when a terrorist group, which was attacked on much of the wahabitischen ideology and the staff of the Saudis America, in September 2001.</seg>
<seg>An explicit Sunni variant militant Islamic it was on the move.</seg>
<seg>The fact that the United States have both the Sunni Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the Iraqi regime Sunni war, encouraged this new radical Sunni present.</seg>
<seg>The recently self-assured Sunni Arabs attack Israel and the West as a threat, others include Shi-ite crescent 'so-called - -' the land statement which extends from Lebanon on Syria and Iraq to Iran and is inhabited by the so-called shedding tables Shiites.</seg>
<seg>As guardians of the most sacred places of the Muslim faith in Mecca and Medina the masters of Saudi Arabia feel that this threat is perhaps most passionate.</seg>
<seg>In the eyes of the sunniten Shiites do not just exist on the oil-rich areas in Iran, Iraq and the East Saudi Arabia, but they are also trying - - by the actions of the Hizbollah - - to usurp the role of the 'patron "of the central dream of all Arabs the Palestinian question.</seg>
<seg>Because the Saudi Royal House takes and the loyalty of its Shi-ite population concerns its legitimacy from a strict form of Sunni Muslims, the Kingdom opposed the Hizbollah.</seg>
<seg>It is ironic that it was America, long protectors of Saudi Arabia, which made the increase in the power of the Shiites, covered by Saddam Hussein and bring Shi-ite parties in Iraq to power.</seg>
<seg>The Bush Government seems to see what it has done; during the Shia statement in the east of the Arab-Muslim world, the United States is trying their protection of Sunni statement - - Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia - - in the west of the region to strengthen.</seg>
<seg>Israel, once the implacable enemy of the Arab thing appears in the middle to be included in this defence structure.</seg>
<seg>But such a defence position is inevitably unstable due to pan-Arab feelings.</seg>
<seg>At present, normal Saudi citizens before aluminium-dschasira and other Arab satellite television stations are stuck in order to follow the events in the Gaza Strip and South Lebanon.</seg>
<seg>They see how Arab? (Shia blood spilt) is not only the Hizbollah and fighting against it.</seg>
<seg>In his opinion, the Hizbollah has become a model for the heroic resistance.</seg>
<seg>This has led the Saudi government to deepen divisions between sunniten and Shiites.</seg>
<seg>After the Kingdom officially Hizbollah was censured, the Saudi state its official wahabitischen clerics fatwas to express which condemn the Hizbollah as Shi-ite abtr√ºnnige and h√§retiker.</seg>
<seg>Such convictions can only strengthen the konfessionellen dividing lines in Saudi Arabia and the region.</seg>
<seg>Will the Sunni regimes, if these differences are coming to the conclusion that they need their own Hizbollah in order to fight in the region?</seg>
<seg>If they should come to this conclusion, they need to search for a long time, because many of these activists have been trained - - by Al Qaeda.</seg>
<seg>Europe must not forget Georgia</seg>
<seg>The times in which Europe could count on America in the backyard of wars lead Europe must make peace and introduce democracy is past.</seg>
<seg>The enlargement of the EU to be seen, belongs to the European Union and at the latest Russian gas crisis, not only to this backyard, Ukraine and Georgia.</seg>
<seg>Just as in the Ukraine democracy is currently being put to the test in Georgia and Europe cannot afford to ignore this development.</seg>
<seg>Georgia was the first item office-soviet country in which it was a "black 'revolution and where people its decision for democracy and European values with dignity and mature demonstrated.</seg>
<seg>The flags of the European Union since that time, which will at all public buildings in Georgia, bear witness to a natural link to Europe, which goes back as far as the history of a country which, since the time of ancient Greece a fixed component recognised that world was at that time.</seg>
<seg>medea true Prometheus, which demonstrate amazonen and d√©marche Noah in neighbouring Armenia that European myths from here, took the outcome.</seg>
<seg>With its history, culture and its traditions - - including the critical and independent and even rebel spirit from the days of belonging to the former Soviet Union matters - - Georgia would still be the ideal candidate for a successful transition to democracy.</seg>
<seg>It is all the more worrying, therefore, that this democratisation does not succeed.</seg>
<seg>Everything was launched as well.</seg>
<seg>political reforms, privatisation, anti-corruption measures, the search for new point politicians unloaded of links with the previous regime and the introduction of a pro-European foreign policy had no resistance.</seg>
<seg>However, the totalitarian attitude of certain leaders steps here today to light those under the pretext that the majority will too represented, more power in tears.</seg>
<seg>Similarly, in the ancient Greek Hydra purchases, the political elites of Georgia over and over again.</seg>
<seg>precisely those people and rule practices which one of the revolution '' has risen in November 2003 wanted, appear to get rid of the shift of power, a lever to use them of their networks extending beyond the borders of Georgia, as well as their tremendous wealth and their fate in political set-up and manipulation.</seg>
<seg>This has very little to do with real democracy, which is characterised by the separation of powers, but not only by elections.</seg>
<seg>The government interference in the affairs of the European Parliament, which is trying once again, the government to steer work in detail - - in my case, that was the attempt to establish the nomination of ambassadors and their programme of the day!</seg>
<seg>A more serious problem is the lack of judicial independence, and the constitutional state undermined and much-needed private investment are hindered.</seg>
<seg>The Georgian democracy is the head, but not the hearts subject: people knock the policy still dirty affairs as it is to leave the territory which should be withdrawn for a long time ago.</seg>
<seg>hope for democracy but people who organisations and the media deep-rooted to civil society.</seg>
<seg>Now it is up to Europe to ensure that this hope does not lapse.</seg>
<seg>The United States has done everything in its power to support political stability in Georgia since its independence.</seg>
<seg>During the term of office of Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister, who lost his office for President during the increased revolution, was to be equated this stability, of course, not always with democracy.</seg>
<seg>But the Americans generously invested in the survival of democratic ideas and their proponenten.</seg>
<seg>Although the increased revolution does not state from Russian nationalists, the work of finance George Soros Foundation has supported this there is no doubt that the democratic foundations promoted, encouraged and supported.</seg>
<seg>for the consolidation of its democracy, Georgia but requires a different type of assistance they can provide more Europe.</seg>
<seg>The balance of forces which must conduct in law and local democracy following European models are made, the more suited to the Georgian reality as the Anglo-Saxon model of American development.</seg>
<seg>With a rejection of this challenge Europe its fundamental responsibility would Mediterranean towards a small, flexible country with old traditions would betray where democracy has a much greater chance of success than in the vast and even the Soviet spirit in Ukraine, from Central Asia to be completely silent.</seg>
<seg>The refusal to support Georgia in their fight for democracy would very likely delay the democratic process in Ukraine, Belarus and even in Russia.</seg>
<seg>It is increasingly at stake.</seg>
<seg>Although Russia its superpower dreams and power had never abgeschworen instruments that we had to resign ourselves to the inevitability of democracy, at least at the frontiers.</seg>
<seg>But this hesitation adoption of a certain normality in relations with its neighbours has always been susceptible to the sudden reoutbreak Russia's famous more irrational 'derschawa - -' an aggressive ethic which glorifiziert concerns the state and its strength from the utilization of the weaknesses of the others.</seg>
<seg>That is the key to understanding the latest Russian gas crisis.</seg>
<seg>It is true that every sign of a withdrawal of democracy in Georgia and other centre office-soviet states of Russia will allow neoimperialistische ambitions revived.</seg>
<seg>It is Europe's responsibility to convince Russia that there is no hope of a return to the past.</seg>
<seg>Europe must accept this role, not just in order to guarantee the independence of its future energy supply, but also to demonstrate that the European values of liberty, democracy and justice between peoples on solid foundations to actually are.</seg>
<seg>In order to be successful, the European Union must provide itself with the necessary apparatus subject: we need a great halfpublic foundation for the promotion and support of political reforms, a college for the training of future leaders of encouraging democracies and police force and a whole host of judges and courts, with the models young lives which we want beginning.</seg>
<seg>Above all, however, that Europe needs.</seg>
<seg>If Europe cannot see today that it has a fundamental interest in the future of its neighbours, who is going to believe that tomorrow in Europe?</seg>
