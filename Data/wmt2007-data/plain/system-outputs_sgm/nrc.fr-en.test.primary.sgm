<seg id=1>Our declaration of rights is the first track that this millennium.</seg>
<seg id=2>Let us hold to fifteen in order to be able to welcome in the right conditions which countries knocking at our door.</seg>
<seg id=3>The field of public services and basic interest social, cultural and caritatif must be included in Article 87 so that these institutions are important benefit of sustainable protection.</seg>
<seg id=4>Some are of the opinion that we can create an internal market in Europe without to agree on the values and principles.</seg>
<seg id=5>I welcome, in turn, the intervention strong and substantial of President Prodi.</seg>
<seg id=6>You know that this is a deliberate choice which has been done in Amsterdam, to make a clear distinction between the two functions. The High Representative, unlike the Commission, should not express independently, but it has the task of coordinating the common foreign and security policies which are within the competence of the Member States and that we must leave room for perhaps a broad intergovernmental.</seg>
<seg id=7>We wanted the Presidency trace in Nice the way for the future.</seg>
<seg id=8>We can indeed wish more and better, but I think quite honestly that it is a good start.</seg>
<seg id=9>I therefore hope that the Nice European Council will decide on its project and the start specifically as project and not as a fait accompli, having obviously embraced the reforms that are necessary.</seg>
<seg id=10>However, I have also made it clear that in the current situation, we could achieve the objectives very important through the Community, such as more effective action in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg id=11>It is only by linking Russia to the West and the European Union that we can have an influence on his policy and maintain the contact and dialogue with it.</seg>
<seg id=12>Motion for a resolution (B5 0767 / 00) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=13>At the moment that it is, it is pursuing this genocide and also seeks to destroy press freedom and the rule of law which barely exist in that country.</seg>
<seg id=14>In trying to meet the expectations of this pensioner, called the Giuseppe Italia, lives in Cremona and would surf the Padania, I voted in favour of the Piecyk report on the development of seaports, inland ports and intermodal and on the nodes.</seg>
<seg id=15>The outcome of the vote of this House forbidden to achieve the objective of the directive, yet accepted and approved by all the speakers and the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=16>Mr President, I voted for the Skinner report, as I said during the debate, before the vote, because I believe that risk capital is important.</seg>
<seg id=17>My party colleague, Armonie Bordes said yesterday in terms of sharp that only a minority benefits from the commitment of Community funds and of contributions to the cash pensions to the risk of enterprise.</seg>
<seg id=18>Accordingly, the Charter will devote more to current practices, including backward-looking, national States will represent a step forward.</seg>
<seg id=19>Mr President, we finally have a Charter of fundamental rights of European citizens whose entire an article, Article 25, is dedicated to the elderly.</seg>
<seg id=20>This text may painless as a first step, since it takes the main existing rights. But if it was incorporated into the Treaty with binding force, as Parliament requested, it would tend mechanically, over time, to the harmonisation of national laws in Europe; it accorderait power disproportionate to the Court of Justice; it would promote a centralisation around the European institutions; it would limit the scope for autonomous decisions of each nation.</seg>
<seg id=21>· We must avoid overloading of the Charter with the detailed regulations and to leave them in secondary legislation.</seg>
<seg id=22>I shall vote for another Charter in taking part in the demonstrations in Biarritz, 13 and 14 October, and in Nice on 7 December 2000.</seg>
<seg id=23>Progress towards of the 12 candidate countries</seg>
<seg id=24>I think that a number of Member States have not yet grasped the existence of this link to date and did not understand that a tentative progress of the Intergovernmental Conference could ask ourselves enormous difficulties in order to impose enlargement within the time available.</seg>
<seg id=25>We cannot impose end up, everything I have mentioned until now that if the world and the political elites of applicant countries and the European Union - and, in this regard specific, you are right, Commissioner – are finally understand that the enlargement of the Union benefits to it.</seg>
<seg id=26>It is the formula for.</seg>
<seg id=27>Allow me to mention now to the second orientation according to which the Presidency wishes to move in these six months, the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=28>What I propose, therefore, is to work in this direction with the idea that we will have to examine, with the prospect of 2003, which of the candidate countries that are ready to join us on that date.</seg>
<seg id=29>I thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, on his clear and comprehensive report.</seg>
<seg id=30>The subject for negotiations is by no means the 'if': it is a question of the 'how' and 'when'.</seg>
<seg id=31>But they have also made because the prospect of accession to the European Union doing their hope the solidarity of the European peoples and it offers them a anchoring and sound economic policy.</seg>
<seg id=32>A number of countries have so far made as regards the second criterion, economic competitiveness on the internal market - they are approaching a great deal of accession.</seg>
<seg id=33>So we are looking for the coordination of programmes more closely with the national governments, Parliament and the other institutions.</seg>
<seg id=34>Every year, and there will soon be again - the 8 November - all the applicant countries are waiting impatiently for the judgment that favour the Commission on their progress.</seg>
<seg id=35>The reason we opted for the principle of differentiation, that each candidate country is assessed on its own merits.</seg>
<seg id=36>This debate is a further opportunity for my group to confirm that the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe - as well as Cyprus and Malta - is the best guarantee of future for all of us in Europe, in the East and in the West.</seg>
<seg id=37>The task, which is nevertheless capital, has not yet aroused great interest on the part of the public.</seg>
<seg id=38>People plaisantent on enlargement which, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, must always speak in five years only.</seg>
<seg id=39>The next opportunity any natural, it will be the European elections in 2009, but we want to make efforts to ensure that the maximum countries can join 2004.</seg>
<seg id=40>Furthermore, six other issues of substance we are concerned because of the method followed.</seg>
<seg id=41>In reality, it is the same model of European integration in which we have engouffrés, I mean the simultaneous integration of all sectors of activity whatever the traditions or the peculiarities of each other ’ s, which turns again in trap.</seg>
<seg id=42>The expression of this feeling almost general in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s commits us all until today.</seg>
<seg id=43>However, let us be clear: there can be no accession on the cheap.</seg>
<seg id=44>There is a powerful idea which is also a good idea: namely that we will not against the enlargements and the opinion that the best way, indeed, to make the enlargement with the opinions through their participation in the elections, as the elections are an expression of democracy and the method of membership of the citizens in political system.</seg>
<seg id=45>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to speak briefly about the conditions for making possible the scenario that wanted a number of speakers.</seg>
<seg id=46>You should not forget that these people are 'interests.</seg>
<seg id=47>However, I have already indicated that all countries approchaient relatively quickly on this point.</seg>
<seg id=48>This means that we had already decided the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products without the Poles do fear that it follows the collapse of their agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=49>Tensions have occurred, but, on the whole, peace and trade have established between citizens closer relations, who are still reinforced by monetary union.</seg>
<seg id=50>This must be the outcome of the negotiations that matter.</seg>
<seg id=51>The only amendment which has been tabled at the moment is already covered by this report, but I am delighted that the Green Group wishes to stress the need for equal treatment of all citizens.</seg>
<seg id=52>This does not mean merely an act in the field of public service but also open up opportunities for appropriate remuneration for young officials.</seg>
<seg id=53>This applies equally to Latvia that the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=54>The connection of litas to the euro is stipulated in the second half of 2001.</seg>
<seg id=55>Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am rapporteur, is the largest and most important but, as we know, also the most problematic countries who are preparing to join the European Union to tell the truth, it poses many problems that it intends to raise its voice calling for the exclusion of the first group, that of the countries which will join the first.</seg>
<seg id=56>We have done too many broken promises to Poland, to the eastern countries, the formerly communist countries.</seg>
<seg id=57>There is one point which is regularly when it comes to the Czech Republic is the Roma problem.</seg>
<seg id=58>Slovakia is not condemned to remain in the second group and it is logical that it wishes to join the Union at the same time as the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id=59>Finally, I would like to make a final comment on domestic policy.</seg>
<seg id=60>Thirdly, and as regards agriculture, the level of productivity is lower than that of the European Union, it must be completely open the market to agricultural capital necessary privatisation of land, the modernisation of farms and structures of endorsement, as well as better yields.</seg>
<seg id=61>Bulgaria is cold-pressed to join the European Union and NATO.</seg>
<seg id=62>The chapter of the extreme poverty - a problem which affects the Romanian since 1990 - there is finally a real signs of progress economic under the current government.</seg>
<seg id=63>I hope that these issues are becoming a priority for the new Parliament which will come into office within a fortnight and the new government.</seg>
<seg id=64>But we also stress that the definitive solution, fair and lasting must comply fully with both the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, which is nothing more than the current international law, and the principles governing the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=65>Malta has also to stable democratic institutions and functional.</seg>
<seg id=66>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we want to make our contribution to this debate.</seg>
<seg id=67>We still need to apply the Community law does in fact not just a collection of laws: he must also be a legal effect in the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=68>This change raises difficult challenges to the citizens of the applicant countries but also ensures that, at the same time, their future and that of their children.</seg>
<seg id=69>I agree with the previous speaker said: we must pay special attention to border regions.</seg>
<seg id=70>In this respect, the Commission must not be left to account!</seg>
<seg id=71>The candidate countries want to quickly on the path of economic growth, although it must be done at the expense of political nature protection described previously.</seg>
<seg id=72>A on both sides, we entretenions of bad habits, most linked to health.</seg>
<seg id=73>- (ES) Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and united Europe.</seg>
<seg id=74>The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and also responsible for the trans-European networks, are aware that it is necessary to coordinate the various sectoral policies in favour of a global policy on regional planning.</seg>
<seg id=75>I must stress yet again on the fact that the transport infrastructure are of paramount importance for the success of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=76>Mr President, I join with you, when you say that the forthcoming enlargement is the main task of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=77>The social values traditional own the former planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe have been heavily ébranlées.</seg>
<seg id=78>The PPE-DE Group do not want to unload the applicant countries the responsibility of the rate of progress of the accession process: we cannot announce date.</seg>
<seg id=79>The second point is the appointment of dates.</seg>
<seg id=80>However there is another reason.</seg>
<seg id=81>Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the different countries and for the EU as a whole - depends on the example of Denmark is for us to show - largely of the elimination of social and democratic deficits in European policy.</seg>
<seg id=82>The populism is épithète infamante that the technocrats give the popular when it is expressed in a direction which is their should not.</seg>
<seg id=83>Ladies and gentlemen, it is now time to break the and the dinner. We shall resume at 9 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=84>We will, even if it is doing in the longer term, a single currency for the whole continent.</seg>
<seg id=85>These thematic cause internal battles in each country.</seg>
<seg id=86>We call them in fighting for a different Europe, that of all the peoples, free from all these characteristics inhumane, where the people will be masters of their destiny, develop them relations of peace, freedom, fraternity, of mutually beneficial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=87>I am publicly the praise for their work and, in particular, the work carried out by Romanian challenge appeal, the headquarters of which lies in Birmingham, as well as the work of other organisations Irish supported by a number of people whose Daniel o donnel, the artist Irish, which promised 1 million pounds it has gathered in Ireland and other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id=88>The summit must primarily nizza clearly establish whether and how the EU can, for its part, will be ready to end time for this enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=89>The Polish are wondering whether they will benefit even when they have joined or whether they will become a country of second-rate.</seg>
<seg id=90>Nevertheless, I am convinced that, with goodwill and with the assistance of the European Union, will be found a solution which will allow the two communities to live harmoniously and prosper, as they have done for centuries.</seg>
<seg id=91>We are also concerned by the problem of minorities because the issue of the integration of these minorities, including their integration language, is also important in these countries.</seg>
<seg id=92>The precondition for it to become a Member of the European Union is basically to fulfil the basic criteria, so-called Copenhagen criteria.</seg>
<seg id=93>The benefits of enlargement have been mentioned and this is one of the topics on which Lithuania can we learn something.</seg>
<seg id=94>Imagine that they are all as that.</seg>
<seg id=95>Mr President, Commissioner, I also wish to congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs, but I would particularly like to confine myself to Slovakia, and especially to the policy towards minorities.</seg>
<seg id=96>I therefore invite you at the forthcoming summit of nizza to set a deadline for which you plan to conclude the negotiations with the applicant countries have made more progress on the road to EU membership, not to mention the name.</seg>
<seg id=97>The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its efforts to join the European Union and, of course, ensure that the planning of this aid is even more decentralised.</seg>
<seg id=98>The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups within civil society, the government and Parliament plays an important role in this respect and - as we see as positive.</seg>
<seg id=99>We are currently to end the division of Europe into two blocs and not to create a new division.</seg>
<seg id=100>All these elements contained in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne that thank you on behalf of our group.</seg>
<seg id=101>In this respect, I believe that the Cyprus issue is, par excellence, one which will be judged on the ability of Europe to see their physiognomy policy.</seg>
<seg id=102>I myself live near the Baltic Sea, a sea which is for us an ecological problem.</seg>
<seg id=103>The political vision remains.</seg>
<seg id=104>Thus, it was very good to hear that Mr Hänsch, who spoke on behalf of the PSE Group, hoped that the Commission procéderait to a genuine assessment of the consequences of enlargement, as well as the economic consequences in the event of enlargement would not have taken place.</seg>
<seg id=105>However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling that the setting of transitional periods is essential in the interests of both parties, moreover, as an MEP from a border region and - as Mrs Schierhuber owner - a strong located near to the Czech border, I particularly want to ensure that the creation of joint economic areas close can be controlled without problems and provide positive results on both sides.</seg>
<seg id=106>As a Social Democrat, I would like to highlight three points.</seg>
<seg id=107>EEA which includes dossiers pillar gives to companies in the candidate countries' access to the internal market and the scientists to young people and the right to participate in exchange programmes, but on the other hand, still does not oblige the EU to extend its system agricultural aid to these countries.</seg>
<seg id=108>Secondly, we must say 'no' to the big bang concept which would admit that at the same time, a large group of countries, because that would be at odds with the principle of the admission of each country according to its merits.</seg>
<seg id=109>Thirdly, we must do everything possible to prepare, by 2003, the European Union to the enlargement process in line with the excellent speech by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.</seg>
<seg id=110>In this respect, I should like to make the report that exists between Parliament and the Council by highlighting the fact that there is an enormous delays with regard to the answers to written questions.</seg>
<seg id=111>It is worrying to see that such incidents occur in a country that will enter the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=112>I therefore ask that the matter be referred back to committee so that it can prepare for it.</seg>
<seg id=113>Mr President, we are going to debate today, and perhaps to vote on three reports, in total dealing with this issue, which are two of my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=114>All those involved in the food production chain should actually gain.</seg>
<seg id=115>Safety is going to cost money to all those involved in the food production chain.</seg>
<seg id=116>We must therefore follow Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and adopt the principle of watered down in securing the feed and genuinely protect consumers in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=117>The 1999 directive has been well thought-out and it can already boast a success taxes have been reduced to a sensitive.</seg>
<seg id=118>However, allow purely and simply the watered is not a solution.</seg>
<seg id=119>Very quickly, we need to emphasise the amendment 37 on dioxin.</seg>
<seg id=120>On this point we agree.</seg>
<seg id=121>Thus, it will result in that we, as consumers, we shall continue to buy on the world market for meat and milk and derivatives of these products on the basis of a feed which has no link with the minimum and maximum limits set by the European Union and a system for the production of feedingstuffs who buy raw materials on the international markets, free mixing of any principle and composed, before introducing their products within the territory of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=122>We must be given, for the second reading, in the opinion of the Committee on the way to the assessment of risk.</seg>
<seg id=123>However, it would be wrong, for example, to adopt Amendments Nos 39 and 40, because this would remove the possibility for Member States to intervene promptly against the dangers that would come to detect.</seg>
<seg id=124>Consumer protection is already beginning from cattle feed, of ingredients in animal feed, and the statement and, finally, of official inspections.</seg>
<seg id=125>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our colleague Mrs Paulsen on undesirable substances in animal nutrition is an important topic and, as all the important issues, it is highly controversial.</seg>
<seg id=126>Mr President, the discussion on this excellent report by Mrs Paulsen has been, on certain points, very emotional charge on the plan, and now that the debate is closed, I believe we must assume that the requirements in the field of animal nutrition are admittedly strict, but that we can then ensure that quality is changing by the feedingstuffs.</seg>
<seg id=127>Individual and jointly, these three proposals aim to considerable shortcomings which have been highlighted by the dioxin crisis.</seg>
<seg id=128>Amendment No 33 removes the possibility of réexporter lots of not conform to the country of origin.</seg>
<seg id=129>Nor can I accept Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which seek to restore the possibility of dilute, under certain conditions, raw materials destined for the manufacture of feedingstuffs which are infected.</seg>
<seg id=130>These should be sufficient, given the commitment we have made to establish, within the framework of the new proposal on the food safety agency, a rapid alert system covering all the products and the food chain.</seg>
<seg id=131>Commissioner Byrne, behind this directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs, hiding, basically a problem we have for a long time, namely the question of open declaration.</seg>
<seg id=132>And for that reason alone, I have already have learnt something.</seg>
<seg id=133>For if we put this measure rapidly implemented and if we entamions quickly the codecision procedure, this would surely gain valuable and I am convinced that, in view of the Council, we will produce strong and united.</seg>
<seg id=134>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it may be that, in future, contaminated raw materials can also enter the composition of feedingstuffs - in any case, this is not to exclude.</seg>
<seg id=135>The BSE scandal is the worst example known.</seg>
<seg id=136>Good sense, as our rapporteur says, this is obviously a label to open declaration, which gives the list of ingredients.</seg>
<seg id=137>I think that the technical expertise, as well as the ability of the judgment of the members of the Committee on Agriculture are no doubt in agricultural matters of food and feed, in order to find a solution geared towards practical and enforceable which must be applied and understood by farmers and consumers.</seg>
<seg id=138>That is the good news.</seg>
<seg id=139>This is, in my view, a legitimate right to information that must be met.</seg>
<seg id=140>Madam President, I would ask you, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, to send a message of condolence from Parliament to the families of the victims and the local authorities of both Brittany Marín, that the city of Galicia, which are from most of the victims.</seg>
<seg id=141>(Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=142>Are there any colleagues who oppose the tabling of this oral amendment?</seg>
<seg id=143>That is, as the rapporteur has explained the situation.</seg>
<seg id=144>Most of its technical proposals deserve to be supported with enthusiasm, for example on food safety, the dismantling of nuclear power stations of the first generation, the protection of the environment, the fight against social dumping, essential to the code of conduct for companies in the West, when they work to the East etc., the task is enormous, and also absolute priority.</seg>
<seg id=145>At the same time, there are still considerable difficulties to be overcome, particularly in budgetary terms.</seg>
<seg id=146>Enlargement thirteen countries not only to change the geopolitical context of the European Union, but it is also changing the structure, because both the total population will increase (+ 28%), but also the number of 'less-favoured regions'.</seg>
<seg id=147>In this respect, we must take account of the fact that in the candidate countries, a competitive agriculture and food safety will be of decisive importance for the success of the process of transformation and restructuring, because of its high social and economic importance.</seg>
<seg id=148>In this regard, I would like to see the outermost regions, whose 6 on 7 10 are always among the poorest in the EU, benefit from the structural funds, nor on the criterion of GDP, but also on indicators geographical, demographic and above all social.</seg>
<seg id=149>Because we reject the in the interests of French, we cannot in all conscience, approve its enlargement to the countries and peoples to the east, barely released from the Communist dictatorship and which may not yet know how trap technocratic totalitarian and they want to join.</seg>
<seg id=150>We should have simply at most a resolution short but intense with regard to the reports on the country.</seg>
<seg id=151>The current system, consisting of aid, subsidies and quotas, must be replaced by free trade and adaptation to the market.</seg>
<seg id=152>The importance and the extent of the problems that enlargement raises are not compatible with the double language as far as concerns within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=153>For me, speaking of enlargement does not mean penalising membership or not of certain countries in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=154>Our neighbour has tried resolutely over the past decade to meet the criteria for accession.</seg>
<seg id=155>Latvia has its place in this House, not only because, generally speaking, its progress its right to this' credit 'confidence is essential to carry out such negotiations, but above all, and above all, because it is at home in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=156>I think that, among the countries which have applied for membership, Poland is the more the state which deserves our support, our commitment, because, without the very important initiatives of Poland, the fall of communism would not have taken place and we would not be here today in talking about this issue.</seg>
<seg id=157>This is not possible so obvious to the Polish people which remains largely euro sceptical.</seg>
<seg id=158>I invite Prague to seize this sign, this invitation, this request for dialogue, to follow up and to ensure that, together with this House, these reliques an era nationalist may be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=159>- (IT) I welcome the Wiersma report on Slovakia's application for membership of the European Union and I share the majority of conclusions that he draws.</seg>
<seg id=160>On that occasion, it is my great pleasure to send a special salvation pensioners and the elderly in the Bulgarian Republic.</seg>
<seg id=161>I do not see any reason for that Romania is not permitted within the European Union, if it continues to make progress at the same pace and once again that the Union will have made the necessary adjustments of its institutional structure and to its policies in order to confront enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=162>Whatever solution is on the settlers, and God knows the problem is difficult, such as the return of land on both sides, what the report says is too hard not to earn a reserve.</seg>
<seg id=163>Unfortunately, some of the comments of the draft report on the request for accession of Cyprus to the European Union, established by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, are not a great help in this respect.</seg>
<seg id=164>This task will not be easy, given the lack of good will of the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=165>Stenzel report ((A5-0243 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=166>Misery, I was indeed victim of food poisoning, even if it was slight, in the European Parliament, unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id=167>For all these reasons, I voted in favour of the prohibition of dilution which is proposed by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=168>We must, in this resolution, to urge the ASEM countries so that they pressure on the Burmese military regime to restore democracy in the country.</seg>
<seg id=169>We show of bias in our approach and our way of doing.</seg>
<seg id=170>That is not the time to take hesitant.</seg>
<seg id=171>I would like to mention a couple of important points of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=172>The equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=173>That is why we need a legislation against discrimination.</seg>
<seg id=174>We are thus now with a large number of amendments aimed at ensuring a technical legal equal degree of protection against discrimination based on racial on the one hand and the discrimination on the grounds of religion, disability, age and sexual orientation, on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id=175>We should make an effort of balance, moderation and good technical and legal his report reflects - in my opinion - all these qualities.</seg>
<seg id=176>Furthermore, they are of the opinion that the cases of discrimination are not large enough to justify a directive.</seg>
<seg id=177>The action programme under examination does not have sufficient resources to replace the relevant work of the fifth framework programme - work which, I hope, the continued will be guaranteed in the other programmes - and we must therefore ensure their complementarity.</seg>
<seg id=178>Everyone agrees that we must fight against discrimination, but opinions differ when it comes to how and to what extent and with what resources.</seg>
<seg id=179>I had the opportunity, in the committee, to protest against the fact that the experts might also outside of NGOs and nevertheless have something to say.</seg>
<seg id=180>We are also very pleased with the provision of the directive specifying that equal treatment for people with disabilities also means that companies are supposed to make adjustments in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=181>That is the only way we will manage to fight effectively against discrimination in all areas of life in society in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=182>After all, as we teach the major democracies Anglo saxonnes, racism and discrimination are counter to liberal democracy, and not by the restriction and the gradual erosion economic freedoms, of opinion, expression and association.</seg>
<seg id=183>Thus, we have a proposal which pupil homosexuality rank of sacrement marriage.</seg>
<seg id=184>We are strengthening and the European Union's positions on specific situations experienced by citizens in relation to discrimination and equal treatment.</seg>
<seg id=185>I also refer to the issue of derogation religious.</seg>
<seg id=186>My attention has been drawn to the interpretation of the potential of the explanatory statement in relation to Article 1, which again may seem a little obscure, if it is not that the distinction between the sexual orientation and behaviour.</seg>
<seg id=187>As all the discrimination is hiérarchisent.</seg>
<seg id=188>In Caledonia is given a preference on chromatique skin.</seg>
<seg id=189>These guidelines of the directive, jointes at the fact that recently adopted Directive 2000, demonstrate the obvious desire of the European Union to guarantee an open society, free from predetermined categories and, above all, the scourge of racism which has deep roots in history.</seg>
<seg id=190>Those who say that Europe must not adopt a directive setting out the values that we all want to defend are wrong.</seg>
<seg id=191>Do not touch to these acquis hard gagnés.</seg>
<seg id=192>Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the media should also play an important role in this task.</seg>
<seg id=193>Experience has shown that the promotion of legislative measures to combat discrimination is essential, but it is not enough.</seg>
<seg id=194>We must avoid the confusion paperassières, which will reduce Europe to a purely entity materialistic politically correct, admittedly, but unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id=195>I find that this Parliament has asked too heavily legislation, all 'reluctant', that the European Commission wanted to propose.</seg>
<seg id=196>I should like to start by thanking the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, for their texts quite remarkable.</seg>
<seg id=197>I also accept Amendments Nos that you presented to stress the importance of the prevention of discrimination and to combat them.</seg>
<seg id=198>The second category aims to clarify the text of the Commission's proposal and the third is to a large number of amendments whose aim is to try to put this proposal into line with the directive on discrimination based on racial adopted in June last year.</seg>
<seg id=199>In particular, Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 propose to delete the reference to the discrimination based on racial and ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id=200>I cannot accept the references that you, in Amendments Nos 21 and 45, people with physical and moral and also to the unofficial groupings, because this proposal in employment applies only to individuals.</seg>
<seg id=201>The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.</seg>
<seg id=202>You cannot expect the public support for operations of peacekeeping troops if you are threatened with death by weapons that we ourselves have provided.</seg>
<seg id=203>Thus, in my country, I would need a licence to possess a gun of hunting, but not for me to install as broker at the back of my garden.</seg>
<seg id=204>Another important point: the export ban, to promote and marketing equipment and knowledge used for the practice of torture.</seg>
<seg id=205>Having said this, I would naturally like to congratulate the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Titley, on his excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=206>We must extend our considerations, on the one hand, the questions of constraint, but also the means other than those intended to use military itself: disarmament, even to the conversion, strengthening the actions of the police and customs authorities and, on the other hand, the candidate countries that Mr Wiersma has just mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=207>The monitoring of the circuit financial makes it more difficult bypassing provisions on trade in arms.</seg>
<seg id=208>The annual report is designed to identify such potential improvements.</seg>
<seg id=209>The European Union is currently considering to complete the project beyond its expiry date of, which will take place in November of this year.</seg>
<seg id=210>A methodology and indicators have been defined and will be presented to the next Research Council.</seg>
<seg id=211>I would thank you, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=212>As regards the problems of SMEs, of course, we have ensured that, in the framework programme, the SMEs have their part - as provided for in the budget decision.</seg>
<seg id=213>It is at least what emerges from the discussion of the budget in Greece and we must also point out that those who put forward the views of the European Union are many. Is that true?</seg>
<seg id=214>As regards the pluridisciplinarité, I share your feeling.</seg>
<seg id=215>The first is the participation of the EU to the national programmes, that he mentioned specifically in his statement.</seg>
<seg id=216>We therefore cannot talk about a European research area, if we do, we, as responsible for 5% of this research.</seg>
<seg id=217>Thank you very much, Mr Busquin.</seg>
<seg id=218>On the one hand, as a result of the effort made to fully commit appropriations at the end of 1999, applications pending at the beginning of this year for the financing of new projects were necessarily very limited.</seg>
<seg id=219>But I repeat that things have been well made by Portugal for the previous period.</seg>
<seg id=220>Question No 2 by (h 0730 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=221>Finally, set the excise duties on mineral oils at a high level not result a breach of Community regulations in the field of competition.</seg>
<seg id=222>Secondly, as Mr MacCormick knows when Member States promote an industrial sector given by fiscal measures, they contravene the regulations on state aid, in this case the state aid fiscal equivalent to subsidies.</seg>
<seg id=223>Nuclear energy, for example, is a very clear example.</seg>
<seg id=224>Subject: budget line 'minority languages' the budget of the European Union for minority languages which exist since 1983, have continued to increase up to 1995, the year when they have been the highest million euros (4).</seg>
<seg id=225>Mr President, Members of Parliament know that resources are certainly extremely important are affected, in the Structural Funds - and this is new - to cultural activities, because with my colleague, Mr Barnier, we have given the importance of the fact that the structural funds is investissaient not only in roads or airports but also in humans.</seg>
<seg id=226>The Commission does not therefore will formulate of new financial commitment next year.</seg>
<seg id=227>As regards the concrete proposals for funding, I do not, it is possible to take this position, because we must respect the normal procedure.</seg>
<seg id=228>I thought to several possibilities.</seg>
<seg id=229>It is therefore necessary that something is done in this area, because it represents a million small and medium-sized enterprises in the whole of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=230>Its regulations covering t it the requirements for the elk hunting, for example, as well as the processing of meat for personal consumption?</seg>
<seg id=231>If we were to implement this regulation to meat that they are consuming themselves, it would be a disaster for the elk hunters of bureaucratic.</seg>
<seg id=232>I intend, after the conclusion of this report, to present proposals to improve the transport of animals and to address the problem of inadequate application of the restrictions of journey time.</seg>
<seg id=233>We have already discussed this issue during my meeting with the Group of the Greens.</seg>
<seg id=234>Our question was clear: what are the measures taken by the Commission?</seg>
<seg id=235>The general product safety obliges also producers to inform consumers of the risks.</seg>
<seg id=236>The case of Maryam ayubi is extremely worrying.</seg>
<seg id=237>Question No 14 by (h 0745 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=238>The attitude of the EU live to live in this ministerial meeting in Vientiane, and even the question of its presence or the level at which the EU should be represented, will depend on developments in Burma, between now and December.</seg>
<seg id=239>One final point.</seg>
<seg id=240>The elections are an important step in the participation of the Kosovars in managing their own communities.</seg>
<seg id=241>I can even tell you that the conduct of the elections was more democratic, more organised that some of our countries which I found myself, either as participating, either as an observer.</seg>
<seg id=242>But we considered that it was a beginning and not in any way the outcome of the process.</seg>
<seg id=243>It calls for more effective control of the arms trade and for greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id=244>I see now that the number of contracts on arms and their components is increasing every year.</seg>
<seg id=245>We cannot take concrete decisions on the basis of information, of fictitious fictitious reality.</seg>
<seg id=246>The deal which has been to maintain them together in the same directorate-general should be reconsidered.</seg>
<seg id=247>If these institutions should be able to appoint an internal auditor, it will prove perhaps enough to impose minimum requirements in terms of auditing the financial controller.</seg>
<seg id=248>The Commissioner is aware, this proposal does not unanimity in this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=249>So we do nothing to object to an independent internal audit service, to which we give the green light today through the report by our colleague Mr van Hulten.</seg>
<seg id=250>Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by expressing my congratulations to the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=251>We are of the opinion that the modernisation of administration is necessary and urgent.</seg>
<seg id=252>One against independent review is essential to avoid the mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=253>Money must be spent in a way that better targeted and more effective in the future, of course, it must be better ensure that funds are actually spent for the purposes for which they were affected by the competent authorities in budgetary matters.</seg>
<seg id=254>Regarding the amendments, I should like briefly to say the following: the Commission supports this recital further.</seg>
<seg id=255>I therefore thank you for your proposals and your deliberations.</seg>
<seg id=256>I would like to summarise the proposals in this report which seem to me to be the most important and positive operational: firstly, the establishment of a group of experts, consisting of individuals appointed by the Member States, which must contribute to lay down minimum parameters of protection of minors in the media; secondly, the establishment of a code of self-regulation by all operators in the sector; thirdly, the possibility of promoting and to make available the devices of filtering both by television that Internet.</seg>
<seg id=257>Unfortunately, I cannot approve the requirements of liberal.</seg>
<seg id=258>This is mainly the legislative competence of the Member States and should remain so, this does not preclude but not a conciliation procedure for the search for consensus on some reference values by the path of dialogue with all interested parties at European level.</seg>
<seg id=259>The fact remains that it is true, in my view, parents to ensure that their children do not look this type of programmes.</seg>
<seg id=260>Parents are in particular need to them is providing assistance in this field, which must include: the specific parameters for the protection of minors in the field of media that are in force in the area of the European Union as a whole, and the establishment of availability at an affordable price, filtering systems of legal provisions relating to the protection of minors and the commitment of the liability of the media, i.e. broadcasting companies and companies are producing programmes, be they public or private.</seg>
<seg id=261>When I hear, the debates in committee, some claim that there is no evidence that can influence the harmful violence in all its forms, on the television, on children, I am surprised and I am using this is a euphemism.</seg>
<seg id=262>As regards the introduction of a code of self-regulation, it is to point out, especially in technical terms, that in some Member States have already introduced the broadcasters codes of réglage for television channels, which must allow parents to cut off electricity.</seg>
<seg id=263>In the debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=264>In particular, my report replaces the widespread international valid in restituant decisions to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=265>It would be a minimum we agree to this area of freedom, which is a fundamental right of every European citizen.</seg>
<seg id=266>Some payments due in 1996, Mr President, have still not been implemented.</seg>
<seg id=267>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mr Evans and Mantovani for their work.</seg>
<seg id=268>I commend the report to the House as well as the amendments tabled by Mr Evans.</seg>
<seg id=269>Our human resources represent our common future in a world where knowledge is that there are more valuable.</seg>
<seg id=270>That is not with green papers, white, black or red to solve the problems, but with concrete actions.</seg>
<seg id=271>But Parliament, and it is in its role, Parliament has exercised a press for the researchers are when even included in the text.</seg>
<seg id=272>Today, you are rendez visit at a crucial moment for the future of European construction.</seg>
<seg id=273>But we know that the process is incomplete and that this incomplétude threatens its vitality.</seg>
<seg id=274>The debate, which each country is helping with its own sensitivity, its traditions, its culture, is the instrument which allows them to disclose, to define and to clarify the.</seg>
<seg id=275>Long live the European Parliament! live the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=276>We must ensure that women take advantage of the losses incurred, while avoiding the repetition of the same inequality than in the more traditional areas: jobs less qualified, a part-time sometimes not chosen contracts, insecure and difficulties of access to decision-making positions in.</seg>
<seg id=277>The Council will be submitted a proposal of indicators to measure the progress in this area.</seg>
<seg id=278>Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar dedicated to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality by the mainstreaming and by specific guidelines.</seg>
<seg id=279>I am thinking in particular of the violence suffered by women, a priority themes of my government action, and I know that this issue will also mobilise particularly.</seg>
<seg id=280>We know that the measures the reconciliation of professional and family life promote in particular women, although we still studies on the current situation of the family and the role that women play there, which is no longer the traditional role given that society has changed considerably, as is the family.</seg>
<seg id=281>Some people, including members of this Parliament, sometimes seem to be convinced of the opposite, but it is a mistake.</seg>
<seg id=282>I would like to end, Mr President, by saying that the equality begins at home.</seg>
<seg id=283>I find it embarrassing position and ambiguous, and this deserves, I believe, reflection for projects that you are proposing, because it is not true that we are to end the practice of through it.</seg>
<seg id=284>In this area, there is no equality.</seg>
<seg id=285>The image of women in Europe, one that we find the over the pages of our report, from our framework directives, badly with these Danish women in their majority who say no to the euro.</seg>
<seg id=286>I think it is significant that the report is the creation of a digital balance between men and women in all sectors of society, on the labour market, for example.</seg>
<seg id=287>It is precisely for this reason that the report has missed a major opportunity in occultant completely marriage and the family.</seg>
<seg id=288>This is something that the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities should also take into account.</seg>
<seg id=289>We have heard that the previous presidency has first restructured and then dismantled the Ministry of equal opportunities.</seg>
<seg id=290>Wages means women continue to be inferior, on average 28%, compared to men, which contributes to the fact that women form the majority of the poor and which makes it difficult their participation in social and political life.</seg>
<seg id=291>It is a result quite remarkable.</seg>
<seg id=292>We are seeing today with an impoverishment of female salaried everywhere in Europe, in France too, where 15% of them live even less 3.650 FF per month.</seg>
<seg id=293>All the countries have not followed this example, I hope that the example of France will be followed by other countries.</seg>
<seg id=294>The history of women are obviously very long.</seg>
<seg id=295>We must help the candidates to really get down to the level of the acquis communautaire.</seg>
<seg id=296>However, on this point, I would like your support.</seg>
<seg id=297>However, this is not the case, even if it is a text satisfactory. After a long thought, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has chosen, after a long debate, not to table amendments.</seg>
<seg id=298>The Committee on Legal Affairs, after a long debate, felt that it was not reasonable that legal insecurity six years and that has lasted three years, the deadline set, was a deadline that more appropriate for it to be possible to determine, with adequate resources and an average speed, if there was no or irregularities in a declaration.</seg>
<seg id=299>It is about Amendment No 15 relating to fraud.</seg>
<seg id=300>The objective, namely to achieve a communication simplified but quality, as well as sufficient flexibility the basic regulation by improving the procedure for recovery and by adapting the provisions on presentation to the customs, responds to one of the many requirements of the single market and this objective has been achieved here, since a number of countries that are to be able to participate in inspired rapidly to international trade.</seg>
<seg id=301>It would like to thank Parliament and especially the committee chaired by Mrs de Palacio for the interest and the efforts made by Parliament and the Commission – in the context of this matter.</seg>
<seg id=302>Welcome</seg>
<seg id=303>I hope that does not change the meaning of the vote which will be expressed, but we really must check the translation of the French version.</seg>
<seg id=304>Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Evans report.</seg>
<seg id=305>It is recognised that the knowledge of foreign languages is a prerequisite for mobility.</seg>
<seg id=306>We also feel that the Member States must be able to decide for themselves, to a large extent, they wish to levy taxes.</seg>
<seg id=307>I somewhat regret that we have no chance of obtaining a majority in relation to the need to formulate a deadline of prescription for the conservation of documents.</seg>
<seg id=308>. When negotiating the Treaty of Amsterdam, we were pleased with the inclusion of Article 13 relating to discrimination on the grounds of gender, race or ethnic origin, religion or belief philosophical not sectarian, disability, age and sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id=309>My final point relates to the budget of this programme, or 98,4 million sum, which is obviously insufficient given the actions envisaged.</seg>
<seg id=310>It is explicitly the grounds for the amendment of the directive provides for intervening in the field of the regulations on age applied in the Member States, regulations, which are, however, entirely justified on grounds of psychology genetic and have no impact on life.</seg>
<seg id=311>I also believe that we could go to everything that has been written in the new Article 12 has).</seg>
<seg id=312>With regard to the religion / of personal beliefs, the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection proposed in this field.</seg>
<seg id=313>The Christian Democrats believe, on the whole, I welcome the proposal for a directive on the introduction of the general framework on non-discrimination in working life.</seg>
<seg id=314>This is not, however, reveals that the occupation of the staff of the internal audit service and not the importance of financial and, consequently, of the usefulness of such a service.</seg>
<seg id=315>The EU has decided to equip itself with joint military powers in order to achieve the objectives of the so-called Petersberg (combat crises and solutions to conflicts outside the territory of the EU), but it has no common defence policy.</seg>
<seg id=316>- (NL) without weapons, the world would be much more secure.</seg>
<seg id=317>The resolution does not drastically reduce arms sales for promoting a policy of disarmament, but only to regulate in order to further the profits of industrial groups.</seg>
<seg id=318>The Commission communication acknowledges the problem but does not propose practical measures, because it is locked in the logic of the liberalisation of the market and competition, and the proposals it can do not concern the substance of a harsh reality - specifically for children - one of the unaccountability enjoyed by the multinationals, which, in their hunting for profit, do not care about the impact of their programmes and of their products and the transfer of responsibility parents, even in inviting them to buy new products in order to protect their children.</seg>
<seg id=319>Like the rapporteur, I think that measures to protect young people against the violent and harmful programmes should not be limited to traditional television, but to apply all the media.</seg>
<seg id=320>With an average of three hours per day, it is the most important human activity, and after the sleep for adults, the work.</seg>
<seg id=321>Furthermore, women are often posts' flexible '; the temporary contracts or low wages are typical areas about occupying mostly women.</seg>
<seg id=322>To be the first victims of the cut public spending, the privatisations in the health sector - for the right of access to care and treatment, not to mention the right to programmes of prevention and information.</seg>
<seg id=323>B5 0792 / 2000, by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, on the crisis in Peru.</seg>
<seg id=324>Mr President, I would have liked a debate on Latin America does not only happen depending on one or other topical problem, but rather in the context of a debate well prepared in the committees.</seg>
<seg id=325>We must ensure that Peru reaches the objectives it has set itself with candidates which are up to the challenge and which are able to therein the view of the Peruvian people, namely a renewal policy and a substantial democracy.</seg>
<seg id=326>The joint debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=327>We know that Afghanistan is not far away, that Afghanistan is the biggest producer of global opiacées, and so we know and we can imagine the role that these mafias policies, not only political elsewhere, play in the expansion of trade in drugs.</seg>
<seg id=328>It calls on the Commission to take stock of humanitarian aid programmes directed at the Afghan people, so that no one is forgotten the territory.</seg>
<seg id=329>The suffering connected with this conflict is terrible.</seg>
<seg id=330>A budget line is funding programmes for mine clearance and prevention for years.</seg>
<seg id=331>Allow me to respond to the warnings of Mrs Paciotti by saying that I will of course ask the Commission today to find out what has happened and what should happen in resources allocated to demining.</seg>
<seg id=332>B5 0794 / 2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnapping of Colombia a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerrilla;</seg>
<seg id=333>We would all wish not to discuss in Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=334>The Commission has already proposed to coordinate the measures for such a package, the Commission already provided in the next few days to absolve considerable resources to that end.</seg>
<seg id=335>So, once again, double standards, and I believe that we must deplore.</seg>
<seg id=336>This attitude of the opposition party Albanians of reject knowingly solution needed to tackle a problem Albanians in Macedonia is, in my view completely incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id=337>I think that the Macedonians have carried out an extraordinary performance by achieving them settle the questions of procedure.</seg>
<seg id=338>That is why I also believe that this reconciliation can take, but the government, which has very courageously found a solution to the issue of universities and to many other problems, needs the visible signs of success as well as a strong support, on pain of being threatened peace in the region as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=339>The PHARE funds made available for the year 2000 in the context of the national programme can also serve as an aid to university at the next academic year 2001-2002.</seg>
<seg id=340>I would like to point out that we all today, Greek MEPs, we now have reacted in this situation.</seg>
<seg id=341>And all this, which concerns Greece, which is at the forefront of the European Union for the sector of the Merchant Navy, actually concerns the safety of shipping in all its aspects in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=342>In recent years, many more people have died at sea, not just as a result of the sinking of ferries, but, so far too regular, within our fishing communities.</seg>
<seg id=343>On the contrary, the innocent victims is used to promote the objectives wider of shipowners.</seg>
<seg id=344>We must, we realise that there is also the credibility of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=345>To conclude, I would like to stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the issue of European legislation on the safety of vessels used for the carriage of passengers must be given the highest priority in the European Union and that the important thing is to ensure that these provisions are applied throughout the Community with a very stringent and uniform.</seg>
<seg id=346>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have arrived a little late for reasons which you know well, in order to make a brief statement on the two issues which are on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade and in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=347>Commissioner Verheugen is going to speak, as did Mr Solana, on the two areas which we meet this afternoon, i.e. the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg id=348>We must be prepared to keep that promise, as soon as the will of the people have been respected.</seg>
<seg id=349>Madam President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, it is with reservation that I take part in this debate, because I did not want that Parliament appear only as a judge allowed to throw the anathema on this or that, at a time when, after the hopes raised so much here a month ago, we face the dramatic consequences of this new explosion of violence in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=350>Madam President, my contribution to today 's is based not only on various analyses the situation, but also on the experiences that I have personally experienced last week, since I was incidentally in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip when the unrest broke out.</seg>
<seg id=351>Even if one is opposed to all violence, it is not possible to put on the same footing Israeli violence and Palestinian violence.</seg>
<seg id=352>I would ask the House at this critical moment, to make a declaration of support for the courageous people who, today, defended freedom on the streets of Belgrade, thereby repeating the support we have given, we Europeans, not so long ago, to those who are fighting for their freedom in other cities.</seg>
<seg id=353>Europeans, Madam President, would no doubt be well advised to take to jump the ball which was launched here by the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council.</seg>
<seg id=354>The status of Jerusalem is a tricky point in the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=355>For years, thanks to his propaganda machine and to the brutal he was exercising pressure on the media, he has managed to mislead the people of his country, but unfortunately too many people in the way Western, in their present a false picture of the reality.</seg>
<seg id=356>While this tragedy is coming to an end, this Parliament has the duty, as a symbol of a free and united Europe, to support the crowds outside the Yugoslav Parliament to help Mr kosturica to fulfil its mandate.</seg>
<seg id=357>It is precisely this attitude as hard stone, which makes us fear the worst - and current events illustrates the words that I had consignées a few hours ago.</seg>
<seg id=358>I wonder whether the Commissioner already provides steps which will show that we regard Kostunica as the legally elected representative of the Serbian people and as the partner with which the European Union must now address.</seg>
<seg id=359>The European Parliament wishes to express its full solidarity at this historic moment when the tyranny is being vaciller and where triumph democracy.</seg>
<seg id=360>The next item is the report (A5-0237 / 2000) by Mr Seppänen on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2000 / 24 / EC so as to extend the guarantee granted by the Community to the European Investment Bank loans for projects in Croatia [COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000 / 0122 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=361>We must welcome the new road policy which has open in that country after parliamentary and presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id=362>Between the EU and Croatia, there is also an advisory working party whose objective is to make available to Croatia its powers and its technical assistance in the negotiation of agreements governing the mutual relations.</seg>
<seg id=363>Let us not forget that Croatia symbolised recently the failure of a programme of privatisation, only a few have benefited.</seg>
<seg id=364>The contribution that we are discussing, in the form of a loan of EUR 250 million for the EIB for the period 2000 2007 cannot therefore be a milestone but must be a help stimulating.</seg>
<seg id=365>It is not quite accurate to talk about democratisation in this report.</seg>
<seg id=366>When, half a century ago, Croatia and Slovakia became independent for the first time, they were of countries satellites of the Hitler regime.</seg>
<seg id=367>We cannot separate clearly the issue of guarantees and Croatia, or of the debate yesterday evening, nor of the developments that have taken place in Belgrade.</seg>
<seg id=368>At a time when it appears that Milosevic has fled and that the determination of the Serbian people has prevailed, we hope that the establishment of normal relations and the partnership between Serbia and our union of democracies are so soon.</seg>
<seg id=369>I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 6 October 2000.</seg>
<seg id=370>(The House rose and observed a minute 's silence)</seg>
<seg id=371>My question is this: who speaks on behalf of the European Parliament on this Statute?</seg>
<seg id=372>I would ask you, Madam President, to do everything in your power to accelerate the procedure in the Committee on Petitions a document presented by more than thirty collective social and NGOs in order to protest against this situation of flagrant violation of Community legislation on radiation protection.</seg>
<seg id=373>The post-mortem taken Georgia has shown that it is clearly a murder after likely of torture.</seg>
<seg id=374>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the opportunity to take a major step towards your dream - which is not, moreover, mine.</seg>
<seg id=375>This is the basic regulation, on the basis of all the other regulations on genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id=376>It is obviously the foot in the flat, one after the other.</seg>
<seg id=377>(The sitting was suspended at 5.50 p.m. and resumed at 17h40)</seg>
<seg id=378>The next item is the report (A5-0291 / 2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Commission communication to the Council [COM (2000) 379 - C5 ­ 0508 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 (COS)], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the new social agenda.</seg>
<seg id=379>When, however, to emphasise the importance of the open coordination method does not mean that this method must replace social legislation, because we need to establish, in Europe too, social rights, let us dare to define minimum social legislation and social which is essential in the context of a European internal market.</seg>
<seg id=380>In our opinion, we also support the dialogue and cooperation with civil society, and especially with women's organisations in the countries which are preparing their integration into the European family, because we need to ensure a uniform development time at subsequent stages and the motives of the rest of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=381>The areas of action listed in the Commission communication has also been the subject of general agreement.</seg>
<seg id=382>I would remind you, at this stage of my speech, the holding of a European seminar in Biarritz on this issue on 4 and 5 December, seminar that I chair.</seg>
<seg id=383>Regarding the fight against exclusion, we have made great progress in defining, 17 October last, the Employment and Social Policy Council, appropriate objectives of combating poverty and social exclusion which will form the basis of national action plans.</seg>
<seg id=384>I have heard some people who has read the report say that they agree with the diagnosis but not with the remedy proposed.</seg>
<seg id=385>Technological development and the new methods of organisation also legitimise a flexible cooperation, putting more emphasis on the objectives and the achievement of results and giving less importance to the rigid regulations.</seg>
<seg id=386>This is where there must be to seek, in our opinion, the archaïsme reproached those who did not wait for brave new world of a market without hindrance.</seg>
<seg id=387>This has undoubtedly contributed to reducing the social unrest in our countries and to promoting the investment programmes of foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id=388>However, the method used seems more questionable.</seg>
<seg id=389>If we talk of a Charter of Rights and if we look favourably on drafting a European constitution, we cannot be achieved by strabisme, and we have to say that we need to make every necessary step in this direction, even though it requires more detailed legislation.</seg>
<seg id=390>I would like to point out, in a critical, a lack of initiatives on the new requirements connected with safety at work, the consultation of workers and the reports of work.</seg>
<seg id=391>Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Minister, Mrs Péry, for the presentation of the social agenda.</seg>
<seg id=392>These points, as we know, are tackled by the conservatives in Europe; we are, with our group, particularly attached.</seg>
<seg id=393>The third issue of the content is enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=394>The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=395>We must supplement the measures the Commission by a review of access for individual health care, social security and the pension system, the shortcomings of the organization of work, and perhaps also by a general reduction in working hours.</seg>
<seg id=396>Thus, women will feel that Europe is close to them, and Europe will draw benefit interesting ideas and innovative body which will result in connection with this programme.</seg>
<seg id=397>We therefore expect an annual report of the President of the Commission in the context of an annual declaration to the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=398>I am pleased, moreover, that we envisage a better management of guard of children in order to facilitate the balance between work and family life.</seg>
<seg id=399>My Group will take into account in its final vote.</seg>
<seg id=400>(The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=401>I find the new approach to the Commission very positive, and the proposal for a decision for the 2001-2005 programme, very thoughtful.</seg>
<seg id=402>I think that the large number of amendments which are accepted testifies to the Community of mind which exists between the Commission and the committee on women.</seg>
<seg id=403>Firstly, because I have received over the last year, many requests from companies, who feel somewhat powerless compared with the decisions of merger they must take, particularly in cases where they had to appeal against the decision by the Commission before the Court of First Instance.</seg>
<seg id=404>I would also like to ask Commissioner Monti when we can expect the publication of a public register and effective valid on state aid and also the picture, long-awaited, results.</seg>
<seg id=405>I would also like to Commissioner Monti that it is important that, in the next report, is a most important section devoted to the financial services sector.</seg>
<seg id=406>What I have just said is not only valid for the energy sector, but for the other areas in general.</seg>
<seg id=407>Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the good work done in the two reports, which emit a flattering judgment on your work and that of the Directorate-General for Competition.</seg>
<seg id=408>I stress this because the market cannot solve all and that, in this sense, there is no cannot be competitive without limits.</seg>
<seg id=409>Mr President, today, nobody is questioning, and I am not going to do, the fact that state aid alter the conditions of competition and is something which does not damaging encourages companies to be more efficient.</seg>
<seg id=410>The hearing and deny the fact that the State aid fell during the period 1994-1998, while the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction, was already curious, to say the least.</seg>
<seg id=411>Today, we obviously cannot, Mr President, ignore the past, although my opinion refers to la Commission report on competition policy, and must learn lessons from this for the future.</seg>
<seg id=412>During the time I have available, I should like to make, Mr President, the following three points: the modernisation of Community competition law, the work done in 1999 in the application of competition rules and the issue of state aid.</seg>
<seg id=413>The Commission has continued to intervene decisively in particular in relation to cartels and the abuse of dominant positions, just as in the field of concentrations.</seg>
<seg id=414>Mr Rapkay, it was extremely important, for the Commission to have the support of the European Parliament for the continuation of its competition policy and I do not have the impression that this support can be weakened.</seg>
<seg id=415>This mechanism can be activated at the request of a Member State or under the terms of Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community measure which remains in force during the third phase of economic and monetary union for those States which are the subject of a derogation, currently Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.</seg>
<seg id=416>The use of capital market should remain the only option for the future.</seg>
<seg id=417>I am therefore expressing the wish that this report will receive the approval of this House in its present version and the internal market and also applies to the sector up of vine.</seg>
<seg id=418>Today, its review is necessary, given the developments of the regulations and phytosanitary of scientific and technical progress intervened, particularly in the increase in vitro.</seg>
<seg id=419>I also believe that the reference, through this precautionary principle, to the possibility of genetic modification means, for example, the reduction of the intensive use of treatment plant.</seg>
<seg id=420>To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, to observe the precautionary principle, in spirit in his letter, as if by misery articles and amendments that I have just mentioned are not withdrawn, we must, as demanded by the wine, if we followed the advice of Marianne Isler Béguin, then the Committee on the Environment, and vote their abolition.</seg>
<seg id=421>Mr President, if you allow: Commissioner, can give your opinion on the amendment of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy? that is Amendment No 1.</seg>
<seg id=422>The only point on which we could discuss, is that of whether or not I would have had to note that the French Government has sent me the decree withdrawing the mandate of Mr Le Pen's mandate.</seg>
<seg id=423>I would remind you that the vote has taken place at 12.30 earlier.</seg>
<seg id=424>In the field of Justice and Home Affairs, I am optimistic about a solution to the civil judicial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=425>The preparatory group will play its full role to 19 November, the date of the next meeting at ministerial level.</seg>
<seg id=426>We need this climate tonic, as Mr Moscovici has said, and I too have felt, at the level of Heads of State and Government, a sense of collective responsibility and very serious historic at an historic moment in European integration.</seg>
<seg id=427>We must simply, ladies and gentlemen, ensure from now on, in these matters for qualified majority voting, we do not find below the spirit or the climate of Biarritz.</seg>
<seg id=428>The smaller countries in the European Union are not subordinate to the largest!</seg>
<seg id=429>I would be grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify this point.</seg>
<seg id=430>On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica is an historic event.</seg>
<seg id=431>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, if the progress were held on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting, the profound disagreements remain on the composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, you have already pointed out.</seg>
<seg id=432>It seems to me that they are going in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id=433>Those who reject reinforced cooperation enjoy the same freedom of movement that passengers back the seat of a car.</seg>
<seg id=434>I am not here, more than you, so my interfering in internal affairs German, but I believe that this position is deeply coherent and will, moreover, in the sense that the Commission would, if I am not mistaken.</seg>
<seg id=435>We have started to have trade on this issue, where it appears that all Member States wish to maintain this ceiling after enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=436>I believe that it will not happen.</seg>
<seg id=437>The first: one sometimes has the impression that in Biarritz, there was an obsession of the debate between small and large States.</seg>
<seg id=438>From this point of view, I believe that it is not enough to say that the Community method must be safeguarded.</seg>
<seg id=439>Even when the applicant countries have agreed to the Union, each Member State must retain a junior Commissioner "or" senior '.</seg>
<seg id=440>The wording of the text of Article 93 is all the more tragic that once the first wave of enlargement, we will be even more successful in the inability to move towards qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=441>Indeed it is to convince the citizens of these countries the obvious merits of any new European Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=442>That would have been the méconnaître ressorts such a crisis, to imagine that fears maintained for generations could place without new soubresauts appeasement forever, in the run-up to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id=443>I am also concerned about the response weakened to Parliament's request for a democratisation.</seg>
<seg id=444>Yet, the fault lies in opposed to those who wish to intervene reforms of major before enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=445>On the one hand, the head of the Israeli Government's decision to freeze the peace negotiations on the grounds of the violence which prevails in the region and to focus its efforts on the establishment of a government of concentration with the opposition leader, Mr Sharon.</seg>
<seg id=446>It is with great satisfaction, of course, that we have learnt the victory by the Yugoslav population and the election of its President Mr Kostuníca.</seg>
<seg id=447>I would advise Mr Barón Crespo to ask his Italian colleagues to explain why they are in government in Italy with a Communist party, which declares itself openly and are preparing to confront the elections with another Communist Party openly, as per the Partito Rifondazione Comunista.</seg>
<seg id=448>Progress are needed on this plan in the codecision procedure.</seg>
<seg id=449>The Commission is in a better position to provide the necessary impetus in the future by the possibility of it has to vote by simple majority.</seg>
<seg id=450>The European Union does not need a today of visionaries who look until 2030, but people who can identify the problems that enlargement will bring in the three to eight years to come, and which can find the solutions to these problems.</seg>
<seg id=451>It is therefore an open labour which does not have fallen from above and which has not been imposed.</seg>
<seg id=452>In the debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=453>Without this fundamental reference, at best, you do not contains more, at worst it kills between.</seg>
<seg id=454>Democracy is better in Europe, but the European democracy, it, is ill.</seg>
<seg id=455>Today, on 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, the European Parliament said very simple and the highly said: the European Constitution, yes, you can, yes, we want the.</seg>
<seg id=456>It is therefore the idea that island status is in itself a criterion will suffice.</seg>
<seg id=457>I will go to the essential to focusing on the salient points of the report of the President Gil-Robles, which I will simply say that I feel it is excellent.</seg>
<seg id=458>First, that of a simplification and clarification of the Treaties.</seg>
<seg id=459>I would not go further, because we are not here - at least - I am not here to discuss the report by the Institute in Florence.</seg>
<seg id=460>According to information - I will be, the technical pardonnez me - which have been communicated to the Presidency, it would appear that a majority of the language versions, in contrast to the Italian version, no reference, for the application of the cohesion policy, which the islands and not the least favoured islands in general.</seg>
<seg id=461>Mr Duhamel, you will surely agree with me that if there is no success in Nice, there will be no room, at least not of credibility, for reflection on the future of European integration, in any case in the current framework.</seg>
<seg id=462>It is also essential that the European Constitution to be clearly defined in the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union the dynamics of European integration should to be included to cover areas in which it is imperative that we act jointly, as for example in foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=463>They could also be necessary to overcome the persistent blockages.</seg>
<seg id=464>We need more clarity in the division of competences and the affirmation of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=465>Everyone knows that there are very different views on this issue in the various Member States and within the various social groups.</seg>
<seg id=466>Unfortunately the ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be opposite and obviously we cannot support it.</seg>
<seg id=467>In the European House reinforced, in fact, there will be people sitting at the table, possibly military, monetary and fiscal and other people who are in part.</seg>
<seg id=468>It is obvious that the second version is not the right one and that, firstly, because the regions are economically delayed in any case be covered by the structural funds and that, secondly, if this interpretation was valid, there are no would have no reason to adopt Declaration No 30</seg>
<seg id=469>Mr President, I will focus my poor small sixty seconds on Duhamel's report, which is a good report, because it would make things, and the lyrisme of our rapporteur, has finally convinced just now.</seg>
<seg id=470>In my opinion, the unity of Europe cannot be political.</seg>
<seg id=471>It seems to us that the new Constitution should already be ready to enter into force for the next European elections.</seg>
<seg id=472>Consequently, the word 'least developed' applies both to island regions and to other regions and, if we follow the proposal by Mr Barnier, it is appropriate here to amend the Italian version of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention.</seg>
<seg id=473>In the debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=474>Since the colleague said she would vote against, the amendment is therefore rejected.</seg>
<seg id=475>Mr President, the amendment which is requested here we would lead straight to chaos.</seg>
<seg id=476>- (IT) I welcome the adoption of the Trakatellis report by this House because it provides for the establishment of high standards of quality and safety of blood and blood derivatives.</seg>
<seg id=477>If the European parliamentary immunity is autonomous, the French authorities should we take up the waiver of Mr Le Pen.</seg>
<seg id=478>I am particularly disappointed by the EP's vote on the report on the propagation of the vine plants.</seg>
<seg id=479>Each group consider that alcohol, tobacco and drugs, a product is likely to cause a great deal of harm to those who consume and to around them. The other regard the contrary primarily as a source of employment and enrichment important.</seg>
<seg id=480>The rapporteur reserve in, all welcome the proposals of the Commission's White Paper on this issue, but it has, however, fears concerning the possible implications of the reform, whose main purpose and to decentralise the application of the competition rules.</seg>
<seg id=481>In yesterday 's debate evening, if I have been able to welcome Jonathan Evans on his work, I should say at the outset my profound disagreement with the imprégnation too liberal, otherwise ultra-liberal, on his report.</seg>
<seg id=482>Ireland has aid recentré its activity to attract in the Objective 1 area half of all jobs on greenfield projects in the three years to come.</seg>
<seg id=483>The face of the outcry that cause the consequences of this policy, the speeches, funding and other economic incentives and tax of State may offset partly the situation.</seg>
<seg id=484>(The sitting was suspended at 14h06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=485>And we are therefore, in October 2000, on the eve of taking a decision about the chiffrage budget 2001.</seg>
<seg id=486>However, this has not prevented the Council from lowering agricultural spending a total of 555 million euros.</seg>
<seg id=487>Furthermore, we believe, of course, that it is not sufficient simply, quite simply, to create 400 posts.</seg>
<seg id=488>I can only invite the Council to follow us.</seg>
<seg id=489>That is why the administration of this House is there for the members and not the opposite.</seg>
<seg id=490>At present, it is the Court of Auditors who are the least cause for concern.</seg>
<seg id=491>Finally, we must deal with the Ombudsman's budget.</seg>
<seg id=492>On the contrary, we believe that this matter should be strengthened in the area of applicant countries.</seg>
<seg id=493>We also propose that Parliament continues to be regularly informed.</seg>
<seg id=494>When organising consultation legislation on social affairs, cultural or environmental - the Commissioner recognises that I was right - we meet with the Commissioner for budgets, the Finance Ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets to urge all for any mistake financial being committed.</seg>
<seg id=495>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your warm welcome.</seg>
<seg id=496>The Council voted at first reading the appropriations to seem justified for 2001, without taking account of the concerns of tactical serving the objective of sound allocation of appropriations for the Community institutions must continue.</seg>
<seg id=497>Before you prononciez on the draft budget for 2001, I would like to stress a number of objectives that the Council and Parliament have in common and which can be translated into an agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=498>We find ourselves in a similar situation in terms of structural policy.</seg>
<seg id=499>Mr Colom I Naval has pointed out, the consultation of this summer has also led to a good result in the future, Parliament will have better information on the legal bases which have an impact on the level of expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=500>May I remind you that the financial perspective proposed last year to the Balkans is stipulated that 1.85 billion for the whole period of up to 2006.</seg>
<seg id=501>I would ask you once again without prejudice to examine this proposal that the Commission keeps and to bear in mind that possibility.</seg>
<seg id=502>This material has of course been useful to both the preparation of the budget 2001 and for the 1999 discharge.</seg>
<seg id=503>Although I very much appreciate the work of this body as a Member of the Committee on Budgets, even if I think as much as the work of the rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgets, I do not want to fail, as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to point out two of the amendments that the Commission has submitted again in the plenary and whose importance is not inconsiderable, in spite of the modesty of amounts involved.</seg>
<seg id=504>By these measures, we want to make the legal controls, once fully operational, to restore confidence in the legal security within the EU and consolidate the Community law of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=505>Looking at the deletion of this initiative without providing the replacement of lesser extent, the Commission was clearly disregard of the political will expressed in Lisbon and the priority expressed by this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=506>This decision was, at the very least, surprising and has given the impression that many of us that the whole of this programme, very important, was simply become a bubble that refer to the Committee on Budgets and the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=507>The third point concerns the common agricultural policy as defined in the draft budget.</seg>
<seg id=508>If employment is the political priority of the Union, fisheries, as an economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.</seg>
<seg id=509>I particularly welcome that the funding of the Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000, including the continuing was decided at the end of last year, has been assured.</seg>
<seg id=510>With regard to aid to the Mediterranean countries, for example, the backlog relates to the budgets for several years.</seg>
<seg id=511>Mr President, during the debates of the years, I prenais speaking on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, for which we have heard this afternoon Mrs Iivari.</seg>
<seg id=512>However, I would like to say to the House this afternoon that we must not lose sight of the fact that the European Union is spending that 1% of GDP in the Member States and that most of this money is managed in the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=513>I come now to the overall strategy.</seg>
<seg id=514>This brings me to the strategy of my group, because the basis for our conviction is the wish to give the European citizens value for money.</seg>
<seg id=515>On the contrary, we must do everything to ensure that this House is an example of transparency, efficiency, and to proper democratic control of the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=516>We need to reflect on how to solve this problem.</seg>
<seg id=517>We want to promote the democratisation process and we want to achieve a balance between the traditional areas of foreign policy, we must address.</seg>
<seg id=518>In the most difficult problems in the new budget relevance to external actions.</seg>
<seg id=519>It goes without saying that a rigorous management is needed, it has our support and we should not deceive ourselves on this point.</seg>
<seg id=520>This is an initiative very exceptional, especially at first reading, and this is a thankless initiative, because it cannot, in the current context, a majority of votes in favour.</seg>
<seg id=521>That being so, the importance of the allocation for Kosovo is not without its problems.</seg>
<seg id=522>The budgetary policy must inspire confidence amongst the citizens of the European policy.</seg>
<seg id=523>We must therefore support all the measures designed to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id=524>The level of budgetary implementation;</seg>
<seg id=525>Bearing this line in the strategic approach on Budgets of this year and in the coming years, the European Parliament is fully place in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg id=526>Indeed, with the transfer of 175 million euros, we made an estimate 25 million more than what was intended.</seg>
<seg id=527>As regards the MEDA programme, the Council has said that the commitments does not pose any problems since the eight years of payment arrears.</seg>
<seg id=528>I think that Mr Duff were here this morning, when we discussed the European Council in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg id=529>My reply will be very simple.</seg>
<seg id=530>Ramiro Zapata was the last 25 of defenders of human rights to be murdered recently and the press has denounced the 'Plan Colombia' 100 paramilitary groups designed to assassinate hundred human rights defenders.</seg>
<seg id=531>The attitude of the Council I welcome a little more today than in July, as often in crisis situations, the European Union seems to be the last to manifest itself on the international stage and to make its voice heard.</seg>
<seg id=532>The question, Mr President, I will end here, is whether there is not a means of pressure stronger than that proposed by the President in his information and whether the aid that we are going to be totally different from that of the United States, in other words, not geared towards the fumigation of cultures, but towards their replacement, and also to the social aspects rather than military.</seg>
<seg id=533>The questions that several Members and myself have posed relating specifically to the situation in Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=534>As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.</seg>
<seg id=535>Subject: tax on financial transactions in the demand for a tax on speculative capital is constantly gaining ground in recent months with the proliferation of committees (Attac association for a tax on financial transactions and aid for the citizens') in France and in Europe, and the amendments to the French National Assembly and the Senate.</seg>
<seg id=536>I would also like to reply to the question of its influence over the volatility of markets of currencies, and particularly the effect of a tax of 0.1 per thousand on the speculators who await the devaluation of the order of 20 to 50%.</seg>
<seg id=537>It would furthermore paragraph 26 on the establishment of an international organisation arbitration to cancel the debt of the countries of the South.</seg>
<seg id=538>Moreover, this is what has happened to the euro to a year, whether for the regret or the wish.</seg>
<seg id=539>I would add to what was said earlier, Danielle Auroi, compared with the countries of the South, that some estimates made by specialists, give the interesting figures: for example, a fork, ranging from 50 to 250 billion dollars, which might be recovered a Tobin type of tax, while at the same time the UNDP, amount to the tune of USD 40 billion per year, the amount which may be enough to give minimum living conditions to the hundreds of millions of people who lack any in third world countries.</seg>
<seg id=540>In recent months, specific cases have been discovered, specifically, in various parts of France.</seg>
<seg id=541>I therefore ask the question, as a representative of the French Presidency is here, as to whether the slaughter of these cows will be paid on the Community budget or if you paierez on the national budget and if you feel that it would be a good thing that the paying on the Community budget.</seg>
<seg id=542>May I ask for your indulgence and ask you to hear the response?</seg>
<seg id=543>So the action of the two governments concerned is limited by this international law.</seg>
<seg id=544>I do not understand how the Commission can already say in February it needs, and the Council in July.</seg>
<seg id=545>By doing so in the name of subsidiarity, the European Union is, in fact, to one of its duties, as has happened in recent weeks, both in the north of Italy that in Spain.</seg>
<seg id=546>As an MEP mindful of this majority, how can I endorse the disbursement of GBP 11.5 billion paid by British taxpayers - that is our annual contribution today - if it does not enjoy a broad approval of the public?</seg>
<seg id=547>A flexible attitude would enable the Council to reach an agreement at second reading in order to complete the budget.</seg>
<seg id=548>If someone does need to be convinced, as it is simply proof.</seg>
<seg id=549>This strategy has already been introduced by Joan Colom I Naval, Vice-President in charge of buildings.</seg>
<seg id=550>The political messages present in the budget of this exercise – and the Commissioner Schreyer referred to - are many: the adaptation of the agricultural policy, the new structural programmes, better implementation of the structural policies, the follow-up to the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit for the creation of a stronger European Union and more competitive and to combating social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=551>The war by NATO has too destroyed and left behind it is too great suffering.</seg>
<seg id=552>Despite what has been agreed, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to achieve this objective within the existing budget without prejudice to the agricultural budget is needed for a sustainable rural sector in the present Member States.</seg>
<seg id=553>And I say this to you very clearly: we must give its opportunity to Kostunica and I therefore hope that it will ensure an amnesty during the weeks or months ahead; but in the meantime, I wish, however, that, in political terms and in budgetary terms, the political conditions are linked to the introduction of these two new budget lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=554>The elections held in Yugoslavia have shown two things: people have finally had enough of the dictator Milosevic and they have lent their confidence to Professor Kostunica.</seg>
<seg id=555>I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners are released also shortly.</seg>
<seg id=556>Otherwise, we will inevitably tomberions' in the financial engineering ', in the redistributions and cuts in social expenditure, both environmental and that in cooperation, without of course mean that the amounts intended for the Balkans to be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id=557>In connection with which we are concerned, it is to resolve the major problems of society such as unemployment, for example.</seg>
<seg id=558>There is, of course, a very important point, is the fact that we have initiated within category four, with his approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to solve the problem, not least because the Council does not wish to participate enough food for thought.</seg>
<seg id=559>The priorities are an important element of any budgetary work.</seg>
<seg id=560>This is not to result in the run-up to the expiry of the Treaty but it would be worrying if the legal post-ECSC allowed to maintain such practices.</seg>
<seg id=561>This brings me to my third remark on the task which is now before us.</seg>
<seg id=562>The mistrust towards the political leaders of the EU continues to grow, as I myself to see.</seg>
<seg id=563>I pay tribute to them for that.</seg>
<seg id=564>The provision in the discussion of all the institutions concerned has allowed an exemplary collaboration, thanks to which we will - I hope - to reach an agreement at first reading.</seg>
<seg id=565>We who are committed to European values in a country Eurosceptic, we now have a further argument for the EU, namely a more effective protection of individuals, which is important for the citizens in modern society.</seg>
<seg id=566>I have noticed that my own country is apprêtait to proceed to an amendment of the law on personal data, which, at present, depriving the elected representatives of influence on the decisions of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=567>There are many other points are also problems and deserve the judgement of the practice to be assured.</seg>
<seg id=568>The Commission would first like to recall the commitment that we have all taken towards the citizens to guarantee the protection of personal data processed by the institutions.</seg>
<seg id=569>By this statement, the Commission will accept that the scope of the regulation is limited to the activities of the first pillar exclusively.</seg>
<seg id=570>In order to honour the political agreement has been reached with the Council and the rapporteur to enable the approval at first reading, the Commission rejects any other amendment that would not part of the Paciotti report approved by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, except Amendment No 69 which corrects Amendment No 41.</seg>
<seg id=571>Thus, it is urgent that the staff of the interservice group are very quickly strengthened at the heart of the secretariat of the committee, so that all the proposed act of general scope can be accompanied, during their examination by the College on the basis of Article 299 (2), a fiche d'impact detail.</seg>
<seg id=572>The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market believes it is important to stress that we cannot compare that what is comparable.</seg>
<seg id=573>Given the importance of fisheries for the outermost regions, I can only be saddened by this observation.</seg>
<seg id=574>Since the creation of an interservice group for the outermost regions under the chairmanship of Mr Delors, a lengthy and fruitful path has been made so far and I want to address the most sincere thanks to the outermost regions of the European people who chaired this group.</seg>
<seg id=575>Indeed, while the Treaty of Rome, it was referred to the French overseas departments, it was not until 1989 and the programme of options specific to the related to remoteness and insularity, the famous POSEI, so that the European Union finally admit that the permanence and combination of structural handicaps outermost regions justified specific treatment in comparison with other regions of the Community.</seg>
<seg id=576>I have no doubt that the proposals that the Commission will formulate Council will bear the stamp of these qualities.</seg>
<seg id=577>This question is all the more relevant that we are approaching an enlargement of the Union to the East.</seg>
<seg id=578>This right to difference is nothing more, what is more, that a émanation the principle of equality, which also requires a different way of dealing with what is different.</seg>
<seg id=579>It is a document which we see my team, and I, as rich in ideas, proposals, which is at the heart of the problems and which only esquive any of the issues of concern to the outermost regions Community.</seg>
<seg id=580>Your report, Mrs Sudre, emphasis, quite rightly, on the need for action in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=581>As to the relaunch of the diversification of the economy, we have made progress in several key areas.</seg>
<seg id=582>It is now important that a large number of projects to be presented within the DOCUPs, but, in parallel with this action on the ground, we must consider in depth needs, to access, specific to each of these outermost regions in the information society.</seg>
<seg id=583>Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg id=584>I will of course part of your speech to the President.</seg>
<seg id=585>I am concerned about the risk of a general failure of a large number of machines and of rules which would then question the decisions of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=586>The food safety agency and the legislative proposals which we are submitted, intended to guarantee food safety, receive the support of this Parliament, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=587>The main task of this agency will be a task of scientific advice, because the debate on food safety must be 'clean' too.</seg>
<seg id=588>Mr President, I would like once again to thank the rapporteur for her constructive contribution and for his openness to the opinions of other committees.</seg>
<seg id=589>When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to implement the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg id=590>On the question always controversial of to what extent we must allow him to look on nutrition, to give advice and really to be consulted by those who care about essentially the management of risk, we have also says that, when it comes to safety, these questions should at least be part of the role of consultation of this food safety authority.</seg>
<seg id=591>A central element of this last point is to ensure that the rich heritage of traditions which is ours can continue.</seg>
<seg id=592>The elements that will enable this respectability to see the light of day should call or laws or legislation, but integrity, academic impeccable quality, independence, duty of accountability, transparency and comprehensibility.</seg>
<seg id=593>A good scientific knowledge is certainly necessary to assess the risks linked to the food chain, from farm to table.</seg>
<seg id=594>Mr President, the enthusiasm for the establishment of a European agency for food safety, as our rapporteur prefer to call it, is obviously considerable.</seg>
<seg id=595>As the programme of the who is properly financed and supported, it does not seem to be necessary to create a body of more, not least an agency whose scope is limited to the 15 Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=596>Food safety is an essential condition for the consumer; indeed, they want to eat healthily and it is up to us to ensure.</seg>
<seg id=597>Unless we are drawing up any new framework directive, we shall be smiling on many things in the field of food safety.</seg>
<seg id=598>We therefore need to change the Treaty on European Union, so that the Commission has the possibility of applying sanctions in the field of animal, exactly as it can do today in the field of competition.</seg>
<seg id=599>I support all the actors involved, whether they are political, administrative or other, who works in the context of the strategy 'food for all'.</seg>
<seg id=600>I do not agree with these words, because we can discover that a man is more than a body.</seg>
<seg id=601>It must be the true brain coordination of the network of national agencies, which in turn will activate and coordinate a network of centres of excellence food safety at regional level.</seg>
<seg id=602>Also, I believe that your Amendment No 11 and my Amendment 17 are perfectly conciliables.</seg>
<seg id=603>The reform of food law in the European Union must be done at European Union level.</seg>
<seg id=604>His report is not so much changes that it focuses on a number of elements.</seg>
<seg id=605>We stated clearly in the report, and I welcome it wholeheartedly.</seg>
<seg id=606>However, the creation of a European agency on food safety is very positive.</seg>
<seg id=607>It is to be hoped that, in the interests of European consumers, they will be respected.</seg>
<seg id=608>It is needed, I believe, to define precise deadlines in which it will be necessary to notify the Commission any event suscitant justified concern.</seg>
<seg id=609>The EU must have the highest standards of food safety for its citizens.</seg>
<seg id=610>The Commission is now proposing the creation of a European food safety authority.</seg>
<seg id=611>I fear that Europe should set out again at risk to provide itself with an enormous administrative apparatus, unable to act.</seg>
<seg id=612>Indeed, the yield is inversely proportional to the levels of bureaucracy and the level of expenditure engaged.</seg>
<seg id=613>The work empêchez double and parallel in various institutions.</seg>
<seg id=614>But we must ensure that, in the shadow of the debate on the White Paper, is becoming stronger in public opinion the fear of a bureaucratic Europe which affects the quality of products without remedy effectively the fraud that threaten the health of consumers.</seg>
<seg id=615>As you know, the Commission attaches the utmost importance to its strategy in food safety.</seg>
<seg id=616>The Commission intends to adopt a proposal for a regulation establishing the principles and objectives which will form the cornerstone of food law and will form the framework for future measures of health protection in the area of food.</seg>
<seg id=617>Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=618>Turning to my report, I welcome the Commission proposal and have to say that the Committee on Foreign Affairs and of development have worked hard to improve it, in particular on some points.</seg>
<seg id=619>As Mrs Bonino has clearly said, there has been a step forward by the Commission's proposal for a regulation.</seg>
<seg id=620>The proposal for a regulation of the Commission is very vague.</seg>
<seg id=621>It is necessary to organise properly the allocation of mine clearance operations and to finance research for the work of detection and of mines and the instruments that can be used simply in order to help the developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=622>In the course of eight years, the European Union has spent more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget in the fight against landmines.</seg>
<seg id=623>But we cannot penalise the peoples whose government commits of violence.</seg>
<seg id=624>Firstly, I have already spoken, I think it would be a mistake, therefore, a good sense, but all the same, counterproductive to membership of the Ottawa Convention an absolute condition for the granting of Community assistance for the fight against landmines.</seg>
<seg id=625>So I cannot accept Amendment No 19.</seg>
<seg id=626>Secondly, the international community is suffering from a lack of coordination of its efforts at world level and especially in the countries affected.</seg>
<seg id=627>Mr President, the Socialist Group shares the pride that has just been expressed just now by Mr Van Orden about the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=628>Remember the bombs toys Soviets in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=629>I thank you for the quality of your report.</seg>
<seg id=630>Mr President, the Cambodian call the mines sentinelles eternal.</seg>
<seg id=631>The population maintains a justified suspicion in respect of the forces in uniform, whatever they may be, which explained by many years of war.</seg>
<seg id=632>Mr President, I welcome the fact that there is finally a European legislation, in the form of a regulation on anti-personnel mines and that we have today a good report by Mrs Bonino on this issue.</seg>
<seg id=633>- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing today a very sad.</seg>
<seg id=634>It is no coincidence that mines are, first and foremost, in areas of crisis, in other words in regions which might take initiatives of a different nature to overcome these crises.</seg>
<seg id=635>In two kilometres from Hamlet in Bosnia, in 1999, a sign indicates the presence of landmines in a minefield, this does not prevent the presence on the grounds of a boy.</seg>
<seg id=636>It is tragic that the civilian population which is suffering from the failure of its leaders.</seg>
<seg id=637>On the eve of the fourth Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference, which will take place on 15 and 16 November next in Marseilles, I am convinced that your work with our delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries, headed by Mr Obiols, will take forward our project of dialogue and peace.</seg>
<seg id=638>All the mines are stored in deposit.</seg>
<seg id=639>(DE) Mr President, given that I agree with almost everything that my colleagues have said, it seems unnecessary to repeat that I therefore up to use my speaking time.</seg>
<seg id=640>Your understanding of the cooperation is open from relapsing into the institutional system dominated by Commission officials.</seg>
<seg id=641>We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, which means that decisions are taken at the closest possible of those concerned.</seg>
<seg id=642>Since, however, the main amendments tabled by the PPE Group have to find a large majority, I supported the report.</seg>
<seg id=643>Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the resolution on the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz, for two reasons: the first because I voted separately, so that nominal, to paragraphs 2 and 5, which enabled me to express my opposition frank in relation to these two paragraphs.</seg>
<seg id=644>In other words, around the table of the common European home, some mangeraient à la carte menu and others to a minimum.</seg>
<seg id=645>Admittedly, we can always be improved, and the democratic control must not weaken. But it is our view that the list of these rights and their inclusion in the Treaties were not the main problem in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=646>There have been debates about referendums and of the amendments which have been tabled to that effect.</seg>
<seg id=647>During the 1999 elections to the European Parliament, the electoral turnout has reached that 40%, if we exclude the countries in which the vote is compulsory, and those in which the ballot European was combined with national elections.</seg>
<seg id=648>To achieve the objective of a European Constitution – what we want to see - we must avoid imposing schemes and methodologies of rigid, which inevitably lead to the failure of the objective sought.</seg>
<seg id=649>A genuine Constitution should align social, from the top, the best of the acquis communautaire to the labour market, women, immigrants and the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=650>Without denying the laudable intention to improve, clarify and deepen the European Union, as well as to simplify the texts for closer to citizens, I did not vote for this resolution.</seg>
<seg id=651>The allocation of powers and responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id=652>I consider it absolutely crucial the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU leads the Union's accession to the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=653>But the report by Mr Gil-Robles just to my relief, because it proposes that a few subjects, sectors and materials, some Member States of the European Union to agree on joint action.</seg>
<seg id=654>The desire to ensure that an increasing number of decisions on important areas to be taken by qualified majority is contrary basic democratic standards.</seg>
<seg id=655>Today, it is trying to prevent the relaxation of enhanced cooperation, and we will not lose the part, here too.</seg>
<seg id=656>This report seeks to implement the position taken by this Parliament (point of our resolution of 13 April 2000).</seg>
<seg id=657>- (SV) our views about the so-called flexible integration is generally positive.</seg>
<seg id=658>The UK Labour Members of the PSE Group welcome the favourable reception reserved for the contribution they have made to the ongoing work of the IGC on reinforced cooperation, without endorsing totally at all the details of this.</seg>
<seg id=659>These islands must feel part of the European Union which, I hope, will be a paradise for tourists and for their inhabitants themselves.</seg>
<seg id=660>In the Middle Ages, these regions and their peoples did not belonged to Europe and, even today, they are not properly considered European.</seg>
<seg id=661>Indeed, the specific features of these regions, arising in general of island status and of remoteness from the continent, but also of their addiction chronic compared with a limited number of products or even a single production, require specific measures adapted to overcoming these constraints.</seg>
<seg id=662>Mr President, I apologise if I still requires the Presidency and the interpreters to listen to my last explanation of vote and would particularly like to express my solidarity with the translators of our explanations of vote, as far as I am concerned the Italian ornella buson.</seg>
<seg id=663>In fact it seems clear that the Agency is intended to capture the powers of national defence, or to paralyse the, to the need to serve the objectives of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=664>This does not prevent the Commission and Parliament to baptiser this agency 'authority' name, which is totally contrary to the philosophy which is supposed to draw.</seg>
<seg id=665>This is not quite what we propose the Bowis report, where one has the feeling that food safety is mainly seen as a new pretext for fuel the well-known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission, to the detriment of the national bodies and of the safety of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=666>Also, I think, by this statement, condemn these unspeakable acts on behalf of our European Parliament has always advocated respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all communities.</seg>
<seg id=667>Madam President, I understand the criticism of the rapporteur, but by adopting the amendments of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, one does not vote only appropriations but also for or against a determined orientation of policy.</seg>
<seg id=668>I ask for support for the modification of the 'line 206, acquisition of property', according to the proposals for amendments to be adopted, so that we do not have our own limited dépassions ceiling of 20% of total administrative expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=669>Before the vote on the proposal to amend 929</seg>
<seg id=670>Section VI - Economic and Social Committee;</seg>
<seg id=671>Report (A5-0276 / 2000) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of the stock of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES Division VIIa) (COM (2000) 0190 - C5 ­ 0071 / 2000 - 2000 / 0219 (CNS))</seg>
<seg id=672>(Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=673>Export subsidies have the effect of sales at low prices, on the world market surpluses of food, which creates a serious disadvantage in terms of competition for agri-food industries in many countries, for example to the developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=674>In order to obtain the necessary financial resources to an increase in aid to the Balkans, the Member States must make a redistribution of funds available in the budget.</seg>
<seg id=675>However, Parliament has managed to push through a number of important priorities - including a greater effort in the fight against unemployment and poverty, on a number of important issues relating to the environment and equal opportunities, etc., we voted against the blows right through the LIFE programme and the European women's lobby.</seg>
<seg id=676>- (SV) We maintain our opinion on the travel expenses paid to MEPs, namely that only the actual travel costs incurred during which fall within the framework of their mission must they be refunded.</seg>
<seg id=677>I assume - and I hope that the Commission finding constructive solutions to this effect - that we will have to cover the period between 2002 and 2005 through a transitional regulation.</seg>
<seg id=678>- (DE) in its desire to regulate and obsessive to liberalise but especially in order to gag truly national parliaments, the European Commission has tabled a proposal for a regulation for the purpose of implementing immediate and compulsory, instead of a proposal for a directive, which must be addressed to the cravache to Parliament and the Council to enter into force on 31 December of this year.</seg>
<seg id=679>We therefore support the efforts made by the Commission to reform this sector and we will be opposing all new measures to encourage it.</seg>
<seg id=680>A development which has made the heavily dependent on capital borrowed.</seg>
<seg id=681>Report (Nicholson has 0276 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=682>It is important to be able to guarantee that the money allocated under the are not used for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id=683>Our firm opinion is that the reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to be mainly achieved the costs that will have to pay the real polluters (i.e. the large industries), to the detriment of their excessive profits.</seg>
<seg id=684>Report Moreira da Silva ((A5-0271 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=685>We must spend that money by harmonising, and in coordinating the expenditure on research policy in all fifteen Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=686>Even if only by precaution, we are right to want to learn more about these substances.</seg>
<seg id=687>The period of vote is over.</seg>
<seg id=688>This would replace the national European format format which is already used everywhere at present.</seg>
<seg id=689>The loss of data used to establish the statistics balance of payments which would result from this amendment would be minimal.</seg>
<seg id=690>We must do you realise that it is mainly small and medium-sized enterprises that are concerned by this problem.</seg>
<seg id=691>For years now, we are calling on harmonization of the efforts in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=692>I think that this report is of crucial importance for a genuine integration of citizens and the citizens, of small and medium-sized businesses in the euro zone and to increase the acceptance of economic and monetary Union.</seg>
<seg id=693>The free movement of capital in single currency cannot live with with obstacles or of considerable differences.</seg>
<seg id=694>However, the European Parliament and the Commission will attach very great importance.</seg>
<seg id=695>I support the twin-track policy that wishes to follow the rapporteur for the banks too rétives to act.</seg>
<seg id=696>We cannot force the banks to activity unprofitable, but as politicians, we can do is to support the amendment tabled on behalf of the PPE-DE Group by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs requesting that measures be taken before the end of the year and preferably that these standards are become reality if we begin to use the notes and coins in euros.</seg>
<seg id=697>In this spirit that is the proposal which I introduced with Mrs Peijs: get banks around a table, not to impose constraints, but because we cannot continue to strengthen the political pressure.</seg>
<seg id=698>It goes without saying that if the systems of cross-border payments remain as expensive as they are today, the credibility of the new coins and notes will be directly to these new challenged.</seg>
<seg id=699>We believe that this accumulation of statistical data on national payments from the European Union is a relic of the past are no longer justified in an integrated area, unified, and that it is an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the market.</seg>
<seg id=700>Listening to the speeches of some of my colleagues in the Committee, who attend here for longer than I do, I had the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, which this Parliament is submitting for the fourth time belonged to this category.</seg>
<seg id=701>Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you in advance of the support that you will in my report.</seg>
<seg id=702>If it is at European level, we must strengthen the possibilities for the regions.</seg>
<seg id=703>The main source of job creation, both in terms of quality and quantity, SMEs play a vital role for the social cohesion and for land use planning.</seg>
<seg id=704>The care she has contributed to the study of the proposals and the agreement that it was the desire to conduct with many interested parties were an asset to better define and optimise the implementation of this programme.</seg>
<seg id=705>Thirdly, we must seek the European added value.</seg>
<seg id=706>It follows that in the small and medium-sized enterprises cannot live that if unemployment is low and if public budgets are free of debts and sufficiently supplied to provide such investment.</seg>
<seg id=707>The companies need clarity.</seg>
<seg id=708>Above all, when a company unipersonnelle or a society with fewer than 250 employees has a project, it must be possible to benefit from funding not only with a guaranteed to 120%, but also on the basis of a simple idea:</seg>
<seg id=709>The national States, or the regional authorities or local use of already gigantic pumps, intended to finance drainer taxpayers' money, that is to say the amounts levied on the majority of the population, including the poorest, towards the big companies and thus towards their owners and shareholders.</seg>
<seg id=710>, small and medium-sized enterprises contains thousands of fragile trials which feed the large companies in staffing and ideas.</seg>
<seg id=711>What I expect of the Commissioner, particularly among all the measures we have proposed here is that it will facilitate and speed up the aid and access to information, for which the heads of small and medium-sized enterprises to be able to use information effectively.</seg>
<seg id=712>All these will hold a prominent place in the multiannual programme.</seg>
<seg id=713>Finally, I welcome the idea of giving us an annual meeting in order to make an assessment of the implementation of the programme.</seg>
<seg id=714>The recent incidents against the Greek minority in Himara make more imperative the need to promote measures to democratisation, the strengthening of institutions and the respect for human rights in Albania.</seg>
<seg id=715>An impressive number of Albanians leave their countries because of the insecurity that there are difficulties, social, family and social structures and prémodernes.</seg>
<seg id=716>We need to preventive measures taillées tailor-made for Albania and helping the construction and the reconstruction of the country in order to live with dignity in this region.</seg>
<seg id=717>That is how the travel documents of a body to another and that the European Commission, for example, refuse to make public the report which concerns, amongst other things, also the customs assistance mission (cam), drawn up by the Albanians.</seg>
<seg id=718>Try to look the truth in the face.</seg>
<seg id=719>Mrs Karamanou, congratulations on the point of view extended that has governed the design of your report.</seg>
<seg id=720>It is a very important subject which is shaped by the factors historical, social, political and economic.</seg>
<seg id=721>We will never know the exact number of victims.</seg>
<seg id=722>The economic activities Commons generating peaceful links between people.</seg>
<seg id=723>What I find rather unacceptable in this report, and I say this with great frankness, is that there is confusion between the effect and the facts, namely that there is confusion between the procedure for the granting of visas, balanced and therefore the possibility of migration, with the result of illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id=724>The important institutional changes which are the result of the Treaty of Amsterdam has had an impact on the management of the issues of asylum and immigration.</seg>
<seg id=725>Thirdly and finally, the action plan and its method of implementation must be considered at regional level.</seg>
<seg id=726>Naturally, this requirement we also invites us to show restraint in terms of European regulations.</seg>
<seg id=727>It is now or never to focus particularly on the force of Community action.</seg>
<seg id=728>I also call for proposals that are introduced codified in the event of a modification of the current European legislation to incorporate the amendments in the existing directives or regulations.</seg>
<seg id=729>The principle of subsidiarity, it is understood, commits us in two directions: decisions at the lowest possible level, but to recognise that the lowest possible level can be a very high level, when the general interests are at stake and threatened if they are not protected everywhere in a uniform manner.</seg>
<seg id=730>This report is a model of brevity and clarity and I hope colleagues will take seriously into account.</seg>
<seg id=731>The report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not caused the enthusiasm of its members.</seg>
<seg id=732>That is what I am referring to the report on the SLIM project, because Community legislation, and Mr Medina has just prove it with the reading of one of the articles of the Treaty, is difficult to understand, even for the experts.</seg>
<seg id=733>Consequently, certain aspects of the report I have enthousiasment little, because I would have preferred a report more 'communitarising' with regard to the internal market, and, above all, because the report does not go in this direction on this point.</seg>
<seg id=734>What is important for the institutions of the Union, is that we ourselves firmly to improve the quality of legislation, particularly bearing in mind the subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=735>In the debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=736>The persistence of this situation could have a negative impact on the citizens about the euro.</seg>
<seg id=737>Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Internal Affairs has prepared with great care the Karamanou report.</seg>
<seg id=738>Having said that, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to take advantage of our oral question and in this debate for me to address two sides - since our motion for a resolution is addressed to both sides - and I should like to make a few observations calmly.</seg>
<seg id=739>The people of the European Union whom we represent here we demand.</seg>
<seg id=740>Much of water has passed under the bridge, the agreement is, however, come to an end and has not been extended.</seg>
<seg id=741>I can understand the reasons for the Commissioner but not those of the Director-General.</seg>
<seg id=742>We could say that, after the least eleven of tie-up, we continue to pay the previous agreement, and the earlier to the earlier.</seg>
<seg id=743>Mr President, we had a similar debate a year ago and the fact that it has taken a year to begin negotiations shows how difficult it is to find resources for imposantes fleets of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=744>At the second agreement, things were very clear.</seg>
<seg id=745>But we must also realise that nothing is eternal, not even the fisheries resources.</seg>
<seg id=746>It is for that reason that I particularly want to make it clear that if the PPE-DE Group has distinguished from others, it is not only for having supported and encouraged, supported the fisheries agreements, but also for having encouraged their extension of significantly.</seg>
<seg id=747>Thirdly, since the fisheries agreement is suspended, the exploitation of the place of the Sahara fishing by the Community and non-Community fleets which are not subject to the control of either the Commission or the Member States' continues: there is talk of a fleet especially important in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id=748>I understand the easily, because fishing is a source of income and jobs are important for this region poor - in relation to European standards.</seg>
<seg id=749>The other point I would like to emphasise is that the temporary aid paid to fishermen and shipowners in compensation for this year without work will end at the end of the month. This is an unsustainable situation for them, they prefer all work rather than to receive aid.</seg>
<seg id=750>A year ago that, as a member of the party Andalusian, I negotiated and I propose initiatives in the corridors, offices, the Committee on Fisheries and in the hearings with the Commissioner to be taken into account the very special idiosyncrasie Andalusian fishing fleet which fished in Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=751>Spain has developed in a way the positive extremely difficult neighbourhood that has always existed between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=752>As a Spanish Member, I Andalusian and claiming the right to thousands of families Andalusian and Spanish to maintain and defend, and that this Parliament, also defend their job, which are being put at risk for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id=753>We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=754>A history of almost twelve years, made of reassuring words spoken by the authorities, of delaying tactics, the hopes, also needs of personal, of placebos for those affected, defence stubborn of old with regard to the rights of citizens, who do nothing more than their recherchaient that right.</seg>
<seg id=755>As you know, the matter is very complex and concerns some 700 people working in over 25 Italian universities.</seg>
<seg id=756>If the legal Italian is reformed and modified, as was the case for the staff university, we do not believe that the Commission can intervene, therefore, that every European citizen enjoys equal access to all categories of professions.</seg>
<seg id=757>The injustice lies in the fact that two people meet the same task and working shoulder to shoulder receive a salary different and are subject to different conditions.</seg>
<seg id=758>In my view, however, there is nothing worse than having to warn people that a ruling in their favour could not have been a series of words réconfortants and do not have any consequences concrete on their existence.</seg>
<seg id=759>I would remind you, I would remind the Commission that I hope a reaction to the fact that, in the case of allué, the ruling by the Court says that it is contrary to Article 48 (2) of the EC Treaty that legislation is of a Member State limit the duration of contracts of employment assistants in foreign languages in one year with the possibility of renewal, if there is no limit on the principle of this type of teachers against the other.</seg>
<seg id=760>However, I believe that these affairs affect the very core of the fundamental principles of freedom associated with European law, specifically the freedom of movement, and no exceptions cannot be tolerated in relation to these principles.</seg>
<seg id=761>As shown in the current debate, even though we encounter obstacles, many obstacles on the path of this internal market, and not just in this case.</seg>
<seg id=762>We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=763>(The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=764>On behalf of Parliament, I immediately sent to the chairman, Mr Thomas Klestil, as well as the Chancellor, Mr Wolfgang Schüssel, the messages of condolence and solidarity in the test such a tragedy calls in respect of the victims, their families and the whole of the Austrian people.</seg>
<seg id=765>Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg id=766>I support the proposal of Mr Ceyhun and I should be very grateful to the Council if he could inform us whether it intends to submit a new proposal on this matter.</seg>
<seg id=767>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group considers this incident of such importance that we believe that it would not be treated as part of the topical and urgent debate.</seg>
<seg id=768>I have the feeling that you join the motivation, Mr Barón Crespo, if I understood you correctly.</seg>
<seg id=769>Madam President, some time ago, we discussed in this House on the issue of sanctions against Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=770>It is urgent that we have a debate on this subject before the entry into force of the amendments proposed by the British authorities; the Commission must also make it clear that it is in the right in this respect.</seg>
<seg id=771>(A5-0314 / 2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the adoption of a Convention to improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, particularly in the field of the fight against organised crime, the laundering of product of crime and crime in financial matters (10213 / 2000 - C5 ­ 0394 / 2000 - 2000 / 0815 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=772>The statements must be followed up by practical actions to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.</seg>
<seg id=773>The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot remain in the hands of an agency specialised placed under the sole control of the national governments.</seg>
<seg id=774>On the other hand, Article 8 of the draft convention limited solely to essential interests the grounds for refusal of assistance that could invoke Rule required.</seg>
<seg id=775>First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Marinho on his work and say how the fight against economic crime deserves not only our support, but also our vigilance.</seg>
<seg id=776>Identify, continue to condemn the laundering of dirty money terrorists and smugglers of arms and drugs: yes, of course!</seg>
<seg id=777>Our task is to detect, dépister, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of organized crime.</seg>
<seg id=778>These things are to be found in the amendments and, judging from the discussions in committee, I am confident that they will be approved by Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=779>It seems to me that this set of initiatives move in a way which is likely to destroy the protection offered by Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</seg>
<seg id=780>But the reality is not as simple.</seg>
<seg id=781>To conclude, Mr President, the PPE Group supports the compromise amendment which we reached with Mrs Roure about the activities of lawyers.</seg>
<seg id=782>The second measure, the second instrument, is harmonization.</seg>
<seg id=783>Other speakers have already have welcomed this Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id=784>This was the objective of the joint meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the ECOFIN Council of 17 October.</seg>
<seg id=785>The best way to strengthen parliamentary control and judicial control over Europol, is to integrate fully the Europol Convention in the legal framework of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=786>The establishment of a provisional unit of judicial cooperation is a step in the right direction, not to which the European Parliament wants a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id=787>That is the purpose of guarantees, namely to push this aspect of freedoms.</seg>
<seg id=788>The European Parliament is the supranational body Community for the establishment of this report, and I shall therefore propose to support the merits in supporting our rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=789>It is only when the institutional model and the rules which will govern the European area of justice will be specified that the citizens and Parliament can decide on the measures that the Council is proposing.</seg>
<seg id=790>Eurojust is a logical step of this work, which aims to give the citizens a high level of safety, in an area of justice, security and freedom, stepping up the fight against all forms of serious crime organised.</seg>
<seg id=791>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must congratulate Mrs Gebhardt for the excellent report she has presented, along the lines of the decisions taken at the Council meeting in Tampere.</seg>
<seg id=792>However, as Eurojust, people talk about the coordination of national public prosecutors and judges in order to fight against all forms of serious crime - and here I agree with the approach of the rapporteur - it broadens the concept: we no longer talk only of cooperation for crimes purely transnational, there is also talk of cooperation for the suppression of criminal activity.</seg>
<seg id=793>We will have the opportunity to commit ourselves in the provisional unit, from 1 January 2001, but the Commission wants to support the debate on what should be the definitive Eurojust unit.</seg>
<seg id=794>On both sides, there have been taken to stand frank - it seems to me - which have not yet led to the opposition inflexible.</seg>
<seg id=795>The problems which have arisen at the level of expenditure have not too worried; other areas were far more worrying.</seg>
<seg id=796>It is unacceptable that we do not have a clear objectives and we cannot measure the results; this does not happen in any other institution.</seg>
<seg id=797>A second point, Commissioner: as regards the hierarchy in terms of competence of ordonnancement of overlapping, really intolerable have been observed.</seg>
<seg id=798>I want to stress this, he has played a positive role in a number of problems.</seg>
<seg id=799>It is obvious that this work in consortium does not set a duality in the joint financial responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=800>Therefore, we really have worked for the recovery of 3.4 million, and we can say that we have achieved more than 90%.</seg>
<seg id=801>Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg id=802>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of nine months of work and a long research of this compromise, so the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=803>Even though it merely today to say 'yes' to this Charter, I hope that this Parliament will leave no doubt, in the coming weeks, on the fact that it requires the Council that this Charter legally binding and that the latter should guarantee citizens' access to the European Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id=804>This position joined, you know, one taken by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Biarritz themselves, which were approved unanimously and without reservation the Charter, and I can therefore only urge you, on behalf of the Council, to follow this position, perhaps in you by saying a few reasons.</seg>
<seg id=805>But it is above all by force of the content of the Charter, I am sure, a landmark.</seg>
<seg id=806>For its part, the European Trade Union Confederation has been complaining of what it considers to be the shortcomings, the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum wage for example.</seg>
<seg id=807>The fact remains that several personalities, and especially the members of the European Parliament, have proposed that an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights inserted Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which has already referred to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=808>Our group has approved the Charter to unanimously, except for the British delegation.</seg>
<seg id=809>As the European People 's Party, we are unanimously favourable as quickly as possible to the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties, so that it has the force of law immediately for the citizens of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=810>They have shown that could be work on European issues in a new and exemplary, superior to that of the Intergovernmental Conference, because it gives to work a openness and democratic, enabling citizens to fully exercise their right of scrutiny and to take part.</seg>
<seg id=811>The right to health, to social security, housing or the minimum income are non-existent or only in the order of solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=812>Fourthly, and this is particularly important to me, the Charter based on the principle of the indivisibility of civil and political rights, on the one hand and social rights, on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id=813>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this Charter is simply the umpteenth demonstration of the capacity of the Union and of our Member States to increase the texts empty, declarations of intent.</seg>
<seg id=814>The Commission's representative in the Convention of Turin has added to the document a legal scope.</seg>
<seg id=815>After a time market, the moment Europe's rights is perhaps finally arrived. The concept of citizenship in the European Union is a relatively new concept.</seg>
<seg id=816>The Charter is indeed drafted as a text that can be a binding.</seg>
<seg id=817>I also note with pride that a representative of the group I belong to the Finnish Parliament, Mr Gunnar jansson, has played a very important role when drawing up this Charter.</seg>
<seg id=818>As I said yesterday evening - I repeat - today, there are too many shortcomings in this area, everywhere in the Union, and, sometimes, emportés by our desire to develop judicial and police cooperation, we neglect the importance of ensuring that the innocent do not become the passive victims, the collateral damage of the war against crime.</seg>
<seg id=819>Madam President, the European Parliament's draft resolution on the Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the same ambiguity that the work of the House.</seg>
<seg id=820>The Italian Constitution provides for example the limit of good practice; the Convention provides the limit of the rights of others, of public order.</seg>
<seg id=821>Mr President, today, in the vote will take place at 12 noon, we put an end to a process that began in 1984, when the European Parliament has approved the draft Treaty of European Union, which already appeared the demand for a declaration of rights, process that we have pursued in 1989 with the resolution of Mr De Gucht.</seg>
<seg id=822>The Charter will produce effects. it will happen, it is or not in the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=823>It is to be welcomed and not to fear, as seems to think Mr Bonde.</seg>
<seg id=824>It seems that all the struggles for the emancipation of disadvantaged classes century which ends have been pointless and do we have learned nothing.</seg>
<seg id=825>The Charter fills a gap in the law of this, it reinforces the protection of individuals against the damage that they could be the subject of the European police authorities, who shall counter fraud and those responsible for monitoring the competition.</seg>
<seg id=826>I do not understand those who oppose the Charter on the grounds that it does not contain everything they would like to see included.</seg>
<seg id=827>Mr President, I shall continue in the same lines, that Mr Gahrton.</seg>
<seg id=828>I would like to make a third comment about the rights of third-country nationals.</seg>
<seg id=829>As the Court of Human Rights, the Council of Europe has also a solid experience regarding such forms of control; we can take to basis.</seg>
<seg id=830>In view of the text of the Charter we are going to adopt, by a large majority, I hope - today, it is clear that we will achieve a protection of fundamental rights more and more important than the current would have allowed entry to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=831>That is why it is necessary to make further step forward.</seg>
<seg id=832>This is essential if we want to win the support of the European people with regard to the Charter.</seg>
<seg id=833>After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be my grid analysis for this report and, as far as my personal power, intellectual and the ways in which employees to be given to permit, I shall make an analysis law by law, country by country of respect for the Charter in the fifteen countries of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=834>Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to be associated with the words of Mr Moscovici, and welcome the contribution that the Members of the European Parliament have given to the debate, to the Convention, in particular the role that Mr Mendes de Vigo has played in the Praesidium of the Convention for the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=835>I will mention just some of the salient points of this debate.</seg>
<seg id=836>The Convention chose to enshrine fundamental rights inspired the various instruments of the Council of Europe, the Treaties and the constitutions of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=837>The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:</seg>
<seg id=838>As things stand, it is up to Parliament to tell the Turkish people that there are now three conditions to its accession.</seg>
<seg id=839>Furthermore, it would not have been possible to set up conditions only by a decision of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=840>That is why I have taken note of the suggestions made by Mr Morillon on the conditions for the accession of Turkey and they deserve the greatest interest.</seg>
<seg id=841>I am pleased to say that, in the meantime, the Turkish Government has accepted that partnership as a basis for future cooperation, which gives us hope to achieve our aims, in other words, by helping our policy, the reform-minded forces in Turkey, to give fresh impetus to the process of reform and the move towards membership sought to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=842>In my view, the key element is that Helsinki unleashed in Turkey, in the Turkish public opinion, a debate on the conditions for the accession of Turkey to the EU and that this debate supports and encourages the reform-minded forces in the country.</seg>
<seg id=843>This text before you to comment.</seg>
<seg id=844>What is meant to do now is to give an impetus within the framework of a future accession.</seg>
<seg id=845>I do not know how we will proceed to the vote but I would urge Turkey to deal with this issue seriously.</seg>
<seg id=846>The European Parliament will play its role in the promotion of relations with the political parties, NGOs and the press, as well as in the development of its complex and sometimes tense relationship with the Grand National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id=847>Mr Morillon, your report is, in my view, all did realistic and responsible.</seg>
<seg id=848>On the occasion of your visit to Turkey in March, as today, you have at least specifically mentioned the problem of the Kurdish people.</seg>
<seg id=849>There is both a great naivety and a large enough to consider that Europeans will get the Turks, and I quote: 'to a radical change of habits and their mentality'.</seg>
<seg id=850>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us éveille in me of serious concern.</seg>
<seg id=851>Recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the approval of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487 / 1 / 00 - C5-0570 / 2000 - 2000 / 2233 (AVC))</seg>
<seg id=852>In any event, we must, the next time that we discuss the power computer, we realise that we need a monitoring broader and therefore more capable of respecting human dignity.</seg>
<seg id=853>Recommendation Duff / Voggenhuber (A5-0325 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=854>As an indicative, include:</seg>
<seg id=855>The rights contained in the Charter are already included in the national constitutions and defended by the national parliaments closer to the people and their cultures.</seg>
<seg id=856>For example, the 19 to Article 1, which stipulate that: 'the collective expulsions are prohibited', does not specify that this ban can be suspended in the event of war or serious disruption to the public order.</seg>
<seg id=857>We give a brief explanation of these three objections in the order.</seg>
<seg id=858>The right to a government to remove arbitrarily its Constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny.</seg>
<seg id=859>However, I repeat today, we have every reason to be proud of the conditions under which we have taken this important step for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=860>A society without knowing that rights, but not of duties, becomes a society selfish.</seg>
<seg id=861>This is our struggle for priority that the affirmation of fundamental rights to be implemented in political choices.</seg>
<seg id=862>As the Convention method is interesting and fruitful in order to establish a basic text, seeking a broad compromise, so that there is no justification for denying Parliament incarnant, representing the peoples of Europe, the possibility of amending, to enrich the text.</seg>
<seg id=863>This Charter must be improved and our Parliament should propose a strategy for its updating and its enrichment.</seg>
<seg id=864>Therefore, it should not be adopted and proclaimed at the Council meeting in Nice, this summit should instead initiate a European debate on this Charter.</seg>
<seg id=865>Fortunately, the trend dominant national governments seem marked the stamp of common sense, i.e. the Charter to the scope of a purely political and non-binding.</seg>
<seg id=866>Created as' that 'forum' by the Cologne Summit, it has Auto proclaimed 'convention', a name which recalls fâcheusement 1793 terrorists and the excesses of the French Revolution implemented by another Convention.</seg>
<seg id=867>However, the method which has been used, which have been made and the exclusion of the ambiguity surrounding the nature of this text cast a light enough raw on new ferments totalitarian which are at the heart of the process of European integration.</seg>
<seg id=868>Fortunately, the European Parliament has not even in this field that an advisory role, in anticipation of the full application of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but it is the way to play in the wrong direction, in freinant the right decisions.</seg>
<seg id=869>As to how to proceed, opinions differ.</seg>
<seg id=870>In fact, there was thus a century ago, before and after it has been somewhat limited, this right is now a return to power.</seg>
<seg id=871>The last thing we want is that the single market to allow criminals to introduce it by the back door.</seg>
<seg id=872>We also support the future creation of a Convention facilitating the fight against organised crime and money laundering, as well as the various measures for that purpose.</seg>
<seg id=873>Indeed, it creates a provisional unit consisting of representatives of the judges and police officers who carry out activities of a judge in our fifteen Member States.</seg>
<seg id=874>Mr President, as a member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I am very concerned about the prospect of accession of Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=875>The attitude of Turkey on the Cyprus problem is also unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=876>However, we agree with the criticism of the rapporteur, who believes that it is, at present, an effective evaluation of the results of the EIB ’ s lending activity, and that there are also serious shortcomings in terms of the right of scrutiny of public and democratic control of the activities of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id=877>Turkey, in spite of its entire difference, has always belonged and is still a full to the European reality.</seg>
<seg id=878>Turkey's accession to the European Union has become a matter more than ever on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=879>Mr Morillon says that Turkey should endeavour not to see the European Union as a "Christian Club exclusive ', which would exclude it, Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=880>Turkey accédera genuinely to democracy, when it apprendra to live with its past, such as Germany democratic taught to live with his work, and also, as we have asked them.</seg>
<seg id=881>Given that the authorities in Ankara will have understood that the status quo is unacceptable for Europe and the rest of the world, progress can be made: the island can be reunited and a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement in accordance with international law will be made tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id=882>In fact, why is it remains absent from the report of the European Commission?</seg>
<seg id=883>It is in this context that we have balanced press on our action to further the rapprochement between the Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=884>If you treat the Armenian issue in connection with accession to the EU - I would ask you to pay attention to what I said: treating the Armenian issue in connection with EU membership, the project which we have discussed today does not démarrera. It is as simple as that.</seg>
<seg id=885>Moreover, this is also the reason for our insistence that a balance sheet is drawn up for the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, so that in Marseilles, rightly, we are able to stop the necessary guidelines.</seg>
<seg id=886>However, we have managed to maintain the dialogue and sometimes sensitive subjects: stability, terrorism, emigration, human rights, for example.</seg>
<seg id=887>The fact remains that the Council has tried, in particular since 1995, to give the Mediterranean of means more important, to the extent of the challenges of the partnership.</seg>
<seg id=888>Indeed it is - and I would also like to say this as someone from Central Europe - an extremely important issue.</seg>
<seg id=889>Mr President, as you know, there is a saying in English which says that when a vedette does not appear in a spectacle, it seems to be a representation from Hamlet without Prime fossoyeur.</seg>
<seg id=890>We want to see fulfilled the political issues relating to the single market and to reach an agreement to introduce the cumulative origin, alongside sub regional free-trade agreements for all partners are engaging in this direction and adopting the harmonised protocol on the rules of origin.</seg>
<seg id=891>We hear with great satisfaction that the Commission intends to give new impetus to the Barcelona process.</seg>
<seg id=892>I stressed these aspects because that is where we must find the key to the relaunch of the process and that we must add to this the enrichment of the political agenda of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id=893>Therefore, our priority must be to guarantee peace and security in the European Union in the Mediterranean and we must make every possible effort on behalf of this cooperation and ensure that the funds committed to be effectively implemented, in accordance with the - let us say - selfish generosity of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=894>These are important issues and concrete that I would like to ask, and I thank Mr Brok for allowing this debate before the Presidency and the Commission be able to discuss these issues.</seg>
<seg id=895>The world is moving in the direction of a globalisation now inevitable. In this context, it is necessary to hold in large blocs acting as players in the broader landscape of global competition.</seg>
<seg id=896>It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries have requested that a quarter of the appropriations of the MEDA I programme comes to an end in 1999 and which was the allocation of 4.7 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id=897>In this sense, the proposal for a new impetus on the part of the Commission is positive and we agree entirely with the two priorities that Mr Patten has emphasized in her speeches and repeated this afternoon in this House.</seg>
<seg id=898>This is a warning to the European Union plays a much more active role in the Mediterranean region, which historically and culturally, has contributed to the wealth and the size of our continent.</seg>
<seg id=899>But worse still, at the very time in this Chamber calmly we exchange of views sometimes very divergent, increasingly of Palestinians are being slaughtered.</seg>
<seg id=900>Aid for reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=901>If we do not, however, in December, the means to implement this regulation, this means that the debate we are holding today concerns an empty shell.</seg>
<seg id=902>This is often too bureaucratic and is often by procedures are too complicated, but we must not and do not want to turn a blind eye, and I hope that Member States do not do so either, on the role that they have played in this respect.</seg>
<seg id=903>The media in this region have often been responsible for the tragedy that has suffered; they must be free to work in accordance with the rules in force in our democracies.</seg>
<seg id=904>But I am also pleased, because I believe that Parliament has managed, through a uninterrupted pressure, to bring a successful outcome to a situation which was not particularly pleasing initially.</seg>
<seg id=905>I repeat: we really must avoid unnecessary to spend the money in meetings unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id=906>However, we must not focus solely on the Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id=907>I also regret that a number of programmes have been put in the performance reserve, the reservation of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id=908>In Feira, it has recognised the quality of potential candidates for accession to the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process.</seg>
<seg id=909>I recall the main priorities assigned the CARDS programme: the institutional strengthening in the sense of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction, regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=910>The European Union was right to react positively to the accession of President Kostunica to power.</seg>
<seg id=911>A first examination took place on 6 November.</seg>
<seg id=912>As the European Parliament has called for in its resolution of 16 March 2000, they initiatives European Council Presidency intend to take to play a more active role in order to ensure the full implementation of the UN peace plan?</seg>
<seg id=913>How can we achieve this recovery without regulation of this conflict?</seg>
<seg id=914>I can simply say that France and Germany - and here I speak not more as President-in-Office of the Council - have raised these issues during a bilateral summit to vittel, last week, and it was decided to set up a working group in order to remedy the problem.</seg>
<seg id=915>At the same time, the European Union continues to provide material support to these two important countries, through its various programmes, including TACIS.</seg>
<seg id=916>The honourable Member's question gives therefore to the Presidency the opportunity to dispel some confusion.</seg>
<seg id=917>And let me add a further point: it is particularly in these two texts, strengthening of the penal framework to combat organized networks of smugglers.</seg>
<seg id=918>In the report that the Council of Ministers Turkish adopted on 21 September as programme of reform, appear in the part of several projects: legislative changes within the civil code measures strengthening effective equality of men and women in areas socio educational: better combat violent family; better condemn these acts of violence, by creating specialist judges family and finally ban the possibility of a reduction of only for crimes of honour.</seg>
<seg id=919>Therefore, the Presidency does not provide an answer to this point.</seg>
<seg id=920>Next week, there will be a meeting of the European Conference, to my invitation, in France, i.e. with the applicant countries.</seg>
<seg id=921>Do you think the Austrian model '' - namely the bilateral majority decision-making - will in future an instrument to take decisions by ignoring the European institutions and to set up a new institution, or a new group, in order to get round the unanimity rule in the Council?</seg>
<seg id=922>The Council has not received the letter but the Presidency has, of course, replied to Mr Cem. the terms of this response has been communicated to all the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=923>What is it, Mr President-in-Office of the Council sees it the position of Mr Cem - Mr Moscovici did not reply to this - which claims that it is not possible to do justice to the Cyprus question, if one wants to promote the partnership between Turkey and the European Union?</seg>
<seg id=924>We must be aware that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is more than just a simple fisheries agreement and, as he knows, if we were to reach such an agreement, and all that that implies, that could have hide a deterioration in relations between the European Union and Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=925>And that is why I would like to express my scepticism about the outcome.</seg>
<seg id=926>With regard to the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal cases, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that this principle should enable the strengthening of cooperation in the Member States, but also the protection of the rights of individuals.</seg>
<seg id=927>The supplementary questions must be made by other Members.</seg>
<seg id=928>Furthermore, the Commission, in the communication it has adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union's oil supply, indicates that it intends to present, the European Council in Gothenburg, a plan for energy savings and the diversification of energy sources which should help to improve energy efficiency, particularly in buildings and transport.</seg>
<seg id=929>In this spirit, we have launched, with the vote on the resolution on the embargo, in the context of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on 9 November, an appeal to the Cuban authorities that they cooperate fully with the international bodies who defend human rights.</seg>
<seg id=930>It therefore falls to NATO to take the measures which it will judge necessary such facts cannot be repeated.</seg>
<seg id=931>(The sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=932>When we talk about money, who give money have in fact privilege to clearly define the political objectives, and that is what the Commissioner has always done.</seg>
<seg id=933>This presence, in principle, can open up new prospects for the whole of the policy we are pursuing.</seg>
<seg id=934>If we consider the region as a region of political antagonisms in power, we shall wrong.</seg>
<seg id=935>Parliament must be consulted and informed regularly; that is the second request of rapporteurs, request that we should all support.</seg>
<seg id=936>The Heads of Government have also confirmed the Union's determination to support this process by means of a technical and economic assistance.</seg>
<seg id=937>It is Parliament that is supporting the Commission's proposal to create a European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=938>As the House will know, we do not think it is necessary to provide an explicit reference to this issue in the regulation.</seg>
<seg id=939>The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=940>Leaders agreed to extend and to update the framework of cooperation Asian Euro 2000, which is the work programme for the next ten years.</seg>
<seg id=941>I think that this reminds us, in Europe, the important role that we play in Asia and this, not only in the field of the economy and trade, yet we should say that one of the reasons the restoration of Asia is the fact that we have to keep our pledge our markets open to Asian exports over the last two years.</seg>
<seg id=942>I think it was a very good political statement, but we still have a few problems to be resolved.</seg>
<seg id=943>We know that the Commission considers the ASEM very seriously, and we support it truly in this attitude.</seg>
<seg id=944>It is necessary to improve the existing mechanisms at the level of the transposition of Community law in order to increase legal certainty and to overcome the current slow.</seg>
<seg id=945>It ought therefore to encourage the creation of new regional organisations, starting with where there is already a Community presence, as is the case in the Western Pacific and the South Pacific.</seg>
<seg id=946>This will be vital for the sustainability of fishing.</seg>
<seg id=947>I think that the future of fishing in international waters dependent on these organisations and the overall efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, boil down to little. to uphold the position of the United Nations, both in the Convention of 1982 that in those of New York, which has been mentioned here, our presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing must be very active.</seg>
<seg id=948>That is why I believe that the Commission can play a leading role by going on the spot and to encourage fishermen to cooperate with it and to propose a solution with which we can unite us all.</seg>
<seg id=949>Moreover, the Commission should take a number of tasks in the field of negotiations which must be conducted in the context of the RFOs.</seg>
<seg id=950>Mr President, I meet the same problem that Mr Nicholson, but in a form still more acute.</seg>
<seg id=951>Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the solutions advocated by the Committee on Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=952>Sometimes, we come to ask ourselves whether the crisis cyclical market is not, to a certain extent, the result of the action speculative desdites of corporate structures, which provide for the control of the sector according to their interests.</seg>
<seg id=953>The supplementary aid for EU proposed by Mr Garot in his report is, in my view, contrary to the common sense in these years of Agenda 2000, of enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe and the reform of agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=954>I think it is quite remarkable that the rapporteur has shown here what can be done with a bit of administration when pursuing a project, which is clearly defined in the report.</seg>
<seg id=955>On the one hand, the biggest producers or those who are to be integrated with industry downstream tiendraient left out of this system, preferring systems they have already: individual savings, poised banking, premiums of equalisation.</seg>
<seg id=956>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to start by saying that, basically, and account of agriculture Austrian favourably, I welcome the Commission proposal to set up a fund for regulating.</seg>
<seg id=957>I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report.</seg>
<seg id=958>I understand that you want to a common organisation of the market in the sector of intensive farming and a dismantling of agricultural policy in that it is connected to the territory, where there is production connected to the territory.</seg>
<seg id=959>There is already a market organization in beef and pork, and we must not make the mistake of questioning while, basically, it works well.</seg>
<seg id=960>According to the Commission, it is right not to submit to a discipline that farmers participating in the Fund regulation, because they are receiving in exchange for a certain amount of guaranteed income, while those who do not participate in the funds do not receive this guarantee.</seg>
<seg id=961>(The sitting was closed at 10 a.m. p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=962>The resources from the value added tax represent 36% and traditional own resources 15%.</seg>
<seg id=963>Another element of the reform is also closely linked to a priority identified by the Court is of the increased importance to grant the assessment of results and performance within the framework of a distribution of resources which responds to the predetermined priorities and to clearly defined objectives and measurable.</seg>
<seg id=964>It is good and I would like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, as well as the members of the Court of Auditors and the services of the Court of Auditors, to support the reform of the Commission with this report.</seg>
<seg id=965>In this connection, it is also of circumstances that I inform you that, for the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we have proposed to amend the Treaty so that we can create a European Public Prosecutor to pursue the fraud affecting the financial interests of the Community. I truly hope that this proposal will not be simply actée at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice or there under the carpet, but that the deal seriously.</seg>
<seg id=966>The true described in the annual report is rather disappointing.</seg>
<seg id=967>The number of errors is too high for giving such a guarantee.</seg>
<seg id=968>The amount intended for the activities of equipment 240 million is too low.</seg>
<seg id=969>I would also have liked the report of the Court of Auditors fusse somewhat more user-friendly and he seen tabled a few clear recommendations - for example, one or two recommendations by chapter.</seg>
<seg id=970>A Convention on the protection of the financial interests of the EU was adopted in 1995.</seg>
<seg id=971>The Commission and the Member States should grasp the in this direction and exploit its conclusions in order to strengthen the effectiveness of their methods of management of EU finances.</seg>
<seg id=972>I know that this report and the work that Parliament is about to start in the context of the discharge procedure will contribute to greater vigilance with regard to Community expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=973>At the moment, I would like to keep quiet, Madam President, and expect that a Member of the Council comes here.</seg>
<seg id=974>As in previous years, the Court is not come to identify exactly the omissions.</seg>
<seg id=975>Madam President, enlargement of the European Union approach and the Court of Auditors' report clearly shows that there is still a great deal of work to do, even in the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=976>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have recently concluded an agreement with the Court of Auditors, which was to obtain in advance information on the report of the Court and to keep quiet about it.</seg>
<seg id=977>I would also like 'harassing "the Council and to ask him why the situation is not moving on Article 24 of the financial regulation.</seg>
<seg id=978>Perhaps that a bit of common sense European will solve the problem and to give George Bush the place it deserves in history - the dustbin!</seg>
<seg id=979>We do not have to look for scapegoats, nor in our institutions and in our Member States.</seg>
<seg id=980>Above all, on the procedure for the presentation of the annual report to Parliament and to the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am pleased to hear that Members who believe that the situation is this year is more satisfactory than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id=981>In any case, we will have the opportunity to examine everything.</seg>
<seg id=982>When the audit justifies the, we mention everything that must be.</seg>
<seg id=983>Ladies and gentlemen, as you have noticed, the last part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors has been the victim of a virus, which is unfortunate interposé between his speech and this House.</seg>
<seg id=984>Some amendments, such as Amendments Nos 1 and 18, relate to issues of interest to fundamentally the United Kingdom and it must be said that all groups in the United Kingdom, that they are Socialists, Greens, the popular or have defended with great vehemence and they were approved by the Committee on the Environment.</seg>
<seg id=985>Mr President, in March of this year, we adopted the directive on funiculaires for the transport of passengers.</seg>
<seg id=986>We believe that, in this case, the manufacturer of the obligations arising from the law on the safety of products should not burden the trade.</seg>
<seg id=987>We have heard the justification for them and for the resumption of arguments industrial listed in committee.</seg>
<seg id=988>The time that the seller is in a position to inform whenever the buyer of nature of goods and reservations about the information; this should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id=989>Finally, I have one small thing to ask the European Commission regarding Article 4 relating to European standards and the question as to whether these standards must be published.</seg>
<seg id=990>I am therefore pleased that the exceptions are made for the charity shops and non-profit-making organisations, as well as for second-hand goods sold markets or within the framework of sales of private individuals.</seg>
<seg id=991>The reliability of the safety of products and assistance after sales represent an added value for the European label at a particularly difficult and crucial.</seg>
<seg id=992>If we also call on the Commission to submit a proposal in the near future on the safety of services, one cannot see why we should and would regulate here and now the aspects relating to services, rather than to wait for the Commission's proposal because we can already foresee that difficulties of demarcation of different rules arise and that legal insecurity will increase over time.</seg>
<seg id=993>Just a few words about the main aspects of this proposal.</seg>
<seg id=994>We offer to the possibility of opening the system to third countries, especially those applicant countries: simplifying the procedures for emergency measures at Community level in order to be able to provide a rapid reaction on Council of a regulatory committee.</seg>
<seg id=995>This new requirement not involve any significant additional liability in the case of this type of shops.</seg>
<seg id=996>Replacing the term 'producer' by the word 'supplier', as proposed in Amendment No 11, générerait more confusion than clarity, since the directive gives no definition of the word 'supplier'.</seg>
<seg id=997>Although the Commission is in favour of a rapid implementation of the network, the procedures must be discussed between Member States.</seg>
<seg id=998>Such certification can always be the proof but cannot be regarded as intrinsically reliable.</seg>
<seg id=999>Having explained in detail why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first parts of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31, 35 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, given that these amendments are an improvement and clarification of the Commission proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1000>Of course, for Mr Barón Crespo, an Italian Socialist cannot be part of the European Socialist Group.</seg>
<seg id=1001>In my view, there is no contradiction between Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37.</seg>
<seg id=1002>With regard to the agenda, I shall leave it to the President to decide and I would remind you that I am against, in any case, on each of the three amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1003>Mediterranean countries outside the EU are, it is true, with problems particularly acute economic development there is a constant tension caused inequalities between the regions.</seg>
<seg id=1004>With regard to respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, in the spirit of a harmonised European policy on immigration, in addition to the legal instruments designed to guarantee them equal treatment, we must create instruments of financial aid for all those young people who, having completed a round of studies, higher or university, in European countries, désireraient return to their countries of origin to begin a professional activity.</seg>
<seg id=1005>I should like to highlight one factor, that I consider it crucial to tackle this problem. I am referring to the inequality in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=1006>Albeit belatedly, the Commission has presented a programme on Community framework strategy for equality between men and women (2001-2005), which differ very much earlier programmes, specifically the fourth action programme, which ends at the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id=1007>Despite these reservations, I voted for this report, firstly because it was taken account of many of the amendments of my group and, secondly, because this report calls for the studies on the position of women on the national labour markets as well as on the inadequate access to social security systems, two problems for which we need, of relevant statistics broken down by sex.</seg>
<seg id=1008>My Party expresses serious reservations about the regulation of the sale of consumer goods by means of Community legislation, as it makes reservations about the concept of mutual recognition of standards.</seg>
<seg id=1009>This misunderstanding is now dissipé, and Amendments Nos labour offer a guarantee not to touch of charity shops and to see them excluded from the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1010>Finally, Amendment No 15 gives them a free hand to the Commission for the language regime of the Agency, what we consider a very worrying.</seg>
<seg id=1011>The simplification of the procedure of decision-making, the creation of operational centres decentralised (and not only in Pristina, which is equivalent to the separate of Yugoslavia) and the management of its dual structure between the management board and the Commission may be positive actions to combat the considerable bureaucratic shortcomings of the European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=1012>We shall therefore be voting against the Commission proposal and against the report of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1013>An adaptation of the existing Community legislation in this field can therefore be seen as justified.</seg>
<seg id=1014>Moreover, the funds cofinanced by the Member States allowed to grant State aid for more or less hidden.</seg>
<seg id=1015>Despite its serious shortcomings, the Morillon report obviously goes further than the Commission proposal on the partnership between the European Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1016>We, we voted against.</seg>
<seg id=1017>Has, like the rapporteur, we must recognise that Turkey has made progress on some plans and positive signals that exist.</seg>
<seg id=1018>Since 1987, our House has itself is committed to the path of recognition, and the adoption of this amendment shows the coherence of Parliament in this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1019>The Union must do more to devise proposals and the accession of Turkey as an essential geopolitical strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1020>Such ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and the unworthy of Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1021>For several years, as a member of the delegation for relations with Canada, I have seen the operation of one of these regional organisations, the Fisheries Organisation (NAFO, the Atlantic north-west), involving the countries in this region, including Canada, as well as all those who use in this place areas of traditional fishing, including France, Spain and some other European countries.</seg>
<seg id=1022>It will only be satisfied that when its own fleet of canonnières, European flag, will uphold its policy on fisheries.</seg>
<seg id=1023>The important thing is not to satisfy the desire of the hegemony of the Commission, weakening the position of Europe, which would be completely at odds with a correct application of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=1024>Finally, after a tough negotiations, we reached a final result that it is worth defending.</seg>
<seg id=1025>Thus, this proposal, which aims to replace three directives on waste incineration, aim to improve air quality, water, soil, the health of people, by reducing emissions of pollutants and activities of incineration and co-incineration and, in particular, of dioxins and furanes of heavy metals.</seg>
<seg id=1026>But I think it should also be pointed out - and this is new - that there is no longer just a matter of emissions of these substances in the air; that also applies to the emission in water and the soil.</seg>
<seg id=1027>The proposal has been improved during the various examinations.</seg>
<seg id=1028>The introduction of stricter limit on nitrogen oxide for new installations such as the co-incineration in cement kilns represents both a step and an incentive for reducing emissions, even though the proposed standards do not reflect best available techniques.</seg>
<seg id=1029>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry - in particular Mr Blokland, for a few minutes late.</seg>
<seg id=1030>In conclusion, this directive represents a major contribution to reducing the negative effects on the environment and the risks that they represent to human health.</seg>
<seg id=1031>The European Parliament will honor, on behalf of the refusal of the fight against discrimination and exclusion, and in accordance with the responsibilities of all, to give a strong impetus for the establishment of a mechanism which will enable us to be the actual principle of solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=1032>However, there are major differences from one country to another; we lack however detailed and comparable statistical data, which would allow us to draw up a rule of reliable, to assess the situation in which countries are more efficient systems, and how, what are their weaknesses etc., that is exactly why my opinion, which was drawn up at the request of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, emphasises that it is necessary, before a few general value to introduce rules that, in terms of supplementary sickness insurance, the Commission to publish a Green Paper together all these data dispersed, which will have been addressed, and that the relevant information.</seg>
<seg id=1033>To date, they were the subject of a certain taboo.</seg>
<seg id=1034>The risk of citizens in less healthy and that older people can full access to a private insurance because of the high risk they represent is unacceptable for the development of our society.</seg>
<seg id=1035>The other point of view, illustrated by the example of the original rapporteur and shared by many colleagues, is to promote the regulations and codes of conduct needed to create, between insurers, the forms of mutual costs guaranteeing to all the provision of high-quality care and to counter the risk of seeing develop discriminatory practices and a risk selection and customers.</seg>
<seg id=1036>I do not think it is quite right that money that determines the turn of passage in a queue waiting.</seg>
<seg id=1037>The new proposal from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which is to draw up an inventory first in the form of a Green Paper and subsequently to decide whether we need a directive or a recommendation, we think is right.</seg>
<seg id=1038>A debate is currently underway in the Netherlands about structural changes of the system.</seg>
<seg id=1039>On this basis, it is up to the Commission to take an initiative and to articulate the key points which will serve to concrete guidelines for the health systems of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1040>It is therefore impossible to envisage a 'one-size-fits-all' solution to the problem of insurance disease.</seg>
<seg id=1041>That is why I believe we must focus on the content of Mr Rocard's report - which we welcome -, which requires the Commission to the provision of a service, the drafting of a Green Paper, which will enable us to know what the current state of insurance in the Member States and also look to the future.</seg>
<seg id=1042>The two systems are based on a model tripode comprising the State, the company and the private sector.</seg>
<seg id=1043>The European Union has already made a specific regulations in the field of supplementary pensions.</seg>
<seg id=1044>Mr President, I would like to thank and congratulate Mr Rocard on his report and congratulate Mr Marinho for the opinion of its Committee.</seg>
<seg id=1045>This study will be the basis of a Commission communication to the Council and Parliament with initiatives or measures.</seg>
<seg id=1046>As far as the amendments of the Committee on Budgets, I can say with satisfaction that they have all been accepted.</seg>
<seg id=1047>We have supported the characteristics of the programme, as the multi-dimensional approach of the phenomenon, measures in the field of health, education, housing, cohesion and complementarity with other policies, as well as the participation of non-governmental organisations, but also the very people who are suffering from social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1048>This means that we must take advantage of bottom-up phases round to return to a situation of balance or surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1049>I would remind you in this respect that the last Ecofin Council asked the Commission to that assessment of the stability programmes once again next year precisely this aspect of long-term public finances on the ageing of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1050>One of the characteristics of positive programme of the Netherlands is the special attention being paid - as I said earlier - to the impact of the ageing of the population on the Treasury in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id=1051>Therefore, in the case of Germany, the result budget for the year 2000 will cause a surplus of 1.5% of gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg id=1052>If we add to this the evolution of the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, we have a significant negative impact in terms of inflation.</seg>
<seg id=1053>On the other hand, they aim to compatibility with a system of public distribution systems of private capitalisation and, of course, they are also compatible with the support for the creation of specific investment funds likely to provide tax breaks for long-term and help to tackle the problem of ageing.</seg>
<seg id=1054>It is therefore the third principle which guides us: the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg id=1055>We must point out that several regulatory proposals are currently under discussion, which will contribute to increase the effectiveness and the relevance of the Community system and, therefore, I hope, the consumer confidence.</seg>
<seg id=1056>However, this does not justify relatively low incidence convenience.</seg>
<seg id=1057>Frankly, I was disappointed that Prime Minister Jospin does not mention the very positive role played by the Community in recent years in his speech yesterday.</seg>
<seg id=1058>We must clearly define the reasons for the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1059>The Commission's Food and Veterinary Office already attaches the highest priority to the control of Member States in relation to safeguard measures against BSE.</seg>
<seg id=1060>As regards the security of meat-and-bone meal, let me remind you that there is already a wide range of controls to ensure that such meal do not present a risk of transmission of BSE.</seg>
<seg id=1061>Yes, as hard to believe that this may be, it took four years to get a measure that I consider it essential for the protection of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1062>Mr President-in-Office, I urge the Council to finally make known its position on the regulation is.</seg>
<seg id=1063>In the present situation, the only way to stop the cycle of transmission of BSE is totally to ban the use of animal meal.</seg>
<seg id=1064>In this connection, I would like to point out that the liberal group to which I belong has tabled an amendment which I hope to see.</seg>
<seg id=1065>The political need to change this, to ensure that the real guilty of this crisis penalised and that specific decisions provide a first step towards the end of this dramatic crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1066>We should therefore be looking.</seg>
<seg id=1067>The labelling of beef which has been decided, which is a minimum and labelling which is in force for two and a half months, does not properly to trace the origin of the animals and we have banned quite late specified risk materials.</seg>
<seg id=1068>It is necessary that the public is fully informed about the characteristics of the test which I speak.</seg>
<seg id=1069>At the time, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have not done anything or almost similar, as you have done nothing about the consequences of Chernobyl, nothing about the spread of AIDS, nothing about the contaminated blood, always with the same reason: not panic among the public.</seg>
<seg id=1070>The prohibition of France will cause a huge increase in demand, but the offer is not unlimited and prices will suffer an extraordinarily heavy pressure.</seg>
<seg id=1071>Consumers have lost confidence, and to contain this phenomenon, we must make the tests on BSE in cattle and sheep.</seg>
<seg id=1072>It seems more important to go in the direction of the Commission proposal, namely to ensure that meat and bone meal meet the highest safety standards.</seg>
<seg id=1073>For the rest, I totally agree - just this once - with what my fellow Members, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs Grossetête, have said.</seg>
<seg id=1074>We, Members of the Council and the Commission, you have a large financial basis for policy is strong.</seg>
<seg id=1075>We must find the problem.</seg>
<seg id=1076>Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased to hear here, in this Chamber, that we must at all costs to change the CAP.</seg>
<seg id=1077>As we denounced, even here, with Jimmy Goldsmith, in its time.</seg>
<seg id=1078>For food must be safe.</seg>
<seg id=1079>I find exemplary that France will be resolved to take this step.</seg>
<seg id=1080>But we do not help to do!</seg>
<seg id=1081>So I am surprised to see that the corpses are still used or processed under these conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1082>The Phillips inquiry into BSE has just been published in the UK.</seg>
<seg id=1083>I would suggest to the European Commission to apply the precautionary principle to the French beef.</seg>
<seg id=1084>We need to know today, since we are still in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what measures are to be taken.</seg>
<seg id=1085>Furthermore, I am of course all these proposals, I too am not insensitive.</seg>
<seg id=1086>If European citizens tell me that the legislation has not been properly or fully applied, we will then perhaps réenvisager the question, but not for reasons of scientific it will do so because the legislation has not been respected in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1087>The best way of not we hear; that is not to invite us.</seg>
<seg id=1088>The Commission considers that the first readmission agreements, are currently under negotiation with Russia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Morocco play an important role in the clarification and the coordination of these policies.</seg>
<seg id=1089>What proposals does the Commission on this matter on the basis of Article 31 of the European Union?</seg>
<seg id=1090>(The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=1091>During that period, the objective was to reduce the deficit in order to achieve a more appropriate monetary policy, lower interest rates and greater growth.</seg>
<seg id=1092>I always say that the euro will not be introduced on 1 January 2002, but it is already in our pockets; we have with currencies fractionnaires separate, but we have already in our pockets.</seg>
<seg id=1093>The ozone limits laid down in Directive 92 / 72 have not been superseded in the capital, but it should be noted that no measures have been taken in the middle of the summer.</seg>
<seg id=1094>Subject: State aid in the audiovisual sector at a seminar of the French Presidency devoted to cultural industries, a representative of the Directorate-General for Competition on the European Commission took the view that the legal obligations investment imposed chains constituted state aid to the very fact that these investments were made mandatory by the legislator.</seg>
<seg id=1095>It must be respected and protected ’.</seg>
<seg id=1096>However, this is not of course because this new growth is very unequal and can be accompanied, as we have seen in the United States since a ten years' time, the persistent phenomena of insecure jobs, exclusion, poverty, of ghettoisation URBAN.</seg>
<seg id=1097>The governments of the Member States refused to accept this definition, which is a little too simple and far too vague.</seg>
<seg id=1098>And in the difficult climate resulting, more and more people are no longer, are marginalised and excluded.</seg>
<seg id=1099>Mr President, we are very often in this Chamber, as a tune, the glorification of the European social model, of the social market economy, which we reject with pride - as many believe - the savage model of the United States of America.</seg>
<seg id=1100>(technical))</seg>
<seg id=1101>It is a huge figure.</seg>
<seg id=1102>Furthermore, these are all levels policies which must be involved.</seg>
<seg id=1103>I support the need for better understanding the causes of poverty, I support the preventive action against exclusion as a result of mergers, industrial change, relocations, rural depopulation, hyperconcentration urban, with the aid of innovative and concrete answers, involving the social partners, local and national authorities, as well as the joint action of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1104>We have seen a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion as well as on the role of social and structural reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1105>This is a problem formalistic due to the fact that, in the Treaty, it is only refers to the social exclusion and not to poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1106>I believe that these proposals are a pragmatic response to your request.</seg>
<seg id=1107>However, an approval of the global strategy does not necessarily mean an approval of the proposal in detail.</seg>
<seg id=1108>If we define a clear framework and binding on the Member States, the different systems to meet these requirements should have a longer period of being tested.</seg>
<seg id=1109>Renewable energy sources do not constitute a panacea for solving this problem, but no doubt that they will contribute to a large extent to the remedy, to diversify the sources of energy and to reduce our dependence on oil, which, moreover, do we not dérangerait at all.</seg>
<seg id=1110>I will now come back on three of our demands.</seg>
<seg id=1111>Define realistic targets can therefore only strengthen public confidence in the policy of energy to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id=1112>I believe that a strong policy in the field of renewable energy is a symbol for the Europe of tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id=1113>Finally, the European countries must prove through these agreements that they will contribute to achieving the Kyoto objectives.</seg>
<seg id=1114>It seems a pity excluding any category of waste which can contribute to the overall production of energy from waste - whether for projects for small-scale or within the framework of a more comprehensive calculation.</seg>
<seg id=1115>The formation of the mass of peat by photosynthèse and in the production of waste wood is comparable to that of other biomass.</seg>
<seg id=1116>Finally, I can inform Mr Chichester that off my region, there is already a project of windmills well advanced and that it is the announcement promising I invite you to come to see itself.</seg>
<seg id=1117>The debate on the abandoning nuclear energy, in Sweden and Germany, for example, has shown that, without replacement energies possible respectful of the environment and competitive, the discussion turns short. This is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=1118>That is why the Member States should impose binding targets.</seg>
<seg id=1119>I am therefore optimistic about the future potential for renewable energies provided that the appropriate incentives are put in place.</seg>
<seg id=1120>I think that we need a great deal of courage to give renewable energy the place it deserves.</seg>
<seg id=1121>There is no doubt that a huge rise in oil prices confronts us with more violently problems related to energy dependency towards the fossil energy sources.</seg>
<seg id=1122>Therefore, we cannot accept Amendment No 28.</seg>
<seg id=1123>However, in doing so, the Commission not forgetting that the words used does not prejudge its right of initiative and that they must be compatible with the single market in electricity.</seg>
<seg id=1124>On 26 participants, the Commission's national reconciliation of Tajikistan is that woman, whereas the country 25 000 widows.</seg>
<seg id=1125>Studies show that the presence of women in the ranks of the peacekeeping forces in the United Nations, although limited, improving relations with the local populations and the general moral of these.</seg>
<seg id=1126>Mrs Theorin's report deals with this issue in detail and contains many repetition we are calling for, as the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, to do away with a view to produce an official document.</seg>
<seg id=1127>From a political point of view, I see in Amendment No 19 failure or a withdrawal tactics rather than a compromise in terms of content, which should in any case be unworthy of the cause of women.</seg>
<seg id=1128>They have been accepted prisonnières.</seg>
<seg id=1129>Then a Portuguese example, where the doors of diplomacy is not open to women that after the revolution 'April 1974. "our ambassador in Indonesia, Mrs Ana Gomes, showed recently in West Timor, the role of a woman and his sensitivity to the problems and the suffering of a people which has addressed only 25 years of a long struggle for freedom, can be seen by everybody, and above all by the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1130>Very little of the Member States have done so far, I am told that there are two or three.</seg>
<seg id=1131>That is why we also need, in future, to take account of this aspect in the drafting of European Union policies.</seg>
<seg id=1132>Unfortunately, the report does not define this concept, not more than it establishes the distinctions.</seg>
<seg id=1133>Please convey our protest at the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1134>They have different experiences, which are essential to the way in which the policy is exercised, especially when it comes to manage crises.</seg>
<seg id=1135>In the debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1136>This brings me to the second point. If one wants to regulate the sector, we must obviously examine a number of points.</seg>
<seg id=1137>Over the past few weeks, I have discovered a interest as part of the international trade union circles that a number of European Union organisations.</seg>
<seg id=1138>Second objection. You are therefore support the payment of a salary for housewives?</seg>
<seg id=1139>Everyone who works are currently obtiendraient undeclared work in decent social conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1140>Moreover, this project has also allowed to two to three families to merge to create a whole employment aid housewife.</seg>
<seg id=1141>We were gathered in plenary in this first part-session in October, when we learned, at the time of our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia, the reaction of the Serbian people brave and immediately, as you will recall, ladies and gentlemen, we have called for the lifting of international sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=1142>In doing so, Europe has demonstrated the vitality of its civilisation in the history of the world and a political capacity creative forward-looking.</seg>
<seg id=1143>There can be no doubt about the fact that the status of Kosovo is a question of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1144>Furthermore, we would have a chance to demonstrate to Europe that we are able to develop their own constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia, recognising the true democratic principles.</seg>
<seg id=1145>I must say that I was - as you listening - very impressed by your mastery of a situation Oh! difficult, at the same time as by your determination.</seg>
<seg id=1146>This will be done in the next Minutes, Mr Watson.</seg>
<seg id=1147>Access to documents and to information on the activities of institutions enables citizens to the bodies of the European Union their responsibilities and thereby stimulates greater efficiency.</seg>
<seg id=1148>A fifth amendment important, in my view, is that on the annual report which should specifically address documents to remain secret, or at least that remain secret.</seg>
<seg id=1149>Things are not clear on this point, and it is not impossible that can also remain in force more restrictive measures, which is particularly on this point that we have tabled amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1150>The Committee on Foreign Affairs, for its part, is opposed to the idea that the documents relating to issues of foreign and security policy should be automatic and, in general, an exception to this rule of law and public scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id=1151>If we want people to be able to defend their rights, really places information require well-trained staff who are in some way by the hand of the citizens to research and used to their intelligence which guides inside the complex labyrinth of institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1152>These are essential if we are to avoid the so-called transparency is boils down to a transparent to insiders.</seg>
<seg id=1153>We must welcome the fact that Parliament has managed to gather a large majority in favour of greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id=1154>Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1155>Mr President, openness and transparency within the European Union does not arise in a favourable light.</seg>
<seg id=1156>If that is the case, it would then be a bad calculation, these are the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens who are at stake here.</seg>
<seg id=1157>The notion of documents takes many forms nowadays and we will ensure that access to the widest possible for the greatest possible number of documents and to the most diverse types of documents.</seg>
<seg id=1158>Mr President, we have to know the Commission's position in relation to public access to documents on reading the internal Manuel which has been submitted, on 11 October, to the Commission officials in order to explain how they deal with the requests of Members regarding access to documents.</seg>
<seg id=1159>This is where the regulation must be abolished or at least be complemented by the obligation to take account of the interests at stake.</seg>
<seg id=1160>The old models of international collaboration with all their old habits and rules of the game diplomatic where everything is going behind closed doors are no longer for in the sort of cooperation that modern became EU.</seg>
<seg id=1161>We should not make the confusion between this objective and the role of Parliament, nor with the future interinstitutional agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1162>I consider that a step has been made towards the possibility for the citizens to exercise their right to information and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1163>It is not, however, the only thing that I thank Mrs Maij-Weggen itself: the PPE-DE Group, and that through the enhanced Hughes procedure is the second report of the rapporteur, also deserves thanks.</seg>
<seg id=1164>Transparency must become the mainstay of all the activities of the European Union, but the right of access to documents is not enough in itself to continue to make transparency a reality.</seg>
<seg id=1165>The European Parliament therefore ask that the European security and defence policy in the future to be incorporated into the structures of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1166>In his speech before Parliament, 3 October last, President Prodi referred to the institutional triangle and pointed out that, in a European system based on checks and balances, the flow of operation of each institution contributed to the common interest.</seg>
<seg id=1167>I must admit that the great challenge of this regulation is to give a precise definition of the documents.</seg>
<seg id=1168>I would like to stress that the Commission could, at the appropriate time, almost all the amendments, such as Amendments Nos 9, 18 and 21 in part, and Amendments Nos 23, 25, 28, 26.1 F, 35, 38, 42, 40.1, 40.6 41.1, 43.1, 47, 49 and 52.</seg>
<seg id=1169>Sometimes I would vote in favour of the proposals made by the Commission, and for that we must indeed that Members have the list of the amendments which the Commission can support and that of the amendments that she does not want to support.</seg>
<seg id=1170>Equity capital of banks</seg>
<seg id=1171>Finally, and this is a most controversial issue, the Commission has called vigorously to use the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1172>These amendments replace various proposals of the report, which will probably be rejected in the vote and which will therefore replaced by new amendments from this consensus.</seg>
<seg id=1173>Mr President, in the light of the excellent vote of support that this report has received, and since the Commission's response to this morning, it seems obvious - recital all parties on which we voted - that on the basis of Article 69 (2), we ought to put off the vote on the draft legislative resolution, to enable us to engage in fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1174>Mr President, I am sorry to say that the PPE-DE Group had also hoped that the evening vote postponed, but it is that you, Mr the coordinator, who have come to tell me that you prefer that the matter be deferred until the second November part-session, rather than voting this evening.</seg>
<seg id=1175>The reason why I would suggest that we vote remettions East - as Mr Goebbels has said - that this is a very important matter.</seg>
<seg id=1176>I do not know how many costs the roll-call vote, but there is no doubt of hundreds of thousands of francs, or Belgian francs, of our budget.</seg>
<seg id=1177>I know that in France, the slaughter of whole herds principle was applied and that it does not seem to be the best way to combat this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id=1178>The deletion of animal meal in animal feed, not only that of cattle and sheep, but also to that of pigs, of poultry, fish;</seg>
<seg id=1179>It is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1180>It is through measures such as those that consumers will be reassured and that farmers will hear the message of solidarity that we want to convey.</seg>
<seg id=1181>We need to go further than this matter of urgency, we need to change the common agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=1182>The ban on the use of animal meal in animal feed is only the first step in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1183>We very much regret, however, that the amendments tabled by our group does not have been adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1184>I think it would be logical that the working hours of those who work in businesses polluting be reduced.</seg>
<seg id=1185>I shall conclude by insisting once again that the generalisation of the exploitation of hazardous waste must not lead us to live with the production of such waste.</seg>
<seg id=1186>Indeed, while pensions, for example, were less weak, there would be less poor.</seg>
<seg id=1187>The report envisages a total of EUR 100 million over five years to reduce poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1188>I fully support the proposal to implement a Luxembourg process 1a in the field of social exclusion, which involves the guidelines and national action plans.</seg>
<seg id=1189>Indeed, the report calls for the establishment of qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1190>By submitting its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission responds to the appeal made by the Council coming forward 'between now and June 2000' a 'initiative for cooperation in this area'.</seg>
<seg id=1191>Mr President, I abstained on a very specific reason: in my opinion, this report has not, from an environmental point of view, the progress that I hoped and wanted.</seg>
<seg id=1192>I hope that such a system to be extended to all the cities of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1193>Some proposals of the European Parliament are unrealistic and cannot receive my support.</seg>
<seg id=1194>We must also arrive in future to make better know best practices exist.</seg>
<seg id=1195>The high-wage mindful of the environment are being given the opportunity, in a liberalised market, voluntarily to contribute to a cleaner energy, while for the other, everything still remains as before.</seg>
<seg id=1196>The next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1197>These three reasons are as follows: firstly, because it agree in line with the process of consolidating democracy and in the strengthening of the requirement of respect for human rights, particularly with regard to the indigenous peoples.</seg>
<seg id=1198>Mr President, in this debate, we wish to express, as has been said quite other Members who have spoken before me, the solidarity and support in this House in the Central American Parliament, at a time when we are fighting for maintained that the priority within the European Union's external relations with the countries of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=1199>I did not express the reservations that have been able to express our colleague and friend, the chairman of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, Mr Seguro, regarding the issue of human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1200>Finally, in its dialogue with the authorities of Central America, the Commission again to the importance which must be given to regional integration processes, as an instrument of consolidating the democratisation and development of the region.</seg>
<seg id=1201>In order to hold on to power it did not hesitate to grab the nagging debate on 'the Ivorian', causing an outbreak of xenophobia: hatred of others, from abroad, or of the burkinabé malien, and yet many of them to live and work on the ground'Ivoire for many years.</seg>
<seg id=1202>The introduction of a democracy in Côte d'Ivoire will not now happen without the establishment of an independent committee of inquiry on the crimes and without the official commitment to uphold human rights and civil peace.</seg>
<seg id=1203>Some believe that the relative importance of democracy is that when it comes to Africa, that these are complex procedures, that we must leave from time to time, but I think there is no such thing as a possible compromise with democracy and the question which arises today for Côte d'Ivoire is the same as that arises for example for Guinea, where we know today that there are people who are imprisoned and that there is no democratic system.</seg>
<seg id=1204>I shall conclude with the following: the dictatorships that are being put in place, Mr President, because there are people who are suffering from poverty, which do not have access to information, which do not have access to knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1205>It would be illogical that the European Union requires today of new presidential elections which all the candidate countries could participate in this time.</seg>
<seg id=1206>In many parts of Africa, we are faced with brassages ethnic and religious very different.</seg>
<seg id=1207>These elections must allow the representation, at national level, the political parties who have been excluded during the presidential election and offset, and so, if only partially, the imperfections of this first election.</seg>
<seg id=1208>On the situation in Burma.</seg>
<seg id=1209>The authorities are conducting a major offensive directed against the Karen people and Shan, and as the rapporteur has indicated to the United Nations, there is no sign of dialogue between the sdpc and the NLD.</seg>
<seg id=1210>For this reason, we reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1211>I hope that by giving an urgency and priority to this issue, Parliament is sending a clear message to the people of Burma, would mean that its plight is not forgotten, that are not aware that in Burma, things empirent rather that it does not improve, and that we are determined to try to change the course of events.</seg>
<seg id=1212>This has lasted long.</seg>
<seg id=1213>In Asia, there is the danger that the economic and political reforms are decoupled, that liberalisation and an economic progress are being created without liberalisation of the sector without political and strengthening the rule of law, although I am of the opinion that, in the long term, the absence of the rule of law is detrimental to subsidies, trade and investment.</seg>
<seg id=1214>Mr President, I join the previous speakers on many points, because a lot of things that go in Vietnam today are unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1215>However, the publication Human Rights Watch, that quoted by Mr Swoboda, that Vietnam recently made some effort to improve their situation from the point of view of human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1216>These extremely confidential documents we provide a curious light on the sidelines of the policy pursued by the Vietnamese authorities.</seg>
<seg id=1217>However, the Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation that cannot be achieved through a dialogue between the military regime, the opposition and democratically elected representatives of the ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg id=1218>The Vietnamese authorities also exert pressure on the press clear the country for which it adopted a regime of self-censorship.</seg>
<seg id=1219>The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1220>We also call on the EU to give aid and assistance, not only in the south-west of England, but also to all the other areas.</seg>
<seg id=1221>I would ask you all to support our resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1222>It is urgent that the European Union sets to restrict ourselves to the speeches exceptional when disasters arrived.</seg>
<seg id=1223>The Commission has taken two initiatives in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1224>Mr President, on a purely linguistic error has crept into one of the amendments to the joint resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1225>A postponement of the vote would mean of postponing the entrusted to the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1226>(Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1227>The report is based on the fact that a proportion of increasing the national insurance systems in Europe is covered in a supplementary sickness insurance.</seg>
<seg id=1228>I find it a little strange to now obliging the Commission to a motion for a resolution and to ask him at the same time to draw up a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and supplementary sickness insurance.</seg>
<seg id=1229>At a time when the ageing of the population is well aware, it is essential that we tâchions improving the health care system in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1230>We are obviously not the endorsing.</seg>
<seg id=1231>Mr President, there are undeniable arguments in favour of the fast-track procedure to the implementation of the review of the Basle the capital adequacy.</seg>
<seg id=1232>The sense of urgency that Mrs Villiers has added to the feelings of the need for the Commission by calling for its good wishes a fast-track procedure for the adoption of these measures, there is forced to note that the rapporteur himself acknowledges that this new regulation will have no grip on the anti-competitive practices which, unfortunately, unfortunately, are widely used in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1233>We must also ensure that the decisions taken in Basle, which do not lead to an increase in capital requirements, a second disadvantage for banks.</seg>
<seg id=1234>Having said that, I believe, and I would like to stress, that economic operators are also satisfied with the approach, given to these regulations on capital, which strengthen the issues relating to risk.</seg>
<seg id=1235>Those are a few ideas on how we might achieve a swift, effective and verifiable legislative process in the context of the current rules of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1236>Indeed, the time has come to admit that the institution of Ombudsman '' has enough experience and it has already given ample evidence of maturity to have its own budget.</seg>
<seg id=1237>The PPE-DE Group supports the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the joined to affirm that the powers of the Ombudsman must be expanded, and that the sooner the better, particularly in the field of powers of inquiry of the Ombudsman, laid down in Article 3 of the decision of 1994.</seg>
<seg id=1238>An Ombudsman is, of course, subject to the rules of confidentiality, but to the citizens, it is good to know that those or one which fulfils this office can have access to documents which they, as citizens, have no access.</seg>
<seg id=1239>The report tabled was therefore subject to the recommendation by the Ombudsman for the Commission to help the candidate countries and candidates to competitions organised by it to consult their scripts corrected.</seg>
<seg id=1240>We believe that the institutions of the Community should conduct their procedures for recruitment of staff, even of the fact that all the procedures for recruitment, with a maximum publicity and transparency, in order to avoid any suspicion of partiality of injustice, administrative or incompetence.</seg>
<seg id=1241>I am referring to an amendment concerning the requirement of proof beyond doubt the conduct of a test oral, for example.</seg>
<seg id=1242>Mr Bösch has already outlined here briefly to the amendments to the report.</seg>
<seg id=1243>I asked two questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal competitions, and I have received from him precise answers and detailed.</seg>
<seg id=1244>This is the beginning of a process of openness and transparency of the method of government.</seg>
<seg id=1245>Firstly, the corrections examinations organised by the Commission are always be anonymously.</seg>
<seg id=1246>This is, of course, in July 2000.</seg>
<seg id=1247>Votes</seg>
<seg id=1248>(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)</seg>
<seg id=1249>- (DE) during the evaluation of the own funds directive credit institutions must be seen scrupulously several interests which are in conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1250>It is thus that is born the idea of a European police college for the Member States of the European Union and the applicant countries.</seg>
<seg id=1251>That is the position defended by the rapporteur and shared by the European People's Party.</seg>
<seg id=1252>The social situation in most Member States of the European Union is currently of this nature that the need for cross-border cooperation between the different police forces is indeed important.</seg>
<seg id=1253>The majority of speakers who have spoken so far seem to think that it is essential that the College has a permanent seat.</seg>
<seg id=1254>The umpteenth decision provisional, insecure, but not the small gift that the Council has accustomed to make on this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1255>The rapporteur would like to see more of crime prevention, assistance, of innovative developments and of border surveillance and also wants to change the internal security to include respect for the law and order.</seg>
<seg id=1256>These were the ideals they we proposed and that was the kind of State for which they uvraient.</seg>
<seg id=1257>I would be in favour of a balance of standards in some Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1258>Since the first thoughts on this issue, which were held at European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission is committed to Member States to promote an action intended to develop what we could consider a European police culture, focused on the highest standards in terms of ethics, human rights and freedoms, and efficiency in the fight against crime.</seg>
<seg id=1259>It is opposed to the development of a college of police mainly in an intergovernmental context.</seg>
<seg id=1260>For the reasons set out above, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will vote against the report.</seg>
<seg id=1261>I have voted against the report on the provisional establishment of the European police college.</seg>
<seg id=1262>It is clear that many of our courts are slow and their heavy and that it is very difficult to act promptly faced with these problems.</seg>
<seg id=1263>Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, the fact that it is linked to the Brussels II regulation which excludes children whose parents are pending of divorce, as well as children designed out of wedlock.</seg>
<seg id=1264>My mother did such a divorce and abduction 85 years ago and it is always talking about.</seg>
<seg id=1265>I would therefore like to tell Parliament that, in the action programme on the mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters, which we hope will be adopted before the end of this year, the Commission proposes that the first and the main priority being given to extending the scope of the regulation of Brussels II and, consequently, of this regulation on the right to visit to cover, without any discrimination children from married couples and children from unmarried couples.</seg>
<seg id=1266>We shall now proceed to the vote</seg>
<seg id=1267>Nowadays, sport - it has to be said - is closely linked to other economic sectors, such as audiovisual industry or the promotion and the sale of products sportspeople.</seg>
<seg id=1268>What we need is a flexible and intelligent way to interpret the existing rules.</seg>
<seg id=1269>In other words, a genuine attack on democracy, even if we avoid to look at things from this point of view.</seg>
<seg id=1270>The Commission expects so soon to receive a reply to its request for detailed information on the measures provided for by the British Government.</seg>
<seg id=1271>The proposal was initiated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a statement made before examining the budget, six months before the declaration of full budget spring 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1272>Again, I thought that what was said by Mr Simpson has really served to reassure us with regard to the intentions likely the British Government.</seg>
<seg id=1273>The traffic jams we are losing not only a lot of time, but they are a problem for the whole of the environment and I therefore believe that if the British Government commits indeed the funds necessary for the resolution of these issues, that is to the benefit of everybody and in particular of all the citizens of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1274>We are more or less the only producers of oil in the European Union and yet we are faced with the price of petrol and diesel the highest in all the countries of Europe - the GBP 1,20 litre of diesel to Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id=1275>In the debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1276>The European Parliament has a duty to make them that it is on their side, and I propose that, once again, to observe a minute's silence which expresses our solidarity and emotion.</seg>
<seg id=1277>Madam President, this is to fully support, since I am one of those who have requested the inclusion of this point.</seg>
<seg id=1278>We have done a good progress.</seg>
<seg id=1279>The Union will its relations with all the major groups and, as soon as possible, also will contact the new American administration.</seg>
<seg id=1280>Given the verbatim report of Mr Prescott surprisingly shining on the way in which he himself had negotiated, how is it that not only Mrs Voynet but also, I think, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, most of the other EU environment ministers have rejected this?</seg>
<seg id=1281>What can be fear, is that the momentum will be lost, that the US negotiators do not change and that everything is to start again in May.</seg>
<seg id=1282>This time, it is the forests have proved to be the main stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id=1283>If this warming continues, part of the territory of the European Union countries become sea or in desert.</seg>
<seg id=1284>The standard of living there are high and the price of petroleum products downs.</seg>
<seg id=1285>I congratulate the Commissioner Wallström for the efforts she has made in the Hague and wish to have more of a chance.</seg>
<seg id=1286>Without doubt, worth it better not to have an agreement that will have an agreement that is wrong and, in this case, the American proposal was a watered-down proposal, unacceptable for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1287>Climate change has important consequences in the developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=1288>I repeat this idea in its wording English: forest turns from being carbon sinks to carbon sources.</seg>
<seg id=1289>Only this credibility will enable the European Union to direct the speeches and the action of the COP 'B' Bonn.</seg>
<seg id=1290>We must make our own evaluation of what has happened and prepare the documents in order to establish contacts with various parties and, of course, with the 'umbrella' group.</seg>
<seg id=1291>Of course, the continuation of the forthcoming COP or the continuation of the COP will be ratified an agreement within the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1292>Before the European Council, we shall still next Sunday, Pierre Moscovici and myself, a ministerial conclave, to which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, as well as a meeting of the IGC, Monday on the occasion of the General Affairs Council.</seg>
<seg id=1293>The minimum number of participating Member States should be set at eight while the clause to appeal to the European Council, which is currently a genuine right of veto, would be replaced by a right to mention.</seg>
<seg id=1294>We may regret this, but I am obliged to make this observation.</seg>
<seg id=1295>The European Council will discuss also of the state of progress of accession negotiations, and therefore, of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1296>The Lisbon European Council approved the guidelines intended to promote a European economy innovative and competitive.</seg>
<seg id=1297>Consumer protection is a growing concern of Europeans, for obvious reasons that I do not need to develop.</seg>
<seg id=1298>We must be prepared for this enlargement considerable.</seg>
<seg id=1299>This is, in the final analysis, the light in which we will judge the Nice Summit.</seg>
<seg id=1300>(Loud applause)</seg>
<seg id=1301>The first is that the candidate countries should adopt and implement the acquis communautaire is the task that they share with us.</seg>
<seg id=1302>We are deeply attached to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we do not want simply to say.</seg>
<seg id=1303>Admittedly, the text could have been better, and it will be possible to improve and clarify the post-Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1304>I think it is simply unacceptable that some governments have purely and simply swept to table the question of the inclusion of a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1305>You do not even want to incorporate into the Treaty, that proves that this text should be set aside.</seg>
<seg id=1306>We shall talk with one voice disgracieuse within the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1307>Given the rather gloomy prospects of success of the Intergovernmental Conference, I believe that it would not be appropriate to add to the agenda of this complex subject and controversial.</seg>
<seg id=1308>I appeal urgently to the French Presidency to do everything in its power to fill that gap particularly destructive.</seg>
<seg id=1309>The Commission, in terms of commercial policy, drew up a proposal which must be examined carefully.</seg>
<seg id=1310>Although the previous Treaty has some progress in terms of the extension of the method, we also introduced this formula senseless under the codecision procedure with unanimity for citizenship, social security, the rights of independent persons and also to cultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=1311>The simple fact that this issue be raised in itself shows clearly the absence of a policy of strengthening links of mutual trust between the countries which make up the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1312>It is precisely in this situation that the Intergovernmental Conference bogged down for months, because nobody wants to abandon its toy.</seg>
<seg id=1313>The experience of this year we have to say that the developments to provide - after Nice, by looking towards the future of Europe, the process of constitutionalisation of the Union should not be entrusted to the method of negotiation now obsolete confidential between representatives of the governments.</seg>
<seg id=1314>If the majority do not become the rule, the process of decision-making is enlisera inevitably, as has so rightly pointed out by Mr Prodi.</seg>
<seg id=1315>If the aspect of the subsidiarity is very important, we have not heard during the debate here today.</seg>
<seg id=1316>That is what we have done, the enlargement of 1995 was adopted, we moved in the reflection group chaired by Carlos westerdorp wisely, Amsterdam has happened, we are now on the eve of the Nice Conference and the situation has scarcely changed, Mr President: we are back to the institutional issues, without finding a solution that will enable us to complete an ambitious task, I am referring to enlargement to 27.</seg>
<seg id=1317>Do not add to the disappointment that will cause at Nice, if the Council is naturally proves unsuccessful, the disappointment that our Parliament would cause among peoples.</seg>
<seg id=1318>In the past, we have proved that it is possible to achieve this goal, and coming from a Member State which has been a draft planned transition towards accession, I very much hope that we shall succeed in an enlarged Europe and peaceful.</seg>
<seg id=1319>But we must realise that, if you have the right of veto, all the others have too.</seg>
<seg id=1320>But we must proceed to a first transition in view of the elections of 2004 because a number of new Member States join before or during this legislature that run until 2009.</seg>
<seg id=1321>The President-in-Office of the Council has raised the issue of closer cooperation and he said that one's progressait towards consensus on this.</seg>
<seg id=1322>Mr President, at first sight, Nice is about the necessary reforms and on the leftovers from the prospect of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1323>If we possédions if only a few features of this mentality, if we insist on less that things are going badly on our continent and a little more about the things go well, we would be a little more pleased that at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=1324>We must not only extend qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers in force in the transport of goods, we must include services, investment, intellectual property and competition related and adapt accordingly Article 133 (1) of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1325>Indeed, the grant such a right to the European Parliament would leave also free rein to the arbitrary nature of the policy of party on this matter ultra sensitive.</seg>
<seg id=1326>So we must also, as the saying one of you, referring to the American 'optimism and the way in which the Americans speak for themselves, we must also be able to enhance what works and what beforehand.</seg>
<seg id=1327>I would also like to say that I do not believe that there are a problem between large and small countries.</seg>
<seg id=1328>We have worked hard, but we come up against this old problem, and I do not believe that the development can be triggered by the movement of a single country, because we come up against realities, once again, in national policies, democratic, very strong in twelve countries out of fifteen.</seg>
<seg id=1329>Finally, Mr Védrine, you have raised a situation perhaps too tense and talked of a certain pessimism.</seg>
<seg id=1330>In general, could you take measures to strengthen the security so that such events cannot be repeated?</seg>
<seg id=1331>I think that we must take measures, yet we still have never taken up to now, so that the guests of this Parliament feel here as the hosts, and do not have to fear of threats.</seg>
<seg id=1332>Here, hospitality hospitality and respect there.</seg>
<seg id=1333>I would thank you for your contribution, Mr Tajani.</seg>
<seg id=1334>The best tribute to Ernest and in his memory is to meet its message - dìaleg in Catalan. can all give his chance the Basque country?</seg>
<seg id=1335>Of course, on the other hand, everyone should express its opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1336>B5-0550 / 2000 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Council, on the political situation and the humanitarian aid in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=1337>When I speak of organisation, I am also thinking that if the European Union is making great efforts and which, in my opinion, ought to be able to take responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=1338>Secondly, you will see in the resolution the clear will of Parliament to rely security and defence policy on two pillars: balanced civil crisis management and, in the event of failure, managing the military, the two pillars are complementary.</seg>
<seg id=1339>Mr President, since the delay which has been taken and, after my obligations, I shall try to shorten somewhat the speech which I have had prepared.</seg>
<seg id=1340>These relations will in the form of meetings between the Council of the North Atlantic and the copsi, and meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European countries applicant and / or allies.</seg>
<seg id=1341>Take, for example, what has happened in the Balkans, where we can say that everyone has been playing its full role.</seg>
<seg id=1342>We have also kept in that period very informed of developments in the United States under the European security and defence policy, which is a sine qua non for it develop harmoniously, as is the case at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=1343>The second edition of the annual report of the European Union on human rights was presented to the European Parliament a forum on human rights will be held in Paris on 13 December.</seg>
<seg id=1344>This policy, say, does not aim to compete with the Atlantic Alliance, which is still today the bedrock of collective defence of its members, or to set up a permanent European army.</seg>
<seg id=1345>On the other hand, if I have mentioned the figure of 100 000 soldiers, this does not mean that we ambitionnons to exceed the objective set at Helsinki, but that we have a reservation in qualifications and in different specialities which makes it possible to guarantee that the 60 000 men of the objective of the Council would be achieved, whatever the operational conditions of their jobs.</seg>
<seg id=1346>Allow me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to speak briefly the deep political sense, approved by a large part of public opinion, of this new task which Europe is becoming a tool of political influence which it was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id=1347>The problem we now face is to ensure that, when we talk about consolidating liberal democracy in Europe, we believe in Europe as a whole, because this is the purpose of enlargement and of the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=1348>We need to incorporate into a coherent whole three elements: separate Community policies, including the CFSP (ESDP) and the action of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1349>Despite our proceedings laborious, we do not need a force of 60 000 men to meet our objectives.</seg>
<seg id=1350>We must therefore put in place an urgent solution for humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id=1351>I do not agree with the cynical who say that Europe is thus giving a joujou unusable. It is certainly true that, in many situations, the rapid reaction force cannot be mobilised directly.</seg>
<seg id=1352>The EU should not provide itself with a defence own with fixed in staff.</seg>
<seg id=1353>Finally, I should like to express the concern that the members of my group and I feel in the face of the continuing deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan. I would urge the Commission and the Council to do everything possible, and to intensify efforts to achieve a peaceful and to provide aid to the civilian population, not least for the moment, the approach of winter.</seg>
<seg id=1354>To put it very simply: where, when and under what conditions the European intervention force should t it come into action in the future?</seg>
<seg id=1355>It makes it possible to understand the appalling record of these two months of Intifada: 270, most Palestinians dead, and nearly 10 000 injured, often disabled for life.</seg>
<seg id=1356>Hence his efforts endless intended to set up an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction can no longer be lugubre.</seg>
<seg id=1357>Secondly, contrary to what the previous speaker has said, I do not know whether it is possible and desirable that the European Union to do more than it has already done in the face of the conflict and the escalation of violence in the Middle East, particularly now, in this transition period that cross the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1358>Mr President, I shall concentrate in my speech on the report by Mrs Lalumière report, that I find well thought-out and clearly formulated.</seg>
<seg id=1359>But there are no political concept and there is still not really of common foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=1360>The only problem is that the EU has so far it has not managed to obtain the interest of public opinion for this type of action in spite of the fact that they are considerably more sustainable and more effective.</seg>
<seg id=1361>Mr President, there are still, of course, the budget and the question of how we distribute.</seg>
<seg id=1362>I say this in spite of the huge numbers of guarantees which were apparent miraculously progress in relation to this issue over the last few days.</seg>
<seg id=1363>At the moment, this ability is severely lacking and must, at the end of the day, the Member States to look into their programmes of expenditure on defence which differ greatly from one country to another.</seg>
<seg id=1364>Even those who are asking about the usefulness which may result in a decision such as that to create what is called the European army must consider the political aspect of this important decision and its influence on the cohesion of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1365>The presence of a Minister of Defence for the first time in this House is such a historic event that you have reserved for the evening sitting of our Members that are not too impressed.</seg>
<seg id=1366>For all these conflicts, a non-military crisis management to pre-emptively is better than a military operation.</seg>
<seg id=1367>Does it want Russia, in the long term, remain united at an undemocratic regime?</seg>
<seg id=1368>Therefore, Europe will not be a new alliance, as I have heard mentioned, I believe, by a development incomplètement informed.</seg>
<seg id=1369>I have received a motion for a resolution, pursuant to Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure, to wind up this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1370>In view of the scale of the task, four committees were concerned and an unprecedented procedure has been put in place, with parallel reports.</seg>
<seg id=1371>All the measures proposed in the White Paper must contribute to modernise and make any effective functioning of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1372>It would therefore be a good thing that the reform is an opportunity to limit their intervention in the only areas which does not involve of expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1373>The differences of appreciation that have arisen are not only of a political nature, but even more reflect the cultural differences between the Fifteen.</seg>
<seg id=1374>The new internal audit service, under your direct responsibility, Mr Kinnock, the Vice-President responsible for reform, as will the main task analysis of functions and systems of internal control which exist within the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1375>Work together has been a pleasure, and I believe that the fact that there have been all four involved has deepened and enriched the process of dealing with a reform of the Commission, crucial reform which is essential for the future of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1376>They can expect to be transferred to other institutions, to be seconded to the national governments or to work in the private sector.</seg>
<seg id=1377>Also, our Committee on Constitutional Affairs recalls t it its commitment to a strong executive Commission, independent, efficient, transparent and politically responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1378>As the Committee on Budgets, we believe that activity-based budgeting problems because of the lack of visibility of expenditure and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=1379>This will mark so obvious, the good will of this Parliament in relation to the implementation of this reform with the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1380>Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1381>This is a disgrace when you think that the European Union raises a champion of the modernisation of economic life.</seg>
<seg id=1382>Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteurs to support the work of the Commission, it has not yet made a global and coherent response by the Committee of Independent Experts, which aims to answer a management policy and not only for better administration of the institution.</seg>
<seg id=1383>This change in attitude must be translated into a transparency in the administration.</seg>
<seg id=1384>In my view, there are no structure whose importance is more are fifteen nations, tomorrow twenty or more, an entire continent, the part of the world, the more industrialised living in the Union and, with it, in the Commission and its structures.</seg>
<seg id=1385>The change is never easy.</seg>
<seg id=1386>In doing so, however, the Socialist Group believes that the current functioning of public administration Community is quite effective.</seg>
<seg id=1387>The result is known and to draw the dedication and the competence of most of the components of the Commission and its administration.</seg>
<seg id=1388>Many thousands of requests for projects await assessment for over a year.</seg>
<seg id=1389>The debate, as we have seen, is not so much on the principles, the objectives or the possibility of reform that on the procedures, the pace, the timetable, the possible malfunctions unwanted pregnancy or the consequences of implementing it.</seg>
<seg id=1390>I would like to inform the House - as pointed out by Mr van Hulten just now - that the meeting of the College of this morning, has adopted the proposal for an interinstitutional agreement establishing an advisory committee rules governing public life, such as 1 sets out the action plan of action by the White Paper.</seg>
<seg id=1391>I think that Mr van Hulten has once again stressed this point during the debate.</seg>
<seg id=1392>The main objective of this overhaul is to simplify the procedures, to increase transparency and to enhance the budgetary rules, which will result in practical terms by a reduction in the number of exceptions and special arrangements incomprehensible and, consequently, through greater efficiency in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg id=1393>There is indeed little economic to the Commission that texts stipulate a payment of 20% for costs X and 30% for the costs there and then, there are regrouping and verification of evidence must be provided for small amounts.</seg>
<seg id=1394>The next item is the report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the impact of the reform of the Commission on these relations [2000 / 2051 (INI)].</seg>
<seg id=1395>These aspects are particularly the NGOs.</seg>
<seg id=1396>Of course, this is not enough, but that we must put aside everything to the cartoons of the safe on the weakness of our development aid.</seg>
<seg id=1397>We shall return, because that is in itself a framework of quality.</seg>
<seg id=1398>Mr President, I returned today of Mozambique, where the European Union has provided humanitarian aid high-quality following the floods, but of the reconstruction projects for which the funds have already been allocated are, once again, delayed pending a signature in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id=1399>Faced with these realities, the need for greater involvement and of greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is essential.</seg>
<seg id=1400>We now have a harmonised framework for the development of country strategy papers and the indicative programmes of cooperation in all developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=1401>What is more, the creation of SEM did not put an end to the disparities that exist between eight volumineuses administrative resources.</seg>
<seg id=1402>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, if I would particularly like to be with you today for this debate on the first package maritime safety in the European Parliament, it is because you consider three important texts, which constitute a first step on a crucial issue that recent events have unfortunately put on the agenda of the topical.</seg>
<seg id=1403>This could, moreover, from the point of view of the Council presidency, to discuss with the Member States to reach an agreement in Council on the basis of your proposals and to adopt the text at first reading, if necessary by qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=1404>This rapid response and targeted, implemented by the Erika two trains of measures and the six proposals, has launched a dynamic important.</seg>
<seg id=1405>The lesson that must retain this House in her this morning's debate is that we are forced to conclude that the laws are maritime, throughout the world, in a state of mess, and that we must set about the task of them to bring order.</seg>
<seg id=1406>We must send a clear signal to the vessels which do not meet safety standards and their mean that we cannot tolerate the more in European waters or in European ports.</seg>
<seg id=1407>For the small tankers, we adopt a position of compromise between the ceiling of 5 000 tonnes to set the IMO and the 600 tonnes of what the Commission has set.</seg>
<seg id=1408>These data should be made available to the European authorities, the Member States and port, as well as the public interest.</seg>
<seg id=1409>The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region, requires the creation of a Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution.</seg>
<seg id=1410>The organisations of protection of the environment are also involved in the cooperation at local level.</seg>
<seg id=1411>To amend the directive in the direction of greater rigour in its application, harmonisation of legislation, particularly as regards the selection of vessels under the inspections, and the scope of the different types of inspections, is clearly positive.</seg>
<seg id=1412>I should like to point out that the urgency that you are invoking now has no reason to be.</seg>
<seg id=1413>With regard to the limits of liability of classification bodies, it is my view that the Council and Parliament approfondissent reflection, regardless of what will be decided today.</seg>
<seg id=1414>A black box, a black list, all the things we are dealing with actively. But I would nevertheless stress a few points.</seg>
<seg id=1415>Faced with this catastrophic anarchic and maritime transport, Europe took up the challenge and, eleven months after the Erika disaster, the European Union will be able to announce that procedure will never have been per so quickly.</seg>
<seg id=1416>You can see how the liberal logic is opposed to that at a high level of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1417>Whatever, finally, the technical measures to be taken, one of the major sources of insecurity will remain as long as one does not have rebalanced area, in the English Channel and the North Atlantic, the exponential increase in traffic related to the hypertrophie ports in the North Sea.</seg>
<seg id=1418>That would be to the credit of the President in Office of the Council to put things in order, also in their own country.</seg>
<seg id=1419>Madam President, since the sinking of the oil tanker Erika, a package of measures has emerged, political pressure in order to improve the safety of ships at sea.</seg>
<seg id=1420>Ships Greeks have sunk, without that there are the slightest storm in the exist, Mr Gayssot.</seg>
<seg id=1421>Thirdly, I think that we need becomes clear, in such cases, there is no relationship between our oil supplies on the one hand and the fact that we always use of fossil fuels on the other.</seg>
<seg id=1422>Let us therefore finally the political courage to our ecological ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1423>That is to say that, in this field more than in any other, our responsibility is greater and we must, I believe, to silence all love own institutional.</seg>
<seg id=1424>From the point of view of Finland, for example, it is important that Russia is involved in these agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1425>I think at the same time strengthening the requirements regarding the standards of construction of oil, to improving the rules for the control of ports, and also, therefore, the tightening of regulations applicable to classification societies of ships.</seg>
<seg id=1426>Madam President, we are talking about today to maritime safety on the basis of three reports which I warmly congratulate the rapporteurs.</seg>
<seg id=1427>With regard to these three new proposals on maritime safety, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs, who have, in a very short period, demonstrated the extent to which our Parliament is determined to adopt new measures to enhance safety at sea, for controls, the standards of construction and shown that it is no longer tolerable that similar accidents occur again.</seg>
<seg id=1428>Madam President, our continent has recently been struck by a series of maritime disasters and wide-ranging, particularly involving oil tankers.</seg>
<seg id=1429>More than 80% of accidents are bound to human error, but there are reasons to human error, which is the social order.</seg>
<seg id=1430>One or a parliamentary has the "traceability '.</seg>
<seg id=1431>The directive on port State control is designed to ensure compliance with international requirements and not to introduce new regulations.</seg>
<seg id=1432>Amendment No 18 links the port state control to rest periods of sailors, even if the application of provisions on working hours for seafarers is already fully covered by the Directive 99 / 95.</seg>
<seg id=1433>I am pleased to see that the rapporteur has introduced a reference, in Amendment No 21, the special system of control, and I gave our agreement with the main thrust of this approach, but nevertheless stresses that the wording should be refined in order to clarify matters.</seg>
<seg id=1434>Amendment No 4 and the part of Amendment No 18 on point K are not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1435>I can assure you that if a shipowner refer to register a ship under these flag, it would be useful to give some thought to twice in view of our proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1436>The Commissioner spoke for 18 minutes, and all this time, it was mentioned dozens and dozens of articles, and it has declined the position of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1437>Proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on a range of actions relating to the trans-European network of collection, production and distribution of statistics on expiry dates of goods intra and non-Community (EDICOM) [COM (00) 0458 - C5 ­ 0401 / 00 - 2000 / 0201 (COD)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)</seg>
<seg id=1438>By withdrawing our resolution, I am nonetheless convinced that our Parliament would have done better in devoting its voice to the Nice European Council, a specific resolution and separate issues so important and so difficult to the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than to deal with them in the context of a single resolution including also all the other items on the agenda of the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1439>(More than twelve Members are being removed, the oral amendment was not retained) (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1440>Report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the impact of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI))</seg>
<seg id=1441>I voted against in protest against the fact that the European Union still fails to intervene as it should do so also in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1442>Although the proposal for amending the existing directive on the monitoring of ships as the Watts report do not meet the real needs, they represent some progress in the right direction for these reasons, we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1443>It is therefore regrettable that the Commission proposal has not taken on board the idea of creating a genuine European supervisory body, on the model of 'coast guards' in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1444>The safety of ships, the protection of life at sea and the environment need beforehand that sort of attack the impunity enjoyed by shipowners, it takes very stringent measures for the control of State of the ship and that it imposes strict sanctions ferry companies which violate the safety rules, that improves the conditions for seafarers, that gives them proper training and that the guarantee in staff on board that meet the increased needs of ships.</seg>
<seg id=1445>Unfortunately, the rapporteur Hatzidakis makes the opposite.</seg>
<seg id=1446>The Erika accident in December 1999 was at the origin of the emergence of the issue of maritime safety in Community policy agenda and it is under pressure from the European Parliament that the European Commission has proposed the texts that we have voted today, almost a year after this sinister shipwreck.</seg>
<seg id=1447>The compensation fund existing have been misinformed fuelled, and this is all too apparent that clear in the case of the disaster of the Braer, following which the fishing industry Shetland was too little indemnisée compared to damage incurred.</seg>
<seg id=1448>I have already said, Madam President, that in the past I have had the opportunity to navigate.</seg>
<seg id=1449>The rapporteur's proposals for the harmonisation at European level can only be welcomed.</seg>
<seg id=1450>This is an important aspect since it relates to the classification society of ships.</seg>
<seg id=1451>It would be rather a great success, because Europe, we need, on the eve of enlargement, is not a supranational Europe, rigid hiérarchisée, remote, but a flexible Europe and close to the people, is based on respect for national democracies.</seg>
<seg id=1452>The fight for power that are engaged in increasingly large numbers openly States brouille the prospect of possible compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1453>The Nice Summit will be the main task of guaranteeing the effectiveness of the institutions of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1454>In a week of the Summit, I have personally confident!</seg>
<seg id=1455>Nor am I in favour of a link between the automatic QMV and codecision and, here too, I think that any decision designed to extend the powers of codecision should be considered on a case-by-case basis.</seg>
<seg id=1456>By amending Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extend qualified majority voting in the Council, currently in force for the trade in products, in other areas such as public services, intellectual property, health or education.</seg>
<seg id=1457>So, Parliament is forbidden to exert an influence, we reduce the voice and silent on behalf of fidelity partisan, and national government, forgetting and its obligations towards the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1458>I have also voted against a text that calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty to be adopted in Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1459>When, however, share the Union into A and B teams is a mistake, and I therefore agree with the idea of allowing one-third of the Member States to pre-empt the other.</seg>
<seg id=1460>Its new role has put an end to the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.</seg>
<seg id=1461>There are many elements which the British Conservative Group can support in this report, in particular the insistence on the enlargement of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1462>The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have decided to support the report on the establishment of a of the European security and defence policy.</seg>
<seg id=1463>But also against the peoples of the European Union will, in any case, to finance the new expenditure of arms that advocates the report and which does not even have the guarantee that these forces are not a day used against them, on behalf of the 'maintenance of law and order'.</seg>
<seg id=1464>It is also a serious attempt to a state that does not wish to participate in a mission to be forced to pay a financial contribution will be shared between the Member States participating in this war.</seg>
<seg id=1465>The military outside did not provide any solution, because it does not remove the origin of the conflict and does not change public opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1466>· the fact that the military operations would be financed by a line of the Community budget and that the Member States would have to contribute financially operations, even if they do not wish to participate (paragraphs 49 and 50)</seg>
<seg id=1467>The EU would, on the contrary, advantage to alter the priorities set out in the framework of the Petersberg tasks and it should concentrate its efforts on achieving civil and humanitarian tasks.</seg>
<seg id=1468>I support the report by my colleague Mrs Theorin.</seg>
<seg id=1469>But there is no mention of the needs of this category to pass on the request for a tax deductibility of domestic services' and a 'adapting prices and costs to the financial possibilities individuals'.</seg>
<seg id=1470>It is quite incredible that we were still in the twenty-first century recommend that Member States guarantee employees domestic the right to social security and pensions.</seg>
<seg id=1471>For many young people, the first contact with the labour market is likely to take the form of undeclared work.</seg>
<seg id=1472>The situation is worse when it comes to women's distant countries which have accepted this work by necessity and who have no alternative to continue supporting themselves to their vital needs.</seg>
<seg id=1473>The reform of the Commission will be judged on coins, hence the need for regular monitoring reports that the European Commission will for the duration of the programme and the importance of the comprehensive record expected in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id=1474>In a recent past. Yet, various scandals and problems, in March 1999, led to the resignation of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1475>Finally, I must point out that, through this reform, which is essential for the future, we look at the same time more rigorous and more transparency in the Commission in its day-to-day management, but also a greater sense of responsibility of him, in the strict framework of competences to the tasks.</seg>
<seg id=1476>Conservatives also support the claim paragraph 7 of the report that we must ensure the democratic accountability and the functioning of the system in three pillars.</seg>
<seg id=1477>(The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=1478>We have heard - and I would like to add immediately that I cannot do believe – that the President of the Council and of the French Republic will be present tomorrow over thirty minutes of, so to speak.</seg>
<seg id=1479>Therefore, it seems to me to be ruled out that we have a thorough position and taken.</seg>
<seg id=1480>In any case itself, voting, and I am in favour of a resolution as suggested by Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others.</seg>
<seg id=1481>We have worked on these texts far into the night, as the figures on the weighting of votes in the Council and to the distribution of seats in this House.</seg>
<seg id=1482>Madam President, I am anxious to speak in favour of maintaining the de Roo report off the agenda, because it has been very well drafted and must be the subject of a common position at the last Council of Ministers for the Environment of the French Presidency will next Monday and Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id=1483>Thank you, Mr Parish.</seg>
<seg id=1484>In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy - that Mr Brok - smoke in chairing this sitting.</seg>
<seg id=1485>The political basis is clear: harmonising the market, taking account of a high level of protection of public health and consumer protection, it is based on the existing regulation and by promoting the scientific point of view.</seg>
<seg id=1486>The same applies to their conditions and design of life, in which the protection of health occupies an ever more important.</seg>
<seg id=1487>This rule can also apply to all drugs récréationnelles but dangerous as far as the consumer of drugs should be the only to run risks.</seg>
<seg id=1488>Yesterday, the United States, the trial has been gagnés against the tobacco multinationals for poisoning and lie on not toxicity products.</seg>
<seg id=1489>With regard to the export of cigarettes prohibited by the EU, for health reasons, within the Union, we believe that the only logical and reasonable solution is to put an end to it.</seg>
<seg id=1490>Rather than learn the lessons from the failure recorded in Luxembourg on 9 October, we persist in really legally untenable.</seg>
<seg id=1491>I have studied carefully to the statements by Commissioner addressed to my colleague Mr Hume: 'not a massive loss of jobs in this sector.</seg>
<seg id=1492>It is Parliament and the Council to adopt this proposal for a directive and to examine, among other things, its proper legal base.</seg>
<seg id=1493>I do not believe that we can follow a path too limited, in other words, irrespective of the content – and substantial content that highlighted by Mr Maaten and others - are running the risk that, if this Parliament and the Council accept the restrictive interpretation proposed by the leader of the European People's Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and all the Community institutions are being bound hand and foot in terms of legislative development of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law.</seg>
<seg id=1494>The weak point of the proposal is that it puts great emphasis on the promotion of free competition.</seg>
<seg id=1495>I would say in conclusion that, since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has the power of coordination in terms of the environment and consumer protection, and of course it will work in close cooperation with the Council and the Commission on these matters.</seg>
<seg id=1496>In fact, it has nothing to do with tobacco, but the judgment of the Court of Justice could also lead to a ban on the advertising of alcohol or for chocolate, since it is known that sugar can also be harmful to health.</seg>
<seg id=1497>I do not really parviens to understand that a majority of Members may wish a relaxation of the rules on export compared with the wishes expressed by the governments of the Member States - the governments which are also the many industrial circles concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1498>It is a fact that 80% of smokers to stop, but the tobacco industry does that little policies in place to assist those smokers to stop.</seg>
<seg id=1499>If we entêtons to dictate to other countries standards of public health that they should be applied by extending our proposals quite sensible for the internal market to exports, we will jeopardise the excellent work done by Mr Maaten.</seg>
<seg id=1500>We are in favour of the application of a uniform method of test recognised by all the countries of the EU, which must be implemented through a laboratory testing of accredited in a country.</seg>
<seg id=1501>The effects of tobacco consumption on health are now widely recognised, and the legislators and public opinion share the same feeling that it is now time to adopt rules and regulations draconian for this product.</seg>
<seg id=1502>Consequently, the Community rules would be good in harmony with the future international agreements, which we would avoid the danger of trade barriers and at the same time strengthen consumer protection, while ensuring a high level of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1503>It would be better to wait until the question of all the additives be dealt with in the context of the first report of the committee.</seg>
<seg id=1504>On laboratory testing, the amendment dealing with the approval of testing is superfluous since another article guarantees the movement of goods which are in line with the provisions of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1505>Madam President, this report is that there are currently more simple, the directives on summertime have only a period of validity of five years, then they must go back to Parliament to be renewed.</seg>
<seg id=1506>The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on the provisions on summertime, we are debating today, is a good proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1507>I therefore believe that we should not spend too much time on this issue, since the Member States and the people have already widely accepted regulations on summertime and that it has been recognised as an integral part of our annual rate.</seg>
<seg id=1508>In my view, it is good that the issues of time zones and application of the directive on summertime remain the competence of the Member States, as the proposal provides.</seg>
<seg id=1509>It would be more sensible to put an end to the time of the end of September, six months after its beginning.</seg>
<seg id=1510>It can nevertheless to agree with the idea of making appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report by 2007 mentioned in Article 5.</seg>
<seg id=1511>It was made clear that no trial leading to changes to the genetic identity of participating cannot be accepted.</seg>
<seg id=1512>If we approve it, we will surely a regulation which safeguards the therapeutic progress and not leave the protection of patients in the current situation, but the improvement and that is why I am arguing in favour of this compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1513>These groups must be kept within the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1514>I am also glad that we have managed to put safeguards to gene therapy and cell.</seg>
<seg id=1515>I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his work, and to thank him for the efforts he has made to reconcile the conflicting points of view.</seg>
<seg id=1516>These programmes are the fight against cancer, the prevention of AIDS, the prevention of drug dependence and the promotion of health, and their adjournment would mean the end of the actions concerned and business networks which have been put in place.</seg>
<seg id=1517>It is very advantageous to iron out in advance the ground, in order to make progress as far as possible, to bring us closer to greatly and, in cases where a second reading would be necessary, to ensure that we will be almost to decide.</seg>
<seg id=1518>Furthermore, we must not lose sight of the fact that both the prevention and promoting the vigilance that will always be more important and we must therefore provide the most important and their budgets to attach greater importance.</seg>
<seg id=1519>Madam President, following the Trakatellis report on the extension of certain existing European programmes in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about the direction in which European policy on public health is changing.</seg>
<seg id=1520>According to my information, the Council has also given its agreement in principle.</seg>
<seg id=1521>In the European Union, paradoxically, the abolition of internal borders in order to promote the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is accompanied by the maintenance of 15 borders in the fields of police and criminal justice, which Member States have difficulty are from.</seg>
<seg id=1522>Finally, the initiative represents a significant step forward towards the creation of a European criminal justice area, even though partial and limited, but it meets the needs of a considerable volume of European citizens who, when they are victims of an offence outside the territory of their State of residence, are usual until now almost without appeal.</seg>
<seg id=1523>What have we therefore asked for these groups of people?</seg>
<seg id=1524>We must at the same time guarantee a special training professionals in direct contact with the victims.</seg>
<seg id=1525>The victims cannot be doubly victims, victims of crime and having been victims of the system.</seg>
<seg id=1526>In this context, it is also important that parents, close to the victim's family, be informed of the facts of so reticent and professional if they emit in the wish and can also count on the support necessary, avoiding they learn all the details in the press.</seg>
<seg id=1527>This applies regardless of the type of crime which is.</seg>
<seg id=1528>That is the level of Member States, or that of the Union, we must never divert the fundamental principle that any individual must constantly take responsibility for its actions.</seg>
<seg id=1529>In other cases it may be possible to obtain information useful in a language of a European Union which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id=1530>I am very pleased with the positive reaction of Parliament to this first text on an issue which is so crucial, which allows for the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building gradually to offer our citizens assistance in situations which are often difficult to live.</seg>
<seg id=1531>Vote on request for urgent procedure</seg>
<seg id=1532>(Parliament rejected the request)</seg>
<seg id=1533>Thus, in the night of 23 to 24 November, we have reached an agreement with the Council on the essential points of a budget, which is certainly not brilliant, but which is nonetheless sensible.</seg>
<seg id=1534>The Commission had proposed a review also to the tune of EUR 300 million.</seg>
<seg id=1535>But I also know that the discussions it is much more difficult to achieve the formulation of a Council position non-negotiable, to receive a mandate and to bring the purely national self-interest in a joint decision European slightly reasonable and justified.</seg>
<seg id=1536>I hope that the work for a common recruitment office, as we say in German, i.e. a modern EU authority of recruitment, avanceront really, so that we can respond to the problems which arise in all the institutions – the Council as the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions - in the next few years, namely the need for staff.</seg>
<seg id=1537>The Council is refusing to carry out this review - it appears that we should already have data - and I want to prevent: to use the flexibility instrument two consecutive years, indeed, in less than 15 months and the first to less than six less of the approval of the financial perspective - vacuum the flexibility instrument because it prevents its renewal and its possible accumulation, which is scheduled for up to EUR 600 million.</seg>
<seg id=1538>This very large sum, which responds to the existence of needs very high in 2001, will also be financed through the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to the tune of EUR 200 million.</seg>
<seg id=1539>This is taking account of this fact once again that the Council voted at second reading in a budget increase of 2.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1540>Finally, before you procédiez to the final adoption of this budget, I would like to stress Council 's commitment to respect for certain basic budgetary rules, in terms of implementation of appropriations in reserve, the legal basis and the classification of expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1541>Unlike at Nice, and the three institutions - Parliament, Council and Commission - are all, I believe, contentes the final result.</seg>
<seg id=1542>Ladies and gentlemen, the re-emergence of cattle infected by BSE makes it necessary immediate action in the budgetary context, and specifically for the protection of health, for consumer protection, but also for aid for farmers affected by this situation.</seg>
<seg id=1543>Moreover, the Council has defined for the framework programme of aid for reconstruction in the Western Balkans, a multiannual indicative amount, admittedly, which is compatible with the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1544>High fight, we managed to get a few million euros additional.</seg>
<seg id=1545>I am very sincerely Mrs Haug.</seg>
<seg id=1546>We therefore believe that 1% of the budget of the European Union is put to good use.</seg>
<seg id=1547>I understand what you have said, we should not resort to the reserve because it is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id=1548>I therefore believe that we have seen very good things, in addition to many others, that I cannot mention now because of the brevity of the speaking time.</seg>
<seg id=1549>Although the agricultural appropriations, which represent almost half of the total budget of more than 5% increase, even taking into account the letter, the increase in the total budget is that of 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1550>Now we see the great danger that the opposition is not increases in the coming years, between the MEDA projects for the countries of the Mediterranean and the Balkans, as we all know that there is an urgent need for funds in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1551>Satisfied to overcome the difficulties that rendaient close if the road to the objective sought to fulfil the commitments made at Helsinki to undo the applicant countries without the European Union, to enable the Europe of tomorrow to continue to operate efficiently.</seg>
<seg id=1552>They are real, even if they do not go as far as the Presidency, which has shown, I note, as the national, a greater opening - would have liked.</seg>
<seg id=1553>A new legal basis is planned for the statute for European political parties and Parliament finds itself entrusted with the status of requesting institutional provided for in Article 230 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1554>In recent weeks, three significant progress has been made.</seg>
<seg id=1555>This is the aim of the declaration adopted in Nice and the reflection committed to coordinate at European level in the fight against doping.</seg>
<seg id=1556>Among the threats, there is, as everyone knows, the global warming.</seg>
<seg id=1557>Furthermore, in Nice, the European Union has put in place the necessary permanent bodies in the definition and to conduct a common foreign and security policy: a political and security committee, a military committee and a European staff.</seg>
<seg id=1558>For this cooperation, for your support and also for your warm welcome, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, the French Presidency thank you.</seg>
<seg id=1559>(Loud applause)</seg>
<seg id=1560>(Loud applause)</seg>
<seg id=1561>We must now look closely the text to Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1562>(Loud applause)</seg>
<seg id=1563>I see a failure not only in relation to the declared ambition of the European Union to change the institutions to be able to welcome new members properly by improving the effectiveness of the European Union and I see this as a failure compared with a further important aim, which was perhaps too little mentioned, the approximation of the European Union and the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1564>The right questions, it is in our view those which have been the bearer impressive human tide that, of the whole of Europe, have converged in Nice on the eve of the Summit.</seg>
<seg id=1565>Firstly, the Fifteen have signed up to the hastily and gas tear-gas which is under the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=1566>(Loud applause)</seg>
<seg id=1567>My group is disappointed by this Treaty and worried that we are preparing for the future, as we will oppose it with all our might.</seg>
<seg id=1568>Mr President, you have the floor.</seg>
<seg id=1569>I have already replied to this point and I agree entirely with what he said about the need to improve considerably the public debate I will not repeat what I said, but it is true that, all too often, citizens feel alienated to decisions that are taken in bodies that they do not know.</seg>
<seg id=1570>Mr President, I would like to know whether the competence of the European Parliament in terms of summertime is a new conquest of the Nice Summit.</seg>
<seg id=1571>Until then discouraged by the complexity of clinical trials, laboratories will perhaps, in the desire expressed both by the Member States that by our House, the courage to develop the paediatric medicines market, even if it is not a large enough to enable a return on investment.</seg>
<seg id=1572>Should we renew the change of an hour of summer which was established at the time of oil shocks, with a view to saving energy, and which was extended until 2001?</seg>
<seg id=1573>The victims are not always protected as the necessary in criminal procedure.</seg>
<seg id=1574>Many passengers and holidaymakers will therefore of this European initiative.</seg>
<seg id=1575>Mr President, the time for me to welcome Mr President of the Commission who is here and the Council Presidency that was in advance, and to highlight that, in this Parliament, is probably never has expressed such unanimity on the results of a summit.</seg>
<seg id=1576>That work, it is one that, under the leadership of the French Presidency, in six months, has, I believe, in fact done its work on six key strands.</seg>
<seg id=1577>However, my greatest fear is that the United Kingdom, France and Germany are now in a position to overturn the delicate balance that existed between the States of different sizes and between the institutions for decades.</seg>
<seg id=1578>In fact, it is hard to see, in this decision in Nice, which is home to facilitate enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1579>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be very brief today.</seg>
<seg id=1580>As a result of all this, when we shall proceed to the vote on the Treaty of Nice, my vote will not be that negative.</seg>
<seg id=1581>Mr President, the most important result of the meeting in Nice lies in the fact that, despite everything, reached a treaty, so that we can now prepare their place in the applicant countries.</seg>
<seg id=1582>The real winners of this Conference, it is mm.</seg>
<seg id=1583>Then, let us forget Nice, post-Nice - and please allow me to put my hope in the draft Convention made greater by Belgium for its Presidency, because the proof is made, we need the nine, we need to change the method, we need to speed up history 2004: it is too late, it is too far, it is too dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=1584>Instead of that spirit which prevailed in Nice was, rather than how to take forward the real Europe, be asked how we could block, how we could achieve a system of decision-making at intergovernmental level, how we could boast, once returned home, having been the defender of national interests.</seg>
<seg id=1585>In this case we are after Amsterdam and Nice, it is a Europe of princes, a Europe of national administrations, and not a Europe of integration policy.</seg>
<seg id=1586>We cannot continue without a qualified majority decision on the key issues.</seg>
<seg id=1587>It is true that - I paraphraserai Mr Bayrou - I am at this dock since this morning; firstly, together with the President of the Republic, and then by myself and critics fusent seems to me, moderate, friendly criticism, but all the same.</seg>
<seg id=1588>We must not forget that this is the first time, in fact, since 1957, that this reform, it really revise the grid.</seg>
<seg id=1589>We are in the constitutional systems and the authorities cannot be confused.</seg>
<seg id=1590>Thank you very much, Mr Minister.</seg>
<seg id=1591>But it has not been incorporated into the Treaties and has not been mentioned in Article 6 (2) of the Treaty on European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1592>Finally, there are some positive elements: the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty, Article on political parties and their status, the right of this Parliament to translate the other institution before the Court of Justice - it is also an important element of political control - the new formula for the European Commission, which is what is known as the 'Prodi law' in the Treaty, which strengthens the President and the new composition of the Commission - reasonable compromise which I accept and which will function, with time, and, as my colleague, Mr Tsatsos, pointed out, towards the future.</seg>
<seg id=1593>Mr President, we have already delivered to a rigorous evaluation of what happened in Nice, but it is worth remembering that Nice is party an agenda very limited.</seg>
<seg id=1594>Seeing things: the Charter has not been included in the Treaties, it does not even mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=1595>We want to prove to the Heads of Government that we can do better.</seg>
<seg id=1596>Despite the statements made from its own élogieuses issue this morning by the French Government, the IGC has not quite finished.</seg>
<seg id=1597>Mr President, the French Presidency is not present at this debate, it is not easy to criticise the.</seg>
<seg id=1598>Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the method of the Intergovernmental Conference has had it.</seg>
<seg id=1599>Budget 2001 ((continuation)</seg>
<seg id=1600>This does not mean that we could do more and better.</seg>
<seg id=1601>These maximum require the Commission to set priorities within the limits of a certain budget as any authority must do so.</seg>
<seg id=1602>The vote which will follow this debate will conclude a long and complex process of adopting the European Union budget for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1603>That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by returning to Article 272; the financial perspective has been maintained, even if we have used the flexibility instrument.</seg>
<seg id=1604>Let me just say to the Council that, on this issue, we still have the balloons and that, on this side, we hear play until we have achieved a good result.</seg>
<seg id=1605>We do not want a proposal to review for next year is already included in the resolution Colom, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we share her view critical when she says that this way of solving the insufficient financial in category 4 distorts the nature of the major objectives of multiannual outside the European Union itself and the definition of the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1606>For that all this is possible, we will have to define, for the future as well, the priorities of major.</seg>
<seg id=1607>That is the only way the money is made available to our citizens, will be used properly and wisely.</seg>
<seg id=1608>If we add to this the SAB already calculation coming, can almost to 8%, while in all other areas - whether it be the policy of training, of the whole area of internal actions, including research, foreign policy, administration and pre-accession aid, we have only a growth rate of 1.1%.</seg>
<seg id=1609>Given that this cooperation is so good, we will certainly have the opportunity to pursue in January, during the presentation of the supplementary budget.</seg>
<seg id=1610>The criticism of relations between Russia and the Baltic States which have still not been settled satisfactorily we should also.</seg>
<seg id=1611>We are following with great interest the developments of society and of internal policy in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1612>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1613>Even if President Putin guarantees us the democratic development of his country, it is not automatically the guarantor of a stable and democratic Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1614>We must not be insidieux but instead building a Europe of economic cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1615>Regarding the Caucasus, Mr Van Orden is quite right.</seg>
<seg id=1616>If we look at Russia from outside and that they are receiving punctually of impressions of direct interlocutors Russian quickly, it runs the risk of speaking with a selective a Russian reality which is in fact the image that there has been oneself to Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1617>In political terms, the common strategy proposes to Russia to initiate a permanent dialogue on politics and security and to establish a permanent mechanism for this task.</seg>
<seg id=1618>In this paragraph, I wanted to stress how important it is to do with the fact that Russia is actually a political union with Belarus.</seg>
<seg id=1619>Do you support such a project, Mr Patten?</seg>
<seg id=1620>In this context, as Parliament knows, at the last summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi has initiated an in-depth dialogue on energy.</seg>
<seg id=1621>I very much hope to make me personally to Kaliningrad early next year, and not just because it Kant past lifetime.</seg>
<seg id=1622>Once again, I congratulate the honourable Member for his excellent report, which concerns a matter of very great significance, on which I am sure that we look again and again in this Parliament over the next few years.</seg>
<seg id=1623>You put me in a position very difficult.</seg>
<seg id=1624>Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is very important, because the mad cow crisis has an enormous impact on food, on the production and import of food products.</seg>
<seg id=1625>The Council has expressed its concern at the many meetings with Russia, at all levels, particularly as regards the lead to avoid the excessive use of force and a possible extension of the conflict, to carry out independent investigations and effective on violations of human rights, to support the OSCE assistance group in carrying out its duty and finally to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id=1626>Mr President, on a point of order: it is customary in this House that when the issues have not been the subject of an oral reply satisfactory, then they should be dealt with in writing.</seg>
<seg id=1627>(Interruption by Mr Posselt)</seg>
<seg id=1628>This directive dates from 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1629>It is in this sense that we will have to work.</seg>
<seg id=1630>These groups are obviously not the object of an exception in the new proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1631>The presidency and several Member States have already received the Committee of European manufacturers of sugar various letters relating to the Commission proposal which they will take account in their deliberations.</seg>
<seg id=1632>Question No 6 by (h 0886 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1633>I should like to begin by saying that, I think, the President-in-Office of the Council has not yet replied to the question by Mr korokas.</seg>
<seg id=1634>We must now implement this agency and I think that the awareness of the European authorities are strong and that we will have to move forward.</seg>
<seg id=1635>Specifically, the representative of the Presidency, in this case the Ambassador of France in Algeria, he met Mr Ahmed taleb?</seg>
<seg id=1636>We welcome the proposed provisions in this respect by the preparatory committee and decided by the general meeting with regard to the method of accreditation of non-governmental organisations, the preparatory process and to the special session in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1637>The partnership has several references to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=1638>As the Council has argued from the honourable Member in his earlier answer, the process of mutual recognition of criminal decisions will better protection of the rights of individuals.</seg>
<seg id=1639>I would like to urge.</seg>
<seg id=1640>It ensures specifically the political control and strategic leadership of a military operation of crisis management.</seg>
<seg id=1641>I would simply like to remind you that the system of the Treaty makes a difference in treatment between the tax and indirect taxes in which harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and operation of the internal market - that is Article 93, and the rapprochement, provided for in Article 94, laws which have a direct impact on the establishment and the functioning of the common market, amongst which are those concerning the direct taxation.</seg>
<seg id=1642>Let us say briefly on these three main areas.</seg>
<seg id=1643>If the traditional attitude following 'when in doubt, remain enemies' continues, this could explode the Stability Pact in southern Europe based on the principle of regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1644>We also need cooperation with Yugoslavia and more specifically of a bilateral cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1645>Mr President, our group supports the work done by Mr Baltas regarding the report on the possibility of negotiating a stabilisation and association agreement with the Republic of Croatia.</seg>
<seg id=1646>Mr President, I had, over the years I have exercised the mandate of President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the opportunity is supporting many Croats in their efforts towards freedom and prosperity they identifiaient to their integration into the European institutions, like the other peoples of our continent.</seg>
<seg id=1647>In view of the results achieved by Croatia this year, I admit that I do not doubt our ability to make progress with great speed.</seg>
<seg id=1648>That is what we think, and the speed with which we have adjusted our policy towards Croatia in recent months witness.</seg>
<seg id=1649>We have to Croatia to bring the government and the people of that country all the aid as possible in the coming years and we are very grateful to the honourable Member who has the wisdom to encourage us to continue along this path.</seg>
<seg id=1650>In this connection, it is incomprehensible that thousands of Laskar Jihad States have been able, in the spring, go in the Moluccas to stir up again conflicts.</seg>
<seg id=1651>In Timor, the militias blocking the return of refugees and the first-aid are harassed.</seg>
<seg id=1652>On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I shall confine myself to three points.</seg>
<seg id=1653>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen for her excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1654>However, in this respect, the country is no exception.</seg>
<seg id=1655>The continuing violence which are the theatre the province of Aceh, the Moluccas and Irian Jaya cause great suffering of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1656>Tomorrow, we remettrons the Sakharov Prize.</seg>
<seg id=1657>The latest news from the Indonesian archipelago compel us, however, to ask ourselves whether the situation of President Wahid and its faithful is not even more serious, more critical than proposed by the rapporteur's analysis.</seg>
<seg id=1658>If we want to help Indonesia, we must speak now with money and concrete action, and not just with words.</seg>
<seg id=1659>This report is extremely valuable because it sheds light on the development of events.</seg>
<seg id=1660>It is clear that the difficulties in Indonesia will not be resolved in a day.</seg>
<seg id=1661>Protection of financial interests of the Communities</seg>
<seg id=1662>The obstacles to its independence, both in the recruitment of personnel in terms of its structure, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id=1663>It is therefore essential that by a process of internal reform, the Commission finally concrete declared its desire to no longer tolerate any fraud and pursue them accordingly.</seg>
<seg id=1664>I think that is something which should result, and which must also result in Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1665>We would like the Member States initiate negotiations with a view to the adoption of a uniform legislation in the field of crime, but we reject that our countries are dependent on a public prosecutor federal arising out of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1666>I would also like to know why the publication of the Commission communication on the subject has been postponed to the next day the Danish referendum on the euro.</seg>
<seg id=1667>I have tabled an amendment seeking to designate these countries by name, because it is time to state clearly that they are met and that they should be ashamed of.</seg>
<seg id=1668>I am sure that OLAF feels that it is in its interests to make transparent the choice of its senior leaders.</seg>
<seg id=1669>However, we must ensure, in the European Parliament, to not to miss the beam in which it is in our power to focus on the mote in, which is a neighbour of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1670>We are trying to extinguish the fire, but the smoke we made suffoquer.</seg>
<seg id=1671>Nobody can understand this, I am either.</seg>
<seg id=1672>So far in this connection, I would like to highlight four points which I consider to be fundamental in the work of the authority of budgetary control.</seg>
<seg id=1673>In the Parliament itself, the problem is the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1674>It is also worrying enough, Commissioner, that the Commission - the guardian of the Treaties - should be explicitly mentioned off with regard to respect for the rights of Members.</seg>
<seg id=1675>The latter could for example recommend to the Committee on Budgets to freeze or reducing the amount of appropriations earmarked for the budget lines in the budget for next year, or not to allow any transfer of funds, when it comes to raising the budget lines and that, until the end of the internal investigations under way. It can go up to request that the President of the Commission requires the resignation of the Commissioners concerned by the serious problems which have been observed, a European césarienne in some way.</seg>
<seg id=1676>The report calls for the inventories of detailed operational activities, detailed examinations of budget lines and irregularities and an internal audit of the parliamentary committee.</seg>
<seg id=1677>Commissioner, the legal basis for the transmission of information to the European Parliament is the EC Treaty and not the interinstitutional agreement.</seg>
<seg id=1678>Without amendments, the final result of this common position would however an unequal weapons not only in relation to North America, but also in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1679>I really do not see why we did not aboutirions here as in all other cases at a compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1680>There is a proposal that has come a long - and, I fear - sinueux path, to overcome certain existing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id=1681>The first amendment relates to Article 4, which sets out what should be the competent authority to control the supply.</seg>
<seg id=1682>Now we are left with a proposal which would lead to a genuine pagaïe, a fair to empoigne with its trail of potential disputes at a delicate moment in the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=1683>In the UK, the rules on occasions, by means of the voluntary code of practice implemented by the Commission on take-over bids, is a success story: this is a good example of pragmatic approach of a highly complex problem where legislation would be more appropriate.</seg>
<seg id=1684>But what is even more important is that it enables us to press forward the Lisbon Agenda aimed at the creation of a European economy competitive and dynamic.</seg>
<seg id=1685>The important thing for us here in the European Parliament is ultimately the conflicting interests, for example, the directory versus the shareholders, the major shareholders versus small shareholders, business versus the financial market, regulated form minimal at EU level.</seg>
<seg id=1686>Some amendments proposed by Parliament provide other improvements to the text of the Council's common position they are in fact point to the points which may give rise to difficulties of interpretation and insist on a more rapid transposition of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1687>Indeed, there is absolutely no doubt that the definition of fair price that is proposed is better than another, because the definitions used in the Member States currently sufficient all amply.</seg>
<seg id=1688>In the debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1689>Moreover, for a period of three years, the artist will have the right to require professionals of the art market any information on the amounts which are due to him, which is sensible because they have to keep a register of purchases and sales.</seg>
<seg id=1690>Therefore, it is the Austrian legislators who is targeted and not the European legislator that creates the framework conditions for the positive artists and chambers of sale.</seg>
<seg id=1691>Moreover, in the issue before us, the need for a common position is all the more that only a common position will enable the European Union's influence at international level to ensure that the interests of artists can be defended at world level.</seg>
<seg id=1692>I trust in the wisdom and the judgement of this House.</seg>
<seg id=1693>In Germany, for example, in 1998 on 7 000 artists which have transferred their rights, 274 only have finally recovered and money, not to mention that 40% of the resale right has fallen in recovery costs of amounts owed.</seg>
<seg id=1694>In short, there is no need for harmonization of this kind in the sector.</seg>
<seg id=1695>A similar amendment had been rejected at first reading.</seg>
<seg id=1696>They thought that the translations could follow in spite of this very tight timetable and difficult.</seg>
<seg id=1697>Only, we came to such an extent that we can no longer put off this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1698>We have proposed in the Commission to proceed a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id=1699>Our Parliament is naturally on the part of those values and we will always continue to defend them.</seg>
<seg id=1700>Technological developments and the fluctuations of markets lead to changes in any case.</seg>
<seg id=1701>Here, we cannot find a legal justification for an exclusion of competition.</seg>
<seg id=1702>The restriction of the universal service - the pillar of the postal sector - to 50 grams of risk putting the governed national positions in a difficult situation, in that they can find it hard to provide a universal service at an affordable price to citizens, regardless of their place of residence.</seg>
<seg id=1703>I would remind my Conservative colleagues the problems they have had in the United Kingdom when they have tried to privatize the British posts.</seg>
<seg id=1704>We have no more nor less transformed the safety net of users of the postal service in a hamac in which the main players in the postal sector can continue to vautrer and act in freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1705>I am very happy because, after all, this notion of special services claimed to new technologies outside the scope of universal service.</seg>
<seg id=1706>Madam President, Commissioner, we cannot tolerate and will not tolerate such a situation.</seg>
<seg id=1707>That is why the European Commission has not proposed, as a second stage, total liberalisation of this sector.</seg>
<seg id=1708>This is a development of this type that I wish to other States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1709>Mr Bolkestein has recently condemned the attitude of the French too liberal in the Dutch press, at least that is what heralded the title of the article in question.</seg>
<seg id=1710>In this connection, we could cite Spain, which was a fund of this type, and which uses the legal framework for this talk of random on which the Fund is based, the criteria relating to its composition, of virtual avals discretionary of its application.</seg>
<seg id=1711>We are voting on tomorrow: I hope that this vote will take place before the amendment by Mr Atkins or that of Mr Sterckx, otherwise I shall vote against this report.</seg>
<seg id=1712>Royal Mail participates in competition, and distribue my letter in Malmö in Sweden.</seg>
<seg id=1713>Madam President, Commissioner, that we have learned from the debate, or rather the controversy caused by Commissioner Bolkestein in its pursuit of a liberalisation of postal services company, in the absence of any assessment of the first stage and in violation of the rules laid down by this directive, under the guise of terms such as modernising and enhancing progressive liberalisation, monitoring of essors technological, been bascule in a quality social regression of a country.</seg>
<seg id=1714>The maintenance of the universal service means of a compensation fund which could initiate private profits for the benefit of the public service will probably deal fire.</seg>
<seg id=1715>These limits and these delays have also contributed to a debate in which one's often confuses the end and the means.</seg>
<seg id=1716>We cannot discuss this issue, Madam President, not to mention the economic and social cohesion.</seg>
<seg id=1717>Madam President, first of all let me congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, because it has actually work complex, difficult and he has tried to strike a balance between the positions and proposals, points of departure and arrival are completely different.</seg>
<seg id=1718>I fear that this proposal is further strengthens the current position of monopolists the taxpayers' expense and increasing the limits imposed on newcomers.</seg>
<seg id=1719>I am also glad to see that our liberal friends of continental show an example to the British Liberals.</seg>
<seg id=1720>Admittedly, I admit that liberalisation in itself is not a problem and that it may prove to be beneficial to consumers.</seg>
<seg id=1721>Is justified because it is in line with the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union, which put forward the completion of the internal market by the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id=1722>The universal service is the cornerstone of Community policy in this field and everything we do is to create a climate conducive to improve it.</seg>
<seg id=1723>With special services is also a sector where innovation and modernisation must be encouraged.</seg>
<seg id=1724>According to him, by the end of the decade, opening to competition of almost all of the postal market seems inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=1725>I think we need firm guarantees in order to preserve the constantly and universal service obligations.</seg>
<seg id=1726>That is why I cannot and do not will remain silent while the future of the sector is threatened by a possible decision which would result in not to respond properly to the challenges that we have been launched to anyone in Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id=1727>Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.</seg>
<seg id=1728>However, I would remind you that this common organisation of the market main purpose the guaranteed access to the Community market of its products.</seg>
<seg id=1729>I am glad that we have been able to reach a unanimous vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development I would like to thank my colleagues Mr Fernández Martín, as rapporteur of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, for his support.</seg>
<seg id=1730>We cannot prevent us from expressing our concern for the production of bananas in ACP countries, countries of small producers in the West Indies and some of the West African countries which are the traditional suppliers of the banana market and with whom we have made commitments that we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id=1731>Therefore, I hope that this report be supported as a whole by Members of this House, as was the case in the Committee on Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=1732>Meanwhile, the US condemn initially reference periods historical but advocate now their own historical reference periods.</seg>
<seg id=1733>Powerful interests come into play, especially those of the Americans, who are not themselves of banana producers, but which have hidden the American capital in commercial companies.</seg>
<seg id=1734>Sometimes it seems that the Commission, in the proposals of the deregulation of trade and agricultural production at international level, goes further than the Cairns Group.</seg>
<seg id=1735>It is a pity that the Commission and the Council persist in a solution which could seriously endanger the production, particularly after 2006.</seg>
<seg id=1736>Successive decisions of the WTO does not say that it is forbidden to give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers.</seg>
<seg id=1737>Thus, the transitional period should be for some fifteen years and in no way inferior to ten years; compensatory payments must include the guaranteed income of Community producers and the disposal of production in the outermost regions should also include an aid entities that marketing bananas which are produced.</seg>
<seg id=1738>I hope that it will listen today our arguments, because this system proposed by the Commission, this tariff preference, even of EUR 300, will prove very useful in practice because ACP producers will be hot-rolled said by the system of 'first come, first served.</seg>
<seg id=1739>Votes</seg>
<seg id=1740>(Parliament approved the proposal by the Commission)</seg>
<seg id=1741>The Commission rejects the other amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1742>Before the vote:.</seg>
<seg id=1743>(The House accepts the oral amendment)</seg>
<seg id=1744>Report (A5-0376 / 2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the reform of the institutions and procedures of budgetary control (2000 / 2008 (INI))</seg>
<seg id=1745>Most smokers are not familiar with all the risks and will bear the real price of their choice.</seg>
<seg id=1746>I am always held to this principle during my long parliamentary career of 35 years.</seg>
<seg id=1747>I am afraid that their hopes are in vain.</seg>
<seg id=1748>This is our ultimate attempt to put on cigarette packets of labels and the pictures which reflect the real dangers of smoking.</seg>
<seg id=1749>Lehne report (A5-0368 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1750>This analysis is both relevant and justified even today, and that is why I voted against this report in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id=1751>It is right in saying that the Committee on Legal Affairs continues in the refusal of a ceiling and the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be less than 7%.</seg>
<seg id=1752>To oppose this directive for my Group is also a way to give a clear political signal: we must not lose our time in Europe to create unnecessary rules.</seg>
<seg id=1753>It is right to denounce the Stalinist dictatorship of antan, how can we allow the slightest confidence in Putin, the sacrificer the Chechen people, the godfather of the various mafias, who is trying to liquidate all opposition, civil society, political parties (trade unions), in order to enhance their personal power?</seg>
<seg id=1754>Admittedly, Indonesia does not deserve such a development relations because we cannot say that, in recent years, its leaders have distinguished by their great democratic spirit and by their great merits, but we must take into account the Indonesian citizens, and therefore agree to the development of relations and this aid.</seg>
<seg id=1755>The unit will deal that criminal acts committed by officials of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1756>The Theato report on fraud prevention enables us to discover that the European Central Bank, probably in order to prove its so-called independence, did not consider it appropriate to accede to the agreement on the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).</seg>
<seg id=1757>That concludes the vote.</seg>
<seg id=1758>Either we are part of the club, or we are not and we must therefore we bow to that decision.</seg>
<seg id=1759>It is not called therefore not at all - EEB everything but does not aim bananas. provoquons, ladies and gentlemen, a change of name.</seg>
<seg id=1760>The tariff only system, however, is an important element which ensures the balance of the Commission proposal and is an important basis which must enable the Council to make progress.</seg>
<seg id=1761>There are also measures for the labelling of these bananas at national and regional programmes to promote rural development.</seg>
<seg id=1762>Europe and the United States works closely with the defence of the values we share.</seg>
<seg id=1763>We are discussing a new WTO round and the implications for this round the many bilateral trade initiatives which are the subject of debates in the American hemisphere.</seg>
<seg id=1764>He has said, rightly, that transatlantic relations have developed very much over the past decade - to a large extent, it is true, the American side thanks to President Clinton; but I believe that history will note that there has also been a European contribution to these new relationship - contribution quite fundamental - with the 1990 transatlantic declaration and the new transatlantic agenda adopted during the Spanish Presidency in December 1995.</seg>
<seg id=1765>It will therefore be important to undertake a reversal of the work and in fact consist of a transatlantic agenda for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1766>I will conclude with the Dominican Republic who said: 'the WTO was supposed to be an impartial referee applying common rules and where individual countries could learn to play the game.</seg>
<seg id=1767>Secondly, even if We can be delighted at the fall of the Communist sham, the collapse of the Soviet Union has left a superpower: the United States of America.</seg>
<seg id=1768>I know that it maintains a dialogue with Parliament and with the committees which deal with these issues.</seg>
<seg id=1769>The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:</seg>
<seg id=1770>These objectives, the primary objective and the secondary objectives, will represent the stone of hitting enabling us to judge the concrete proposals presented by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1771>It is clear that such a solution - the registration in one country, the possibility of providing services throughout the Union - can cause an avalanche in countries where the rate of taxation is low.</seg>
<seg id=1772>Thus, an agreement was reached in 1992, considered at the time as minimum harmonisation, which provided that the standard VAT rate could be below 15%, Member States with the possibility of applying a reduced rates or several that cannot be below 5%; the derogations provided for in this case.</seg>
<seg id=1773>We have asked the European Commission to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and to submit a report on this issue to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1774>In short, the objective of this proposal is laudable but the method is ill-conceived and if we really want to encourage the e-economy in Europe, it would be good to provide our e-commerce VAT rather than try to impose our problems to others.</seg>
<seg id=1775>If we are to meet the requirement for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases effects, we must take all possible measures to reduce its production.</seg>
<seg id=1776>The only case for which no tax is still perceived "is an example of supply in the European Community from a third country.</seg>
<seg id=1777>Positive discrimination against the air transport must stop.</seg>
<seg id=1778>The companies from third countries that are not Members of the Union are not subject to any tax.</seg>
<seg id=1779>The discs compacts are not so archaic and they should be tax, while the programmes which circuleraient by Internet sales would!</seg>
<seg id=1780>However, the solution can only be technically unworkable and obstruct the development of online transactions in the European Union, precisely at a time when everyone wants, on the contrary, their expansion.</seg>
<seg id=1781>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the European Union is degrade and lose in return.</seg>
<seg id=1782>We should endeavour to promote electronic commerce and not to new ways of the tax.</seg>
<seg id=1783>The Liberals are telling us that we must be less state possible.</seg>
<seg id=1784>The Primarolo group has made a simple rules that must be applied.</seg>
<seg id=1785>The group I represent in this House, however, makes an objection and thinks that it should balance the situation between the newspapers, which enjoy a reduced rate of VAT, and the daily online, who do not enjoy.</seg>
<seg id=1786>A tax on kerosene cannot therefore that exist in the context of an international consensus, to ensure the balance of competition.</seg>
<seg id=1787>I particularly welcome the fact that the report highlights one of the key points that I raised in my report for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism voted by this Parliament a few months ago, namely that, since he is certainly politically difficult to reach an international agreement on the taxation of aviation, at least in the short term, we should use the tools alternative to obtain the same effect, including a tax on emissions.</seg>
<seg id=1788>In fact, the industry pay 100% of its infrastructure costs through the air traffic control and airport charges, which is settled at USD 4 billion in 1998 - in contrast to other modes of transport, such as rail transport by road, or which are still very subsidised.</seg>
<seg id=1789>The current situation is against.</seg>
<seg id=1790>In this regard, it must be noted that there is a bit of a problem with regard to emissions caused by air traffic; although the percentage is not so high, it is increasing significantly and therefore we cannot underestimate the.</seg>
<seg id=1791>This system would be detrimental to the SMEs within and outside the European Union and especially if we consider the proposed reduction of the exemption threshold excessively low level of EUR 40 000 of annual turnover.</seg>
<seg id=1792>If we are too greedy regarding the case in question, we are really endangering the future of electronic commerce, important for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1793>The principle that wanting suppliers from outside the Community and making of services to customers within the Community should be registered that in one place must not lead to a shift in tax revenue between Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1794>Since the debate has not yet been completed within the Council, and given that the Commission wants to bring to an end the issue of VAT and electronic commerce fairly quickly, I think it would be wiser to not yet formally accept the proposals for amendments made by Parliament but to try to come the greatest possible number of these proposals in the Council negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=1795>I therefore cannot accept the amendments proposed.</seg>
<seg id=1796>Thank you very much for all the issues that you have addressed this week.</seg>
<seg id=1797>Only three months after the accident, the Commission, for its part, has assumed its responsibilities by adopting a first package of measures, that the European Parliament has fully endorsed on 30 November.</seg>
<seg id=1798>With more than fifteen directives or regulations in force, it is, in fact, an urgent need to standardise practices and to exercise greater control on the application of Community rules, in order to avoid possible differences, important and unacceptable, within the Union in the field of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1799>Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her continuous commitment in the field of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1800>I would like to remind Members that in terms of air safety, compensation applied within Europe and in North American equivalent to the amounts are not applied in other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1801>Secondly, I would say that it is the French courts which may confiscate or a company to freeze funds for compensating damage or some other; it is the French courts which may establish responsibilities beyond those provided according to the criteria of the current international regulations on pollution by hydrocarbons.</seg>
<seg id=1802>The Commission considers that such adjustments in the direction of the establishment of a system of tax fairer which also promotes a more rational and efficient use of the road network.</seg>
<seg id=1803>Faced with the criticism, especially those in Ireland and France, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, gave a different interpretation: it is now a tax for all users, including the British drivers of heavy goods vehicles.</seg>
<seg id=1804>I am determined to ensure that the proposed food consumers responds to the strictest standards, for it comes from within and from outside the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1805>Of course I understand the concern of the honourable Member.</seg>
<seg id=1806>I am sorry to say, Commissioner, that your reply, I do not need.</seg>
<seg id=1807>As the honourable Member's remarks are important.</seg>
<seg id=1808>In Nigeria, the indigenous people all ijaw Chevron have accused of encouraging the violence against them and to go up to pay Nigerian soldiers to draw on the demonstrators at the naval base of Warri.</seg>
<seg id=1809>In her report adopted on 15 November, the Commission concluded that operating aid granted under the Regulation 1540 / 98 did not solve the problem of prices by South Korea.</seg>
<seg id=1810>I believe that all the intentions is very reassuring, but in the meantime, the fact is that our shipyards are close down.</seg>
<seg id=1811>Question No 38 by ((H-0868 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1812>I understand, Commissioner, that you do not want to change your decision, despite the fact that ten Member States are opposed to such customs duties.</seg>
<seg id=1813>This initiative is based on a Council Regulation amending Council Regulation, which defines the current GSP.</seg>
<seg id=1814>I represent some farmers and I am therefore extremely concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1815>We are working on it in committee, we have not taken this week, Poul Nielson is not present due to travel in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg id=1816>We are working on the safeguard clause and if Mr Clegg needs of arguments, to talk with its beet, I want the at its disposal.</seg>
<seg id=1817>I would like to thank Mr Liikanen for his reply, which is entirely in a very positive and worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id=1818>I will be discussing with my services when the budget for next year will be defined.</seg>
<seg id=1819>Currently, the efforts made by my services and I seek to limit the consequences of the distance between the parties and the future Court.</seg>
<seg id=1820>Like the specialized courts in patent law in Düsseldorf, Munich and other German cities, but also of London, a court Community jurisdiction for Community patent should be very specialised.</seg>
<seg id=1821>In order to prevent this provisional takes a definitive nature, the Commission, on 13 July of last year, has said in a letter to the Member States concerned their obligation to indicate what are their competent courts on the Community trade mark.</seg>
<seg id=1822>As the honourable Member will know, the tabling of a complaint in itself has no influence on the progress of the project in question.</seg>
<seg id=1823>Question No 47 by (h 0877 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1824>This means that the Commission does not use the legal means at its disposal that in the course of the regulation.</seg>
<seg id=1825>The question is how to which to address these students to understand that, when they are following this cycle of studies and the achèvent in Britain, they have the right to have results.</seg>
<seg id=1826>The King, elected for a limited period, could, for example, be chosen from among the most MEPs Finnish méritants.</seg>
<seg id=1827>It may also be seen as a question of competition, because one can continue to practise duty-free sales in the southern part of the Baltic, the line between Stockholm and Helsinki, whereas they are banned on the line between Umeå and Vasa.</seg>
<seg id=1828>We must rectify the situation by stimulating and encouraging the multilingual content, since he is an absolutely crucial for the success of the European sector content.</seg>
<seg id=1829>The problem that concerns me most is that small businesses do not always have sufficient guarantees, nor the background commercial established to give investors.</seg>
<seg id=1830>In order to carry out the ambitious development of this European e-content programme, we must simplify the procedures and secure envisaged.</seg>
<seg id=1831>For this reason, the measures for public subsidies in favour of the content industry of the EU (their usefulness has been demonstrated) should also move towards a culture and a high level of education and to cultural diversity.</seg>
<seg id=1832>On the other hand, there are the communication networks who need to fulfil their content is constantly virtual area and who regard for granted, to submit the content of the accaparer and use them without bothering really production rules.</seg>
<seg id=1833>Mr President, I welcome the launch of this programme content and would like to draw attention to two aspects.</seg>
<seg id=1834>That is why I support the amendments calling for the adoption of specific actions in the field of new technologies.</seg>
<seg id=1835>Firstly, the Commission welcomes the fact that the European Parliament highlights the social and cultural dimension of digital content.</seg>
<seg id=1836>Assessment and management of environmental noise</seg>
<seg id=1837>Indeed, I am grateful for the support that the Christian Democrats, and, moreover, also part of the Liberal Group, have contributed to this amendment concrete, to begin to reduce aircraft noise.</seg>
<seg id=1838>It is not that this year, six years late, and insistent under the pressure of the French Government, that the Commission presented its proposal of indicators of harmonised noise.</seg>
<seg id=1839>This is a proposal moderate. The Scandinavia has already stricter standards than those proposed for 2012.</seg>
<seg id=1840>Orly Schiphol, Barcelona, and other already comply with strict requirements.</seg>
<seg id=1841>Another important point made by and which we will all its importance in the context of the problems of noise emissions from aeroplanes, concerned the need to provide additional evidence of noise in addition to that mentioned by the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=1842>Lack of common standards in the European Union, we have seen situations of well-known distortion of competition between airports and a lack of equality between citizens of the various Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1843>That is why I find the amendments of my colleague Mr Bernd Lange so important.</seg>
<seg id=1844>Firstly, I must say that I welcome this report.</seg>
<seg id=1845>This was the idea of principle which dominated under Amendment No 36, although I think that this idea is not yet sufficiently mûrie.</seg>
<seg id=1846>We should examine this carefully and adopt the combined approach on the two plans, i.e. establish limit values for each source of emissions on the one hand and on the other hand, to define quality standards for emissions.</seg>
<seg id=1847>We needed more time and I regret that we do not have not prepared, even if, in general, I support the framework directive.</seg>
<seg id=1848>Now that the Member States have provided information comparable, the Commission will take into account the question of maximum values at Community level, as well as other measures to reduce the number of people affected by the noise and to refer to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1849>The food additives other than colours and sweeteners</seg>
<seg id=1850>These are the three criteria.</seg>
<seg id=1851>Thank you, Sir. I feel solidarity of your question, for if you have a carrot in the way of throat, I for my part, a cat in throat, as is said here, but the flu short somewhat here.</seg>
<seg id=1852>Furthermore, in the event of problems dietary chronic, increases the risk of cancer.</seg>
<seg id=1853>It is then also emerged that the Commission did not have the appropriate instruments to intervene appropriately.</seg>
<seg id=1854>Tomorrow, a new stage is included in the programme. our colleague Mrs Paulsen, the Liberal Group, will then be selle and will have an opportunity to further improve the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1855>The Member States and Commission now have a better instrument for ensuring that Community law in the field of animal nutrition is properly applied and to ensure that, in the event of crisis situations occur in third countries, rapid responses are possible.</seg>
<seg id=1856>We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities and that up to now, it is mainly the cities' which have been the poor relations' in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1857>The process of planning must be implemented in a fair and innovative.</seg>
<seg id=1858>The multiannual programme 2000-2004 for sustainable development in urban areas is an appropriate instrument to achieve this, along with the application of Agenda 21 is an excellent way of coordination and the development of actions.</seg>
<seg id=1859>The reduction in transport and the abandonment of fossil fuels at local level are required to bring about a change from the point of view of climatic threats we are experiencing now.</seg>
<seg id=1860>Many people have suggested that this budget was too small.</seg>
<seg id=1861>It is intended that the main partners in this framework that the Commission and the networks of the local authorities whose legal responsibility is to develop and implement policies on sustainable development in urban areas.</seg>
<seg id=1862>The Court of Justice and even the bodies of the WTO dispute settlement to see that the precautionary principle is to apply the environmental or in terms of public health, and sometimes even against Europeans, as shown by the matter pending milk and cheese believed.</seg>
<seg id=1863>The objective must not be a restriction of harm or its compensation, the aim must be to prevent any adverse effect on our health or on the assets of persons.</seg>
<seg id=1864>In 1996, the European Parliament was in favour of a ban on the use of meat meal in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only we had listened to.</seg>
<seg id=1865>An absolute scientific certainty on new products or substances does not exist and is will never.</seg>
<seg id=1866>To conclude, if the precautionary principle must be implemented in an effective and credible, it is vital to involve all the key players, including the representatives of civil society, in the political choices surrounding its implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1867>Finally, health and the environment must take precedence over other considerations, particularly those of economic order.</seg>
<seg id=1868>An essential condition related to the application of the precautionary principle is that the concerns about the possible harmful effects are vested with a scientific basis.</seg>
<seg id=1869>Yesterday, in Lisbon, an American professor George, Carlo, who has entrusted with a study on the effect of the waves to human health from the Food and Drugs Administration, has revealed that the use of mobile phones risk of causing the appearance of brain tumours, of Alzheimer's disease and injuries skin.</seg>
<seg id=1870>Mr President, the environment and public health are such a machine that the complexity is such that we must monitor and control its multiple functions in order to be able to intervene and thereby prevent problems.</seg>
<seg id=1871>The application of this principle must avoid at all costs to curb innovation and economic activity, to create the cautious and the stagnation industrial, to become a means to deflect competition.</seg>
<seg id=1872>Parliament has certainly noticed that the Commission agrees with most of the issues raised in the motion for a resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1873>The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=1874>Article 2 enshrines the right to life and whenever in Spain terrorism kills a person, it is the whole of the European Union who feels involved in what is one of its most essential principles.</seg>
<seg id=1875>It is not our intention to replace the institutions legitimately established, but to encourage them to protect our rights and our freedoms without making any concessions to terror.</seg>
<seg id=1876>Votes</seg>
<seg id=1877>It has also reminded the observation of the Council on the classification of budget lines on the draft retirement from the Commission and on administrative expenditure of the fisheries agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1878>(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1879>I think that this is no longer present!</seg>
<seg id=1880>Recent estimeront that the number of 23 428 is insufficient, but they are nonetheless contentes of the area of growth which they are offered.</seg>
<seg id=1881>This deletion, which started from the middle of last year, as we feared has resulted in a dramatic fall in the rate of adoption of projects and of payments so that the annual implementation of licences for this Fund was less than 1% at the end of June 2000.</seg>
<seg id=1882>This text is an ideal carte blanche for closing the General Secretariat of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id=1883>Before I left, they told me: 'it is Christmas, and we, in Bergamo, we celebrate Christmas and St Lucia.</seg>
<seg id=1884>Above all, we are very critical of the overproduction of agricultural products and the use of resources for information from the EU to sell this surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1885>Mr President, I voted for the García-Margallo y Marfil report, which concerns the taxation of services provided by electronic means.</seg>
<seg id=1886>Mr President, I will try, before 2004, to do something to Malta by making a statement in favour of it.</seg>
<seg id=1887>However, I say this with a certain solemnity: it is the maximum that I can accept a Europe which is, in my view, too liberal!</seg>
<seg id=1888>The date of deadline would encourage posts to develop and to modernise their services and to facilitate the planning and investment on the market.</seg>
<seg id=1889>They will continue to put pressure on the money they earned with distribution beyond the bounds of 150 grams enables them to improve their position.</seg>
<seg id=1890>The liberalisation of postal services proposed by the Commission is neither appropriate nor consistent, which is why I voted for the report and all amendments which are expressed this same approach.</seg>
<seg id=1891>De Roo report (A5-0378 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1892>Not being convinced of their compatibility with the WTO, we have also have reservations on Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31.</seg>
<seg id=1893>A globalisation which despises the most basic rights of the human being.</seg>
<seg id=1894>This would be contrary to respect for the national identity (Article 6 (3) of the Treaty of the European Union).</seg>
<seg id=1895>It must be stressed that the linguistic minorities, instead of being écrasées by globalisation Internet, have found new openings cultural and economic.</seg>
<seg id=1896>Mr President, in the absence of other results, the haggling of Nice have informed the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1897>The tone of the joint resolution is, at this point of view, far too one-sided.</seg>
<seg id=1898>The delay in the publication of written conclusions - which have not yet been officially available at the moment, four days later - shows how difficult to compile clear decisions taken in confusion.</seg>
<seg id=1899>The only way to avoid in future of dangerous conflicts, is to stick to the traditional view that Europe is based on mutual respect national communities.</seg>
<seg id=1900>The Nice Summit has achieved Sunday by an agreement that should lead to a draft Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1901>The resolution on the Nice Summit, which has just been passed, does not reflect the.</seg>
<seg id=1902>Finally, I would like to make a reference to the social policy, on which France misait during the presentation of his Presidency, but which is ultimately one hand full of very little, despite the declarations of intent and the titles of documents to content very vague and clearly inadequate compared with the existing problems and to the enormous dissatisfaction, whose demonstration of workers in Nice will have been an important expression also.</seg>
<seg id=1903>Obviously, there is nothing has changed for the really important issues as taxes, taxes, on social policy, asylum and immigration.</seg>
<seg id=1904>The fact saillant debate on Nice is the image of a treaty ultimately without father or mother, since it is anybody 's son. The French Presidency has confused in excuses, as opposed to take clearly the results of the IGC and their reasons; the political groups, which correspond to the governments of the Member States, have increased their criticisms.</seg>
<seg id=1905>On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies fall into force by the further restriction of the right of veto and to increasing the power of Parliament to the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1906>If one were to provide these consequences at the conclusion of the Treaty of Chicago during the year I was born, 1944 - no exemption from tax for fuel and other equipment for had no would probably have been agreed.</seg>
<seg id=1907>Zero risk does not exist, or at least the political scientists must apply the criterion of proportionality, judge the risks uncertain and assume their responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id=1908>This Parliament has, however, also fought for this reduction in the funds allocated to the innovative actions to be compensated for by the use of framework of flexibility, defined in a statement on the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1909>Everyone has a part to play. Indeed, we are moving in a global market of this is undeniable, and these are the innovations that will enable Europe to keep its place among the top of the technological developments in the new industries and, in particular, in the information technology, on the assumption, of course, that they receive the sufficient financial resources and support a realistic and appropriate.</seg>
<seg id=1910>During the previous speeches, a few words have been spoken about serious budget of EUR 400 million is not really that a minimum for funding and must, during the second half of the year, to take advantage of the opportunities for additional appropriations available under the flexibility instrument, as the report notes.</seg>
<seg id=1911>In my opinion, this must be accompanied by automatically to the loss of European added value, unlike the conclusion of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1912>As we all know, the European Union, unemployment focuses on the least-developed territories from the economic point of view and technological, above all the territories of Objective 1 must therefore be the innovative actions have not just a technical nature, but they come from an explicit desire to develop the economy and employment.</seg>
<seg id=1913>When I come back in my home region, in the East of England, and I see that no local authority has not used the money that it received during the last part-session, I doubt that we have shown great efficiency we need in future to host the new communities.</seg>
<seg id=1914>Mr President, my first words are to convey to Markov of my thanks and my congratulations on the extremely serious and constructive, competently presentation of the draft communication on these innovative measures of the ERDF for the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id=1915>Energy efficiency and the aspects of environmental policy have not been forgotten in these guidelines. They can give rise to of innovative measures under the third issue, which concerns regional identity and sustainable development.</seg>
<seg id=1916>We wish, however, that projects are selected at regional level, as well, including Mr Berend in her speech.</seg>
<seg id=1917>In the debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1918>That is why we are asking for in this report and in the three additional amendments that the Commission multiplies the international efforts to impose the procedure for settling disputes in the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1919>It seems to me that the Commissioner must show to the industry that it is doing everything possible to respond to this external threat hanging over it.</seg>
<seg id=1920>Finally, of course, we expect that, once the 18 December, at the meeting of the Group of Six OECD, the arrangement 'vessels' to be examined.</seg>
<seg id=1921>But it seems that the finishing line is every time postponed so that we will never reach the.</seg>
<seg id=1922>As you all know, this procedure will take more than six months.</seg>
<seg id=1923>For the major corporations as to their lawyers, political claim less state simply means that the state and its funding must be available to them exclusive.</seg>
<seg id=1924>But to achieve this, so that the process will enable us to consolidate the shipbuilding industry and employment and to reassure the families who depend on it, we must pursue the aid beyond 31 December 2000 because, on the market, we are not on an equal footing, there is unfair competition and of dumping practices.</seg>
<seg id=1925>To improve the competitiveness of shipyards, the EU is encouraged by the Commission, but the face of the massive dumping prices applied by Korea conceivable, the improvement of productivity is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id=1926>It has also stressed that the existence of this mechanism should not create distortions of competition within the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1927>The presence of nuclear submarine having a fault in the waters of the Bay of Algeciras has unfortunately turned into a diplomatic conflict between a military nuclear power and colonial and a second-class Member State, depending on the final classification of Nice, which is not assert its rights and is surrendering before explanations from childhood.</seg>
<seg id=1928>When, by means of the medical broadcast in the country's owner - in other words, by means of the British press - one's découvrit that the disease was serious, instead of the change of heart, they changèrent training centre.</seg>
<seg id=1929>Of course we await with interest the Commission's response to see if the objective has been achieved.</seg>
<seg id=1930>Mr President, I too wish first of all to express my condolences to the families of the murdered councillor and the Members of the Partido Popular, and reject this barbarity fascist by ETA and the groups which will protect.</seg>
<seg id=1931>I also think it is appropriate that the submarine Tireless emmené in Britain to be repaired, as soon as possible, when the climatic conditions appropriate permit.</seg>
<seg id=1932>Honourable Members have asked whether the Commission considers that Directive 89 / 618 / Euratom on information to the public on the health protection measures applicable and on the attitude to be adopted in the event of a radiological emergency and Directive 96 / 29 / Euratom laying down basic safety standards for the health protection of the population and workers against the dangers arising from ionizing radiation is applied in the case of the submarine and what measures had been taken accordingly.</seg>
<seg id=1933>If it is better that our advisers lawyer, I look forward to hearing the. So I come back to Article 37.</seg>
<seg id=1934>One aspect of the Euratom Treaty is the transportation of radioactive waste of a Member State of the European Union to another; but, as Gibraltar is, of course, part of the United Kingdom, all transport of waste will be a part of the United Kingdom to another without through another Member State of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1935>It is my opinion. It is sufficient merely to win the trust of the people living on the rock.</seg>
<seg id=1936>However, we see here a Member State which deals with the public opinion of another Member State as it would do with any state in the world, as if, in fact, there was no affectio societatis fifty years after the start of the European company, as if European solidarity was no progress.</seg>
<seg id=1937>It is a fact that, at one point, only submarine operating in the British waters was a German submarine.</seg>
<seg id=1938>The debate here, however, citizens based on their knowledge and their intuition, run their attention to the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1939>It is clear that a reduction in investment in new military equipment linked restrictions military budget decided on by the Labour Government multiply in future cases of withdrawal of military equipment to repair of substance.</seg>
<seg id=1940>However, it does not extend, contrary to what some people would wish, the classification of ports that are likely to receive submarines broken or questions of technical safety of nuclear reactors or the conditions under which a submarine needs to be sent to redress in another place.</seg>
<seg id=1941>We must, to help them more, asking the Community institutions to enhance the human and material resources, the UNHCR.</seg>
<seg id=1942>I would ask the Commission to increase again this aid the UNHCR and also to appoint the latter as the body coordination in all its contracts with NGOs.</seg>
<seg id=1943>It must therefore be able to access the civilian casualties and his staff on the ground should be deployed safely and have the necessary resources for carrying out their task.</seg>
<seg id=1944>On 22 November, the Commission adopted a communication on the establishment of a common asylum procedure and a uniform status on the granting of refugee valid throughout the Union which is tending towards this goal that the common European asylum system agreed at Tampere.</seg>
<seg id=1945>I shall conclude by paying tribute to the work that Mrs Ogata has done for the UNHCR and wishing to welcome Mr Ruud Lubbers for his new post.</seg>
<seg id=1946>We believe it is important to encourage an amnesty policy in Yugoslavia for the restoration of democracy, but it is also important to condemn without doubt the resumption of incursions and terrorist activities at the borders between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo because they alarmingly reminiscent of what happened during the Kosovo conflict, where Western powers have certain responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id=1947>Our compromise resolution is clear in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.</seg>
<seg id=1948>I would also call on the President Kostunica to explain what it happened to people like Mr Ukshin Hoti, whose fate, that we have no idea, we are interested in the highest degree.</seg>
<seg id=1949>I also agree with the fact of appealing to the KFOR in order to prevent any attempt to violence on the Preševo Valley.</seg>
<seg id=1950>I welcome the measures taken now by KFOR to deal with the problem and I continue to call on all parties to the moderation.</seg>
<seg id=1951>B5 0916 / 2000 by Mr Barón Crespo and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1952>This clause was agreed at the Moneda palace in March 1990 and I know because I had the privilege to be present during the taking of possession of President alwyn, after the plebiscite which brought an end to General Pinochet's regime.</seg>
<seg id=1953>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak on the joint resolution that of course we will.</seg>
<seg id=1954>It is necessary that the international community is exercising its right to democratic scrutiny, not as interference in the internal affairs of an independent country, but as a political procedure, cautious and preventive action.</seg>
<seg id=1955>The situation in the prisons and in the police stations is totally unacceptable, partly of mistreatment and torture that are very widespread.</seg>
<seg id=1956>This treatment would be exactly similar to that seen in Western Europe and the Minister hikmet Sami al-Turk, faced with these protests, has deferred the transfer, so that social and political consensus on the reform of the prisons develops throughout Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1957>There is urgency and that is why we have decided to put this item on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1958>It happening in trial on 8 January. he is accused of taking part in a meeting of Tunisian opponents in France, what to do deny it.</seg>
<seg id=1959>When the campaigners and responsible for these associations are keen to meet the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, their homes are encerclées by police and those involved in making it attacked the streets by men in civil law.</seg>
<seg id=1960>The second problem is really only one example of many harassed.</seg>
<seg id=1961>My group, like this Parliament, is particularly sensitive to the human rights situation in Tunisia and in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1962>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us a bit of measure please.</seg>
<seg id=1963>The negotiations were extremely well spent, I am delighted that we have made great progress in these negotiations, which I hope will lead to the conclusion that the honourable Member referred.</seg>
<seg id=1964>Several Members have mentioned the situation of prisoners in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1965>B5 0912 / 2000 by Mr Van Hecke on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1966>We cannot be, I believe, Mr President, Commissioner, by withdrawing on this attitude.</seg>
<seg id=1967>The military have taken power in this context, which, as always, has only worsen the situation.</seg>
<seg id=1968>This attitude is, in the continuity of the policy of the French imperialism.</seg>
<seg id=1969>The Commission is also very concerned about the recent outbreaks of violence.</seg>
<seg id=1970>The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1971>Unfair competition worse can contribute to the quality of the working environment in the shipbuilding sector, to reduce the technical knowledge and lead to a loss of jobs and, in the longer term, lead to a situation of monopoly, which would be detrimental to world trade.</seg>
<seg id=1972>Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg id=1973>That is why I thank all my colleagues for the contribution they have made, particularly during the stage of the amendments, as well as the technical committee on which the valuable assistance being allowed to finalise this resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1974>The adoption of the social agenda by the Nice European Council satisfies us wholeheartedly and we hope that the Member States will take this opportunity to promote development and the coordination of social insurance systems in and care for the elderly and promote also other measures which will ensure the reintegration into working life, as is the of lifelong learning.</seg>
<seg id=1975>The promotion of lifelong learning, a subject mentioned by another speaker - is an issue which I also support.</seg>
<seg id=1976>Of course, the people of over 60 or 70 years can still make many useful things, but it is not right to depend on their labour income they provide.</seg>
<seg id=1977>In its monthly bulletin of July 2000, the European Central Bank has launched several urgent warnings about this.</seg>
<seg id=1978>For my part, I believe that the Member States are better able to solve this problem through their legislative instruments.</seg>
<seg id=1979>With its proposals for an active life during the old age, society gaining a whole generation.</seg>
<seg id=1980>The promises on pensions must be held in pensions, however, be guaranteed by the funds in these countries without that their payments at the expense of the common monetary policy of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1981>We have experienced a most important social revolutions over 100 for 150 years, when our life expectancy has doubled.</seg>
<seg id=1982>It only gives full meaning to the extending mathematical of life that the medical progress made.</seg>
<seg id=1983>They have been subsidised - society as a whole is involved - older employees, have left their jobs but no young worker has been committed and many jobs have been lost.</seg>
<seg id=1984>Family policy and tax should on the contrary, to ensure that women and men who have family obligations can decide freely to have a professional activity or not.</seg>
<seg id=1985>My brother and I have joined there.</seg>
<seg id=1986>The forthcoming initiatives in the field of public health is directed rather to questions of health and care for the elderly and the promotion of a healthy old age.</seg>
<seg id=1987>Mr President, I have accepted the amendment tabled by Mr Pronk, both on 2 and 3, in which it calls for the text to be amended and insists on the concept of demographic development, rather than the ageing of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1988>It does not duplicate the advertising activities undertaken or promotional operators sectors or with those of the public authorities.</seg>
<seg id=1989>Mr President, the Committee on Budgets was also take the view that it is, in principle, in favour of the Commission proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1990>That is why it is very important to achieve a balance which can be achieved through the measures to promote sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id=1991>I think that as regards the marketing and sales, learning, as a framework for life should be placed at the centre of educational programmes precisely because the new technologies, the management of the research of outlets offer opportunities for completely new to provide logistical modern.</seg>
<seg id=1992>First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Dary on his excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=1993>The next point relates to the discussions in terms of export and intervention.</seg>
<seg id=1994>There must be no special premiums and publicity for products that are not requested.</seg>
<seg id=1995>We each have enough to eat, so if we make the promotion of a product that militera obviously against the consumption of another product.</seg>
<seg id=1996>The proposals for Amendments 18 and 24, first part, in which the time during which the topics and products which could be proposed will be assessed, are reduced to two to three years in order to improve the efficiency of the instrument of promotion.</seg>
<seg id=1997>In the Greek version juta, Mrs Haug is presented as rapporteur to male, implying a man, and Mr marcuse ferler as rapporteur on female, implying a woman.</seg>
<seg id=1998>It is a good example of how a small changes in practice can have significant effects.</seg>
<seg id=1999>This is provisionally the last Friday in Strasbourg, in other words, Strasbourg loses 12 days of presence of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=2000>Furthermore, I would like to wish to anyone, and in particular of some who have taken the trouble to attend, this Friday, at the last sitting of the year 2000 to Strasbourg, of enjoyable festive season and a new century which is good, but especially wise.</seg>
