<seg>Europe after races divided house</seg>
<seg>A common characteristic all extreme rights in Europe is their racism and the fact that they use the immigration problem as political lever.</seg>
<seg>The Lega north in Italy, the Vlaams block in the Netherlands, the supporters of Le Pen's national front in France, are examples of parties or movements, itself around the common topic: Formed refusal of immigration and around demand after a simplified policy, in order to regulate they.</seg>
<seg>While individuals come such as Jörg shark and Jean-Marie Le Pen and may (unfortunately not to soon) again go, the race question from the European policy will not so soon disappear.</seg>
<seg>An aging native population and ever open borders increase racist splintering in the European countries.</seg>
<seg>The large parties of the right and the left center placed themselves, it to the problem, in which they were the head into the sand and to all prospects contrary hoped may soon disappear.</seg>
<seg>However it does not become, as the history of racism points clearly to America.</seg>
<seg>The relations between the races was located in the USA over decades - do and that this very day - in the center of the political debate. That could be done so far that racial segregation became just as important as the income to determine - if not even still more importantly - around political affections and attitudes.</seg>
<seg>The first step, in order with the race question to deal is to understand a cause and consequences racist hostilities, even if that means, to uncover unpleasant facts.</seg>
<seg>Exactly that in the USA a large number of research project in economics, sociology, psychology and political science carried out. These research showed that humans trust different race clearly less each other.</seg>
<seg>The white ones are less ready to support social expenditures because they believe to favour thereby minorities. More strongly racist split societies have less efficient governments, more corruption and nepotism, more crime and less public advantages per dollar tax revenue.</seg>
<seg>That means, those answer does not have to read to eliminate the heterogeneity one and to create rassisch homogenous municipalities. But one must recognize the realities behind this question, in order to be able to sketch a solid public policy regarding the race relations.</seg>
<seg>Naturally no agreement exists over it among Americans as is to be done.</seg>
<seg>Some affirm schemes, in order to prefer minorities during the dispatching of jobs, the entrance to the colleges of further education and public orders.</seg>
<seg>These measures are regarded as a kind compensation for injustice committed in former times. They are to help to coin/shape, which is still more important, role sample, in order to overcome remaining and perhaps automatic discriminations remained.</seg>
<seg>Others reject such action and state that it requires only one on race differences not respecting policy in connection with a free market and family-friendly values, in order to create and help for the minorities of jobs that the families of the colored ones together-remained.</seg>
<seg>The latter is crucial for each politics. Because one of the most important causes for the poverty in the USA is the large spreading of households with alone educating parents (speak mothers) under the colored ones.</seg>
<seg>Regardless of the correct answer, it concerns with the question, how one deals with the races, an outstanding task in the US politics.</seg>
<seg>Minorities made progress natural in the direction of more integration and better economic successes.</seg>
<seg>Into the 1950er years were not even allowed colored ones in the bus place to in front take, today are two of the most important fellow players in US foreign policy colored one.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless one can be safe that politicians oriented towards the right in America further on those, race map " as a tactical means to set.</seg>
<seg>Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, to the former assistant of Nixon and Reagan, which appeared with the last elections as independent presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg>It published recently a successful book with the title: “The death of the west: Like becoming extinct social classes and the invasion of immigrants our country and our civilization endanger”.</seg>
<seg>But for each book like this there are ten different with a serious analysis of the race question in America.</seg>
<seg>Political analyses and debates over the race relations limp in Europe terribly behind ago.</seg>
<seg>The question is mostly treated also too closely regarding Zuwanderungsquoten and border regulations, which limit these, and not regarding the associated social problems and the chances, which result from increasingly rassisch mixed Europe.</seg>
<seg>Naturally a clear immigration policy is necessary, in order to avoid the accumulation of illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg>But that cannot be everything. Controls at the border to Mexico are not everything that has to say the American policy to the race question in the country.</seg>
<seg>Europe is rich and ages rapidly; the Europeans are, of generous welfare service programs abgepolstert no more prepared “dirty work”, say we in the agriculture or in leather industry to transfer.</seg>
<seg>An increased immigration already makes inevitable.</seg>
<seg>The Europeans are however fast ready to accuse the USA to each error in their minority politics and each sign of racism over the Atlantic away.</seg>
<seg>During the reading of the European press one often determines into the race questions a superiority complex opposite the USA: The Americans have problems with racism; on the other hand we are immune, refrained from a few mad neo-Nazis, skinheads and such a thing.</seg>
<seg>In the last weeks it showed itself that the race problem sits in Europe from Paris to Amsterdam many more deeply and decreases/goes back - as in the USA - to the sad fact that race relations is inherently difficult and that trusting and cooperative handling does not away-come easily over racial segregation.</seg>
<seg>If of Europe do not begin large parties, the race tensions in Europe more seriously to examine and understand and, race " to one of their most important priorities make, for individuals such as Le Pen to see itself compelled to fill out the gaps with their message of the hate. Alberto Alesina is a professor of the economic science at the University of Havard; Francesco Giavazzi, professor of the economic science at the Bocconi university in Milan belongs to the group of the economic advisers of the president of the European commission.</seg>
<seg>The French exceptions fight!</seg>
<seg>The attention in Europe is today rightfully directed toward the extension and the condition, which are prepared at present between the member states of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>But the result of some Geplänkel Galliens with the European commission might determine the fate of new and extended Europe hardly less serious.</seg>
<seg>France decided on one side to ignore stability and growth pact by a forecast deficit, which lies the far over limit value of 3% of the gross of inland product (Gross Domestic Product), accepting.</seg>
<seg>The Frenchmen hold themselves gladly the rational severity of their thinking to property, but if it concerns budgetary provisions, not Descartes but opacity is in demand.</seg>
<seg>France belonged to the prominent critics of Ireland, when the Irish government reduced its household surplus, which was at that time with 4% of the Gross Domestic Product, in the year 2000 only by 0.5%.</seg>
<seg>Also different countries offended against the stability pact, but France is the first country, which did this also to openly hämischer contempt.</seg>
<seg>But something such should not surprise anybody.</seg>
<seg>France applies simply to your-succeeded its eingefleischten habits to judge i.e. its own culture as something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg>For example France prevents persistently reforms of the common European agricultural policy (GEA) by its veto.</seg>
<seg>How even already children know, the GEA means a substantial and completely undeserved gift to the wealthy European (particularly French) farmers at the expense of the farmers in the developing countries, fighting around surviving, and the consumers in the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Also France tries to fall back an old policy to relieve i.e. unprofitable private enterprises at the edge of their collapse with the money of the taxpayers.</seg>
<seg>The European Union commissioner for competitive policy, Mario Monti, may not lose this fight: It needs the support of those, which believe in the market and in the equal treatment of all.</seg>
<seg>In this case the things lie completely simply.</seg>
<seg>The French government plans the company Alstom to frightened, an enterprise, which a number of high tech products under it the TGV, which developed French high-speed things, but went recently to bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg>The French government states that it will back-put never in its plan to save Alstom, a plan with all well-known reasons of the dirigisme: Preservation of the jobs, protection of the investors etc.</seg>
<seg>In addition the French government plays, since it acts with Alstom around a high tech company, which maintains research and development map and, investments in F&E is well for growth.</seg>
<seg>Alstom by the nationalization of the enterprise to save, is obviously wrong.</seg>
<seg>The enterprise consists of many different parts. Some of it bring profit, others are bankruptcy: Which one has to do, is obvious, to smash the company.</seg>
<seg>The profitable parts, like the TGV work, will find easily buyers; Works, which do not throw a profit off, should be closed.</seg>
<seg>The money of French taxpayers is spent better on the support of the dismissed workers than on subsidies, in order to hold unprofitable companies alive.</seg>
<seg>It is important that the European commission does not permit France to take itself out in the competitive policy like apparent with its budgetary deficits special arrangements.</seg>
<seg>The commission must prevent public assistance to private enterprises in France likewise, as it brought such subsidies in every other European Union member state to case.</seg>
<seg>The commission has some successes at this front already obtained, as well known forced it Germany to waive government endorsements for public banks.</seg>
<seg>Alstom in the special one and France generally should not form exceptions; they should have themselves to hold by the same yardsticks.</seg>
<seg>If the commission it will appear missed to act, the European Union still more like the play meadow of French civil servants.</seg>
<seg>France already transferred a guiding role in the European Union foreign policy, whereby minister of foreign affairs Dominique de Villepin goes and acts more and more also in such a way like the minister of foreign affairs of Europe into action.</seg>
<seg>At the same time France injures substantial regulations of the common economic policy and the assignment of public assistance to private enterprises.</seg>
<seg>Does the European commission want what from its reliability is still remaining, loses and like a subordinated Paris district to finally look?</seg>
<seg>A defeat in the case Alstom would have extensive consequences for Europe and not only for its competitive policy.</seg>
<seg>The war around the oil</seg>
<seg>Since decades has America under democratic and republican a number of clear related to energy policy goals pursues led presidencies consistently of keeping i.e. the world oil price as stable as possible; to throttle the oil consumption in the country in as painless a way as possible; the dependence on foreign imports, where this is possible always to reduce; to divide and the oil imported goods on several countries of origin.</seg>
<seg>Even if it seems to be different, under the Bush government none of these goals was changed.</seg>
<seg>Many observers believe, shrubs hit a new course, because the invasion seems to run into Iraq these goals contrary.</seg>
<seg>A large increase of the oil production in Iraq might probably still increase the dependence of the USA von Öl in relation to from other energy sources, since the world oil prices will probably break in consequence of the additional offer.</seg>
<seg>This would particularly mean in response an increase of the US dependence on imported oil, from the Near East.</seg>
<seg>The irony with the fact is however that the USA under the Vorkriegsprogramm of the UN, exercised oil for food " (in that the UN and not Saddam Hussein the level of the Iraqi oil sales to the foreign country determined) larger control of the Iraqi oil sector, than they will do that in the future in a democratically governed Iraq.</seg>
<seg>If the Bush government stable, safe and cheap oil imports from many sides had aimed at, then it would have simply the embargoes against countries such as Libya, Iran, Iraq and the Sudan to waive and the oil from there hereinschwabben to leave to be able.</seg>
<seg>But the American interest in the Iraqi oil did not proceed from its economics or energy policy.</seg>
<seg>The Bush government recognized that the Iraqi oil is above all a crucial geopolitical lever.</seg>
<seg>Who always controls the Iraqi oil, controls Iraq.</seg>
<seg>Saddams power was based on its control of the second largest oil reserves of the world.</seg>
<seg>He understood certainly the role, which played the oil for its exercise of power.</seg>
<seg>With the possibility an invasion and a defeat before eyes, Saddam threatened, to ignite the oil fields in Iraq.</seg>
<seg>A majority of the later destruction and plunderings at Iraqi oil mechanisms and pipelines reflects the wide-spread realization that control of the oil means the rule over Iraq.</seg>
<seg>In the US invasion plans a crucial priority was granted to the protection of the oil fields.</seg>
<seg>A goal was not about to expand the supplies and to lower the prices for the Americans to separate but Saddam from its power base to and to finally use and stabilize a new Iraqi government.</seg>
<seg>Of Iraq future depends directly on the fate of the Iraqi oil production.</seg>
<seg>But the moods of the oil business, particularly under such unsettled circumstances, show only with difficulty, how the Bush government will be able to achieve their goals in Iraq within the next few years.</seg>
<seg>The logic is simple.</seg>
<seg>The USA must use the oil income, in order to facilitate for the American taxpayers the load by the financing of the regime change in Iraq.</seg>
<seg>All plans of reconstruction depend in the long term on the ability Iraq to export oil in large quantities.</seg>
<seg>If Iraq does not deliver its oil, president Bush knows his promises to the Iraqi, whom do not redeem American people or to the world community.</seg>
<seg>Before the invasion the capacity of Iraqi oil production amounted to three million barrel per day.</seg>
<seg>Iraq will not be able to raise its production within the time frame, which forces is, in order to establish an Iraqi government, this level.</seg>
<seg>Each increase of the Iraqi oil production requires to develop the oil fields which means extensive investments, a legal, representative government and political stability.</seg>
<seg>Not even the Bush government believes to correspond to these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg>Political stability the most important condition for the rise of the production capacity is actual.</seg>
<seg>Historical examples from Iran, from Kuwait, Russia, and even Iraq show that it takes approximately still three years after the rereaching of political stability, in order the capacity noticeably to raise and on the reached to hold higher level.</seg>
<seg>Iraq needs several years to negotiate in order to write a new condition to furnish a legitimate and democratic government the allocation of the oil income on its different regions new investment laws too issued to make attractive and its economics for foreigners.</seg>
<seg>It needs further time to negotiate with the international oil companies and neighboring countries to accomplish technical feasibility studies and rebuild its oil fields, on to bring and explore.</seg>
<seg>Therefore a time frame of three years even appears as optimistic, since it presupposes that occupation is terminated in this time, which Iraqis their own democratic government will attain to establish and a political stability.</seg>
<seg>One does not need to mention that the situation can develop also completely differently.</seg>
<seg>The tensions can remain existing still on years.</seg>
<seg>Nobody should be surprised, if the Iraqi oil production comes even under a democratic government suddenly completely to succumbing.</seg>
<seg>Historical experiences suggest that labor disputes and similar disturbances, which can prevent the oil production in democratic countries represent a larger threat than in undemocratic.</seg>
<seg>If Iraq cannot increase its production quotas in the next few years fast, this will disturb both the US outside and their energy policy.</seg>
<seg>How do the USA want the reconstruction of Iraq in the long term financiers?</seg>
<seg>Who will be responsible for receiving a fragile Iraqi democracy alive?</seg>
<seg>Can the USA maintain their occupation, if them the Iraqi people not food, health welfare service and other fundamental services to offer to be able?</seg>
<seg>These are uncomfortable questions. They do not remain determining in principle unanswerably, so long a stable, democratic regime in Iraq the constant river of the oil exports and guarantee can.</seg>
<seg>Murderer as guards of the human rights</seg>
<seg>If it would not be so deeply sad, one would have to laugh at it: Libya was selected to the chairman of the UN-human rights commission!</seg>
<seg>When Caligula made its horse senators, at least no blood stuck at its hooves.</seg>
<seg>Naturally the procedure was perfectly legal: the presidency rotates each year from a world region to the next.</seg>
<seg>This year was Africa at the row to select the chairman and it appointed Libya.</seg>
<seg>Only the USA and Canada were correct against it.</seg>
<seg>To their eternally lasting dishonor the European countries contained of the voice.</seg>
<seg>It is characteristic for the condition of the moral corruption of the UN that this decision straight was made now, in this time so difficult for the organization.</seg>
<seg>President Bush requested the UN to prove that she means it serious with her Iraq resolutions: otherwise it will suffer the same disgraceful fate like the Völkerbund, which faced in the 30's of the aggressive policy of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy completely powerlessly.</seg>
<seg>Libya straight into the presidency of the UN-organization to select now, which is responsible for the human rights, settles negatively on the legitimacy and the moral authority of the entire organization.</seg>
<seg>We remember: Libya is a totalitarian tyranny, its head of state, Muammar Al-Gaddafi connects often incalculable behavior with extremist policy, by supporting the dictators of the world.</seg>
<seg>It manages one of the most repressive regimes of the world, in which there is not even the illusion of elections and where opposition is crushed immediately.</seg>
<seg>Under its rule Libya supported organizations of terror in the whole world - from the Irish Republican Army up to different Palestinian extremist groups.</seg>
<seg>The UN-sanctions for the role, which played the country with the crash of the Pan to-passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland one decade ago, are not waived yet.</seg>
<seg>In the last ten years the position of the UN was constantly infiltrated as symbol for the ideal of a peaceful world community.</seg>
<seg>It was perfectly unable to prevent the wars on the Balkans and at least in a case - Srebrenica - watched a Netherlands peacekeeping force the worst massacre in Europe since 1945 idle, with Bosnian Serbs 6000 defenseless Muslims murdered.</seg>
<seg>A Netherlands clearing-up committee granted later that the Netherlands UN-troop was complicated actually into this war crime.</seg>
<seg>Rwanda. The genocide had hardly begun, arranged for the peace-keeping measures the responsible person UN-functionary the retreat of the UN-troops from the country and left the field to the bloodiest racist massacre since the 2nd world war.</seg>
<seg>The name of this functionary is Kofi Annan.</seg>
<seg>- Probably futile - the attempt of the UN to arouse now in the Iraq crisis the impression speaks it with the voice of the reason and the international authentication is only depressing and pathetisch to be called.</seg>
<seg>But in a time, in which the UN-Waffeninspekteure in Iraq seems like the welfare army, which one sends, in order to dig a gangster gang, can the fact that Libya the presidency will transfer over the human rights commission, history perhaps as the error enter, which sealed the failure of an organization, which was brought with as much hope into being.</seg>
<seg>Organizations do not go normally to under and it give surely too much raison d'etat over to guarantee that the UN continues to itself drag.</seg>
<seg>But it is only one shade its that it should be and be could.</seg>
<seg>The UN today is nothing else as another word for hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg>Autoritarismus on the advance</seg>
<seg>Me the judges at the Indonesian central court in Jakarta condemned last Thursday to one year prison.</seg>
<seg>As an editor-in-chief of the news magazine speed Weekly, am I, in accordance with the judgement, guiltily, a Wirtschaftsmagnaten named Tomy Winata to have slandered by having subordinated its possible involvement into a case of fire on the Southeast Asiatic textile market in Jakarta. Besides I was explained for guilty by the spreading of lies of riots to have stirred up.</seg>
<seg>Are my case and similar other cases already a reference to the end of a further short-lived democratic experiment in Indonesia?</seg>
<seg>The “riots” which I allegedly, took place in March last yearly stirred up, when almost two hundred rioters, who pretended as a supporter Winatas, attacked the office of speed, it in fire to set threatened, the staff oppressed and a reporter injured.</seg>
<seg>With the attempt to solve the situation peacefully I was persuaded to go me to discussions on the central police station in Jakarta. To my frightening police station was however under control of the Mobs.</seg>
<seg>I was struck and stepped, while the police away-saw.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately us numerous journalists with tape recorders and cameras came to assistance.</seg>
<seg>The publication of their photographs caused a public proclamation, which forced again the parliament to organize a public hearing.</seg>
<seg>The police heads of the country and Jakarta were cited and the leaders of the Mobs were criminally accused, under solid public pressure.</seg>
<seg>Winata however escaped a police investigation, and which only because he stated, its supporters would have without his previous knowledge and his agreement acted.</seg>
<seg>Subsequently, it turned the Spieß and refunded even charge against Ahmad Taufik, the author of the article, against the editor Teuku Iskandar Ali, it drawn up and against me.</seg>
<seg>The legal proceedings for many years were characterized by a number of suspicious developments, which favoured all together Winata.</seg>
<seg>First in the case developed by the police and the public prosecutor documents were presented, which were so obviously falsified that the police accused two responsible person.</seg>
<seg>The court however rejected our request for procedure delay up to legal clarifying of the case developed by the public prosecutor and the police.</seg>
<seg>The procedure against the two policemen seems to be kidnapped.</seg>
<seg>One of the policemen was promoted to commander of the again created (and of the USA financed) anti-terror unit of Jakarta.</seg>
<seg>The other one is to have been sent on a Fortbildungslehrgang for police officers.</seg>
<seg>Afterwards, in the sixth month of the procedure, the chairman of the dreiköpfigen judge committee was suddenly appointed the boss of a city court, which lies one hour far away from Jakarta.</seg>
<seg>One of my lawyers meant that it did not happen to him in its 35-jährigen career with court yet that one exchanges a presidency prominent judge during a current procedure.</seg>
<seg>The Richterin, despite its transport, actually functioned in another case in the same house further than chairmen.</seg>
<seg>In our procedure a judge transferred the presidency, which before already pleases in Winatas civil proceedings a judgement against speed had.</seg>
<seg>Finally Winata put a perjury down with its statement, when he denied speed an interview to have given.</seg>
<seg>A tape recording of the telephone interview was played before court; the reporter, who had led the interview, as well as two editors as witnesses stated under oath; the official recording of the telephone company was brought in before court as proof for the call and an expert came at the conclusion that the voice on the tape of Tomy the Winata was.</seg>
<seg>The judges however rejected the request of speed, for arrest and a criminal pursuit Winatas due to perjury and guessed themselves/advised, announcement to refund, which we also did.</seg>
<seg>Subsequently, the judges gave also a refusal to our request to shift the judicial ruling up to the solution of Winatas case of perjury.</seg>
<seg>In view of a so unsatisfactory procedure, my condemnation and the term of imprisonment took place a little surprisingly.</seg>
<seg>I am however confident that we will obsiegen at the end, if speeds appointment comes before higher courts.</seg>
<seg>The Indonesian courts of the higher level are cleaner and the president of the highest Court of Justice are a convinced advocate of the democracy and freedom of the press. The case speed could become an innovative victory for our democracy, similarly as the famous decision of the highest Court of Justice of the USA in the case The New York Times against Sullivan.</seg>
<seg>The hurdle for defamatorische charges was raised. This decision guarantees that American journalists can pull public persons for responsibility.</seg>
<seg>In no country in the world one knows it better than in Indonesia that opinion and freedom of the press belong to the provable indicators of democratic development and that the Kriminalisierung of journalist an early sign of Autoritarismus is.</seg>
<seg>Into the 1950er years was Indonesia a liberal democracy. In the year 1956 then president Sukarno with support of the military seized drastic measures against the press.</seg>
<seg>Critical voices were calmly placed, whereby the consolidation of uncontrolled power fell more easily. In July 1959 Sukarno ordered the “guided democracy” by decree.</seg>
<seg>In the first years after Sukarnos fall in the year 1966 all standards of a genuine democracy including freedom of the press were repaired (except for the communists).</seg>
<seg>But in the early 1970's president Suharto began to proceed again against the press and to forbid finally different media and arrest numerous journalists.</seg>
<seg>After one had brought the press under control, also rapidly different political rights were cut and the Indonesian democracy failed again.</seg>
<seg>Since the fall Suhartos in the year 1998 is Indonesia the third biggest democratic country in the world and the largest Muslim democracy in history.</seg>
<seg>Two parliamentary elections and two direct Präsidentenwahlen - including the recent ballot - ran freely, fair and peacefully and were a proof for the fact that Islam and democracy can exist quite next to each other.</seg>
<seg>The enemies of the democracy however never sleep.</seg>
<seg>Radical Islamic groups operate indiscriminate bombardments and groups with strong authoritarian tendencies it into the internal circles of president Megawati created.</seg>
<seg>However Megawati suffered a straight defeat with the Präsidentenwahl.</seg>
<seg>Also will the again selected president Susilo pursue further journalists?</seg>
<seg>Will my condemnation and the procedures and condemnations of colleagues ring in the end of the hard fought for third democracy in Indonesia?</seg>
<seg>The answer lies in the support, which per-democratic activists in Indonesia can win and abroad.</seg>
<seg>The loss of Indonesia - a potenzielles beacon of hope for all per-democratic activists in the entire Muslim world - would be a terrible defeat.</seg>
<seg>The moral of the death penalty</seg>
<seg>The USA due to their refusal to abolish the death penalty often criticized.</seg>
<seg>Now many, the abolishment of the death penalty state is a condition for a civilized criminal law system.</seg>
<seg>Nobel Laureate Gary Becker contradicts.</seg>
<seg>The European governments are strict against the death penalty -- in the European union it is completely forbidden -- and some Europeans regard the employment of the death penalty in the United States as barbarian.</seg>
<seg>Numerous European intellectual ones argue that not only the death penalty, but punishment has completely generally, no deterring effect on criminal ones.</seg>
<seg>While it could afford Europe with crime rates, which were in the last 50 years far under those Americas, over long time to meet most crimes relatively “mild” it came there in the last twenty years to a drastic rise of the crime rates.</seg>
<seg>In contrast to it these numbers are in America partly due to far going use of punishments to please.</seg>
<seg>In addition also the death penalty belongs.</seg>
<seg>I am for the execution of some as a murderer condemned persons, because -- and only because -- I believe that thereby different murderers are deterred.</seg>
<seg>If I would not be convinced of it, I would express myself against the death penalty, because revenge and other possible motives should not than basis for the policy of a state to serve.</seg>
<seg>The empirical research over the death penalty took its exit, which was published 1975 in the American Economic Review in the USA with an innovative study Isaac Ehrlichs.</seg>
<seg>In some following studies the deterrence effect as many smaller descriptive in others again than stronger.</seg>
<seg>The existing data are however rather limited, therefore one should draw its conclusions not exclusively on the basis of ökonometrischen evidence.</seg>
<seg>Of course one cannot wait with political decisions over each kind of punishment, until this evidence is complete.</seg>
<seg>But even these quantitatively limited data give reason to the acceptance that the death penalty has a deterring effect.</seg>
<seg>Most humans, above all murderers, are afraid death, in particular, if it enters rapidly and with some certainty after committing a murder.</seg>
<seg>David Hume formulated in his paper over suicide that “still nobody threw away a life, which was worth to receive to the trouble.</seg>
<seg>Because our natural fear of death is so largely… “something similar also to Schopenhauer, which expressed it as follows: “If it there came that the fright nit of the life outweigh the fright nit of death, humans for its life an end will set.</seg>
<seg>But the fright nit of death carry out substantial resistance… “</seg>
<seg>The opponents of the death penalty often state, the state would also not be no moral right to take to someone the life a still so horrible murderer.</seg>
<seg>For someone, which believes in the deterring effect of the death penalty, is however an absolutely wrong conclusion.</seg>
<seg>In order to understand the reason for it, we assume the fact that for each executed (instead of for example to lifelong detention condemned) murderer three murders can be prevented, whereby it acts thereby around a much smaller number than in the papers Ehrlichs or other work about deterrence.</seg>
<seg>Hence it follows that for each not executed murderer three innocent victims would have to leave their life.</seg>
<seg>Actually the government “would take” thus indirectly many lives, if it did not use the death penalty.</seg>
<seg>The rescue of three innocent lives for each executed person seems to be a quite interesting equivalent and if per execution two lives are even saved, appears as convincing cost-benefit ratio.</seg>
<seg>Admitted, the argument for the death penalty becomes less powerful with a smaller number of saved lives.</seg>
<seg>But if per execution only one life could be even saved, that would be still a worthwhile equivalent, if the saved life is better around much, as the taken, as it might normally be the case.</seg>
<seg>Many humans resist a consideration between the quality of the saved and the taken life.</seg>
<seg>I see however no reason to employ a such comparison not.</seg>
<seg>One thinks of a professional criminal, who robs and kills humans. The victim led a respectable life and leaves several children and a marriage partner.</seg>
<seg>We accept, it would be possible to protect the life of an innocent victim by the execution of a such criminal.</seg>
<seg>For me it is clear that it must have more weights to save the life of the victim than taking one criminal one the life.</seg>
<seg>Naturally not all cases are so clear, but the comparison regarding the quality of the two lives must be part of each reasonable social policy.</seg>
<seg>That helps also with the explanation, why the death penalty is to be used only in the case of murder, not however with smaller crimes.</seg>
<seg>If in response for executions for example a lowering of the cases of theft is to be achieved, far more speaks for a mild form of the punishment.</seg>
<seg>Although substantial encroachments come understandably like cruel rapes a murder regarding the degree of difficulty quite close and calls after the death penalty become to let loud, am I in these cases not for it.</seg>
<seg>A convincing argument to use the death penalty only in murder cases is the “marginal note deterrence”.</seg>
<seg>On encroachments if the death penalty would stand, the authors would have an incentive for killing their victim in order even to be seized (that is a principal reason, why the hardness of the punishments should be attached generally to the degree of difficulty of the crime).</seg>
<seg>A difficulty consists of the fact that from the death penalty threatened murderers would continue to go still, in order to escape their arrest, whereby again the death numbers could increase.</seg>
<seg>While the marginal note deterrence is an important factor, I believe that the attempts of the murderer, itself its arrest -- possibly at the expense of the own life - to withdraw, an indirect proof for the fact it are that criminals are afraid the death penalty.</seg>
<seg>Naturally the risk prepares to possibly execute innocent ones headaches for me.</seg>
<seg>My agreement to the death penalty was strongly weakened, if the number innocently of the executions were actually so large, as is often stated.</seg>
<seg>I believe however that the appellate procedures in the USA offer an unusually large protection, not so much against unjustified condemnations, but very probably against unjustified executions, so that it, if gives at all, only very few cases of innocently executed persons.</seg>
<seg>With the development of the DNA identification this protection was still enormously expanded.</seg>
<seg>Again: The discussion around the death penalty is essentially a debate over deterrence (those its effect in view of into the length of pulled appellate procedures to lose can).</seg>
<seg>I understand that some humans face the mentioned proofs sceptically, although I believe that they err both in this regard and regarding the healthy human understanding to this topic.</seg>
<seg>The thought humans, even a murderer to take the life is disturbing, but most unpleasant measures are necessary sometimes, in order to prevent still worse behaviors, which cost the life of innocent victims.</seg>
<seg>The people against Putin</seg>
<seg>I participated in the selection Vladimir Putin as a successor for of Russia first democratically selected president, Boris Yel'tsin.</seg>
<seg>Since now KGB and Mafia structures govern Russia and manipulate the law system, it is accepted that Yel'tsin wanted to select its successor, in order to avoid a future criminal pursuit.</seg>
<seg>But we, whom Putin selected, had the task to find someone to protect in order to continue Yel'tsin's reforms, and not in order it and its family.</seg>
<seg>Yel'tsin was quite fearless and aimed at not his personal surviving, but surviving the democratic idea, which it introduced to Russia.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless this idea is now due to the successor selected by us in danger.</seg>
<seg>I do not point the responsibility for the support of Putin from me.</seg>
<seg>We were not close friends, but him and I co-operated in crucial situations, and I had never doubted its sincerity.</seg>
<seg>Putin acts after its convictions.</seg>
<seg>The problem is that its convictions -- including its faith in the fact that Russia can only flourish, if it is governed by only one source of power -- are wrong.</seg>
<seg>This large error leads Russia into the political ruin.</seg>
<seg>Nobody is of course in this top position, without committing errors, even fundamental, and this is valid in particular in turbulent times.</seg>
<seg>Yel'tsin was not an exception, but it recognized its errors.</seg>
<seg>When it withdrew at the New Year's Eve 1999, it asked e.g. for forgiveness for the fact that it had begun the war in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg>Putin seems unable to recognize and admit its errors and holds to a policy, for a long time after their failure for the world is recognizable.</seg>
<seg>One of Yel'tsins' errors was its omission to set moral priorities to the point of its reform agenda.</seg>
<seg>Russia would have had to repent the Stalinismus and the Gulag system.</seg>
<seg>Without exception the whole nation regret would have had to feel, as the Germans since 1945 regret have felt.</seg>
<seg>This omission is of importance, because so of Putin unqualified faith in a central authority could lead to the fact that the state was back-conquered by the security agencies.</seg>
<seg>Actually the national regret of the Gulag era would have had to mean the prohibition of the communist party and the exclusion of the former KGB coworkers of political offices as direct result.</seg>
<seg>Although such political examinations are complicated in post office-communist societies, since both victim role and collaboration far common and the borders were often blurred between them, a good solution could have been found -- as in Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg>Since nothing was undertaken, of Russia remained intact security structures and could concern a political comeback, which they reached now.</seg>
<seg>The political reon purchasing of the KGB structures under Putin and their efforts to bring deviating opinions to the silence transformed Russia again into a country of the defectors.</seg>
<seg>It is impossible to bring independent politicians and independent media to the silence without turning independent financial resources off, why the Kremlin concentrated attacks on the “oligarches so called” under Putin its.</seg>
<seg>Mikhail Chodorkowskis arrest and process were orchestriert for exactly this reason.</seg>
<seg>The security agencies, which control the Kremlin, hope, to destroy by removing independent financial resources the independent political life in Russia.</seg>
<seg>Without independent intellectual bases a climate of the fear spreads.</seg>
<seg>But fear is not only entwürdigend, it promotes also a bad government.</seg>
<seg>Yel'tsin understood intuitively that fear and centralized decision making are from top to bottom no kind to govern a modern country existed it to reform the relations between citizens and state.</seg>
<seg>Putin does not understand yet that a centralized political system is now just as unable to understand and correct errors, like at that time in the Soviet era.</seg>
<seg>As a not very educated man Putin Russia in full and deep sincerity leads in the same decomposition, which accompanied the collapse of the Soviet state.</seg>
<seg>Humans begin to understand this.</seg>
<seg>They recognize that of Putin cannot be converted desire to create a strong and effective modern state, because a modern state is not governed from above, but of informed citizens, who force their ruling powers to see and correct their errors.</seg>
<seg>Putin seems to likewise suspect the inability of its government.</seg>
<seg>This is one of the reasons, why Russia since newest as aggressively against its neighbour, who Ukraine and Georgien proceed and try, to maintain its military presence at places as Transnistrien the abtrünnigen region of Moldavia.</seg>
<seg>By making its influence abroad of Russia valid close, the Kremlin believes to be able to convince the Russians at home of its omnipotence.</seg>
<seg>In view of the restricted debates in Russia and the ability of the Kremlin to manipulate elections a change of government is the only option for those, which want to retain the democratic idea in Russia.</seg>
<seg>It does not use anything to hold to illusions.</seg>
<seg>Those, which Putin oppose, must decide, what it to want, and explain the fact that it, if the regime does not adhere to the condition, which is right to force it with each few means to it.</seg>
<seg>The question of power cannot be decided in Russia today any longer alone at the ballot box.</seg>
<seg>As in Ukraine, which Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan are decided will them in the roads.</seg>
<seg>Taxes and expenditures increase (ask)</seg>
<seg>An excessive fiscal charges can decrease incentives and obstruct growth.</seg>
<seg>A too small taxation can cause however the same.</seg>
<seg>Governments, that have only poor tax revenues, do not have available money, in order to place fundamental public goods.</seg>
<seg>It is still worse that in poor countries low tax revenues are being attributed less to low tax rates than rather to incorrect tax A ELEVATION SYSTEMs, which likewise lead to unproductive enterprises.</seg>
<seg>By the example India shows up the meaning one probably thought out control system.</seg>
<seg>In Bangalore hit CH companies in maintained green belts established world class universities with connection to high-speed data networks.</seg>
<seg>Outside of these campuses however open sewers coin/shape, decontaminated garbage and urgently in need of repair roads the picture.</seg>
<seg>While technology companies send Terabyte in one instant to data into remote continents, the local public means of transport with nearly medieval speed move themselves.</seg>
<seg>For this reason enterprises in Bangalore operate their own Buslinien, have contracts with private offerers for the water supply and to have own generators, in order to protect itself against the losses in public electricity mains.</seg>
<seg>The state cannot eliminate the chaos, because it is broke.</seg>
<seg>The Indian state debts are more than 70% of the Gross Domestic Product. More than half of the tax revenues must be spent from there for interest repayment.</seg>
<seg>The debts are not to be led back however to covered expenditures in the past.</seg>
<seg>The public expenditures in India amount to approximately 15% of the Gross Domestic Product. In the comparison to it in the OECD states 40% of the Gross Domestic Product for public expenditures are used on the average.</seg>
<seg>The financial difficulties of India have their cause rather in an unsatisfactorily conceived and badly administered control system.</seg>
<seg>Compared to international standards the fiscal regulations and income tax rates appear appropriate for individuals and enterprises.</seg>
<seg>The tax revenues of the Indian government from income taxes nevertheless amount to only 3.7% of the Gross Domestic Product. This value corresponds half of the incomes of South Korea and other Asian tiger states.</seg>
<seg>Approximately a quarter of the Gross Domestic Product is allotted to the agriculture, but wealthy farmers do not even pay taxes.</seg>
<seg>Export-oriented enterprises in the software industry and in other sectors enjoy tax exemptions for their profits, although the coworkers of these companies very probably pay wage tax.</seg>
<seg>Despite appropriate tax rates tax evasion is far common.</seg>
<seg>This fraud can take place, because the government invests neither in personnel nor into systems for questioning intensively of tax dodgers, who have to rarely count enough on a detention and often clear on bribes their way from the difficulties.</seg>
<seg>The tax evasion with the “direct” income and profits taxes reflects the chaos with the “indirect” taxes, which become enter above on production and consumption.</seg>
<seg>Over 60% of the indirect taxes in India are allotted to indirect taxes. The portion of the indirect taxes at the total tax wheel amounts to again 60%.</seg>
<seg>The basis tax rate was specified with 16% of the production value of a company.</seg>
<seg>Besides there is still another set of privileges, freeing and impacts.</seg>
<seg>Thus a vergünstigter tax rate of 8% is used into categories such as food, matches, cotton yarn and computer.</seg>
<seg>Containing products, on cars, become additional air conditioning systems and tire a “special indirect tax” (SED) of 8% enter above on polyester fibers.</seg>
<seg>The “additional indirect tax” (AED, not to confound with the SED) is allotted to “goods of special importance”.</seg>
<seg>Beyond that numerous complicated freeing from indirect taxes exists, into whose benefit enterprises with a whole year income of less than 10 million Rupien and companies come into difficult or backward regions.</seg>
<seg>Altogether these freeing is arranged in 70 categories seized far, which are divided into 259 entries, 52 conditions and 7 lists again, from which each again numerous points contains.</seg>
<seg>Tax exemptions invite to the abuse.</seg>
<seg>At a certain price struggle-low officials, to who considerable estimation clearance comes with the application of the conditions, can induced to become, to lay the regulations out favorably.</seg>
<seg>Goods, which are subject to a high tax rate (polished granite, for example) become as goods with a lower tax rate sold (not polished granite, for example).</seg>
<seg>The evasion of indirect taxes is further common as those of profit and income taxes.</seg>
<seg>If a company Verbrauchssteuern evades and if the tax rate is high in the industry compared with the profits before tax, then also the competition is compelling to the fraud, if it wants to survive.</seg>
<seg>During increasing tax evasion the governments invent “additional” or “special” taxes, and stimulate thereby to still more tax evasion.</seg>
<seg>Likewise a elevation of direct taxes suffers.</seg>
<seg>Bribes, which create difference between the value of polished and not polished granite and the discreet actual incomes “black money”, paid a Finanzbeamten for favorable classifications, which can appear in no income tax return.</seg>
<seg>The evasion of indirect taxes handicapped not only the state during the supply of fundamental public goods, but takes also the incentive to the enterprises for introducing more productive technologies which are necessary for a production in larger style.</seg>
<seg>Since however indirect taxes evaded more easily with the enterprise of many small production units as a large become can, size advantages are not to be realized.</seg>
<seg>In this connection it is worth mentioning that Indian companies in the software industry, where all companies are liberating from indirect taxes keep house efficiently.</seg>
<seg>Could India follow the example of China, where the rationalization of indirect taxes booms in the year 1994 the conditions for a large created?</seg>
<seg>Or aren't coalition governments in a strong democracy to such reforms in the situation?</seg>
<seg>In the previous year of the BJP led government laws introduced for the drastic lowering of the household deficit.</seg>
<seg>Subsequently, a working group was used, which had to compile the necessary changes in the tax and expenditure politics.</seg>
<seg>In July this yearly suggested the working group, which taxes to increase to shorten (and not the expenditures), by, among other things, which are painted most freeing from indirect taxes.</seg>
<seg>The new Indian government under guidance of the congress party seems to also welcome these proposals.</seg>
<seg>If the congress party and the opposition bring this project to end, they are set which is enough a step for the lasting economic development of the country, far, and the conception to have scattered, according to which democracies are not able, of implementing measures which are necessary, in order to promote the development.</seg>
<seg>What isn't correct with Turkey?</seg>
<seg>On 16 December Orhan Pamuk, one of the most famous writers of Turkey, before a court in Istanbul, will stand in order the accusation, “the national identity to insult itself” to place after it had expressed itself for the open discussion of the Turkish genocide at 1.5 million Armenians 1915 and 1916.</seg>
<seg>Pamuk must count with three years prison.</seg>
<seg>It convinces the efforts of Turkey, that one, which opposes the official line to punish and lock up with penalty, me of the fact that I was right, when I rejected the negotiations of accession for the membership of the country in the European union.</seg>
<seg>In December 1999 the European advice of Turkey lent the status European Union candidate, which meant that Turkey would join the union to a later, fixed date.</seg>
<seg>The advice asked the European commission afterwards to decide until October 2004 whether Turkey had sufficiently fulfilled the political criteria for the membership -- including democracy, rule of law and attention of the rights of ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg>This was one of the last decisions, which the commission among Romano Prodi fällte, whose member was I.</seg>
<seg>From their 30 members 29 meant that Turkey had sufficiently fulfilled the criteria, in order to continue.</seg>
<seg>I was the only deviationist.</seg>
<seg>The report of the commission to the Turkey, to which by the Günter Verheugen then responsible for the EU enlargement one provided, affected my decision.</seg>
<seg>In this report it was mentioned that in the year 2003 about 21,870 Turks submitted requests for asylum in the European Union, by which 2127 was accepted.</seg>
<seg>Differently expressed, the governments of the European Union recognized on 2003 that the Turkish government over 2000 of its own citizens had pursued.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile the commission published a progress report to the Turkey, to which it granted that the reforms under the rather Islamic stopped government of prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan were continued, although in a slower speed.</seg>
<seg>But the report presented also serious doubts: Violations of human rights, including torture, were continued; the influence of the military remained too large; the free speech was not everywhere kept; not-Muslim religious and cultural minorities were discriminated against; and force against women was not fought strongly enough.</seg>
<seg>It changed not much, since the adhesion talks began in this October.</seg>
<seg>Apart from current pursuit Pamuks gives it plentifully examples of unacceptable behavior.</seg>
<seg>In March 2005 the police interrupted by force a demonstration for the celebration of the international woman daily.</seg>
<seg>In May the largest teacher trade union was forbidden, because it entered for it, informing the 14 million Kurd in Turkey in their native language.</seg>
<seg>Intolerance actually pulls itself to the point of the Turkish government.</seg>
<seg>The minister of foreign affairs Abdullah Gül called recently suddenly a press conference off in Copenhagen, when he a Kurdish journalist in the public erspähte and the Danes refused itself ejecting these.</seg>
<seg>Such actions and attitudes justify my dissenting vote from October 2004 sufficiently.</seg>
<seg>But, if these lack were repaired, should not Turkey yet to the European Union be taken up, because it is not a European country.</seg>
<seg>Christianity, Feudalismus, Renaissance, clearing-up, democracy and industrialization made us, what we are Europeans, but they made the Turks not, what they are.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I am not convinced of the fact that the reforms in Turkey, which were converted on urge of the European commission were continued after the entry.</seg>
<seg>I assume even that they were withdrawn.</seg>
<seg>Beyond that the entry of Turkey would lead inevitably to the fact that Ukraine, Weißrussland and Moldau would join, and perhaps Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.</seg>
<seg>The first three of these countries are surely more European than Turkey.</seg>
<seg>If one leaves the three Caucasian republics outside forwards, however the successor States of Yugoslavia, an European Union with approximately 35 members includes would mean.</seg>
<seg>What for a union would that be?</seg>
<seg>The European Union is not simply a friendship club.</seg>
<seg>It is based on the free traffic of goods, services, capital and persons.</seg>
<seg>When Hüterin of the Treaties of Union must protect the commission these four fundamental freedoms, that means, it must the member states if necessary sometimes convince, and force to change their laws.</seg>
<seg>The alcohol politics in Sweden, which is Volkswagen law in Germany and discrimination against foreign unit trust fund in France case examples, with which the commission made itself unpopular.</seg>
<seg>But they were necessary.</seg>
<seg>When I left the commission, I sat on a pile of 1500 of such violation of contract procedures.</seg>
<seg>Briefly, the European Union membership has the consequence that a state must accept drastic measures, which affect strongly its internal affairs.</seg>
<seg>That will be impossible with such different members.</seg>
<seg>The European Union became victim its that the historian Paul Kennedy calls “imperial overstretching”.</seg>
<seg>The European Union was excessively strongly stretched.</seg>
<seg>Therefore the former French president feared Valéry Giscard d'Estaing that the entry of Turkey to the dissolution of the European Union would lead, and therefore said former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt: “Turkey would be more enters, than the European Union to bear could.”</seg>
<seg>But the most important reason against the entry of Turkey is a question of the democracy: The majority of the population of European Union does not want it simply.</seg>
<seg>Of Bolivia crisis, of Latin America failure</seg>
<seg>Bolivia is in no regard a typically Latin American country.</seg>
<seg>Apart from Haiti, it is the poorest nation in the western hemisphere, it suffers even at still larger instability and looks on a history also over two hundred coups d'etat since its independence back.</seg>
<seg>In a region with a strong indigenen past and a wrecked and insulating present Bolivia beside Guatemala is perhaps the only country of Latin America, in which indigene peoples form the majority of the population.</seg>
<seg>Its topography and ethnic distribution bring out autonomous forces and even splitting off efforts, which endanger the national unit in more threatening way than in other countries.</seg>
<seg>In addition it is natural together with Paraguay the only nation on the subcontinent without entrance to the sea.</seg>
<seg>It would be thus extremely imprudent to transfer of Bolivia current crisis to remaining Latin America.</seg>
<seg>Verallgemeinerungen are much too simple: In other countries the institutions are substantially stronger, the poverty -- in particular the extreme poverty -- decreased/went back, and the fight for natural resources is on the whole settled.</seg>
<seg>Even in countries such as Venezuela with large oil reserves and a tradition-conscious, nationalistic government present practice has to permit foreign investments in energy resources soon outlasted the eight-year old reign of president Hugo Chavez.</seg>
<seg>Although in many countries -- of Chiapas after “Araucania”, from Amazonien to Ayacucho -- indigene movements exist, represent them nowhere in Latin America an actual threat for the national unit.</seg>
<seg>Therefore Bolivia is neither a warning crisis, nor the old-venerable “domino theory”, which both Lyndon Johnson and Che Guevara in the case of Bolivia followed, appears valid or also only halfway reasonable.</seg>
<seg>Of Bolivia refers nevertheless current crisis to the “democratic deficit”, which troubles Latin America at present.</seg>
<seg>Into Bolivia, Ecuador and Haiti the selected leaders were fallen from different reasons.</seg>
<seg>In Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua the democracy is either unsatisfactorily pronounced or missing, and in Venezuela and Colombia it is threatened by different causes.</seg>
<seg>None of these cases corresponds exactly to the others, it is threateningly, harmful or conciliatory in different measure.</seg>
<seg>The question is, which can be undertaken in this situation, which differs strongly from the encouraging view, which determined the picture still a few years ago.</seg>
<seg>At the last meeting of the organization of American states in Fort Lauderdale in Florida the United States took up a good idea of others and essentially brought them by their support to case.</seg>
<seg>History began a draft for the report over democracy in Latin America before a few years, as the former Argentine minister of foreign affairs Dante Caputo and the development program of the United Nations (UNDP) was assigned, to write.</seg>
<seg>They came at the conclusion that an early warning system for democratic crises in the region would contribute to it to act, before the things got like at present in Bolivia out of control.</seg>
<seg>Caputo and the UN-team convinced thereupon the Chilean president Ricardo Lagos to take up and promote with some its colleagues the initiative.</seg>
<seg>He did that, but the initiative came not very far.</seg>
<seg>Even in 2004 the published UNDP report over democracy in Latin America she hardly found to mention.</seg>
<seg>The USA and the new Chilean Secretary-General of the OAS, Jose Miguel Insulza, brought the plan again with the OAS meeting in Florida on the table, but rejected one it because of the justified fears of the latin Americans, the idea would be directed, mixed against Venezuela with the anachronistischen fears of the latin Americans to offend against the high-holy principle of the noninterference.</seg>
<seg>Although the continent could not agree on the principle, attention is entitled to the idea of an early warning system.</seg>
<seg>At present it gives probably little, what the USA can undertake regarding the situation in Bolivia, and nevertheless saves the situation for all some dangers.</seg>
<seg>Evo Morales, Oppositionsführer and Anführer of the Kokapflanzenanbauer, more honestly, although, democratic ruling power may be badly advisory, but is its supporters completely freely by authoritarian efforts?</seg>
<seg>Hugo Chavez financed perhaps not Morales and the other Bolivian dissidents, but are actually not tried Venezuela and Cuba to interfere into the affairs of the country in which Che Guevara died before nearly 40 years as Guerillaführer?</seg>
<seg>Perhaps don't the Bolivian businessmen from Santa Cruz make their threat of a splitting off true, but them the oil and gas reserves of their region with the indigenen population in the high country will rather divide than with Brazilian manufacturers from São Paulo?</seg>
<seg>Before the events achieved such extremes, perhaps the OAS (not the USA) had been supposed to intervene.</seg>
<seg>The region is further dependent on this intervention -- in time, consistently and on a normal democratic basis -- an intervention, which differs from the traditional US intervention and of Latin America of traditional indifference.</seg>
<seg>The fall of France?</seg>
<seg>The Frenchmen are as well known sensitively if not defensively which the reputation of France in the world concern.</seg>
<seg>The French state pretends much money on publicising the French language and culture and is painfully conscious the Frenchmen nevertheless that the global position of its country does not possess no more the same value as in former times.</seg>
<seg>It is thus no surprise the fact that the publication of a report of the European commission during the past presidential elections in which was maintained that France is fallen on the tenth place in the economic rank list of the European countries in one period of ten years of third, to a conscience examination and to controversies led. Already soon president Jacques Chirac gave the debt at the “fall of France” to its rival Lionel Jospin.</seg>
<seg>The OECD and Eurostat, which as such data responsible person European office regarded, this aspect of the debate by her statement that France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain into approximately the same standard of living per head enjoy all for terminated.</seg>
<seg>The public controversy remained however.</seg>
<seg>The demonstrations of this year against the pension reform, increasing disputes with the European commission over the financial policy and Gezänk with America because of the Iraq war let anxious discussions revive over the “French fall” again.</seg>
<seg>The momentarily usually-sold special book in France is a polemic of Nicolas Baverez, La France qui tombe (France in the descent).</seg>
<seg>Baverez' book saves an abundance of quotations of de Gaulle and Napoleon.</seg>
<seg>According to the author obtained France its last achievements in the seventies-years with the introduction of the express train TGV and the airbus.</seg>
<seg>It castigates both edge of center and Chirac for it “common talent to win elections and to make France the loser”.</seg>
<seg>The success of the book is even a reference to a kind “Malaise”.</seg>
<seg>But which kind of bad state?</seg>
<seg>Baverez' proof of degeneration is not convincingly as he as believes.</seg>
<seg>Thus he states for example a dwindling of jobs in the industry as the most obvious proof for the fall of France.</seg>
<seg>The Deindustrialisierung is however all industrialized countries common.</seg>
<seg>France goes it even better as most of its rivals under the rich countries and it has, differently than Germany, Great Britain or the USA, whom maintain same global market share at the industrial sector, which it had at the beginning of the seventies-years.</seg>
<seg>According to the foreign investments, a better measure for competitive power, is to France besides very well.</seg>
<seg>A newer report of the advice for restaurant economics according to the direct investments are in France in the year 2001 to 60 billion euro risen, almost twice as much as in Germany.</seg>
<seg>Also the concerning the price competitive ability of France improved (around 20%) in the past three decades by means of increased productivity, which released rapid wage growth.</seg>
<seg>The core of the long-term economic difficulties of France is however exactly the fear of the loss of industrialism places.</seg>
<seg>In traditional ranges like the automobile or space industry France is further a strong industrial power; in innovative markets, in which smaller enterprises spread new technologies, it stays however.</seg>
<seg>France spends for example only 30 billion dollar in the year on the F&E von Spitzentechnologien, compared to 51 billion dollar in Germany, 98 billion dollar in Japan and 265 billion dollar in the USA.</seg>
<seg>Briefly said Baverez' analysis aims simply in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg>In the process of the last twenty years France went through a number of crucially important reforms: economic and financial liberalisation, the abolishment of price and exchange controls, the end of the credit restrictions, European liberalisation, reduced inflation and trade deficits, the introduction of the euro and the forced globalization of the enterprises of the country.</seg>
<seg>The French Malaise has to do with all that nothing.</seg>
<seg>Of France problem is that he does not succeed in recognizing the new world of which it some already is.</seg>
<seg>French state capitalism is dead and France falls it heavily to resign itself to its Dahinscheiden.</seg>
<seg>France seems itself to be the only country, in that an Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, feels obligated, one day later in the television for its statement to apologize that “the state is not all powerful”.</seg>
<seg>There are many reasons for this French schizophrenia, one the crucial is connected however with the political happening of the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg>Until 1981 there was a clear separation in France between on the right of and left.</seg>
<seg>Since then both the governments edge of center and Chirac moderated their ideological sharpness, in order to carry the difficult process of the adjustment to Europe and the globalization.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps a round “shock therapy” à la Margaret Thatcher before twenty years would have created a new political consciousness.</seg>
<seg>But the by agreement kleckerweise execution of reforms made it for the Frenchmen possible to live in a world and think in another.</seg>
<seg>This is one of the crucial reasons for the devastating political circulation, which took place during the last election campaign before the presidential election, when the right-wing extremist party chief Jean-Marie Le Pen before the acting Prime Minister Lionel Jospin reached the second round of the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg>The ascent extreme linking, which could book 10% of the voices for itself during this election campaign, witnesses likewise from this political failure.</seg>
<seg>France needs rather a political as an economic revolution, if it is to resign itself to the reality. Part this reality it is that the “fall of France” is a fear, which produces the French people.</seg>
<seg>The value of European values</seg>
<seg>The governments of Europe took up the discussions over an European Constitution again, after these were broken off in last December due to a controversy over voting procedures.</seg>
<seg>Such differences of opinion are to be settled naturally by compromises, which are in all probability also found.</seg>
<seg>About what one must become however still united, is a clear conception of it, which is to be achieved with the European condition.</seg>
<seg>The European integration is based on two fundamental principles: Solidarity and Subsidiarität.</seg>
<seg>Both principles are at the interface between philosophy, politics, economics, sociology and right.</seg>
<seg>For years they find their expression in the legal and institutional framework of the European union - in contracts, in the fundamental right Charter (where they are called in the preamble) and in the present draft constitution.</seg>
<seg>Both principles are thus in history and in the ideals of the European Union embodied.</seg>
<seg>What however do solidarity and Subsidiarität really mean?</seg>
<seg>We regard first the solidarity, which can be interpreted in at least double regard: When static solidarity goes, with that it only around the distribution from incomes and prosperity and as that far handing concept of the dynamic solidarity, with which also the production is considered by incomes and prosperity.</seg>
<seg>In the history of the European integration after the Second World War, the dynamic solidarity stood in the foreground, both in the economic development (reconstruction) in the first phase - those the European community for coal and steel - and in the treaty systems, particularly in the contract of Rome.</seg>
<seg>That does not mean however that the dynamic solidarity was later no longer given: The European monetary union is for example an expression of this dynamic solidarity.</seg>
<seg>Although some countries did not have a direct advantage of the introduction of the euro, they agreed nevertheless it, because they were convinced of on a long-term basis positive effects of the common currency.</seg>
<seg>In other words: With dynamic solidarity it acts around strategies, on it aims at itself investments, innovations, to promote economic growth and the job creation.</seg>
<seg>As however the numbers for the GDP growth show in the European Union, the dynamic solidarity was weakened in the last ten years.</seg>
<seg>Particularly concern exciting in this connection is the arrears of Europe in the ranges research and development.</seg>
<seg>The conversion in the year 2000 of the decided Lisbon strategy by the European Union, which is to create the most competitive marketing area of the world from the European union, is however from an increasing accent shift threatened toward static solidarity, which reflects itself in high costs of the welfare state and high taxes to its financing.</seg>
<seg>The increase of the static solidarity lies in the obsolescence of the population justified, who leads apart from slower economic growth to a structural imbalance in the national budgets.</seg>
<seg>One the largest future Herauforderungen of the European Union will be the development of solution models, in order to change the static solidarity predominating today, which orients itself at old humans, in favor of dynamic solidarity, which places young people into the center.</seg>
<seg>Last end cannot it the union afford that the present consumption lies further over that investment level, which is necessary, in order to secure the prosperity in the future.</seg>
<seg>The principle of the Subsidiarität is in as much similar to the concept of the solidarity as it permits likewise two interpretations: Those the vertical and the horizontal Subsidiarität.</seg>
<seg>The vertical Subsidiarität describes the division of power between the different government levels and the sovereignty: Thus between the European Union, the nation states, regions and municipalities.</seg>
<seg>The most well-known application of this principle is the federalism.</seg>
<seg>In the European contracts this vertical Subsidiarität is clearly fixed.</seg>
<seg>But that is sufficient, in order to seize the developing institutional and constitutional framework of the union?</seg>
<seg>The horizontal Subsidiarität describes the responsibility and freedom of humans as well as social and economic power relations.</seg>
<seg>In addition the relations between the state, the society and the market belongs.</seg>
<seg>However and the market their own rights and sovereignty ranges, which are not granted by the state, have the society.</seg>
<seg>The problem develops from there with the protection of the autonomy of each range.</seg>
<seg>An example of horizontal Subsidiarität is the European domestic market, which created a new kind of economic freedom and increasing competition between enterprises, as the national protective mechanisms for these enterprises were abolished.</seg>
<seg>Horizontal Subsidiarität means that the state neither in the society nor in the economy, which may injure individual freedom and responsibility she has to thus respect in the greatest possible extent.</seg>
<seg>Beyond that horizontal Subsidiarität means that a “superordinate power” has to grant support there, where the individual freedom and responsibility are not sufficient, in order would achieve the goal of the keeping of the human.</seg>
<seg>This support should be converted however in a kind, those the natural potential of the particular, the society and the market promotes.</seg>
<seg>That is however possible only if the role of the horizontal Subsidiarität is clearly formulated. That is neither in the European contracts nor in the fundamental right Charter or in the work of the European convention the case.</seg>
<seg>In short, solidarity means today rather rearrangement as growth (in such a way the today's generation their solidarity expresses with future generations) and Subsidiarität means today the distribution of political power and not the careful demarcation between the state, the citizen company and the market.</seg>
<seg>Today both values are defined in such a way that the state of the beneficiaries is.</seg>
<seg>Thus the concentration is often interpreted on market-focused growth as identification with the halfstrange values Americas.</seg>
<seg>But these values are deeply rooted and should be brought also in Europe the surface.</seg>
<seg>The European Union should re-establish their economic dynamics, by pursuing a model of solidarity and Subsidiarität, which rather the market and the society preferentially and which decreases the socio-economic influence of the state.</seg>
<seg>National institutions should be responsible for the supply public goods (like defense, law as well as tax and monetary policy) the society for social goods (like culture, education and assistance for needy humans) and the market for economical goods (with profit, growth and occupation in connection stand).</seg>
<seg>In 21. Century must itself Europe the values of both principles - which solidarity and the Subsidiarität - deliberate, if it wants to achieve its historical goal of the integration: To achieve the freedom and the prosperity, which are necessary, in order to overcome the differences and political dividing lines, which the disasters in 20. Century released.</seg>
<seg>In this spirit the European condition must be written.</seg>
<seg>The policy of the values</seg>
<seg>The discussion around the American elections did not diminish yet.</seg>
<seg>How did president George W. Bush create it to get and in addition in both chambers of the congress a republican majority select let three million voices more than senator John Kerry?</seg>
<seg>With the answers to it little agreement prevails, but two topics emerge in many explanations.</seg>
<seg>One is personality.</seg>
<seg>In a time humans more confidence in the presidents, whom they could do, had of full uncertainties and threats than into a candidate, whose abilities seemed not yet proven.</seg>
<seg>The second topic are values.</seg>
<seg>The people were correct for a structure of values, and not for a certain policy.</seg>
<seg>Some (so reported) with Kerrys politics, gave their voice however nevertheless Bush actually agreed, because they felt “well” with its general attitudes.</seg>
<seg>The United States are at present split regarding the elections clearly.</seg>
<seg>A sheet of blue (more democratic) states in the east, the north and the west re-clamps an enormous (republican) area in the center and in the south.</seg>
<seg>Beyond that the division reflects itself also on local level.</seg>
<seg>Constituency unit deformations -- i.e. pulling constituency borders, in order to favour a certain political party -- are not necessary any longer.</seg>
<seg>The people bend actually to pull into areas in which others divide their moral concepts, are republican or democratic it.</seg>
<seg>Do these values lie wherein exactly?</seg>
<seg>They have allegedly something with “god, guns and gays” -- with God, weapons and gays -- to do.</seg>
<seg>Religion plays thereby a role and among other things also the literal truth of the Bible, if it concerns creation history.</seg>
<seg>The possession of a weapon is the crucial Individualismustest, and the use of weapons in wars is not anything horrible.</seg>
<seg>Gays and other “modern” practices are excessively rejected than.</seg>
<seg>As the political scientist Andrew hacker expressed it recently: “Bush's candidacy it is so put on that she wins the majority, by help about 60 million humans to it with itself to be content.”</seg>
<seg>Is the whole an American phenomenon or gives it at other places similar trends?</seg>
<seg>An answer is not that the policy of the values can at present produce a majority as American phenomenon, but is under any circumstances generally accepted this.</seg>
<seg>Europe and other parts of the world are equally split.</seg>
<seg>Personality is certainly important, and below the obvious political differences possibly hide themselves value questions, which did not arrive yet at the daylight.</seg>
<seg>But traditional political differences, which are based on disagreement regarding fundamental values, play a ever smaller role with the elections.</seg>
<seg>For example the English prime minister Tony Blair, for who as a next large leader before a choice stands, sets personality” on the map “and speaks of politics, but it represents above all a structure of values of the middle class.</seg>
<seg>He speaks of “modernization” or of it, “in 21. Century to arrive”, succeeds it to it, a its own, to obtain however responding mixture from change and stability.</seg>
<seg>Whereupon the conservative opposition found so far no effective answer.</seg>
<seg>Even not brought with questions such as reductions of taxes and stricter asylum regulations values in the measure in the play like the republican party this in the USA was able.</seg>
<seg>A similar picture results in Germany, where the obvious influence of the value politics is even still smaller.</seg>
<seg>The discussion in Germany is to a large extent still another political discussion.</seg>
<seg>If the opposition of the government of discussions to the health reform or -- as happen last -- for the fight unemployment offers, is with the contest lying to reason rather around authority as around values.</seg>
<seg>But value conflicts lie in wait under the well-known battlegrounds of the political discussion in Great Britain and Germany like elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
<seg>The parties fight for those, which one can bring to it, “with itself to be content”, but do not recognize them possibly not perfectly that it only partly concerns thereby a question of the policy.</seg>
<seg>It is improbable that the religion in the European policy becomes an important factor. Public opinion polls show that the adherence to religious regulations represents one of the few large differences between Americans and Europeans.</seg>
<seg>Weapons take likewise another value in European consciousness. Most Europeans regard their absence as important.</seg>
<seg>In Europe also a trace of pazifistischer values is unmistakable.</seg>
<seg>But the topic of the political correctness (“gay”) plays a role underestimated so far also in Europe.</seg>
<seg>Above all Europe divides the Europeans, since the “national question” is raised in all European states.</seg>
<seg>This is a value problem, which is released by fear.</seg>
<seg>Humans want to know, where they belong, and turn thereby against the USA and to Europe, or against Europe and to their own country.</seg>
<seg>In each case we leave the range of the political guidelines and even that the policy and enter the dark realm of the symbols and myths.</seg>
<seg>This is in any case the main risk, democratic countries are exposed to which, because the policy of the values is a dangerous development.</seg>
<seg>To societies, whose largest democratic achievement just banishing the fundamentalism from the policy was, it introduces again fundamental dividing lines.</seg>
<seg>A enlightened public discussion must be an argument over politics, which are determined by a group of values.</seg>
<seg>On it to insist, from there a primary goal of the policy of the freedom is.</seg>
<seg>The time of the interest rates approaches</seg>
<seg>One swallow doesn't make spring and one month of normal job growth and rising prices in the United States it does not mean that the federal supervision of the US banks would have lost the fear of economic bad state and deflation.</seg>
<seg>But the time will come, into the interest rates of the world begins to rise, because prepare central bankers on it before arising inflationist tendencies stop to order.</seg>
<seg>Whenever it will be so far - whether in this autumn, in the year 2005 or 2006 or in the year 2007 - America and the world economy will be confronted with financial susceptibilities, which reflect the success of monetary stimulation measures of the past three years regarding the containment of fallings off in production and the absorption of unemployment.</seg>
<seg>Interest rates for short term credits are amazingly small: only 2% in the Eurozone, only 1% in the USA and zero in Japan.</seg>
<seg>The expansionistic monetary policy is successfully been, however only as the interest rates on historical lowest points pressed - and as investors were convinced that the credit costs will remain for a long time on their current conditions.</seg>
<seg>The most important result of the monetary impulse was a price increase with net assets: Everything that throws profits off, a dividend or rents disburses, will around some attractive - and thus financially substantially more valuable - if the interest rates is very low and will remain probably very low.</seg>
<seg>The large downward gradient between the current prices for real estate in the USA, securities in New York, London and Frankfurt and long-term loans explains everywhere and what one should normally regard as its fundamental values.</seg>
<seg>What will thus happen, if the central banks begin the interest rates to increase?</seg>
<seg>In the year 1994 the increase of the interest rates for short term credits led to interest rises within the long-term range - and to falling prices for long-term loans - which were double its at least, which usual prognosis models forecast at this time.</seg>
<seg>Besides interest rates in the peripheral marketing areas of the world, rose the developing countries, substantially more strongly than interest rates in the large industrial nations.</seg>
<seg>The first danger, over which one must beyond that make thus for the year 2005 and thought - if the interest rates will in all probability rise world-wide - is thus a further wave of financial crises in development markets.</seg>
<seg>For countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the record of the nineties-years showed that interest margins become larger and Kapitalflüsse remarkably fast to turn around to be able itself, regardless of its, how favorably IWF representatives and analyses of large banks evaluate the policy of a country.</seg>
<seg>The interest margins of the threshold markets are at present unusually small.</seg>
<seg>International funds stream - apart from supplies into the USA - are not yet on levels, which one would bring with “irrational Überschwänglichkeit” in connection, but that could still pass before the interest rates to rise to begin.</seg>
<seg>Those are alarming prospects, because if the nineties-years one to have taught, then that nobody should overrate the stability of international financial rivers.</seg>
<seg>The second danger is due to high net assets within the large industrial nations.</seg>
<seg>The predominating way of thinking within the federal supervision of the US banks - with which I agree - obviously exists in the fact that the revolution of the information technology persists that the growth speed of the potenziellen production achievement remains very high in the USA and is relatively large therefore that the production gap.</seg>
<seg>From the fact one can conclude that interest rates must remain actually low during a quite considerable period possibly.</seg>
<seg>It is added that the confidence is high into the federal supervision of the US banks and the last leftovers of the risk premium of the inflation of the seventies-years were pressed out of interest rates.</seg>
<seg>Consequently interest rates, based on the eighties and nineties-years, low to remain, also after production conditions exhaust again their potential.</seg>
<seg>Those are naturally all good pieces of news for those, which possess net assets like long-term loans, shares and real estate.</seg>
<seg>Because the price increase of long-term net assets was exactly the crucial point with the lowering of the interest rates: Finally an enrichment of the security owners us in particular the real estate owner affects in a lively manner the expenditures.</seg>
<seg>Bad message is that, even if on it is counted that the interest rates remain long low a time, it not on indefinite time will remain so low.</seg>
<seg>With a word: If the interest rates rise, net assets will sink.</seg>
<seg>Those are exactly the times - in particular, if net assets decrease rapidly and substantially - in which we determine, how well our central bankers really fulfill their major task: the decrease of financial volatility and the promotion of economic stability.</seg>
<seg>While such periods determine we likewise, like many persons, who possess long-term loans, real estate or shares this do, because they do not believe that the current prices are based on the basic data attractive, but because the prices in the process of the past years rose.</seg>
<seg>For decision makers is a crucial question, because those, which acquired long-term net assets due to obviously constantly rising prices, are also those, which will again sell them, as soon as the price trends develop apparently moving in opposite directions.</seg>
<seg>In particular the American deficit on the balance of payments on current account appears threateningly as a substantial cause for instability, should the prices for long-term net assets fall clearly.</seg>
<seg>The challenges, to which the economical decision makers will see themselves world-wide in the process in relation to the coming year, are surely different than those, with which they were confronted since the Zerplatzen of the NASDAQ blister.</seg>
<seg>The risks in connection with inflation are probably less dangerous than those, which result from breaking down production and threatening deflation.</seg>
<seg>How we learned however in the nineties-years, that does not mean that the forthcoming difficulties would be to be mastered more simply.</seg>
<seg>Of America contradictory future prospects</seg>
<seg>Recently I got to know something interesting: In America internationally oriented financial economists have and at national conditions oriented macro economists very different -- after straight contradictory -- Opinions over the probable consequences of the enormous American deficit on the balance of payments on current account.</seg>
<seg>The internationally oriented financial economists hold a financial crisis, followed from a painful and possibly continuous recession  in the USA for probable.</seg>
<seg>In contrast to it the national oriented macro economists see one which can be expected to exchange loss dollar not as crisis, but as chance to accelerate the economic growth.</seg>
<seg>The situation presents itself the macro economist approximately in such a way: In the future foreign central banks will not sometime be ready any more as before to buy in great quantities dollar share papers in order to support thereby the American currency.</seg>
<seg>If they stop their extensive dollar purchases, the value of the dollar will fall -- and the landing becomes hard.</seg>
<seg>With the depreciation of the dollar however, so the macro economists, US exports for other countries more attractively and the employment outlook in America to improve, there increases workers into the rising export sector to walk.</seg>
<seg>The development would be similarly as in Great Britain, as one the currency connection gave up and the British Pound opposite the German Mark  one devalued or as in the USA of the late 1980er years, as the dollar in relation to the Pound, the German Mark and -- above all -- against the Japanese yen one devalued. </seg>
<seg>The internationally oriented financial economists see the future around some dark.</seg>
<seg>In their eyes the end of the dollar purchases will lead by the central banks not only to a devaluation of the dollar, but also to an highest level with the long-term interest rates in the USA, whereby the consumption expenditure and short time after also the capital expenditures will be reduced directly.</seg>
<seg>Naturally also the financial economists expect that the US exports of an exchange loss of the dollar profit, but by the delays in the demand the export rise will enter or two years after the decrease with the consumer and capital expenditures.</seg>
<seg>The jobs of eight to ten million humans from the service sector into the export and the import-competitive range will shift, whereby on a rise of the structural unemployment is to be counted. </seg>
<seg>Besides it could come to a financial panic: For large financial establishment ions with their short term commitments and long-term net assets will it difficult to bear a steep rise of the long-term dollar interest rates.</seg>
<seg>This disproportion can lead just as easily to financial pressure and to the bankruptcy as at that time during the crises in Mexico and Eastern Asia into the 1990er years and before a few years in Argentina, as the imbalance between the plants of the banks held in local currencies and  their dollar commitments to financial overloading and in the long run to the bankruptcy led.</seg>
<seg>If internationally oriented financial economists sketch this scenario, the macro economists answer, all sounds after a case of incapable monetary policy.</seg>
<seg>Why should the American issuing bank permit federal reserve long-term point interest rates, only because other central banks would drive through no more dollar purchases?</seg>
<seg>Shouldn't the Fed intervene simply and instead even long-term US government loans to buy and thus to a long-term interest rate in a height contribute, which is compatible with full employment?</seg>
<seg>Whereupon the financial economists react with the reference that the Fed would not have in addition Kraft.</seg>
<seg>If it has the choice between full employment and price stability, then, the Fed will decide so the financial economists for price stability, since the memories of the zügellose inflation are still very present in the 1970's.</seg>
<seg>Since an exchange loss of the dollar leads to a rise of the import prices and represents from there a negative shock for the offer side of the economy, the Fed will have to increase the interest rates and will not lower and also loans will not buy, but will sell.  </seg>
<seg>On both sides of this debate respectable economists with large reproduction, whom extraordinary I estimate, engage themselves.</seg>
<seg>I am not intelligently enough, in order to decide, which side is in the right, but I know completely exactly, from which side I hope that she is in injustice.</seg>
<seg>Of Europe free rider</seg>
<seg>In the USA must Federal States, which pursue an insufficient budgetary policy on punishments count.</seg>
<seg>Their loans are less worth than those from better led Federal States.</seg>
<seg>The higher debt service, which the careless ones have to carry out, serves -- up to a certain degree -- as disciplining measure against the temptation to spend the money now and to settle the calculation later.</seg>
<seg>Naturally disciplining is not perfect by the market: The loan market “does not see” implicit future commitments (like assured pension payments) to large extent.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless this forced household discipline in combination with the budget measures of the individual Federal States contributed to the fact that there were no more large household crises in the USA since the large depression.</seg>
<seg>We turn now to Europe.</seg>
<seg>Before the introduction of the euro there were budget crises, which led to high inflation in individual states of south Europe.</seg>
<seg>Due to the single currency however the way to the solution of a household crisis is over the inflation blocked, there now the European central bank (EZB) over the monetary policy is awake.</seg>
<seg>Although thus the European countries cannot regulate their financial deficits no more over the inflation, it permits them the single currency to take up and their Ausgabenorgien expand the debt capacity, which is entitled actually to the other EU member, for itself, in order one while in rushes and Braus to live and the political responsibility on later to shift.</seg>
<seg>In order to put for these possibilities forward a bolt, growth and stability pact were brought into being: The national deficits must be below 3% of the Gross Domestic Product.</seg>
<seg>Last week broke now Germany -- once the most disciplined budgetary presentation country of the European Union -- the rules of the pact for the fifth time in series and without (large) apologies.</seg>
<seg>Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück gave to understand that he on sanctions of the European commission against Germany count, because otherwise would stand the reliability of the pact on the play.</seg>
<seg>Differently than before two and a half years Germany would this time not place itself from there against the sanctions.</seg>
<seg>Steinbrück however also got straight that it on the fact count that the sanctions will be due to the prognosticated deficit of 3,4% of the Gross Domestic Product of to a large extent symbolic nature and no punishments, which for the government or economics would be connected with significant costs.</seg>
<seg>Growth and stability pact function -- still -- nowhere approximately so, as originally meant.</seg>
<seg>How does it stand around the market discipline?</seg>
<seg>Will the readiness of the German government to accumulate still more debts and larger deficits smaller, because the market recognizes and punishes those states, which accept a weakening of their relating to financial policy position?</seg>
<seg>The answer reads “no”.</seg>
<seg>The interest rates for the public debts of the twelve member states of the Eurozone denominierten in euros are very similar all.</seg>
<seg>It does not seem to care the market from there that the countries have different Potenziale, to set the exports in motion in order to lukrieren those financial rivers, which would be necessary for different current or prognosticated ratios of public spending to GNP for the debt repayment or.</seg>
<seg>Willem Buiter of the University of Amsterdam and Anne Sibert of the University OF London believe that the readiness of the EZB undermines to accept in the long run all debts of the Eurozone as collateral the ability of the market as driving Kraft of budgetary caution to work.</seg>
<seg>So for a long time a slight part of the German debts as security for a short term credit or as heart of a security pension business for the improvement of the liquidity to serve can, its value much rather of those conditions will be certain, to which the EZB accepts these as security, as of its true value.</seg>
<seg>The fact that the EZB treats all these debts as equal sources of liquidity it is granted, more weights than all analyses over the differences in long-term national risks.</seg>
<seg>In the long term this development is dangerous.</seg>
<seg>In order to protect a reasonable chance on long-term price stability, it requires both market discipline and solid household managements.</seg>
<seg>Becomes if the immediate punishment of the market for a behavior, which can degenerate later in Rücksichtslosigkeit, switched off or it is missing at institutional regulations to be counted in order to give to future generations a voice, then is on serious risks -- perhaps not today or tomorrow, but sometime intended and then for long time.</seg>
<seg>Over the years the introduction of the single currency and the kind has like this accomplished, to ever larger uneasiness was led.</seg>
<seg>The policy in the entire Eurozone is too deflationär put on.</seg>
<seg>One verabsäumt it to accomplish transfers which would be necessary, in order to make the single currency portable also for those regions, whose position itself worsened and which already in a recession are, if the EZB intensifies its politics.</seg>
<seg>The institutional bases for a stable long-term budgetary policy are undermined.</seg>
<seg>And now Buiter and Sibert determine convincingly that the EZB grants too little clearance to the market, in order to reward the economical ones and punish the spendthrifts.</seg>
<seg>Still no break lines are recognizable and for the next time are that also not to be expected.</seg>
<seg>But if the things do not change, the ground under the euro could very probably turn out in motion.</seg>
<seg>Milosevic and Hussein: Jurisdiction as farce</seg>
<seg>War crimes trials were once a serious affair.</seg>
<seg>One remembers the photos depressed by Hermann Göring and Rudolf Heß sitting in Nuremberg, on the dock.</seg>
<seg>Some Nazi sizes were even hung after relatively short, but fair process.</seg>
<seg>Nowadays the legal proceedings decayed against the most rejected political leaders of our world to the farce.</seg>
<seg>The process against Saddam Hussein and its Spießgesellen from the Ba'ath party are characterized by a continuous series of embarrassments.</seg>
<seg>The accused tries it with a Posse after the other one, and Hussein shows each possible form of ignoring the court to show except the judge the naked back.</seg>
<seg>It is heavy to imagine a result that in the eyes of the Iraqis or the world will appear legitimate.</seg>
<seg>Alldieweil changed itself the process against Slobodan Milosevic to the funeral -- after four boring years of the testimonies and a waste of more than 200 million dollar.</seg>
<seg>In Kambodscha the United Nations and the government therefore haggle for nearly one decade as the process is to be made the survivor elements of the red Khmer.</seg>
<seg>The mass murderers, in 20. Century to power came, were  -- if they did not die, while they were still in power -- to it to be condemned, with risings of the people killed or for their crimes before court be placed.</seg>
<seg>Who it be proud on the fact can that the last communist ruling power of Romania, Nicolae Ceauşescu, and its wife without also only the appearance of a fair process were shot?</seg>
<seg>The formal Brimborium of genuine courts appears always better than the self law, even if at the end in both cases death stands.</seg>
<seg>There are today two reliable methods to proceed against a set off Tyrannen.</seg>
<seg>A nation can place their former leaders themselves before court, as it the Argentinier into the 1980er years with for the disappearance of more than 5,000 of her citizens responsible person generals did.</seg>
<seg>On international level further the Nürnberger Model is available for future processes -- certainly under the doubtful circumstances that winner powers sometimes punishments for crimes -- as for instance “crimes against the humanity” -- impose, for it at the time, when they were committed, no normal definition gave.</seg>
<seg>There was a time, in which the advantages were recognizable both national and international processes.</seg>
<seg>Locally taking place processes made possible it the local community to carry out by close participation in the procedure mourning work.</seg>
<seg>When judges and jurors could bring the compatriots of the accused in addition larger sensitivity into the evaluation of the debt, because they were the difficult circumstances consciously, under which the set off dictator its decisions fällte.</seg>
<seg>Of Argentina procedure against the generals was a successful ritual with the laborious transition from the military junta to the democracy, but the experience ended in tears and self-doubt.</seg>
<seg>Even after their condemnation the generals were still sufficiently powerful, in order to force the completion of the processes and afterwards the pardon by them following the president.</seg>
<seg>This very day the Argentine policy of process caused involvement which is past by the legal consequences of those 20 years is characterized.</seg>
<seg>Likewise on international level the decision of the UN security council was welcomed for the mechanism of the international criminal court for former Yugoslavia (ICTY) with large confidence.</seg>
<seg>The ICTY fällte, under the direction of Antonio Cassese, a number of fundamental decisions.</seg>
<seg>Then however the judges had pitch to be able to realize their boldest dream -- the negotiation, before their court, against the ore rogue Slobodan Milosevic.</seg>
<seg>It is not clear, as the Serbs would have dealt with a process in the own country with Milosevic.</seg>
<seg>Much would have been dependent on the political party, which would have controlled the court.</seg>
<seg>On international level one was not afraid too much one at politics, but at right.</seg>
<seg>Milosevics process should be more than fair, should a symbol for the justice of the UN.</seg>
<seg>Thus it was permitted Milosevic to defend itself -- under the criterion of the length and efficiency of the procedure a giant error.</seg>
<seg>The number of the witnesses, whom the accusation called, in order to testify again and again the same terrible history from Serbian aggression and brutality to, did not know borders.</seg>
<seg>It will take still months, in order to determine, what went inclined and dragged on why the process over four scandalous years.</seg>
<seg>My instinct says to me that the probably-meaning court officials let themselves affect all too much of the South African truth and reconciliation commission -- a model, which is proclaimed in the legal faculties as desirable alternative to the retaliation law.</seg>
<seg>In the South African procedures the most important question was not after the future of the accused, but after the past of the victims.</seg>
<seg>Each victim was encouraged to tell its history and the accused listened.</seg>
<seg>In case of in run 20. Century suffered massacres a such processing can require decades.</seg>
<seg>The victims for talking to encourage and then to the accused that right grant to kidnap by Anpreisen of own political earnings/services the procedure runs on a prescription for do not end wanting delays outside.</seg>
<seg>A lesson, which we from the processes against Milosevic and Hussein to have learned to make is that one should not place men or women before court, in order their charismatic conditioned attractiveness an end.</seg>
<seg>They will actually tear the procedure -- in particular, if one permits it them to defend itself -- and the court room for the justification of the own career use.</seg>
<seg>One should place Tyrannen only before court if they are clearly defeated.</seg>
<seg>Ironically it was an advantage of the Nürnberger of courts that they were occupied with the representatives of winner powers.</seg>
<seg>These were a constant memory to Göring, Heß and their helpers that the allied ones had a saying and the Nazis were unalterably defeated.</seg>
<seg>A clear goal of the procedure was always the punishment of the guilty ones, not the influence of future historiography.</seg>
<seg>The tragedy of the processes against Milosevic and Hussein consists of the fact that to the “i” still the Tüpfelchen was missing to history in its case -- and history before court stood.</seg>
<seg>The irresoluteness on the part of the responsible persons, which is due from this, led -- internationally as national -- to procedures, which facilitated Fantastereien of rehablitation and return.</seg>
<seg>In the case Husseins could become this Fantasterei even still reality.</seg>
<seg>Economical dividing lines in Iraq</seg>
<seg>Iraq presents itself all observers as a state divided between Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds.</seg>
<seg>But a just as fundamental dividing line runs along the increasing gap between arm and realm -- a dividing line, which contributed to the current rebellion as religiously motivated fight likewise as to the resistance against the military crew stated of the Americans.</seg>
<seg>When Iraq was released, many, above all poor humans hoped for a charismatic leader, that would save them from the bitter reality of their everyday life.</seg>
<seg>These humans did not grow up in fear and had a conception, how the democracy would affect its society or how human rights groups and civil rights movements could make a contribution for the organization of the future.</seg>
<seg>Already soon one was confronted in Iraq with a new social dividing line.</seg>
<seg>On the one side stood those, which had understood, how one proceeds in a democracy, power attained and its goals realised.</seg>
<seg>They learned the language of the democracy to speak, as one during this process to money and influence comes and as one independent organizations uses to defend rights and privileges.</seg>
<seg>On the other side of this dividing line however the large majority of the helpless Iraqis remains, including which widows as well as divorced or women abandoned by their men, who do not have anybody, which provides for them and their children.</seg>
<seg>For these humans democracy and human rights do not mean nothing at all.</seg>
<seg>They do not have education, are poor and ill.</seg>
<seg>As victims of an education system, which broke down before more than one decade, they order only over few knowledge, them to help could in the ailing Iraqi economy an occupation find.</seg>
<seg>During the rule Saddams did not give it to any efforts to improve the standard of living arms.</seg>
<seg>I visited the enormous slum areas in Iraq and found families, which lived in dwellings, where there was hardly a roof over the head, which were thoroughly stricken by insects and where the waste water under the door oozed.</seg>
<seg>At day and night they live in darkness.</seg>
<seg>These families need nothing else as food, to some extent acceptable accommodations and the prospect on a job, but they wait for death and are afraid of the cries of their verhungernden children.</seg>
<seg>When I met with the women in these dwellings, they over-accumulated me with questions: Will the democracy provide food and houses for us?</seg>
<seg>Will it hold men to strike their wives?</seg>
<seg>Will our children attain thereby the nationality?</seg>
<seg>Will we then be a right to divorce of husbands, who left us?</seg>
<seg>My answer to all these questions read “”.</seg>
<seg>Yes, the democracy gives you the right to an appropriate accommodation, to education and work, your children the nationality will attain and it becomes on an equal footing your men.</seg>
<seg>You will however hard work and will have to undertake all conceivable efforts, in order to call your rights in.</seg>
<seg>Whereupon the women answered: “Saddam in-blued us 35 years long to live without work and without kicking in fear.</seg>
<seg>What can we now do? “</seg>
<seg>In these beg-poor areas, where most Iraqis live, humans bitter temptations succumb.</seg>
<seg>Many of them cannot be attained by politics or the government.</seg>
<seg>They slide off in force, theft and sabotage.</seg>
<seg>Stimulated of the temptations of a wrong heroism, which they could not realize during the long rule Saddams, it brings the poverty to implement for money of acts of violence.</seg>
<seg>The poverty aggravates the trauma of the forceful, by wars and Gräueln coined/shaped history Iraq, which let humans blunt in relation to killing.</seg>
<seg>Although many young men let themselves be hinreißen by the conditions in Iraq to the force, I am convinced that we must put only appropriate jobs and accommodations to them at the disposal, in order to divert her of it.</seg>
<seg>Above all jobs would help the young people to arrange their life new by serious work.</seg>
<seg>We may not mask the army of the unemployed persons by fictitious, NO-Work-jobs so called.</seg>
<seg>We must offer humans to jobs, which give the opportunity them to make a contribution for the reconstruction of the country.</seg>
<seg>Each humans are by nature anxious to be a useful member of the society.</seg>
<seg>But the culture, which prospered under Saddam, convinced to attain the Iraqis that political connections are the only way, in order power, money and knowledge. For the overcoming of this attitude it needs time and a dynamic economy.</seg>
<seg>That means again that the authority of the new Iraqi government must be limited, in order to make the growth possible of the private sector. At the same time an extensive understanding must be promoted by democracy and human rights.</seg>
<seg>Religious groups are ready to make a contribution for this process.</seg>
<seg>We can also the Technokraten, which served under Saddam, rehabilitate, so that also they get the chance to serve their country.</seg>
<seg>Last we do not have to grant poor families loans, which make it for them possible to develop itself a respectable life.</seg>
<seg>Above all the government may not omit effort to convince and them show the Iraqis of the value of the democracy and the freedom, how important the condition for the implementation of its dreams of a better life is.</seg>
<seg>That does not become simple in a country, where many humans regard the law break as heroischen act.</seg>
<seg>We Iraqis however also learned that power may not be concentrated in the hands fewer persons and that the establishment of fair conditions presupposes the fight of all forms of the corruption.</seg>
<seg>If the condition is to serve as guarantor for democracy, freedom and security, the Iraqis must learn to make this fight their fight.</seg>
<seg>Islamist identity</seg>
<seg>Everywhere one sees today, how the Islam becomes used as political Kraft (and abused).</seg>
<seg>Some Muslims use it as request for the action; many in the west (and elsewhere) understand it as “other” demand for demarcation and exclusion.</seg>
<seg>As a Turk I feel both sides of this debate directly.</seg>
<seg>The reason, why the Islam in the view of the west appears as “completely different” religion, is based in the fact that the west experienced a systematic Entinstitutionalisierung of the religion.</seg>
<seg>The religion naturally disappeared not from the modern western life, many more is it the requirement, which religious institutions raise on the behavior of the particular.</seg>
<seg>Religion is in the modern world a much more personal and spirituellere experience than ever before.</seg>
<seg>But also within the Islam a process of the Entinstitutionalisierung of religious experiences already takes place.</seg>
<seg>The politicalization Islam shifts the authority of the religious classes of the Islam, ulema.</seg>
<seg>As in the west the religious experience in the Islam becomes more personal.</seg>
<seg>A result of it is the interpretation of religious texts by the individual Muslim, also on the part of the political fighters, the intellectual ones and women.</seg>
<seg>Another is the coarsing of the religious knowledge, whereby the theory of the Koran is abused and torn from the connection, in order to support political goals.</seg>
<seg>Who decides now, what is permitted in the Islam and which forbade?</seg>
<seg>Who possesses the authority to interpret religious texts?</seg>
<seg>Who can proclaim one “fatwa” or explain one “jihad”?</seg>
<seg>Today activism and terrorism muster a new source of the legitimacy, or force these rather.</seg>
<seg>Thus laymen, what does not mean Islam meant or, decide and it do without the authority of religious schools and special training.</seg>
<seg>The Islam is actually interpreted today primarily by political participants and cultural movements and not by religious institutions.</seg>
<seg>This Entinstitutionalisierung made, instead of being further a local and national social volume to change over to it an imaginary connection between all Muslims for the Islam possible everywhere to schmieden, where her itself suppressed and pressed feels.</seg>
<seg>Therefore the Islamism, supporters, can unite that were in former times deeply quarreled: spirituelle Sufi and law-abiding Sharia of Muslims; Shiite and Sunni; conservative Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, when its believers left and into the cities, also into those of the west drew the rural areas, also the Islam is guessed/advised in motion.</seg>
<seg>Many this development appears as something negative, and it stress that humans are socially entwurzelt thereby which leads to the alienation and for some to the terrorism.</seg>
<seg>But social mobility is also the condition, in order to win a modern perspective.</seg>
<seg>Naturally Muslims experience due to the drift a feeling of the distance of or a complete break with their social origin.</seg>
<seg>Therefore their religious experiences are robbed of all theological, gemeindlichen and national institutions by a new kind and.</seg>
<seg>The religious experience will instead to a form of social conception, within those humans again a sense to develop of belonging in the new and strange environment to the Islam.</seg>
<seg>The dissociation from the modern life, do not separate the approach to this releases the recollection on the religious identity.</seg>
<seg>The radicalism actually mostly develops in groups, which, because they experienced mobility and driving out, are familiar with which worldly forms of political thinking and urban life in the west.</seg>
<seg>By the unusual environment disconcerted, they find their support in the Islam.</seg>
<seg>But so that this support can work satisfactorily, the Islam must free itself in view of the modernity from its traditionally unterwürfigen, passive and sanftmütigen attitude.</seg>
<seg>By carrying a veil or a beard, which or at school call right in to areas for their prayer on the job and stress special food, Muslims give themselves to recognize openly as such.</seg>
<seg>They show thereby everyone in their environment that they follow more eagerly and more exactly their religious obligations than those, which limit their religiousness to their private life.</seg>
<seg>For example non--Muslims see an indication of the degradation and suppression of the mohammedanischen women usually in carrying the veil.</seg>
<seg>Instead of a stigma the veil for Muslims became now the indication of the positive confession their Islamic identity.</seg>
<seg>Young mohammedanische women in Europe illustrate this transformation quite exactly.</seg>
<seg>Girls, who carry the headscarf in French and German schools, stand in many respects (regarding the youth culture, its mode consciousness and its language) for their schoolmates more near as their, uneducated mothers bound to the dwelling.</seg>
<seg>By carrying the headscarf in the public in Europe, these girls change unintentionally the symbol and the role of the mohammedanischen women.</seg>
<seg>This tendency extends the far beyond headscarf.</seg>
<seg>All Muslims in the west possess a double affiliation feeling, a double cultural capital.</seg>
<seg>They define themselves by their religiousness, but they acquired also a comprehensive, worldly knowledge.</seg>
<seg>Because they possess a double cultural capital, they can move also relatively freely between different activities and areas - between at home, the school, the youth organization and the urban leisure offers.</seg>
<seg>Muslim and Islamic to be, are not the same.</seg>
<seg>Which we experience today, the transformation of the mohammedanischen identity is an Islamist to.</seg>
<seg>The religious even the individual Muslim shifts from the private into the public range.</seg>
<seg>The question, which arises to everyone, is those whether the search for identity with headscarves and to a broad public acceptance of the religious practices Islam can be corresponded, or whether the positive confession requires a grundsätzlichere refusal of the modernity to the Islam.</seg>
<seg>A new era for the Islamic science?</seg>
<seg>When science and mathematics enjoyed some hundred years long a phase of the large inventions, a region of the world particularly stood out.</seg>
<seg>There the masters of these disciplines were admired, the medicine made rapid progress and the average human being were curious, how nature functions.</seg>
<seg>As differently to expect this region world-wide respect was not gezollt.</seg>
<seg>On the other half of the well-known planet scientists were punished, killed even.</seg>
<seg>Mathematics was outlawed as Godless and incorrectly and subjected to the religion later.</seg>
<seg>The standard of living was small.</seg>
<seg>The flourishing region was the Islamic Near East, while ignorant Europe remained further poor.</seg>
<seg>Both regions were certain the science of the religion (historians are different opinion over the role and the nature of the religions in this connection), but erblühte in only one of the two.</seg>
<seg>Now the roles Islamic of the Near East and the west are naturally exchanged.</seg>
<seg>Since the Second World War the United States are undisputedly world-wide prominent in the science.</seg>
<seg>During this entire period the most clever students from their homelands were withdrawn, attracted from superior research universities and better possibilities.</seg>
<seg>Until recently more than half of all university students in the USA within the ranges mathematics, science and engineering was abroad born.</seg>
<seg>Many of these talents remained after the university conclusion, and both the industry and the government drew its advantage from it.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile Islamic cultures entered a historical phase, in which the science was equated and avoided with western influence.</seg>
<seg>Even in countries, in which oil incomes could advance research to substantial extent, Arab rulers did not promote a such investment, with the result that their societies did not prosper so far, as they would have it can.</seg>
<seg>Lately a demand for larger political respect induced Islamic nations to invest in technology which in view of atomic ambitions of Pakistan and the Iranian becomes particularly clear.</seg>
<seg>Such weapons possess political weight, but the science, which is behind it, is banal and old.</seg>
<seg>The respect, which results from developing realizations, is many more significant than the products of discoveries of the past.</seg>
<seg>One imagines the influence, which was produced by Institut of Pakistan, who is world-wide prominent in the cancer research.</seg>
<seg>Would the political Rhetorik shift, if researchers in Oman discovered a key to the fight against AIDS?</seg>
<seg>This is an unused chance.</seg>
<seg>It exists however still another another and not only for Islamic societies.</seg>
<seg>The USA afforded in the recent past heavy absence rides.</seg>
<seg>Science was replaced in the entire government, by the president downward, by “faith affairs”.</seg>
<seg>The reports of point researchers were amended by political functionaries, if the facts contradicted the official conviction.</seg>
<seg>By a religiously affected government encouraged, educational systems shift their emphasis of the science on “values”.</seg>
<seg>Since the terrorist raids from September 2001 entry visas became less and more with difficulty too got, which restrains the inflow of recent talents to American universities.</seg>
<seg>Large science organizations protested without result.</seg>
<seg>At the same time the tax laws were in such a way changed to give to investors fortune increases at short notice which deters long-term investments into the research.</seg>
<seg>One half trillion dollar were made available for the war in Iraq, a sum, which corresponds in for instance the support for the entire basic research in the last thousand years.</seg>
<seg>Even if the USA fundamentalist Middle Ages go around, they risk clearly the loss of their world-wide dominance in the research.</seg>
<seg>Japan recognized the connection between political power and science in the eighties-years.</seg>
<seg>_ Japan lead industrialist Akio Morita, the president of Sony, and to the right politician Shintaro Ishihara hold a row of speech, which collect and 1986 in a book with the title The Japan that CAN Say NO publish.</seg>
<seg>They outlined a national strategy, which assumed influence on the world comes out from guidance in the science.</seg>
<seg>The substantial thought consisted of the fact that military power could be made obsolet, if the “food chain” were controlled for the military technology by other nations.</seg>
<seg>The title of the book refers to of Japan projects “no to say” to US American military influence, as soon as Japan controls the crucial military technologies.</seg>
<seg>It is clearly possible to develop a knowledge-based economy by the use of oil wealth.</seg>
<seg>So was for instance Texas, as most southern US Federal States understood, once economically poor and in the fall.</seg>
<seg>Although it was in the possession of oil incomes, the supply of dollars does not increase into an economy alone the prosperity as one meaning as strong could.</seg>
<seg>Thus Texas decided to use its oil money for a training foundation.</seg>
<seg>This financial equipment corresponds today in approximately that the Harvard to university and on 15 universities is distributed.</seg>
<seg>The result is breath-taking: The production within the range air and space industry disappeared from California so well, flourished however in Texas.</seg>
<seg>Research centers and consortia within the range telecommunications are in crowds come to Texas, even of the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel.</seg>
<seg>Although the processing industry is in the USA in the crisis, Texas possesses one strongest production-oriented managing world-wide.</seg>
<seg>There is no reason, why the same result could not be obtained in the Near East.</seg>
<seg>First the Islamic world must however their proud inheritance again discover and it make itself too own.</seg>
<seg>_ Iran debate over the Iraq</seg>
<seg>No more country in the middle east concentrates on the events in postwar Iraq than Iran.</seg>
<seg>With its western neighbour connect Iran the geographical proximity, a long history of bloody arguments with Iraq Saddam Hussein, religious and emotional connections to the Iraqi Shiites and the concern around the policy of the United States in the region.</seg>
<seg>Considering the continuous tensions with the USA Iran is particularly in view of a possibly longer lasting US presence in Iraq concerned as well as due to the dominant factors role of Americas with the future organization Iraq after Saddam Hussein.</seg>
<seg>For outstanding ones it is probably difficult to follow the internal debates in Iran but it and it gives these discussions is violently delivered, even if to a larger international public is not at first sight evident.</seg>
<seg>In this debate over Iraq after Saddam Hussein three fundamental beginnings are recognizable.</seg>
<seg>The pragmatists are the opinion that Iran with the USA in Iraq must cooperate after Saddam inevitably, even if it only concerns, the rights of the Iraqi Shiites to protect.</seg>
<seg>For this reason one should assure to Iran that a new guidance in Iraq this population part will not attach hostilely to treat and friendly bilateral relations.</seg>
<seg>To the further fundamental interests of the pragmatists the preservation of the territorial integrity Iraq and the Repatriierung Zehntausender belong in the Iran of living Iraqi refugees.</seg>
<seg>The moderate pragmatists want that the Iranian government pressure on America exercises, is delivered thus in Iraq living members of the Mujahedin e Khalq (MKO) and the organization will smash.</seg>
<seg>In response the Iranian government should offer their support with the preservation of peace, stability and security in Iraq.</seg>
<seg>With a word, the pragmatists would like to limit the Iranian-American relations to an agenda, which concerns mainly national affairs Iran.</seg>
<seg>This beginning is supported on the whole by conservative forces in Iran.</seg>
<seg>Another beginning plans a more active role Iran in the reconstruction Iraq.</seg>
<seg>The advocates of this line are the opinion, Iran could due to its well established infrastructure of personnel and institutional connections to Iraq the reconstruction facilitate.</seg>
<seg>In the long run, then one means, the USA and the international community the value of an Iranian co-operation will recognize.</seg>
<seg>As return for Iranian co-operation the infrastructure of the MKO should be smashed in Iraq. To it could be coupled possibly a promise Iran to proceed still hard against activities of Al Qaida and to expel their members living in Iran.</seg>
<seg>Primarily it concerns to the advocates of this position however that by American side it is guaranteed to Iran that the country does not become the goal of American military actions.</seg>
<seg>Briefly said it concerns to the proponents of a co-operation an open and clear agreement: Iran supports stabilization in the present transitional phase in Iraq and promises to maintain cooperative relations with each Iraqi government, that should come, and receives for it the warranty for an improvement of its regional and international position.</seg>
<seg>This opinion particularly by Iranian Reformern - within and outside of the government - and internationally oriented Technokraten and restaurant people will represent.</seg>
<seg>For radicals the possibility of a co-operation with the USA is finally pure fantasy.</seg>
<seg>They believe America would only out be to endanger the security Iran to undermined and its national interests.</seg>
<seg>In the eyes that radicals want the USA at least larger changes of the Iranian foreign policy to force.</seg>
<seg>In the worst case, then, the Americans are argued energetically for a regime change Iran will enter.</seg>
<seg>They will turn actively against the appropriation of atomic knowledge by Iran and will possibly even try to weaken the entire military potential Iran.</seg>
<seg>This radicals regard the American invasion Iraq as a part of the American strategy to encircle Iran.</seg>
<seg>Whereupon, then they mean, must answer Iran with aggressive defense of its interests, form strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers and make its influence in Iraq valid, in order to prevent an per-American, anti-Iranian government in Bagdad.</seg>
<seg>Hardliners of all parliamentary groups support this beginning.</seg>
<seg>The fall of the Saddam regime was the lightest exercise in the Iraq crisis.</seg>
<seg>Now the difficult part comes: To secure to suck off peace and stability to win the war against the terrorism and to convince the Muslim population parts of it that it is not the intention America to occupy Iraq its oil and to arrange the middle east after its image.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile the refusal of the USA in the form of suicide attacks and other forms of the terrorism will very probably still increase.</seg>
<seg>Iran is to remain an important Kraft in the region, because its political dynamics and its Muslim identity find large response in the entire Muslim world.</seg>
<seg>Which happens in Iraq, has large effects on Iran and the USA would be well advised to see to this fact in the eye.</seg>
<seg>The American threats or the suggestions of a new war stir up the most radical forces in the Iran of resentment and frustration and strengthen.</seg>
<seg>If the USA liked to avoid such a development, they should the influence their own radicals limit and see that in Iraq best by a more extensive co-operation with Iran is served the American interests.</seg>
<seg>The way from Iraq</seg>
<seg>Finally the point is reached in Iraq, at which all want apparently the same: the departure of coalition armed forces from the country.</seg>
<seg>The message over a document to the withdrawal of troops, oozed recently from the British Ministry of Defense, underlines this desire.</seg>
<seg>The only question is, how one can follow it.</seg>
<seg>As long as coalition armed forces remain, the force will probably escalate.</seg>
<seg>But they go, it likewise to an escalation will come, only faster.</seg>
<seg>The real question reads thus, how one arrives at the point, at which Iraq a police and an army show can, to which one thinks capable of to maintain law and order.</seg>
<seg>It is still another far way, until this goal is also only approximately reached.</seg>
<seg>Despite the courage of the many Iraqis, who join the army or police, nobody should be surprised, if some motives have, which are not completely pure.</seg>
<seg>In north Iraq old calculations are settled, and in areas such as Irbil, which were traditionally ethnic mixed, an actual ethnic separation is introduced.</seg>
<seg>In other areas the law of the Scharia is by force implemented.</seg>
<seg>How can Iraq set up thus university-formed services, to which one can think capable of an effective and impartial penetration of the law, without consideration of Ethnizität, religion and sex?</seg>
<seg>The traditional answer reads to enlist humans to train and to them the “correct values” mediate.</seg>
<seg>But for it sufficient time is not.</seg>
<seg>Other possibilities are necessary.</seg>
<seg>Without a deeply embodied value system Iraq needs civilian-social organizations at the basis, which the police and army draw for responsibility.</seg>
<seg>These could take different forms, but it is really important that they actually include and by the power structures on district level, on regional and national level are supported humans on local level, if they point abuse out.</seg>
<seg>If there is a local examination, whose value is national encouraged and recognized, most members of the university-formed services behave probably accordingly -- and if they do not do it, they can be more simply identified and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg>This may sound after superelevated hopes, but in Afghanistan, a country, which resembles Iraq in various regard, there are groups, which work on this goal.</seg>
<seg>The Cooperation for Peace and Unity (CPAU) offers a model, as this can be done.</seg>
<seg>Exactly as in Iraq the dismantling of the force for usual humans in Afghanistan had highest priority.</seg>
<seg>The CPAU worked in the last three years generally speaking country to furnish peace committees on district level which are supported by peace advice in the surrounding villages.</seg>
<seg>The initiative has to do it with a culture, in which force is so deeply rooted that children early learned a counting, by counting dead Soviet soldiers.</seg>
<seg>The committees try to bring from there all parts together of the community, in addition belong teacher, tribe leaders, religious leaders, women, police, soldiers, judges and businessmen, in order to find new ways to forceless conflict resolution.</seg>
<seg>Although so far monitoring was formally not part of the role of the committees (this is planned for the future), brings the bare fact that police, army and law to the committee belong, it in contact with the remaining community. This provides for feedbacks and creates confidence.</seg>
<seg>Some results are remarkable.</seg>
<seg>In a Workshop the local commander of military made of politeness went past for a few hours and remained at the end for the whole week.</seg>
<seg>In the end it apologized for its violent past and committed themselves to disarm its 2000 men strong private army.</seg>
<seg>Now it visits the offices of the committee regularly.</seg>
<seg>In Iraq at present projects begin like the Humanitarian Liaison center (humanitarian meeting center) in Kirkuk to fulfill a supervising function by offering locally the possibility to the ethnic mixed population, their problems to speak and assistance with the solution to receive.</seg>
<seg>But judicial decisions, if they were even decided, are all too often not converted due to intimidation.</seg>
<seg>Already much good work was carried out by American and British armed forces for the stabilization of the civil society.</seg>
<seg>One does not hear anything over the Workshops for the authorization of women or the successful organization of local elections in the small framework everywhere in the country.</seg>
<seg>But the mobilization of the civil society is an enormous challenge, particularly if it, as in Iraq, must happen fast and to large extent.</seg>
<seg>Military armed forces are still used, but likewise incentives for disarmament, in addition also the prospect belongs on economic possibilities, which are more fruitful than crime and extortion.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately the structure of the civilian-social abilities is just as cheap as important.</seg>
<seg>The Humanitarian Liaison center serves completely Kirkuk with annual expenses of $ 75.000.</seg>
<seg>With $ 10 million could be created further 100 of such centers, and still much would be remaining “change”.</seg>
<seg>The challenge is appropriate to commit itself this beginning to expand it and place themselves completely behind courageous humans, who accept the challenge, the powerful ones to the responsibility to pull.</seg>
<seg>Otherwise it is improbable that the Iraqis receive the security, which they so absolutely need after so many years of suffering.</seg>
<seg>Democracy at the Nile?</seg>
<seg>The surprising decision of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak for a constitutional amendment, which was to make a direct election possible of the president with several rival candidates, could prove in Egypt and in the entire Arab world as an enormous step toward democracy.</seg>
<seg>For humans in the west, who are accustomed to pluralistische democracies, is possibly difficult it to understand, what an enormous change with it in a country to be connected could, which stands since more than 50 years under military rule.</seg>
<seg>In the present system Egyptian citizens may appear only every six years on the day of the Präsidentenwahlen at the urns and give the only name on the voting card their agreement or also not.</seg>
<seg>It explains why someone receives like Mubarak each mark over 90% of the voices, although during different election turnout.</seg>
<seg>Syrian and Iraqi ruling powers was issued it with such systems still better. This certainly, because names and addresses of the voters on each voting card had to appear.</seg>
<seg>Often one argued, the democratization process in the Near East will not progress, until also Egypt participates in its entirety in it.</seg>
<seg>Egypt could not take the path of the democratization however, without changing its condition -- to cut indeed the pharaonischen powers of its president and limit its term of office.</seg>
<seg>Mubarak is nevertheless already in 24. Year of its term of office as a president.</seg>
<seg>Its announcement is to provide for a Präsidentenwahl with several rival candidates an important first step.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the regime assumes that to be able to use this process for its advantage but the run of the events is not so simple possibly to check, if humans have the feeling to be equipped with power.</seg>
<seg>The bottle spirit of the democracy would have left its bottle.</seg>
<seg>Anyhow Egypt is not the only country in this problem-loaded region, which made itself now on the way toward democracy.</seg>
<seg>Turkey on the one side of the Near East and Morocco on the other one are already on the way.</seg>
<seg>The real pressure seems this time from the strict scheduling and the positive results of the recent elections in Iraq to come into Palestine and in smaller extent also into Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg>During the unparalleled demonstrations against the Syrian crew in Lebanon as a result of the murder of the former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri no end seems in view.</seg>
<seg>Also Egyptian groups of oppositions organized risky marches in the last weeks increasingly and put other forms of the civilian disobedience to the day.</seg>
<seg>Their anger was heated up by the arrest of the healthwise attacked opposition head Eiman only at the end of January.</seg>
<seg>The merciless procedure way of the government led movement, which demands an end of the Mubarak regime to a revival of the national “Kifaya” (enough).</seg>
<seg>The wide-spread opinion, according to which Egyptians would be passive and were afraid at activities, seemed sudden to keep to no more upright.</seg>
<seg>An alliance from local, regional and international forces unites against everyday tyranny on the banks of the Nile.</seg>
<seg>The recent pressure wave from the population seems to have shaken the regime.</seg>
<seg>Only one month ago Mubarak dismissed demands after a constitutional reform as “uselessly”.</seg>
<seg>But whatever constellation of events always caused its change of mind, an initiative for the change of the right to vote should be welcomed.</seg>
<seg>It concerns a necessary -- although insufficient -- first step for the modification of the stuck political system in Egypt.</seg>
<seg>The Egyptians are already sceptically in relation to alibi reforms à la Tunesien, where long-term president its Al-Abidin Ben Ali created the caricature of a constitutional amendment, which made superficial kompetitive elections possible, then however to an illusory ballot led, with which a few select “rival candidate” began.</seg>
<seg>With earlier Präsidentenwahlen in Tunesien reached Ben Ali 99% of the voices, with this choice was it by routine 96%.</seg>
<seg>We hope thus that it means Mubarak more serious with its right to vote reform.</seg>
<seg>When indications of it must only arrange the immediate release of Eiman and seize measures, in order to terminate the state of emergency persisting since 24 years, that an election campaign actively prevented.</seg>
<seg>Besides Mubarak should use itself for a restriction of the term of office of presidents on two times five years.</seg>
<seg>Confidence-building measures, including an open and equal entrance to the media, are just as necessary which are momentarily under national control.</seg>
<seg>I have to bring announced that I intend to stand as a candidate with the coming Präsidentenwahlen in order so a debate over these fundamental reforms on.</seg>
<seg>I would withdraw myself however with pleasure again into my private life, if free and open elections were guaranteed in this autumn.</seg>
<seg>During serious conversion these measures Mubaraks legacy in another light would let appear.</seg>
<seg>Together with the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine thereby a long overdue Arab spring of the freedom could be rung in.</seg>
<seg>Historical elections in Egypt?</seg>
<seg>On 7 September the Egyptians select their new president. To the ten candidates also for 24 years officiating president Hosni Mubarak belongs.</seg>
<seg>Although its re-election stands almost except doubts, one pursues the choice process in many places nevertheless with large interest.</seg>
<seg>For this choice 6000 national election observers prepare and hundreds foreign journalists flow this week to Egypt.</seg>
<seg>Although one corresponds to the outward criteria of an actually fair ballot, important aspects of the reliability are missing however in glaring way.</seg>
<seg>Despite contrary promises one is mile far distant from equal chances.</seg>
<seg>Mubarak holds  still disproportionately many Trümpfe in the hand: Recognizing value, an actual monopoly on the by the state controlled electronic media as well as on approximately 85% of the print media.</seg>
<seg>Some opposition candidates wait one week before the elections still for the radiant emittance of their choice commercials on the Egyptian television.</seg>
<seg>All members of the electoral committee for the presidential election were appointed by Mubarak and with the new choice regulations took one to independent challengers each chance.</seg>
<seg>After a judgement of the highest Court of Justice the 8000 Egyptian judges must supervise the elections and confirm the results since the year 2000.</seg>
<seg>This judgement was an important step toward fair elections, since the professional association of the judges could maintain their independence in the last 50 years to some extent well against the access attempts of the executive force. </seg>
<seg>Therefore the Mubarak regime had on different cheats falls back, around the judge combination out boats.</seg>
<seg>One accepted for example to the “Judikative” also thousands loyale government officials, who could show a conclusion in jurisprudence, but no experience with court had. Thus one bound the hands for the genuine judges, because with a protest through  Boycott of their monitoring obligations would have been given this task again once to the police of the notorious ministry of the Interior.</seg>
<seg>In the past the judge combination with foreseeable effects added itself.</seg>
<seg>With the parliamentary elections in the year 2000 the governing party Mubaraks in the constituencies supervised by genuine judges reached approximately 38% of the voices, while the voting portion rose, where the quasi-judges at the work were, to 86%. </seg>
<seg>This year it promises to become completely differently.</seg>
<seg>In the spring the judges held a country-wide general assembly. One agreed to supervise the forthcoming presidential elections (or parliamentary elections) only if the government grants complete independence and the exclusive monitoring of the choice procedure to the judges.</seg>
<seg>On 2 September they formulated their final demands: The choice is to be allowed to be observed by civilian-social groups, the definition, who a legitimate judge is, may for choice purposes not be changed, and no urn may be removed, without the voices before a legitimized judge and the result was counted out was confirmed and conveyed by this.</seg>
<seg>Up to now it looks like a Patt, because the chairman of the electoral committee explained publicly on the Egyptian television that he rejects any monitoring of the choice process by citizens. </seg>
<seg>A further interesting development the eve of the choice is the violent public debate over it whether one is to now deliver its voice or boycott the Präsidentenwahlen.</seg>
<seg>Several opposition parties requested their members to stay away from the choice from protest against the all too restrictive choice regulations which provide Mubarak a tremendous advantage opposite the other candidates.</seg>
<seg>On the other side the allegedly strongest single opposition in Egypt, the Muslim brother shank, reminds their supporters to the casting of votes and requests it to meet a conscience decision in order not to support any “despotischen, corrupt ruler”.</seg>
<seg>That is an implicit however nevertheless clear rejection Mubaraks, the autocrat of the last 24 years.</seg>
<seg>Approximately 34 organizations of the civil society prepare despite repetitive objections of the government of thousands young Egyptians for the monitoring of the elections.</seg>
<seg>These groups are the opinion that the national and international monitoring of the elections should be probably no problem, if the government does not plan anyhow to manipulate the ballot.</seg>
<seg>The regime counters that any monitoring by foreign persons an injury of the Egyptian sovereignty and national election observers an affront would be against the integrity of the judges.</seg>
<seg>The basis was withdrawed from this argument however immediately, when the judge combination announced its support of the civilian election observers.</seg>
<seg>Whether the Mubarak regime comes at home and abroad now because of the increasing demands after free and fair elections into panic or whether one is simply unable to cure to the party the habitual fraud the present signs for the choice on Wednesday promise nothing property.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile the Egyptians experience for the first time an exciting foretaste on resistance against tyranny and enjoy some again discovered freedom area.    </seg>
<seg>Of Europe dollar envy</seg>
<seg>Currency questions can come into the focus not only commercial transactions but also diplomatic and political Zänkereien.</seg>
<seg>If happens, economic transactions will be subject more with difficulty and to larger uncertainties.</seg>
<seg>The politicalization of the money in the depression of intermediate wartime affected itself economically devastatingly.</seg>
<seg>But it came even in recent time rightfully unpleasant currency wars.</seg>
<seg>Into the 1960er the international financial order came to years into the center of the political tug-of-war.</seg>
<seg>Each side had quite different theories and explanations for what took place.</seg>
<seg>The Europeans - in particular the Frenchmen - complained about what general Charles de Gaulle the “exorbitant privilege” of the US Dollar called.</seg>
<seg>The general and its financial guru, Jacques Rueff, maintained, the USA the status of the dollar as main reserve currency under the Bretton Woods regime of firm exchange rates would use, in order look for deficits to permit and thus for their overseas military Abenteurertum be responsible (at that time in Viet Nam).</seg>
<seg>France reacted with the call: Financial reform to encourage in order to terminate the special role of the dollar, and tried to a large extent discredited gold standard again.</seg>
<seg>The Europeans began a long discussion over the advantages of a monetary union, in order to be able to look with this achievement the dollar into the eyes.</seg>
<seg>But from the American point of view the international role of the dollar was a trap.</seg>
<seg>Other countries could change their rates of exchange and maintain this way for itself a larger competitive power with export.</seg>
<seg>The US Government was powerless in view of an underestimated yen and fed the faith, which remainder of the world will the dollar used, in order to attack of America production basis.</seg>
<seg>The government Nixon arrived at the conclusion, the only way to save the American economy is the monetary unilateralism, a so drastic expansion of funds that other countries were compelling to adapt their rates of exchange.</seg>
<seg>These fights forgotten for a long time seem to be very current suddenly again.</seg>
<seg>Die Welt stands no longer under the regime of firm rates of exchange, but remains the dollar the larger reserve currency - a kind floating Bretton Woods.</seg>
<seg>For Americans the role of the dollar is as reserve currency a potential threat, while it appears to non--Americans as a further case of the American neoimperialen search for supremacy.</seg>
<seg>In this decade China took the place, which Japan held into the 1960er years. It keeps its rates of exchange low, in order to activate the growth of its export.</seg>
<seg>Therefore China a goal of US complaints over unfair competition and their efforts is to force an adjustment of the exchange rates which American would hold from it, Chinese toys, devices, to buy and clothes.</seg>
<seg>The manufacturers in the USA decided that in China manufactured Büstenhalter represent a danger for the American way of life.</seg>
<seg>In the meantime the Europeans (particularly the Frenchmen) complain about the large US deficit, and the argument de Gaulle's that the remainder of the world has to be responsible for of Americas wars, is again in mode.</seg>
<seg>Some Europeans suggest, who should hold a larger part of their currency reserves in euros for Asian central banks. That is an echo of the unsuccessful attempt, with which the general America wanted to force by the buying up of gold against dollar into the knees.</seg>
<seg>The 1960er years ended with the collapse of the “system” and in larger financial turbulences. In addition an inflationary rise of the goods prices came.</seg>
<seg>All were damaged and of America role in world affairs were shaken.</seg>
<seg>A similar collapse became today probably completely different effects produces.</seg>
<seg>The system of free rates of exchange is today stronger and the loads of the adjustment is differently distributed.</seg>
<seg>Most Americans do not suffer from the clear dollar crash, since the salesmen from the foreign country must adapt their prices on the US market.</seg>
<seg>Asian managing grow strongly and collect in their central banks demands on the USA.</seg>
<seg>They will probably continue this politics, since the alternative would draw a sudden setback for the competitive power of its export sectors on the US market extremely important for them.</seg>
<seg>That leaves longer time, their balance of payments defict, which thus cannot be maintained in the long term to concern to the USA.</seg>
<seg>The economically dynamic regions of the world - North America and Asia - are in this way in a pact connected, which will guarantee the central role of the American dollar until further notice.</seg>
<seg>The Americans will accumulate further debts, because the Asians wish this of them.</seg>
<seg>The pact to quit, would be against the interests of both sides.</seg>
<seg>This is not American unilateralism, because it means co-operation with Asia.</seg>
<seg>But for the Europeans, who are excluded from this pact, it looks like funds and restaurant unilateralism.</seg>
<seg>In the meantime the rise of the euro ensures in relation to the dollar for considerable pain with European the goods export your.</seg>
<seg>Europe cannot undertake however much, in order to provide relief.</seg>
<seg>Europe will be actual in the new currency fights the larger suffering-basic.</seg>
<seg>Answers, those into the 1960er were herumposaunt years - the revival of the gold standard, or the introduction of a common European currency - seem to be today no longer very helpful.</seg>
<seg>A only one common currency to possess, proved as no substantial protection.</seg>
<seg>Only the old form of the European reaction - psychologists could call it “dollar envy” - will increase.</seg>
<seg>It will give appeals to the European central bank to expand the monetary basis as if the imitation of the dollar would be the answer to all industrial, structural and demographic problems, which trouble Europe.</seg>
<seg>But already short thinking should remind us of the fact that of Europe are not dependent on manipulations of the currency problems.</seg>
<seg>The protest against the new edition of an exorbitant American funds privilege should be seen as that, what it is: to resign itself a way to the real European powerlessness.</seg>
<seg>Thus it will remain with the dollar envy, and it will still increase, if the international value of the Greenbacks melts there, without obviously unfavorable effect on the people, which print and use it.</seg>
<seg>The epidemic of the political influencing control</seg>
<seg>Just as, have the Americans to the knowledge taken citizens of other countries of this world that the policy plays an important role in the case of the occupation of certain public offices.</seg>
<seg>Only few are surprised (although sometimes disappoints), if the order of a high-ranking judge or diplomat takes place after statement of his loyalty to certain political principles of the party of the president or Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg>It prevails however almost complete agreement over the fact that the science takes a privileged position. The United States begin themselves to develop in this regard however for a warning example of the remainder of the world.</seg>
<seg>Appointments within the field of the science should be based on objective criteria such as training, abilities and achievement.</seg>
<seg>Naturally it is legitimate to ask a future American minister of health to its opinion over the abortion.</seg>
<seg>But it is completely inappropriate to submit members of scientific advisor staffs a test of their political loyalty.</seg>
<seg>Likewise the membership in Peer Review committees - a central mechanism for the scientific progress - should be absolutely free from entry obstacles, which do not stand with scientific qualification in connection.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately Wissenschafter in the USA are confronted ever more frequently with obstacles of this kind.</seg>
<seg>In the last autumn the science magazine Science published several articles to this topic.</seg>
<seg>In one of these contributions around the complete Umbesetzung of an advisor committee of the American national center for environment and health, a subsection of the center for disease control was and - prevention (CDC), without previous arrangement with the director/conductor of the mechanism concerned.</seg>
<seg>Similar cases concerned the advisor committee of the CDC to lead poisonings and prevention, as well as the bio ethics commissions Advisory Committee on national humanly Research of protect ion and Advisory Committee on gene TIC Testing.</seg>
<seg>The momentarily raging epidemic of political influencing control, in whose attendants advisor committees are completely again occupied and candidate a loyalty test are submitted, seems to be for some observers an old hat.</seg>
<seg>Officials in the American Ministry of Health call “usual practice”.</seg>
<seg>Now, it is not usual practice in America - at least it was so far not that.</seg>
<seg>Really concern exciting is not anyhow that the government Bush examines candidates for its compatibility with their “values”.</seg>
<seg>The most precarious aspect of this development is, as profoundly this ideological examination penetrates into ranges, which were immune in former times to this kind of the manipulation.</seg>
<seg>The perhaps most obvious example of the spreading epidemic of political influencing control was the Umbesetzung of a committee at American Institut for industrial safety, who itself with the financing of studies over injuries on the job busy.</seg>
<seg>Advisor committees were perhaps occasionally exposed to this kind of influencing control in the past.</seg>
<seg>They nevertheless recommend, the politicians to strategies convert or also not.</seg>
<seg>But for study financing responsible committees?</seg>
<seg>In October 2002 publish Science a editorial of David Michaels and unite his colleagues.</seg>
<seg>With them it concerned former high-ranking officials, who unite the mentioned committees belonged. On the basis of their personal experiences they supplied valuable information to this topic.</seg>
<seg>Their contribution was one history, but which thereafter followed, was still more interesting.</seg>
<seg>It came to a flood of letters, in which Wissenschafter reported of similar experiences.</seg>
<seg>A candidate for the co-ordination committee of the American institute OF Health for the research of Muskeldystrophie told, how she was examined by a coworker of the white house.</seg>
<seg>After one had made oneself well-informed over their opinion different strategies of the Bush administration, from which no something had to do with the work of the committee, it was asked whether she endorses the policy of the president regarding embryonic main cells.</seg>
<seg>Another sender, a respected professor for psychiatry and psychology, reported of a call from the white house, in which one informed him about its nominating for the American national advice against drug abuse.</seg>
<seg>The caller explained, he would have to submit of examination him still another to determine “over whether he any opinions represent, which would be unpleasant for the president”.</seg>
<seg>According to the remarks of the professor a set of questions was placed to it, whereby the official of the white house raised constantly a scoring and.</seg>
<seg>An example: “You have now two of three points. The president is without consideration of the consequences for moral reasons against needle exchange programs [for dependent ones on intravenously consumed drugs].”</seg>
<seg>Then the questioning took a still more unpleasant turn.</seg>
<seg>The official asked the candidate whether he would have selected Bush. When it experienced that this was not the case, he placed behind: “Why didn't you support the president?”</seg>
<seg>That corresponds to the procedure way in dictatorships and not in democracies.</seg>
<seg>Scientific advisor committees are balanced in addition, there and thought out consultation for the policy to deliver.</seg>
<seg>If the desired political result stands in the first place, one won thereby nothing, but much lost.</seg>
<seg>For this reason the decision, which research projects were to be supported, was always a thing of objective investigation by professional colleagues and not by politicians.</seg>
<seg>The American law relevant in this regard actually requires, - the federal Advisory Committee act - that committees must be built up balanced and “by the appointing authority improperly not to be affected to be allowed”.</seg>
<seg>The American minister of health Tommy Thompson and the personnel department of the white house should set an example for the remainder of the world.</seg>
<seg>That can be done very simply: By the law obeying.</seg>
<seg>Murder in Moscow</seg>
<seg>It is at the time to clear up with the fiction according to which post office-communist Russia would have become less lawless by Vladimir Putin “dictatorship of the law”.</seg>
<seg>The murder at Anna Politkowskaja, one of the most courageous and best lady journalists of Russia, a woman, who dared it to bring the brutal murders of the Russian troops in Chechnya to the public is the last proof for it that president Putin did not establish no more than a completely usual dictatorship, with all pertinent usual ignoring of the laws.</seg>
<seg>This realization comes for the world still in time, particularly for Europe.</seg>
<seg>The German minister of foreign affairs works straight on a strategy for the Russian-German relations, in which the indifference is to be fixed in relation to of Putin lawlessness as national interest of the most powerful member of the European union.</seg>
<seg>This indifference will ruin however to Appeasement, if it encourages Putin to move its lawless methods on the international stage as momentary with its campaign, Georgia economically.</seg>
<seg>The murder at Politkowskaja released an uncanny Déjà vu: As to that time, when the KGB at the high point of its power was, humans disappear simply in of Putin Russia.</seg>
<seg>The killing Politkowskajas is the third politically colored murder within three weeks.</seg>
<seg>Enwer Siganschin, chief engineer of BP Russia, was shot on 30 September in Irkutsk.</seg>
<seg>Andrej Kozlov, deputy governor of the Russian central bank, which straight campaign against finance fraud led, was killed on 14 September.</seg>
<seg>The fact that the Russian prosecutor general Juri Tschajka transferred as in the case Kozlow the investigations in the murder case Politkowskaja, does not give a cause for large hopes, how this would be in genuine democracies the case, if representatives of high judiciary sources are consulted.</seg>
<seg>The integration of highest Russian government circles is actual nearly a warranty for the fact that the murderers are never seized.</seg>
<seg>The murder at Mrs. Politkowskaja is a particularly dark omen, if one considers that it concerned with it one the most powerful critic inside the Russian president.</seg>
<seg>In their articles for one of the last independent newspapers in Moscow, Novaya Gazeta, and in their books “in of Putin Russia” and “Chechnya. The truth about the war” wrote Politkowskaja over the shrinking freedom, which became a characteristic characteristic of the presidency of Putin.</seg>
<seg>_ both the drive out the early Medienzaren Boris out Beresowsky and Vladimir Gusinsky as well as the arrest the of the Ölmagnaten Mikhail Chodorkowsky show, what of Putin enemy be approaching: Exile, detention or the grave.</seg>
<seg>I do not accuse of Putin government of Politkowskaja over an order murderer to have killed.</seg>
<seg>As an exposure lady journalist Politkowskaja has itself not only with Putin to operate a policy of kidnappings for ransom money but also with many different made unpopular, not least with the present Chechnian Prime Minister Ramsan Kadyrow, which she accused of.</seg>
<seg>But if Vladimir Putin people with the murder at Politkowskaja in the elevator of their house in the center of Moscow do not have to even do to anything, then of Putin created ignoring the laws the climate, in which this murder happened.</seg>
<seg>Just like the murder at archbishop Thomas Beckett in the cathedral of Canterbury many centuries ago was committed this crime clearly in the faith that it would please the king.</seg>
<seg>In view of its, for which Politkowskaja stood -- indeed for the responsibility of a democratic press to analyze the Kremlin and its politics -- the government should have guaranteed that the lady journalist nothing bad zustößt.</seg>
<seg>Of Putin Russia in the past six years already 12 prominent journalists lost by murder.</seg>
<seg>None of these crimes was cleared up. That would different be, if of Putin were “dictatorship of the law” more than a PR-strategy.</seg>
<seg>The six years since Vladimir Putin appearance in the Kremlin were a time of deeply contradictory signals.</seg>
<seg>On the one side the world looks on a young, educated head of state, who promises, to modernize Russia and to advance the country particularly regarding law enforcement and legal practice to international standards.</seg>
<seg>On the other side the president watches being silent, if its former colleague in the Russian security agency FSB (the former KGB) on did not threaten that life and limb any security offers and a number of notorious cases of espionage against journalists, scientists and environmental activists in rolling to bring.</seg>
<seg>Among these “Neo spies” the journalist Grigori Pasko, the weapon control expert Igor Sutjagin, the diplomat Valentin Moisejew, the physicist Valentin Danilow and others rank.</seg>
<seg>The alleged civilizing influence of Russia the role as partners of the west to have is  -- as for example its presidency with the G-8-Gipfel in pc. Petersburg -- each effect seems to have missed with Putin Kremlin Kabale.</seg>
<seg>The confrontation with western values promoted a Potemkin village again to day. Russia presents a front from laws and democratic institutions, behind this backdrop prevails however the same blanks in arbitrary manners.</seg>
<seg>The danger for this world is that of Putin is exported lawlessness.</seg>
<seg>Abroad entire close a form of kriminalisierter diplomacy seizes around itself.</seg>
<seg>One regards the regularly brought forward and again withdrawn criminal accusations in this connection of Putin attempt to manipulate the Präsidentenwahlen in Ukraine or against the leader of the Opposition Julia Tymoschenko.</seg>
<seg>One thinks of the conditions in the abtrünnigen regions in Moldavia and Georgien, who can give it only, because the Kremlin supports this.</seg>
<seg>One regards, like the Kremlin tried to extort its neighbours by threatening its power supply.</seg>
<seg>Each policeman knows that criminal ones become ever more brazen, if criminal behavior is ignored.</seg>
<seg>It is high time that the world recognizes Vladimir Putin as, what it is: a man that Russia again into the darkness leads.</seg>
<seg>The whole world must remember old latin the principle qui tacet consentire videtur -- who is silent, seems to agree -- and it must ask itself whether it is intelligent to bear the education of a lawless energy superpower by Putin being silent.</seg>
<seg>_ Russia pipeline to empire</seg>
<seg>Gerhard Schröder, which was before less than one month of German chancellors, agreed, to become supervisory board chairman of the enterprise which continues to build a Gas-Pipeline of Russia by the Baltic Sea until Germany and by Western Europe.</seg>
<seg>In many countries Schröder was made now because of a clash of interests the process.</seg>
<seg>Its obvious moral derailing is strengthened by the fact that Russia straight threatens in this moment to turn the gas supply off Ukraine if the country does not follow the demands for price of the national gas giant of the Kremlin, Gazprom.</seg>
<seg>Of Russia strategic order is obvious: Ukraine to turn off of Europe gas supply to meant likewise limit to a large extent, there some the largest European Gas-Pipelines by Ukraine lead the gas tap.</seg>
<seg>As Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic states are naturally gone around, the new pipeline the Kremlin promises still larger influence, during these tries regionally to state.</seg>
<seg>President Vladimir Putin and its government from former KGB companions must make themselves with the decision, as hard they exclude of Russia post office-communist neighbours, no more concerns around Western Europe.</seg>
<seg>Should Europe Putin actually equip with this new imperial weapon?</seg>
<seg>More badly still, Russia could possibly direct this weapon against an European Union instructed on energy?</seg>
<seg>The fact that a German former Chancellor will lead the enterprise, which could give Russia a means to the hand, in order to manipulate the European Union economy, witnesses from of Europe dangerous indifference in view of of Putin neoimperialistischer ambitions.</seg>
<seg>Certainly itself of Russia are conscious media over the increasing European dependence on the Russian energy.</seg>
<seg>It smolder towards even therein: After we our joint gas company standardized and increased, Russian Leitartikler writes, Europe to the human rights will be silent.</seg>
<seg>With Putin this attitude comes more indirectly by its commitment to the expression, one of it in such a way designated “independent policy” to pursue.</seg>
<seg>By the fact he understands that Russia should be “independent” of the moral and human being-legal doubts of the western democracies.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps some European leaders actually believe, the maintenance of the comfortable prosperity of the union justify our silence to human rights and other topics, which are annoying the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg>Naturally we, briefly, can take position to “business” affairs, as for the expropriation of Yukos, but if the Kremlin our values or criticism at Russian measurement acts -- e.g. in the blood-stained Chechnya -- with a price, seem the Europeans provide to be rather ready to hold their mouth as the possibility of higher energy prices or even a blockade, as them Ukraine are approaching, in purchase to take.</seg>
<seg>While Putin transforms its yard and the Dumas to its will subordinates, hopes of the European Union for an increasing “Europeanizing” of Russia should be given up.</seg>
<seg>The Russia, which Putin develops, transformed from post office-Soviet hopes for freedom into an oil and a gas bulwark for its new model of the former KGB elite.</seg>
<seg>Indeed Matthias Warnig, a general manager of the pipeline consortium, is which Schröder will preside, an old friend of Putin.</seg>
<seg>In Wall Street Journal was reported in this year that Warnig, which leads the Russian branch Dresdner Bank was an officer the state security service, the East German secret police, and Putin into the late 1980ern know learned, when the Russian president was stationed as a KGB spy in East Germany.</seg>
<seg>That the Russians bear a government from former KGB coworkers, for whom compassion and intolerance lacking are in relation to deviating opinions the standard, reflect their exhaustion of the excitement of the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg>Now the Kremlin seems to think the fact that what for normal Russians is good is good for independent nations also: Opposite small and weak countries pointed no pitying, as soon as Russia receives the tools to isolate and them with the prospect to an energy barrier threaten in order to intimidate it.</seg>
<seg>As a former head of state I kept such threats frequent to recently independent Lithuania.</seg>
<seg>The European Union signed numerous agreements with Russia, among them one for a “common area” for freedom and law.</seg>
<seg>The Kremlin understands it very well to pretend a such idealism.</seg>
<seg>Its control of Eastern Europe was made valid always on the basis by “friendship treaties”, and the Soviet invasions of Hungary 1956 and Czechoslovakia 1968 were “fraternal” employments.</seg>
<seg>But one regards, how Putin abuses this “common” area: barbarian treatment of the Chechens, the businessman Mikhail Chodorkowski in the prison, foreign NGOs in distress, one the Mitanführerinnen of the Orangenen revolution of the last yearly, Julia Timoschenko, of Russian military state lawyers for invented reproaches accused.</seg>
<seg>If the Europeans take their common area for human rights and freedoms seriously, they must recognize that these values are not divided by the calculating Pöstcheninhabern into of Putin Kremlin.</seg>
<seg>The same is valid, if Russia is regarded as allying in the fight against the terrorism.</seg>
<seg>Is it to be threatened really conceivable that the homeland of the “red terror” offers reliable support with innumerable unpunished crimes from the Soviet era, whose pulls itself blood-purely from Lithuanias into the Caucasus to hold Iran and North Korea from it the world?</seg>
<seg>It more probably appears that the calculating heads of the Kremlin will only use each crisis as opportunity to increase their destructive power and their influence.</seg>
<seg>For many decades my European homeland region of the grace of the bad one was delivered.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I cannot back-lean being silent, while Europe hineinstolpert blindly into new appeasement politics.</seg>
<seg>We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe were taught by our inheritance that behind each diplomatic action of Russia imperial efforts hide themselves.</seg>
<seg>The west Europeans, who remained saved this inheritance, should erhören our warnings.</seg>
<seg>The dependence on Russia -- even if it presents itself now with the face allegedly of the “charismatic” Gerhard Schröder -- leads only into the abyss.</seg>
<seg>Rifle bullets and elections in Iraq</seg>
<seg>When the Iraq war began 2003, the government Bush pursued very ambitious plans: As in Germany and Japan after 1945 a long and peaceful crew was intended, while expanding oil production should secure a rising prosperity and democratic structures were piece by piece established.</seg>
<seg>The basis should be a liberal, even postmodernism condition, which guaranteed Mrs. 25 % of the seats in the parliament.</seg>
<seg>In today's Iraq there is no peace and no prosperity.</seg>
<seg>The condition, on which on 15 October one co-ordinates, contains the 25%-Regel, otherwise is to be been it however far from it, liberal.</seg>
<seg>The key regulation (article 2) that no law may contradict “the unquestioned rules of the Islam”, it offends against the basic principle of the parliamentary sovereignty and the legislation will prevent to correspond to international standards.</seg>
<seg>For example the age of the sexual majority cannot be set with girls on over nine years, because Mohammed had a nine years old woman.</seg>
<seg>From it results that girls of nine years in the criminal law are likewise considered as grown-up and are subject to the death penalty, e.g. for the crossing to another religion.</seg>
<seg>In the larger context the Shiites can place its Ayatollahs assistance of this regulation as in Iran over the selected parliament, because alone have these the right to specify the “rules” of the Islam.</seg>
<seg>Outstanding ones and the few Iraqi liberals make themselves mainly over this Islamic regulation concerns, but the wide-spread Sunni resistance against the condition is directed against other regulations: the exclusion of the “saddamistischen Baath party” from the political life and from the government and the federal regulations, which grant to the 18 Iraqi provinces autonomy and them permit to unite to regional governments.</seg>
<seg>The exclusion rule is a personal affair for the Sunni elite -- among them thousands of businessmen, specialists and even artists, because except for few exceptions were them all Baath members.</seg>
<seg>Theoretically the prohibition in the condition could be laid out in such a way that it is valid only for the future.</seg>
<seg>But in practice the administrative regulations at present so applied that “high-ranking” Baath members so called are excluded from any government activity, and of it are concerned thousands.</seg>
<seg>The Sunnis would probably accept the federal regulations, if they were valid only for the Kurds.</seg>
<seg>They know that the alternative is not the return to the centralism, but the splitting off of the three predominantly Kurdish provinces Dahuk, Arbil and As Sulaymaniyah, around an independent Kurdistan with own treasury, army (the Peschmerga) and oil production around Kirkuk -- with the second largest oil reserves in Iraq -- to base.</seg>
<seg>The Sunnis reject the same federalism for the Shiites, since they regard her as related Arabs, who will also again do the Sunni rule in the past to have always accepted and this -- it is, it gets its own government.</seg>
<seg>That would make the new condition possible, since the provinces with Shiite majority in the south, which have the largest part of the Iraqi oil reserves, could educate their own regional government.</seg>
<seg>In the usual Middle East style disappointed Sunni leaders, that are dissatisfied with the condition, threaten now with force.</seg>
<seg>But the federalism is not the reason, why Sunni extremists and Islamic commit deadly attacks.</seg>
<seg>Their resistance is more fundamental: They do not accept the principle of a democratic majority government.</seg>
<seg>Instead they would like to restore the rule by the Sunni minority.</seg>
<seg>For the Islamics all Shiites earn death anyway, exactly like renegades.</seg>
<seg>One of the Shiite leaders, Muqtada Sadr, expresses itself also vehemently against the federalism.</seg>
<seg>Its supporters are those predominantly uneducated, poorest and most violent Shiites from the Slums of Bagdad and environment, whose “Mahdi militias” 2004 further-fought even then still against the American troops, when the Americans protected the Shiites against Sunni aggressors.</seg>
<seg>As a very young clergyman, that its authority of his deceased Ayatollah father -- even a populist -- , encounters Sadr derives the resistance of the living Ayatollahs of Iraq, which despise his ignorance and brutality.</seg>
<seg>Which concerns the religious authority, Sadr can not possibly take up it with them, therefore he takes a Arab-nationalistic attitude against her and reminds frequently of the fact that the highest Shiite of clergyman, Ayatollah Sistani, Perser is, and no Arab.</seg>
<seg>In the same way he calls its supporters in the memory the fact that the El Hakims, which would start the highest advice for the Islamic revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), and their “Badr militias” subsidized Exilanten in Iran were, of which many in the long and to embittered Iran Iraq war for Iran fought, until the Americans returned “them”.</seg>
<seg>Sadr is against the federalism, because a regional Shiite government would obey its enemies Sistani and the SCIRI and, then says it, under Iranian influence would turn out.</seg>
<seg>In order to underline its message, Sadr sent its men, in order to attack the Badr militias, which succeeded to him in Bagdad, where the Mahdis is numerous, in Najaf, where Sadr is hated after in the letzen year the caused destruction, remained however unsuccessful it -- until its men were niedergemetzelt by the Americans.</seg>
<seg>It was already badly enough to become finished with Sadr as bandits but a simple political calculation results in now that it will be probably the central figure for the exit of the elections for condition in October.</seg>
<seg>In order to reject and new elections for a national assembly force the condition, the opponents a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces need.</seg>
<seg>The Sunnis win probably only in two provinces, but if Sadr instructs its supporters in the Slums of Bagdad to co-ordinate together with the local Sunnis with “no” that would probably decide the capital for the condition opponents, what would guarantee the refusal of the condition.</seg>
<seg>As political Ganove is naturally ready Sadr to be bought.</seg>
<seg>Last year it was looked for because of murder.</seg>
<seg>Now it wants to be recognized as a statesman, it wants money and, at least implicitly, humiliating Sistanis and the SCIRI.</seg>
<seg>It will probably receive offers, already began perhaps an haggling.</seg>
<seg>But some Shiites, whom he attacks with words and rifle bullets, have thousands of armed ones under itself and to mean that only rifle bullets should be offered to him.</seg>
<seg>The fall of the secret police</seg>
<seg>As of Hungary had to determine prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, when a noted confession that its government log led, to excesses, is openness in Eastern Europe new democracies not always simply.</seg>
<seg>Exactly like Hungary Romania strove after communism to increase transparency and honesty in one of the societies of the world most locked before.</seg>
<seg>While we strove, the continued lockingness led to a precipitous expansion of corruption and office abuse.</seg>
<seg>But it has -- finally -- a real movement to more openness given. This progress was recognized by the European union, when it gave of Romania green light to entry to the European union for at the beginning of of 2007.</seg>
<seg>Apart from reaching its that regards the European Union now as a “functioning free-market economy”, gives it important political and legal changes, which I as a law minister supervised and which cover as different ranges as increased transparency and control with the establishment of political parties or the complete Umkrempelung of the court nature.</seg>
<seg>Judicial reforms contribute again to eliminate the corruption.</seg>
<seg>Against former and current cabinet members, delegate, judge, prosecutor, lawyers, policeman, customs officer, other employee of the public service as well as directors von Privatunternehmen was raised accusation.</seg>
<seg>In addition new forms for standard introduced, on which everyone, which must indicate an official position in the government, in the parliament, in which or in the Gerichtswesen holds public or local administration, its fortune and its to financial interests.</seg>
<seg>The new explanations are the most detailed in Europe, and above all they are published.</seg>
<seg>Of Romania progress in one in this month published report it is confirmed which shows that the entrance of the citizens to national information is now just as good in Eastern Europe as in old-established democracies.</seg>
<seg>The report Transparency and Silence (transparency and silence) actually interprets, which by the open Society Justice initiative (right initiative for an open society, www.justiceinitiative.org) was written, whereupon that the new democracies can teach old in some cases the something: Certain ones national authorities in Romania dealt rather with information inquiries of the citizens as comparable authorities in France or Spain.</seg>
<seg>Particularly in Romania 60% of the archived inquiries were answered, compared to 31% in France and 24% in Spain.</seg>
<seg>Under the other countries, which fared well, were also Peru and Mexico, which discharged both 2002, shortly after Romania, laws to the duty to supply information of public mechanisms.</seg>
<seg>But it is not always simpler in transition democracies to arrive at delicate information as I know from my earlier work than human right attorney at the Romanian Helsinki committee.</seg>
<seg>Often we had to pull before court, in order to force over of Romania law to the uninformativeness of 2001 the publication from information to.</seg>
<seg>Even if we had won for example a case, in which it concerned the access to the recordings of heard telephone calls, which had been approved by the prosecutor general, ignored the public prosecutor the court order simply.</seg>
<seg>We submitted a civil action against the public prosecutor, and the judge imposed a penalty for each day, on which the information was held back.</seg>
<seg>But only as we the attention of the media had, got we the data -- it was indicated in those as many wire-tappings had been approved in the preceding 10 years, against whom they were directed and how long.</seg>
<seg>With the publication Romania began to dissociate itself from its Securitate controlled past to.</seg>
<seg>Now, since I sit in the government, it becomes conscious me that it is difficult sometimes to divide information with the public.</seg>
<seg>But if painful reforms are necessary, there is no alternative.</seg>
<seg>We could not have implemented the economic and political reforms, which qualified us for the European Union membership, if we had not exposed the policy to the monitoring of the public and had not accepted the intensified public participation at decision making, which accompanies with this openness inevitably.</seg>
<seg>This became even an essential condition of democratic governments in the whole world.</seg>
<seg>When the United States 1966 decided their law to the duty to supply information of public mechanisms, they were in the exclusive society of Sweden and Finland.</seg>
<seg>Today approximately 65 countries have such a law.</seg>
<seg>In Romania those, which fought for a law to the uninformativeness, exhausted this fully.</seg>
<seg>As from parts of the study of the Justice initiative follows, information inquiries were readily answered to the Romanian government and given change information, whose publication would have been still inconceivable a few years ago.</seg>
<seg>The Romanian Ministry of Defense e.g. published the number of the army members, who died 2003, as well as their causes of death (under it 13 suicides, two shooting and two dead ones with the employment in Afghanistan).</seg>
<seg>Likewise the court was asked of Bucharest for the number of judges, who had received 2000 punishments since beginning, including the reasons for possibly imposed sanctions.</seg>
<seg>The court handed the inquiry to the highest judge advice over, that supplied a complete answer: a quadripartite list of all sanctioned judges, with details to the reasons and punishments.</seg>
<seg>Such information is both a product of the continued reforms and an engine for these.</seg>
<seg>It was not comfortable always for the cabinet members, and still a tug-of-war is over confidential documents under way.</seg>
<seg>The advantages, which transparency brought in the former Eastern Bloc, nevertheless are not to denials.</seg>
<seg>At the same time of Romania show experiences that the discretion of the authorities still represents a threat for the worths of democratic systems of government and that both in established and in recent democracies only permanent watchfulness can prevent that this discretion inclusively-calibrates itself again.</seg>
<seg>The rescue of the Lebensbäume</seg>
<seg>Nobody comes by the day, without using a product, which originates from a forest.</seg>
<seg>In by far higher measure than most people, comes the paper is conscious, on which we write, which water, which flows from our cocks, which medicines, which us sound, which wood, from which we build our houses and furniture, from the forest.</seg>
<seg>Forests supply us with the fresh air, which we breathe, and offer habitats for endangered kinds.</seg>
<seg>They offer also leisure-time facilities, which become ever more important in our complex world to us.</seg>
<seg>Approximately 1.5 billion of the poorer Landbevölkerung of the world depend directly on forests, in order to satisfy their basic needs after food and firewood.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless deforestation continues.</seg>
<seg>Each year lose we 14.6 million hectare forest -- an area, which is as large approximately four times as Switzerland.</seg>
<seg>Irresponsible forest management, which are strengthened by latch national regulations and penetration, and markets, which reward illegal clearing, rob at present together their most valuable from the world and to most endangered forests.</seg>
<seg>As soon as forests begin to disappear, follow usually each quantity environmentalreferred, social and economic evils, which concern us all in different kind.</seg>
<seg>The Indonesian island Sumatra is a good example of it.</seg>
<seg>Cellulose and paper enterprises operate at present the ungezügelte and illegal destruction of the forests, which contain the richest plant variety of the world.</seg>
<seg>It is probable that thereby plants not discovered yet as well as endangered kinds will disappear like the Sumatranashorn, the Sumatra elephant or also the Orang Utan.</seg>
<seg>If the forests Sumatras disappear, also humans from whole municipalities without a correct roof over the head and without a decent Broterwerb will appear.</seg>
<seg>Besides disadvantages for responsible enterprises result from the distortion of the global markets from the trade with illegal and cheaply produced products.</seg>
<seg>Through illegal clearing annually tax revenues are lost to developing countries at a value of $ 15 billion.</seg>
<seg>The situation is intensified by the fact that the demand for wood for the reconstruction for that continues to increase tsunami in the last year the already untenable requirements at Sumatras of forests.</seg>
<seg>Similar threats for forests become clear in the Amazon and Congo basin.</seg>
<seg>The youngest Millennium Ökosystemstudie of the United Nations (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, mA) shows that forests in these and other critical regions will continue to disappear due to mismanagement precariously to decrease/go back and, if not serious measures are seized.</seg>
<seg>From information of the Brazilian government it follows that the deforestation of the irreplaceable Amazon forests (among other things by the transformation into agricultural effective areas) rose in the last year to 2.6 million hectare, which lets the entwaldete total area of the Amazon on 17% increase.</seg>
<seg>But the fight against deforestation is not lost.</seg>
<seg>Different organizations, environmentalist and societies, which worry themselves around the condition of the forests world-wide, unite at present, in order to turn around deforestation and improve the forest management.</seg>
<seg>For example the World Wildlife has find (WWF) and the World Bank of Brazil government supports to bring an initiative into being which converted over 17 million hectare new protected forest areas into national park.</seg>
<seg>The alliance from WWF and World Bank brought its partners also to furnish funds-in-trust in order to administer these protected areas permanently.</seg>
<seg>In similar way an unusual, borderspreading co-operation for forest protection and responsible management resulted from a summit between the ruling powers of the countries in the Congo basin.</seg>
<seg>This led again to an initiative of the State Department of the United States to the promotion of the forest protection in the Congo with a budget of $ 53 million.</seg>
<seg>Since the first meeting of the ruling powers 1999 in the Congo basin 3.5 million hectare new protected areas were created.</seg>
<seg>Considering the effects tsunamis in Asia in last December and in view of the weight of mA submitted data and the deforestation statistics from the most important forest areas must be continued our efforts nevertheless.</seg>
<seg>The World Bank and the WWF insured recently that they will use themselves together to lower the global deforestation rate until 2010 around 10% and that they will co-operate with other public and private institutions to convert around ambitious goals with the forest protection.</seg>
<seg>WWF studies show that we can cover world requirements at forest products and retain at the same time important environment and social values in foreseeable future, if the world-wide forest stands are assigned to different intended purposes and types among other things to protected areas, for responsibly administrative commercial utilizable forests and again aufgeforsteten forest landscapes.</seg>
<seg>Wirtschaftsbosse, governments and citizen organizations must notice their role during the conversion of this vision.</seg>
<seg>Are the Saudis fanatics?</seg>
<seg>Terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia led not only to question the chances of the continuance of the governing royal house Al-Saud but also raised the question whether it itself with this kingdom around a fundamentally dysfunktionalen and destructive state acts.</seg>
<seg>It has the appearance, as if the Saudi society would have brought a wave out fanaticism by force, which refers its inspiration from the extreme religious Orthodoxie.</seg>
<seg>The fact that 15 of the 19 hi-jackers of the terrorist attacks originated from 11 September 2001 in the USA from Saudi Arabia, strengthened the long preserved opinion, the kingdom would be a bastion of the Autoritarismus and the intolerance.</seg>
<seg>In various regard is correct also, but altogether this view cannot be transferred to the broad public into Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg>Quite the reverse, a heavy error would be to be believed that the attitude of the Saudis was completely defined by fanatical Islamism in relation to the religion.</seg>
<seg>Between 2001 and 2003 I belonged to a team, which accomplished an extensive value study in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, in Iran and in Jordan.</seg>
<seg>Our results show an amazingly nuanciertes picture of the value attitudes in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg>Compared with the asked persons in countries of the middle east, Saudi Arabs were generally less religious and their attitudes to topics such as democracy and arranged Ehen reveal a moderate undertone.</seg>
<seg>The religiousness is naturally embodied in all four countries strongly. Over 90% of the asked ones indicated that they believed in God, in a life after death and in skies and hell.</seg>
<seg>However the Saudis seem to be less religious, than the Muslims in other countries.</seg>
<seg>Compared with 82% the Iranian, 85% the Jordanian and the 98% the Egyptian describe themselves only 62% of the Saudis as religious.</seg>
<seg>Also the Americans seem to be far more religious than the Saudi Arabs. In America 81% define themselves as religious.</seg>
<seg>Partly these deviations may be to due to country-specific differences, how religiousness is defined.</seg>
<seg>Americans for example define religiousness possibly differently than humans from the middle east. In addition Americans have perhaps a weaker connection to their faith than humans in Islamic countries.</seg>
<seg>Partly thereby also differences between the Muslim countries could be explained.</seg>
<seg>However the discrepancy is in such a manner large regarding the defined religiousness between the Saudis on and the Iranians, Jordanian and Egyptians on the other side that it questions the predominating conception of Saudi Arabia as a most conservative and religious society.</seg>
<seg>Practice actually speaks a clearer language than bare words: Only 28% of the Saudis indicated, weekly in services to participate during itself 27% the Iranian, 44% the Jordanian, 42% the Egyptian and 45% the American to it admitted.</seg>
<seg>Although these results contradict the conventional view of the Saudi culture, they are less surprising than it the appearance have.</seg>
<seg>Religion sociologists argued long time that the general religiousness decreases, if the surrounding field is strongly religiously dominated or if religious institutions are too strongly connected with the state.</seg>
<seg>If national authorities give strict precepts, humans are inclined to rebellion and dissociation from officially sanctioned religious institutions.</seg>
<seg>So it is also no miracle that Egyptians and Jordanier, who live in countries without by the state ordered Frömmigkeit are more religious than Iranians or Saudi Arabs, who supported virtue police” with one of the state “live must.</seg>
<seg>Even with the topic marriage represented many of Saudis surprisingly liberals opinions.</seg>
<seg>In the case of the question to arranged Ehen an almost even allocation resulted. Half of the asked ones was the opinion, a marriage should after arrangement among parents be closed, while 48% preferred love as basis for a marriage.</seg>
<seg>In view of the deeply rooted sex separation and the dominance of the patriarchy this result seems to reveal a strong need after more individual option with decisions, which are incumbent on traditionally the family.</seg>
<seg>Finally the Saudis proved as strong proponents of the democracy, which contradicts again the general conception of Saudi conservatism.</seg>
<seg>For 58% of all asked Saudis democracy is not the best system of government, 23% was this opinion and not 18% expressed itself in addition.</seg>
<seg>That a country, in which there is no secular and nationalistic tradition a majority for the democracy enters, appears illogically.</seg>
<seg>The endorsement of the democracy with a number of other liberals attitudes is actually located in connection, which we found in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg>Proponents of the democracy bend more tolerance to less religiousness, more Säkularität, opposite others, to a more critical evaluation of the community and to larger concern over the western cultural invasion.</seg>
<seg>Beyond the survey data in the course of history it turned out that liberals ideas at popularity win, if a country is governed by a despotischen monarch and the religious establishment.</seg>
<seg>Thus developed in late 19. Century in ottomanischen Syria a strong liberal current as reaction to the religious the potentiometer mash of Sultan Abdulhamid.</seg>
<seg>At the same time a antiklerikale, secular movement in the name of the Konstitutionalismus unfolded - as reaction to the absolutist alliance between the Schahs of the Kadscharen dynasty and the religious establishment in Iran.</seg>
<seg>In view of these agreements between historical precedents and the present situation in Saudi Arabia, we should not exclude the possibility from reforms.</seg>
<seg>Today also opinion poll data shows that the Saudis could very probably begin to demand more transparency in the policy and a less interventionist religion.</seg>
<seg>Museum Europe</seg>
<seg>In late 19. Century regarded Europe Asia predominantly either as source of the inspiration for its artists or as focus of its imperial ambitions.</seg>
<seg>The Asians on the other hand regarded Europe either, as in Japan during the Meiji time, than model of the modernity or as in China than a barometer of the decline.</seg>
<seg>One century later had transformed the Japanese economic miracle the picture of the Europeans of at least a small part of Asia to a place of technological and industrial progress.</seg>
<seg>At present now, in the first years 21. Century, the way, like Europe in Asia and Asia in Europe to be noticed, changes drastically. Flower to Asia national economies and prosper, while the European union goes through a deep identity and confidence crisis.</seg>
<seg>Prominent Asians like the former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, warn the Europeans in the meantime that -- they should their past course maintained -- Europe rapidly within all ranges except tourism and high-quality real estate irrelevant will might.</seg>
<seg>A well-known Chinese businessman, who divides its time between Hong Kong and London, expressed himself even still more clearly.</seg>
<seg>With a private meeting of prominent entrepreneurs and politicians in Paris several weeks ago he explained: “Your European develops you to a third world country. You spend your time with the wrong topics -- Condition, welfare state, pension crisis -- and her give systematically the wrong answers to the questions, you raise.”</seg>
<seg>Of Europe opinions over Asia generally and China in the special one are more complex and reach from a hellsichtigen adjustment to a new and respected competitor up to purely ideologically justified refusal.</seg>
<seg>When in May 1968 into France the students went on the roads, in order to invent a new world, they (or at least some of them) dreamed about Maoistic China -- a China, which was in the middle in the brutal and senseless cultural revolution.</seg>
<seg>Their absurd and baroque seeming Betörtheit was just as very product of their unawareness of the crimes Maos as the result of boredom within a prosperierenden society, in which unemployment was practically unknown.</seg>
<seg>In contrast for this criticize their inheriting today openly the Asian capitalistic model.</seg>
<seg>Yesterday China was a anti-capitalistic guidance star for utopian revolutionaries; today it developed to a ultraliberalen Nemesis for a new generation of utopian reactionaries -- the defenders of the status quo in Europe.</seg>
<seg>Recently in the roads of of Paris demonstrating students want to become not in such a way like Chinese and Indian; they reject the logic of the globalization and refuse giving their heavily achieved social collateral up.</seg>
<seg>Of Europe restaurant economics China and India notice clearly differently.</seg>
<seg>They are itself in the meantime fill consciously that their easily nostalgic post office-colonial view of these countries overhauled itself as large export markets and comprehensive reservoir of cheap workers.</seg>
<seg>China and Inden became genuine competitors, that earn respect, if not even almost reverence.</seg>
<seg>Quality, costs and delivery times in automobile production about are enough in the meantime to the European level near.</seg>
<seg>Europe kept, approximately an advantage within the range of the theoretical sciences in the pharmaceutical industry, but itself developing world class enterprises in particular in India are increasing able to recruit graduates of the M.I.T or from Harvard and to retain themselves at the same time their lower labor costs and thus its global competitive power.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately the political leaders of Europe the challenge outgoing from Asia missed recognized, it however, these as a reality test within the irresistible process of the globalization and -- in social and economic regard -- to use as weapon call.</seg>
<seg>Actually one can say with balanced view that the European politicians, from few exceptions as for instance Tony Blair to have refrained, its view of the world too slowly to the revolutionary speed of the change in Asia to have adapted.</seg>
<seg>Imprisoned between their lack of a long-term strategic vision and their adjustment on short term interests, of Europe predominantly missed political leaders it to acquire itself the respect of their Asian colleagues -- contrary to the European enterprises, which are very many more respected with the Asians.</seg>
<seg>The European Union in Asia becomes natural -- a continent, which missed it far going to bury and to the ghosts of the nationalism the door point its past -- frequently also as a model of the reconciliation, the peace and the prosperity regards.</seg>
<seg>But this perception will survive, if of Europe continues to decrease economic performance?</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the Asians will come then to regard the European model as a kind of political Venice -- a place, which one visits, around itself nostalgically its earlier Glorie in addition-given and which one admires its museum-like condition because of.</seg>
<seg>The red ones and the blue ones </seg>
<seg>The replacement of Colin Powell as US Secretaries of State by Condoleezza Rice shows that of Americas produces last presidential election further strong response.</seg>
<seg>But it is not only important for Americans to understand, what states this choice over America, but also for the world.</seg>
<seg>The presidential election of this year proves that America has a healthy democracy, in addition, that some could be better.</seg>
<seg>Contrary to the choice of 2000, with the president Bush the majority of votes missed and the vote in the elector committee only scarcely won, triumphed he this mark with a projection/lead of 3.5 million voices.</seg>
<seg>Although some democrats are still verbittert, there are few serious doubts about the legitimacy of Bush's victory.</seg>
<seg>America remains split into red States of (republicans) and blue States of (democrats).</seg>
<seg>If 100,000 voices in the red State of Ohio changed, John Kerry would be a president (although with a minority of the votes).</seg>
<seg>The elector committee was accepted to of Americas condition, in order to protect small states in a federal system, it meant now however that the election campaign contested itself particularly on approx. a dozen states concentrated, in which the public opinion is split.</seg>
<seg>A still more fundamental problem is that it appears unschicklich to select presidents without the majority of the votes.</seg>
<seg>It is thus at the time for a serious discussion over a constitutional amendment for the abolishment of the elector committee.</seg>
<seg>Some observers weight likewise about the polarizing, negative Rhetorik and advertisement, which characterized the election campaign.</seg>
<seg>But this should be regarded from an historical point of view.</seg>
<seg>At times of the founder fathers newspapers were extremely parteiisch, and George Washington was dismayed over the sharpness of the political language.</seg>
<seg>In its early history the country long time was split into just as limited majorities as today -- without dealing thereby also only with the time of the civil war and the reconstruction. The violent Rhetorik of the election campaign gave against, how close the contest was.</seg>
<seg>At the same time the three country-wide radiated discussions addressed important points in a respectable format despite the negative choice advertisement of both sides and in far circles were pursued.</seg>
<seg>Generally it is probable that an acting president is re-elected with increasing economy.</seg>
<seg>In this sense surprises at Bush's re-election, as small its majority was.</seg>
<seg>Essentially this is to be due to the Unpopularität of the Iraq war.</seg>
<seg>_ Kerry try, the war, the drag job creation von arbeitsplätzen, the insufficient health care and Bush reduction of taxes for group with high income to the central point the election campaign make, but have some observer the feeling, that itself from never a clear message result in.</seg>
<seg>Bush countered with security doubts regarding the terrorism and with Kulturpopulismus with topics such as Homo marriage and abortion right.</seg>
<seg>At the end security and Kulturpopulismus outdid the Wirtschaftspopulismus.</seg>
<seg>The interpretation of the choice was affected by questionings accomplished (after the casting of votes), in which the voters were asked, which topics them was most important.</seg>
<seg>Most (22%) answered with “moral values” compared with 20%, which called the economy, and 19%, which stated the terrorism.</seg>
<seg>Conservative social politicians interpreted these results in such a way that they would have won the choice for Bush and that their program should dominate its next term of office.</seg>
<seg>But an Pew inquiry, which was accomplished one week after the elections, pointed to it that the category covered “moral values” apart from abortion right and Homo marriage a far range of topics.</seg>
<seg>Inquiries actually occupy that 25% of the population support the Homo marriage and endorse 35% legal before-similar communities for homosexuals of pairs (the position represented by Kerry).</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless it is valid for the 37%, which are against the Homo marriage, particularly in the red center of the country that the topic contributed to the mobilization of the Bush supporters for the elections.</seg>
<seg>A more important question is whether the USA are hopelessly split.</seg>
<seg>The geographical Wahlkarte with red and blue states led to Internet jokes and Comics across the two blue coasts, from the red center of the country splits itself off.</seg>
<seg>Some call this “Coastopia”.</seg>
<seg>The separation is not so clear however.</seg>
<seg>In both bearings many states were won only with limited majority. If one dyes the map on the level of the districts, and not the states, a large part of the country looks rather violet.</seg>
<seg>“Cities against suburbs and rural areas” describes conditions better than “coast against center”.</seg>
<seg>Public public opinion polls actually show that most Americans in the moderate center of the political spectrum collect themselves, and not at the outside two edges.</seg>
<seg>But political elite bends like e.g. Party activists and congress members to be more extreme than the public.</seg>
<seg>This appears first confusing, since for her an incentive should exist for moving in the be correct-rich center.</seg>
<seg>But many congress members represent districts, which are safe for their parties, and their re-election is endangered by within the party elections, which of aktivistischeren and more extreme party wings are controlled.</seg>
<seg>This tendency is strengthened by the propagation of the cable television, which spectator assistance attracts more disputed “Infotainment transmissions”, and by Internet bloggers, which take part in embittered polemics without each editorial filter.</seg>
<seg>Reforms for the change of the borders of the congress districts, in order to strengthen the competition in them, would contribute to an improvement of the problem. But few acting congressional representatives will be correct for changes, which perhaps increase the risk of their defeat.</seg>
<seg>The limited result puts near that Bush was selected less for changes, than he seems to believe.</seg>
<seg>In view of the difficult questions in the outside to calm tax and social politics it of it would be intelligent to turn rather to the center as its conservative basis. But it remains further unclear whether a policy of the convictions or pragmatism will become generally accepted.</seg>
<seg>Freeing from dependence on the oil</seg>
<seg>Chancellor Angela Merkel granted high priority to bringing up for discussion the climate change on of Germany agenda for its EUROPEAN UNION and G-8-Präsidentschaften, which begin in January.</seg>
<seg>Here a concrete proposal, is so generally held that the political guidance heads world-wide it to consider and to accept be able and so clearly that other governments and enterprises can take up him: Simply with the next G-8-Gipfel a date specify, starting from which gasoline-claimant cars are no longer certified in large industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg>Such a decision would have a clearly positive economic and geopolitical effect.</seg>
<seg>The real reason for the today's energy concerns are not the shrinking world-wide oil reserves, but rather that domestic oil production by the point consumers -- Europe, the United States and China -- exactly in the moment will decrease/go back, in which the increasing Asian demand pressurizes the market.</seg>
<seg>Available reserves will be increasingly in the Near East concentrated, because the occurrences will simply faster be exhausted in all other regions.</seg>
<seg>It is added that large the oil export your are not ready to subordinate their investment policy to the requirements of the market.</seg>
<seg>Saudi Arabia is anxious to operate its oil production independently while Iran deters potenzielle investors with bureaucratic hurdles and corruption.</seg>
<seg>Iraq suffers from security lacking and foreign investor in Russia a line by the calculation is constantly made.</seg>
<seg>These four states have half of the oil reserves confirmed world-wide and two thirds its that could be potentially exported.</seg>
<seg>All this, not the production costs, is the basis the high oil prices and the fight for oil contracts in central Asia and Africa.</seg>
<seg>In the acceptance, high oil prices are, because they serve the environment, some fundamental facts of the international policy are surveyed good.</seg>
<seg>First of all oil imported goods in many of the poorest African and Asian countries constitute a importantly higher portion of the public expenditures than in industrialized countries, which means that economic growth and social development are endangered, while new debt crises appear.</seg>
<seg>Yields from oil production obstruct reforms in the large exporting countries.</seg>
<seg>Owing to their oiled financial strength feel regime like those in Venezuela and in Iran less and less to international rules bound.</seg>
<seg>Latecomers under the using nations, as for instance China, are well-known to away-watch over injuries of the human rights over itself lucrative business with authoritarian to secure for oil-rich regimes and imitate so the earlier habits of the industrialized west.</seg>
<seg>Only the political and economical heavyweights of the world, the large industrial nations, which are further the by far largest consumers of hydrocarbons, can set a change on global level on.</seg>
<seg>The change must begin in the transportation sector, which is responsible for over half of the present oil consumption -- a portion, which will in the future probably rise.</seg>
<seg>The G-8-Länder should inform itself therefore to permit cars gasoline-claimant of 2025 at no new.</seg>
<seg>This decision would be directed not against the individual mobility to manufacture but against the wasting of a limited raw material, which is more urgently used, in order synthetic materials.</seg>
<seg>The political guidance heads should not prefer a certain technology.</seg>
<seg>Instead they should create incentives for the automobile industry for developing alternative technologies for being based those on fuel from biomass, ethyls, hydrogen and during a transitional phase even natural gas.</seg>
<seg>Countries, which take over a political role of the pioneer, will provide a leading position in the energy technology for the domestic industry, as an additional use, and will secure future markets.</seg>
<seg>The prospective substantial decrease of the CO2-Emissionen could finally bring the break-through, which is necessary in the international climate policy.</seg>
<seg>But also the economic development comes into the play: The healing of our “dependence” from the oil will poorer, less developed and to developing countries more of it to leave, as well as the prices downward to press and the geopolitical energy competition defuse.</seg>
<seg>Geopolitically the advantages would be similarly obvious, since the ability became substantially smaller large oil export your the industrialized countries to extort.</seg>
<seg>This could improve the negotiating position of the international community in the Near East and possibly strengthen the social forces in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia, which aim at seriously political and economic reforms from the inside.</seg>
<seg>When technologically and one of the large car manufacturers is Germany well positioned highly developed country, in order to cause such an initiative.</seg>
<seg>Merkel, which attained a doctorate in physics and began its political career as a Secretary of the Environment -- it led 1995 the presidency at the first conference of the climate frame convention of the UN -- perhaps possesses more reliability when responding this topic than every different one its EUROPEAN UNION and G-8-Kollegen.</seg>
<seg>The time for courageous acting from the leading position came.</seg>
<seg>The myth of trade and assistance</seg>
<seg>Trade and assistance became international mode words.</seg>
<seg>More assistance (including debt forgiveness) and more entrance to the markets enrich countries for products of poor countries seem right at the top on the global agenda to stand.</seg>
<seg>Actually the present debate does not turn therefore, which to be done is, but like much and like fast it is being done.</seg>
<seg>The clear lessons were lost out of the last five decades of the economic development.</seg>
<seg>The most important of the fact is that the economic development lies to a large extent in the hands of the poor nations.</seg>
<seg>Countries, which furnished good achievements in the recent past, created this from own effort.</seg>
<seg>Assistances and market access played a crucial role rarely.</seg>
<seg>We take a developing country, which has free and preferential market access to its largest neighbour, that represents coincidentally also the strongest economic power of the world.</seg>
<seg>We assume in addition the fact that this country millions of citizens can send extent foreign investments as workers over the border, generally speaking receives and is perfectly into international production chains integrated.</seg>
<seg>Beyond that the bank system of the country is supported by the proven readiness of its rich neighbour to substitute in the worst case as creditors.</seg>
<seg>Much better globalization can hardly become, or?</seg>
<seg>We take now a second country.</seg>
<seg>This country is confronted with a commercial embargo on the largest market of the world, receives neither foreign subsidies nor any other support from the west, is excluded and is prevented from international organizations like the World Trade Organization to take up with the IWF and with the World Bank of credits.</seg>
<seg>As if these outside disadvantages would be not weakening enough, keep this national economy also still their own high barriers for the international trade upright (in the form of national trade, import duties and quantitative restrictions).</seg>
<seg>As the readers perhaps guessed, it concerns material countries: Mexico and Viet Nam.</seg>
<seg>Mexico divides one over 3000 km long border with the United States, which does not only provide for privileged market access for goods and workers, but also for a requirement on resources of the US Treasury (which during the peso crisis 1995 became clear).</seg>
<seg>On the other hand America kept until 1994 a commercial embargo upright against Viet Nam, manufactured only 1995 diplomatic contacts and confessed to vietnamesischen imported goods still years after no most-favored nation treatment too.</seg>
<seg>Viet Nam is still excluded from the World Trade Organization.</seg>
<seg>We regard their economic performance now.</seg>
<seg>Since the North American free trade agreement (NAFTA) was signed in December 1992, of Mexico grew on the average economics by hardly more than 1 % per head and per year.</seg>
<seg>This value is the not only far under growth rates of the economic superstars of Asia, it represents also only a fraction of of Mexico own growth achievement in the decades before the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6 % per year between 1960 and 1981).</seg>
<seg>Of Viet Nam economics however between the beginning of his economic reforms 1988 and the admission of diplomatic relations with the USA 1995 by annually 5.6 % per head grew. Since then it continues to grow in the rapid speed of 4,5 %.</seg>
<seg>Viet Nam experienced a dramatic decrease of the poverty, while in Mexico the material wages sank.</seg>
<seg>Both countries registered a steep rise in the international trade and with foreign investments, but arise, where it counts at most, completely different pictures: with the rising standards of living, particularly for arms.</seg>
<seg>These examples prove that the own effort of a country for its economic fate is many more crucial as everything else.</seg>
<seg>All chances, which the US market Mexico offered, could not counterbalance the consequences of the political errors in the own country, particularly omission to turn around the material revaluation of the peso rate of exchange and productivity gains obtained the inability, those within a small range of the export activities since the remaining economy to expand.</seg>
<seg>At most it depends on the fact that a country selects the correct growth strategy.</seg>
<seg>Completely without Viet Nam a strategy, which concentrated on it, its economics broadly to subjects and the production capacity of native offerers to increase, pursued the advantages of Mexico.</seg>
<seg>The further experience of the post-war period supports the conclusion that the internal policy is most important.</seg>
<seg>South Korea succeeded the break-through in the early 60's, not when the foreign assistances on their highest level were, but when it was gradually adjusted.</seg>
<seg>Taiwan received no foreign assistances or preferred market access.</seg>
<seg>China and India, the economic superstars today, flourish particularly due to their own reform efforts.</seg>
<seg>It is enticing, few African successes -- Botswana and Mauritius -- the foreign demand after its exports (diamonds and/or clothing) to attribute, but history there already is to end.</seg>
<seg>Obviously both countries without the entrance to foreign markets would be substantially poorer.</seg>
<seg>But as in other cases of successful development there is not their outside advantages, which take her off from others, but it is their ability to use these advantages.</seg>
<seg>One regards only the pile of shards, which other countries from their wealth at natural resources made.</seg>
<seg>In Sierra Leone the word “diamond” probably hardly causes pictures of peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg>Likewise have only few of the free industrial zones, which spread in the world, which results brought out, which were observed on Mauritius.</seg>
<seg>Nothing of it dismisses the rich countries from their responsibility to help.</seg>
<seg>They can arrange the world for corrupt dictators unfriendlier, e.g. by exchanging financial information more strongly and not recognizing international contracts, which sign these dictators.</seg>
<seg>Likewise a rise of the number of employees from poor countries, which may work in rich countries, and a larger clearance for a growth oriented policy would affect on a long-term basis by a loosening of the World Trade Organization regulations and the dependence on the USA better the development.</seg>
<seg>It is everything but clearly that an expansion market access and the heightening of aids represent the most productive employment of valuable political capital from the north.</seg>
<seg>Development should concentrate not on trade and assistance, but on an improvement of the political surrounding field in poor countries.</seg>
<seg>Who depends now on whom?</seg>
<seg>If the large Argentine economist were Raul Prebisch today still alive, it would certainly ask itself whether the world stands for head.</seg>
<seg>Its enormously influential “dependency theory” assumed those poor countries, which are too strongly dependent on raw material exports can achieve never that industrial penetration, which is necessary for a lasting economic growth.</seg>
<seg>Instead they are imprisoned in a cycle of sinking world-wide prices of raw materials and constantly sinking income portions.</seg>
<seg>Prebischs preferential political reaction, the protectionism, proved for the many Latin American and African countries, which followed its opinions, as catastrophic.</seg>
<seg>Fact is however that Prebisch seemed to lie over many years regarding the long-term trends with the prices of raw materials correctly.</seg>
<seg>Pitying lots efficiency paste run gene in the agriculture and with the dismantling of natural resources pressed the prices of raw materials downward, particularly during the 1980er and 1990er years.</seg>
<seg>From few exceptions apart, developed itself the economy of those countries, which concentrated on raw material exports, erbärmlich, while many Asian countries lacking in raw materials pushed forward.</seg>
<seg>Today however, where of Asia giant -- India and China -- the world economy, explode the prices for oil, gold, wheat and practically all other raw materials entered.</seg>
<seg>It will always give cycles -- the oil prices for example will probably fall, before they begin to rise again -- , but the long-term trend for many raw materials will continue to show upward clearly for longer time.</seg>
<seg>Which many of the participants with the commercial negotiations and other political decision makers apparent yet did not understand -- although Prebisch would have recognized it immediately -- , it is that this dramatic idiom of the events brings enormous effects on the world-wide equilibrium of the forces with itself.</seg>
<seg>Possibly no other aspect of the globalization will actually place the leaders of our world in the coming decades before larger challenges.</seg>
<seg>The questions, which arise, are various.</seg>
<seg>Are the rich countries of our days ready for one era of the Kodependenz, into which them does not despair less the raw materials require than the developing countries of the industrial imported goods and technology?</seg>
<seg>Are they ready for the inevitable river of power and influence for the raw material producers, now this there become clearly wealthier?</seg>
<seg>As the two world-wide superpowers, China and the USA, with the fact will deal that important raw material-exporting regions -- of Africa over the Near East up to central Asia -- are scattered with badly built up nation states?</seg>
<seg>Some appointed prophets represent the problem as limited natural resources, for which the world with alarming speed critical raw materials went out.</seg>
<seg>There are nowadays many supporters of the Hubbert' theory of the oil production, which means the fact that we achieved the upper border of the production quotas that the sources drain and that from now on all becomes only worse.</seg>
<seg>How however the prominent oil historian states Dan Yergin, the prophets of the fall explained already at least four times that the world the oil would go out.</seg>
<seg>Radical technological progress led each mark to the fact that this threat in air dissolved.</seg>
<seg>End 19. Century during the oil production still Maultiere were used for the excavations.</seg>
<seg>Today nobody imagines somewhat to bore 3000 m under the bottom of the sea after oil.</seg>
<seg>It gave similar progress within the range of the metal mining industry and the agriculture everywhere.</seg>
<seg>No, the world does not stand before the fact that you go out the raw materials.</seg>
<seg>Which happens rather, it is that the integration of two and a half billion humans (in China and India alone) into the world economy a demand change causes, which might exercise a clearly stronger upward printing on the prices of raw materials, than him all technological progress probably becomes to adjust to be able.</seg>
<seg>Therefore the prices of raw materials will rise -- at least for the next 50 to 75 years, and perhaps, until humans begin sometime in the coming centuries with the mining industry on Mars.</seg>
<seg>Will the education of a new equilibrium of economic power which is due from it destabilize world politics?</seg>
<seg>The First World War was clearly partly released by fears of Germany that other colonial powers would have itself a much to large portion of the world-wide oil fields and raw material supplies secured.</seg>
<seg>In similar way Japan was afraid for the stability of its supplies of oil and other natural resources from the foreign country in the Second World War.</seg>
<seg>Do similar tensions between resources-poor China (where even the Wassermangel a problem become it represents) and the west to arise?</seg>
<seg>Fortunately this seems at present, not probably in particular in view of the sober and pragmatic beginning of the Chinese guidance for the solution of its resources problems.</seg>
<seg>The Chinese orient themselves toward of regions such as Africa and hope to find there sturdy trade partners.</seg>
<seg>They do not divide that political transmission consciousness of the Americans, who do not carry on simply only with your trade, but they in addition to the true faith bekehren want.</seg>
<seg>Then are there those American leaders, that speak still to make the USA independent regarding the power supply.</seg>
<seg>This however is all in all a joke: Immoderately they may be, become independently them never.</seg>
<seg>Understandably a majority of the Arab world regards the invasion in Iraq as a cornerstone of the true US strategy to secure the stability of their power supply.</seg>
<seg>If this applies, it remains hoping only that America has a plan B.</seg>
<seg>In the meantime the prices of raw materials will continue to rise, while the oil export your in the meantime to of Americas gaping commercial balance sheet deficit carry the largest amount out.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps does the true strategy of the USA consist of trying making so high debts with the raw material-exporting countries that these feel compelling itself to hold America with mood?</seg>
<seg>This however is an idiom, which would have never foreseen Prebisch.</seg>
<seg>Hard line with the elections in Iran</seg>
<seg>Of mayor von Teheran, Mahmud Ahmadinedschad admitted the choice as hardliners, to the next president Iran the relations with the west will probably worsen and the international isolation of the country will strengthen.</seg>
<seg>Which concerns the internal affairs, this is nevertheless surely better for the Islamist regime than a more moderate result.</seg>
<seg>Ahmadinedschad has clearly a broad basis of supporters.</seg>
<seg>But the fact that it led a populist election campaign, of it spoke, to help the arms which condemned achievements of the government and specified themselves near like a candidate of the opposition, is irrelevant: It was the choice of the regime, and at the end it received official assistance even against other rivaling representatives of the hard line among the candidates.</seg>
<seg>The regime played its sheet outstanding.</seg>
<seg>It put the somewhat more pragmatic Haschemi Rafsandschani, which did not agree with some current political measures, than a figure of the “establishment” and made its own man the rebel.</seg>
<seg>The government used the anti-establishment feeling in order to encourage its own rule again.</seg>
<seg>The fact that the last president, was Mohammed Chatami, a supporter of the reform movement -- although more shyly, in the long run the nothing reached -- , underlines only, how thoroughly the rulers the political situation umgekrempelt.</seg>
<seg>Ahmadinedschad is a representative of the younger activists of the revolution against the Schah a quarter century ago.</seg>
<seg>He was directly involved in kidnapping American hostage in Iran, although the exact extent of its participation remains disputed.</seg>
<seg>At most the circumstance worries that it stands for the two groups close, which represent the general agents of the most extreme elements in Iran: the corps of the guards of the Islamic revolution and the Basidsch organization.</seg>
<seg>First is a parallel, regime-faithful army, which second an organization for the intimidation of Opponenten and all different, which aim at an open society.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless the concern is reduced over it that an even still more radical guidance came in Iran to power, by two factors.</seg>
<seg>First of all Ahmadinedschad will probably concentrate on internal affairs and will try to lift the standard of living of the poorest Iranians -- with which success is unclear.</seg>
<seg>Secondly the same group, which is since the revolution at power, becomes the ideology and foreign policy would essentially drive on.</seg>
<seg>The president had less power, than it seems, and is overshadowed particularly by the highest leader Ajatollah Ali Chamenei.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless the choice makes Ahmadinedschads completely clear, which for a challenge Iran for the western policy and stability in the Near East represent.</seg>
<seg>First it signals above all to the most extreme elements in Iran and the customer of terror of the country (the Lebanese Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and the Islamic Dschihad as well as different small groups, those against Saudi Arabia, which Iraq and other Arab countries proceed) that they have green light for attacks.</seg>
<seg>They probably assume that Iran supports them, whatever they do.</seg>
<seg>From the outside regarded, Iran is often relatively careful, but secretly he is the terror sponsor leading world-wide.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes individual Iranian functionaries arranged in the single-handed attempt determined operations and coordinated, now them will feel still freer perhaps to do this.</seg>
<seg>In addition Ahmadinedschad represents openly the Iranian Crash program for the production of nuclear weapons.</seg>
<seg>Most Iranian politicians -- at least those, which by the government one permitted to work openly -- support the program, prefer however a calmer and more careful approach.</seg>
<seg>Rafsandschani placed for example the structure of better economic relations with the west over a raid at the atomic front.</seg>
<seg>With Ahmadinedschad as a president atomic Iran is more probable it that the weapons are used in adventurous way.</seg>
<seg>That means not that it would fire it, but rather that it will increase it for the purpose of the diplomatic extortion to perhaps use and thus threats up to the crisis.</seg>
<seg>Since the Iranian ruling powers explain daily their desire, Israel against the map to rub out and the USA fight (Ahmadinedschad stepped on its way to the casting of votes on a picture of the American flag), increased the risk of a confrontation.</seg>
<seg>Finally Ahmadinedschad is probably undermined stability in Iraq in dreistere way, and its victory will encourage radical Iranian functionaries and extremists in Iraq.</seg>
<seg>Iran sends already agents into Iraq and supports customers, who want the country changed into a clone.</seg>
<seg>The Iraqis, including the Shiite Muslims, whom the same direction Islam attach as the Iranians, generally reject a such interference.</seg>
<seg>A more militant Iranian attitude will possibly strengthen the Reibereien with Iraq and will cause there further anti-American acts of violence.</seg>
<seg>Briefly said, the result of the elections in Iran is dangerous, although its exact destabilizing effect will depend finally on how Ahmadinedschad behaves and how much power is granted to it by Chamenei.</seg>
<seg>Besides handling an Iran, which is based on the yardsticks of the uncompromising regime radical so openly extremely and even, represents a challenge not only for the USA, but also for Europe.</seg>
<seg>Will the European countries try to thus do as if Ahmadinedschads militant Rhetorik and provocations would be all the same and as if a diplomatic solution could be found for the atomic ambitions Iran?</seg>
<seg>With Rafsandschani it would have been simple to close a real agreement or to maintain the appearance of a co-operation.</seg>
<seg>But with Ahmadinedschad a high measure of appeasement will be necessary, in order to continue even the smallest diplomatic processes.</seg>
<seg>Some Iranian Reformer and Exilanten talked beautifully the choice Ahmadinedschads with the argument that its government probably shows the true face of the regimes and all western hopes for a compromise destroyed.</seg>
<seg>However therein also the success of the regime can reflect itself to neutralize the discontent over a quarter century of radical Islamic rule.</seg>
<seg>Independently of the exit Ahmadinedschads victory means that everything that has to do with Iran becomes presumably still more difficult.</seg>
<seg>Take from the arms, which give to realms</seg>
<seg>President Bush seems to be about to wreck of Americas household on years outside.</seg>
<seg>With president Bush's assumption of office one saw so far the eye handed only household surplus.</seg>
<seg>Today enormous deficits on the household horizon due to a mixture from irresponsible reductions of taxes, from the illness of the economy, introduced by the republicans, the blow-out of the stock exchange blister and an enormous increase of the defense expenditure threaten.</seg>
<seg>It comes still more badly, because Bush government and congress under guidance of the republicans are about to develop the household misery still further.</seg>
<seg>The damage, which they will cause, will probably weaken and to the disconcertion of the world economy will contribute the USA.</seg>
<seg>Traditionally the republican party America stood for balanced national budgets.</seg>
<seg>That changed under the government Reagan. Under him conservative republicans endorsed reductions of taxes also at the expense of large budgetary deficits.</seg>
<seg>President Reagan promised the American population both reductions of taxes and military high armament and the continuation of the expenditure politics preferred by them and all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg>The result - not surprisingly - was a number of enormous budgetary deficits, which stressed again to eliminate years.</seg>
<seg>Both presidents, both George Bush senj. and Bill Clinton, had to raise new taxes, around which inheritance of the era Reagan auszumisten.</seg>
<seg>The tax increases were probably partial responsibility at president Bush's senj. Defeat at the polls opposite Bill Clinton in the year 1992.</seg>
<seg>Clinton decided nevertheless courageously to further-walk on the way to a balanced household. He did this partially also, in order to secure the financing of its programs for the social old-age pension on a long-term basis.</seg>
<seg>When Clinton separated in the year 2000 from the office, the budget situation was the best for decades.</seg>
<seg>Then president George Bush dipped jr. up to let over Reagan revive again with comprehensive reductions of taxes, enormous increases of the military expenditure and the updating or expansion of the popular expenditure politics.</seg>
<seg>The result was foreseeable.</seg>
<seg>In January 2001 the cumulative household result was estimated for the years 2002-2011 still at altogether 5,6 trillion dollar surplus.</seg>
<seg>These planned surplus had already evaporated center 2002.</seg>
<seg>In view of this changed economic situation and the shade, which a possible war in Iraq ahead-throws, one would have expected, the Bush government and the congress under guidance of the republicans dealt with recommendations of further reductions of taxes more carefully.</seg>
<seg>But no, they set their highest priority on further reductions of taxes, which come primarily the realms to property.</seg>
<seg>At the same time the government demands clear increases with the military expenditure.</seg>
<seg>After now the attention turns again to the presidential elections in November 2004, with security no meaningful reductions at the non-military expenditure program will be made.</seg>
<seg>It seems thus that it will remain with the substantial budgetary deficits.</seg>
<seg>Even if the domestic expenditures maintain further the same portion of the national income, the cumulative household result might accumulate itself in the next ten years to a deficit of 1,5 trillion dollar.</seg>
<seg>But this number could be to optimistic still, because it probably considers the costs of a possible Iraq war not sufficiently, also not a further round to reductions of taxes and not the risk of higher interest rates in the years lying before us.</seg>
<seg>Why do the republicans make themselves so few concerns over the disorder, which they arrange?</seg>
<seg>Unite republicans are more important to reductions of taxes for realms than nearly everything else.</seg>
<seg>Others believe, high deficits to larger reductions with the domestic expenditures for government would force and so the influence state would cut, which they actually wish themselves in the internal one.</seg>
<seg>The problem of the opinion specified last is only that most taxpayers the domestic programs will not so easily support to assure and them from there larger restrictions of expenditure.</seg>
<seg>A much more stretching question reads: Why the Americans are correct for such political programs, where they should know nevertheless, into which difficulties they will probably lead.</seg>
<seg>An answer mentioned, many voters would simply not see the threatening household problems.</seg>
<seg>A better answer points out that most Americans were not actually correct for such programs.</seg>
<seg>The election turnout with the elections of 2002 was with only 40%. From the delivered voices about half to the republicans, thus approximately only 20% of the voters were allotted.</seg>
<seg>Naturally the prospects do not have to be so hopeless.</seg>
<seg>The war in Iraq can be prevented.</seg>
<seg>The suggested reductions of taxes can be watered or given up.</seg>
<seg>But I forecast enormous budgetary deficits in the coming years and in the USA and abroad increasing uneasiness over the overall economic situation in America.</seg>
<seg>Capital investors from the foreign country might decide to want the household and balance of payments deficts Americas not further on so favorable conditions financiers.</seg>
<seg>The dollar will become probably weaker and fears of inflation could step out more clearly.</seg>
<seg>All this will let the US politicians react less self-assuredly and flexibly to the economical shocks.</seg>
<seg>Arms both within the USA as well as abroad it might suffer from most from if president Bush and the congress will communicate to the American population and the world that because of the large budgetary deficits no more money remains, in order to be able to concern the problems of the poverty and those in the health and education nature.</seg>
<seg>If the simple Americans wake up and do not serious-take the household risks, can make themselves realms again with a gift of many billions dollar of it while the country and the world will have to carry in the coming years hard at the consequences.</seg>
<seg>Theories from the relating to financial policy thoughtlessness of the USA</seg>
<seg>George W. Bush did more than every other president in American history to arrange the economic policy of the USA at the basis and at it even his Mentor Ronald Reagan exceeded.</seg>
<seg>In only three-year term of office it destroyed a fragilen political consent, which to manufacture one decade had lasted and which again to establish a further decade could last.</seg>
<seg>Thus Bush of Americas risked long-term economic health and social stability.</seg>
<seg>Since the long-term challenges for the household, which handle the USA so catastrophic, are not unusual, relating to financial policy Schnitzern important theories for other countries can be pulled from Americas.</seg>
<seg>Main problem of the financial policy consists of the fact that politicians can cause a temporary increase of their popularity, by making enormous national debts, which remains reserving to clear away then the future over reductions of taxes and an increase of the public expenditures problem-free.</seg>
<seg>This trick can function a few years; rather in former times than later however budgetary deficits and rising national indebtedness force a painful political about-face.</seg>
<seg>A cynical politician however can acquire so its re-election and is possibly with outbreak of the crisis then in the retirement.</seg>
<seg>One should mean that the voters after world-wide hundreds of such episodes of relating to financial policy Verantwortungslosigkeit in the last decades allergisch in this kind of cheat would react.</seg>
<seg>Bush however comes through again with it: He acquires today popularity, by increasing enormous tax gifts distributed and at the same time the military expenditure and even the expenditures for education and health.</seg>
<seg>The result is a budgetary deficit at a value of more than 5% of the gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg>More badly still it is that the long-term prospects for the American household were exciting already concern, before Bush began his thoughtless policy.</seg>
<seg>The average age of population of US increases; from this a steep rise of the costs in the public health service and with the pensions results for the future.</seg>
<seg>Careful computations show that the future incomes attainable on the basis the tax policy favored by Bush will presumably fall below the costs of pensions, health welfare service and further public expenditures expected by the public around some ten trillion dollar.</seg>
<seg>Sometime in the future a strong rise of the taxes, deep cuts with the public expenditures or both will therefore be together necessary, in order to correct Bush's actions.</seg>
<seg>Why thus does the public endorse its politics?</seg>
<seg>The reason is that the public applies hardly understanding or interest in these long-term consequences, although in the long run most Americans among them will suffer.</seg>
<seg>The richest taxpayers are naturally content, because they profit at most of these reductions of taxes.</seg>
<seg>It is unbelievable, but almost half of the reductions of taxes benefits the richest 5% among the American taxpayers, and these rich taxpayers expect obviously the fact that the remaining 95% - the middle class and arms - whom is to carry largest part of the future expenditure lowerings and tax increases.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile Bush convinced many voters from the under and middle class that also they can be content - without them to say that they cut for their small reductions of taxes with substantially larger with the future national achievements become to pay to have, if the policy of its government succeeds on a long-term basis.</seg>
<seg>If the Americans would have a political memory, then it would be conscious to them that her this tax political, roller coaster ride " in the past 20 years already to have once through-lived.</seg>
<seg>When Ronald Reagan was selected, he promised likewise substantial reductions of taxes and a substantial increase of the military expenditure.</seg>
<seg>The result was an enormous budgetary deficit in the middle of the 1980er years.</seg>
<seg>The reductions of taxes made Reagan enormously popular and contributed to his re-election in the year 1984.</seg>
<seg>Subsequently, it lasted over one decade - from Reagan's second term of office over the presidencies of George Bush sen. and Bill Clinton - to transform around the budgetary deficit again into a household surplus.</seg>
<seg>Naturally this made the grant of new tax increases necessary, which George Bush sen. the re-election cost and to the polarized political landscape of the 1990er years led.</seg>
<seg>History might repeat itself nearly with security.</seg>
<seg>Some ideologists oriented towards the right within the Bush administration believe that the budgetary deficits of our days will force in the long run deep cuts with the public social expenditures.</seg>
<seg>They hope for a disassembly of programs like the social security and Medicare.</seg>
<seg>In the American public however these social programs enjoy broad support.</seg>
<seg>The strategy political rights to lower first the taxes in order to force afterwards cuts with the social programs, will therefore fail, and which become taxes finally again to rise to have.</seg>
<seg>Others within the Bush administration argue that reductions of taxes are important, in order to pull the USA from the recession.</seg>
<seg>Also this argument is wrong.</seg>
<seg>Of America economics would have itself without these reductions of taxes recovered, perhaps even more effectively.</seg>
<seg>Independently of it is an enormous error to develop a long-term tax policy on the short term economic cycle.</seg>
<seg>For other countries from this two fundamental teachings result.</seg>
<seg>First is that appearing the budgetary deficits of the USA will set of Americas to international influence limits sooner or later.</seg>
<seg>The Americans supported the Iraq war only, because they did not have to pay him with tax increases.</seg>
<seg>As soon as the Americans must decide whether they want their foreign adventures by higher taxes financiers, they in very much smaller measure will be ready to support expensive military operations abroad.</seg>
<seg>It will actually come in the course of the public argument around the relating to financial policy chaos left by Bush to a deeply going internal splitting of the USA.</seg>
<seg>The second teachings are that countries should consider the rising costs, which an aging population causes in their budgetary plannings.</seg>
<seg>The long-term budget situation is frequently neither clearly conscious to the taxpayers nor the parliament.</seg>
<seg>Governments should be obligated to submit together with their annual budget drafts long-term estimates of the budget situation in order to work against the tendency to short term, politically motivated manipulations of the household.</seg>
<seg>The USA can serve other countries than early warning.</seg>
<seg>The white house should others the same reminder give, which Zauberer on the television gives its spectators: , attempts it this not at home. “</seg>
<seg>The political stock market</seg>
<seg>Many economics and financial analysts deplore that the stock markets were manipulated by developing countries often strongly by their governments and rather politically as relating to market conditions are.</seg>
<seg>In contrast to it unexpressed the acceptance seems to exist with stock markets in industrial nations that this by an original Kraft of economic nature are driven and a prognosis of its performance is comparable therefore with a growth prognosis for trees.</seg>
<seg>This description of stock markets in developing countries is not wrongly, only partial, because the same description is valid for stock exchanges in industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg>The best analysts know that a prognosis of the performance of the stock market of each country essentially means to forecast, how well it is to be issued investors at the stock exchange the will of the government after in the current political surrounding field.</seg>
<seg>We take the stock market of the United States, the world largest with distance.</seg>
<seg>After the general view enterprises of the government remain reflecting undisturbed and the net yields on investments at the US stock exchange the fundamental forces of a strong capitalistic economic system.</seg>
<seg>This is one of the reasons, why a magnetic attraction on portfolio investors exercises the USA from all over the world.</seg>
<seg>But the profits, which let the American stock exchange markets be so attractive, are expression of a sensitive political equilibrium.</seg>
<seg>In particular tax rates, which affect shares, varied under changing political pressure in the course of the time.</seg>
<seg>Thus approximately during the Second World War the political support for large fortunes left and the government the taxes to Kapitalgewinne, dividends and high incomes generally drastically increased.</seg>
<seg>When the Second World War brought thorough recovery of the world economic crisis of the thirties-years, Roosevelt and the congress a tax raised president on excessive profits, in order to ensure that shareholders would not profit too much.</seg>
<seg>In the year 1980 however, when it gave no war, the stock exchange was, selected however in a low the US voters Ronald Reagan, a man, who many for too much the right wing belonging held, in order president to be.</seg>
<seg>It demanded - reached and - reductions of taxes on Kapitalgewinne, dividends and incomes.</seg>
<seg>Political interference into the stock market is not limited alone to taxes to Kapitalgewinne, dividends and incomes.</seg>
<seg>Wealth tax, use of you, import duties and value added tax - which are paid all together directly or indirectly by enterprises - to be able in extended measure corporate profits and the stock market to thus affect.</seg>
<seg>Wherever stock markets do not flourish are it coincidence that governments do not provide for it these taxes under any circumstances so far extend to leave to make corporate profits after departure of taxes destroyed.</seg>
<seg>The policy of the stock markets does not stop with the taxes.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, almost each government activity affects corporate profits and in response on the stock market.</seg>
<seg>After the collapse of the stock market in the year 1929 the US Government exposed many activities of the cartel authorities and made possible it to enterprise monopoly power to attain, which would increase its value.</seg>
<seg>This politics retarded the recovery of high unemployment, but was not even sufficient, in order to hold the political forces in the Zaum, which were mobilized to favour of the support of the stock market.</seg>
<seg>Likewise it was one of the most important things, president Reagan did to destroy far parts of the remaining power of the American trade unions which fought for their piece at the enterprise cake.</seg>
<seg>Reagan's smashing the air traffic controller strike of 1981 was a turning point for the American trade union movement - and for the stock market, whose spectacular stock exchange boom took its beginning in the year 1982.</seg>
<seg>Since the speculative blister of the share quotations reached their high point in the year 2000, the US Government supported, in particular the stock market particularly energetically by repetitive lowering of the interest rates.</seg>
<seg>Publicly this was naturally justified as measure for the stimulation of the economy, not for the supporting of the stock market.</seg>
<seg>It is however an informative reference to the meaning of the US stock exchange that the share quotation decline was regarded as one of the most important factors, which rested on the economy.</seg>
<seg>The reaction of the authorities was not limited to monetary stimulation measures.</seg>
<seg>The economical total bill of the USA shows the fact that the effective tax rate on corporate profits (the percentage the profit, which is actually paid in the form of taxes to the government) its high point with 33,7% in the first quarter of the yearly 2000 reached - which highest level of the stock market and the economic situation generally - over in the fourth quarter 2003 on 20,2% fell, when the market had a low point.</seg>
<seg>This decrease reflects to a large extent clear, measures endorsed by the congress for tax preference again, as well as the view from enterprises that they can evade to taxes in the current economic and political surrounding field more aggressively.</seg>
<seg>It is added that the maximum tax on dividends from shares was lowered after the Börsencrash of 35% to 15%, which provided long-term investor a substantial new advantage and which compound interest effect strengthened with reinvestment of the dividends after taxes.</seg>
<seg>Also this reduction of taxes was justified as incentive for economic situation, which one can naturally maintain from practically each measure to support aims at the stock market.</seg>
<seg>It is however the balance of political forces, which decides on the reliability of such a justification.</seg>
<seg>One could say that the same variables, including the rejecting attitude in relation to high taxes and the weak trade union movement, into which the USA are since the last 200 years at the work - and one thus to assume can they will be this also in the future, and high stock exchange gains to produce and enormous Kapitalzuflüsse of foreign investments to tighten.</seg>
<seg>Those, which mean that investments are for many decades maintained into the US stock market the same strong growth trend, could quite right be.</seg>
<seg>One should realize oneself however which one prognosticates.</seg>
<seg>In the reason one does not only forecast economic developments, but politics - and even the cultural values - which economic policy and - achievement coin/shape.</seg>
<seg>The global home of one's own</seg>
<seg>From all investments homes of one's own are most strongly to a certain place bound decay the local economic conditions and thus on prosper or subjected.</seg>
<seg>On our televisions we pursue very fast world-wide developments, but our home of one's own market, which lies almost exclusively in the hands of local amateurs, remains embodied in our backyard.</seg>
<seg>That could change however soon.</seg>
<seg>Within one month the product stock exchange will bring Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in co-operation with my enterprise MacroMarkets as well as with Fiserv and standard & Poor's Futures and option contracts on the home of one's own prices in ten US-American cities on the market.</seg>
<seg>The S&P/Case Shiller Immobilienpreisindizes forms the basis of these contracts -- an advancement of that scientific work, which my colleague Karl Case and I carried out before nearly twenty years.</seg>
<seg>We engaged ourselves many years for Immobilienfutures, but up to now no stock exchange wanted to create a Futuresmarkt on basis of such indices.</seg>
<seg>The Futuresmärkte will make it for investors possible in the whole world to invest by the purchase of portions indirectly into US-American homes of one's own.</seg>
<seg>An investor in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo can thus in New York, Los Angeles and read Vegas into homes of one's own to invest, which are inhabited by their owners.</seg>
<seg>Due to a fundamental principle of the financial theory -- the “diversification” or “Risikostreuung” -- one can assume the interest in the new contracts will be quite high.</seg>
<seg>Like that for example persons and companies are in New York to excessively exposed high local real estate risks. They should decrease this risk from there by the sale of Futures on home of one's own prices in New York.</seg>
<seg>With acceptable prices humans will take over a part of the risk to Tokyo by the purchase of these New Yorker Futures on home of one's own prices.</seg>
<seg>The New Yorker ones live still in their homes of one's own, but they now strewed their investment risk world-wide.</seg>
<seg>There was not a genuine market for Futures on homes of one's own since 1991 no more, than the Londoner to date and option stock exchange (now firmiert under the name the Euronext.liffe) failed to develop a such market in Great Britain.</seg>
<seg>At that time one could not obtain sufficient volume of trade.</seg>
<seg>The stock exchange schmiss a party, but none went.</seg>
<seg>Also the British Spread Betting markets and some on-line commercial markets could not obtain a lasting success.</seg>
<seg>Will it this time different be?</seg>
<seg>Naturally the start of a new market is always an uncertain venture. Humans go only gladly on parties, even if many other people are there.</seg>
<seg>Even if nobody is there, none goes gladly. Likewise it behaves on markets with few investors.</seg>
<seg>It gives too few transactions to attract in order to obtain those yields, which are necessary, in order enough investors. Just as with mad parties also the success of new markets is sometimes a mystery, but we know that it very probably folds occasionally.</seg>
<seg>There are signs for an increasing interest in the trade with Futures on home of one's own prices, above all, since the debates about a “real estate bubble” still underline the meaning of the risk diversification.</seg>
<seg>After the CME announced its plans, also one was reported their competitor inside, Chicago option stock exchange that one likewise plans to bring Futures and option contracts for the most important regions in the USA on the market. Basis for it are the median prices for homes of one's own, published by the American federation of the real estate agents.</seg>
<seg>But apart from the strong public interest in real estate investments and the security of the real estate risks still another crucial point is to be clarified for the success of Futuresmärkten: The prices must to be put openly and the investors have the meaning of these prices to realize itself.</seg>
<seg>I believe that one will count on many this Futuresmärkte soon on a considerable price decline in some US-American cities, entering within the next yearly.</seg>
<seg>The prices will itself in from dealers in such a way designated “Backwardation” to rule. That is, the price of a Futures at the market today is smaller than the current price of the home of one's own.</seg>
<seg>This Backwardation will not enter perhaps on the first day of the trade with Futures, but very probably within a few months.</seg>
<seg>This Backwardation could be necessary on some markets, if these its function to become fair to be supposed.</seg>
<seg>All know that it gave an enormous real estate boom in many of these cities (and also elsewhere) in the last years.</seg>
<seg>International investors will not want probable to invest in these cities, if there are no expectations on the Futuresmärkten regarding a price decline, how the inhabitants of Tokyo from bitter experience know.</seg>
<seg>If however this Backwardation is minted enough, could itself also investors, who believed that the US property market is declining, from whom Eigenheimfutures a good net yield expect, because they already acquire these at the Futuresmarkt at a favourable price.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless those New Yorker ones, which want to secure their real estate investments, up to a certain degree to rethink to have, if it concerns to sell Futureskontrakte in which a price decline is already taken into account.</seg>
<seg>They will only have themselves to accustom at the thoughts that the market the price decline already expected and that they can secure themselves only for the part of possible future Preisminderungen, which go beyond these expectations.</seg>
<seg>Such a reorientation will probably in-turn if we actually know the future market prices.</seg>
<seg>Up to now the future development of the real estate prices was excluding a question of different opinions.</seg>
<seg>If the markets can manufacture an international consent over the future home of one's own prices in the cities of this world, we will be able to deal also with the risks in these cities better and with it the respective Ökonomien -- and our own life -- stabilize.</seg>
<seg>Which messages move the markets?</seg>
<seg>The stock markets in a majority of the world had to accept clear exchange losses since approximately 10 May. Most of it occurred itself in the two weeks to approximately to 23. May; on the average however are the courses since then continue to fall.</seg>
<seg>Do these problems at the international stock exchanges refer to problems for the world economy?</seg>
<seg>Let us the strongest exchange losses regard.</seg>
<seg>With the most important national indices the largest Crash took place in India, where the share quotations from 10. to 23. May around 16,9% fell.</seg>
<seg>The debacle on the other side of the globe was almost just as large, and the most and Tiefststände deviated only two days from those in India: In Argentina the courses gave way around 16,1%, in Brazil around 14,7% and in Mexico around 13,8%.</seg>
<seg>Also the European markets suffered high losses.</seg>
<seg>In Sweden the courses sank between 9. and 22. May around 15,2%; in nearly the same period they fell in Germany around 9,7%, in France around 9,4% and in Great Britain and Italy around 9,3%.</seg>
<seg>In Asia the courses in nearly exactly the same period of relative highest levels fell on relative lowest points -- in Korea around 11,5%, in Hong Kong around 9,3% and in Japan around 8%.</seg>
<seg>Many commentators are endeavored to fasten these procedures at the developments in the United States.</seg>
<seg>But in the USA the shares fell between 9. and 24. May only around 5,2%.</seg>
<seg>Just as little seems to put China behind the world-wide fall in prices, since the courses even rose there during this period.</seg>
<seg>The standard explanation of the economists places the monetary policy into the center.</seg>
<seg>In the course of the large fear of deflation of the yearly 2003 the central banks lowered world-wide the interest and released with it speculation-conditioned upswings both on the share and on the house market.</seg>
<seg>Now however, rising interest becomes so this aspect unpleasantly apparent, which suggests further falls in prices for the future.</seg>
<seg>Herein an important grain of puts certainly truth.</seg>
<seg>US federal reserve main header the interest on 10 May actually, and its Chairman, Ben Bernanke, suggested the possibility of further increases in interest.</seg>
<seg>To 17. May worsening inflation data announced themselves, what points to the fact that a further rationalisation of the monetary policy is approaching.</seg>
<seg>The economists regard the world gladly as logical and controllable -- and it implies thereby that they understand, what into it takes place.</seg>
<seg>But by doing this, they evaluate the role of the central bank frequently over.</seg>
<seg>Actually the increase in interest was in the USA only one in a whole set of increases in interest -- the 16. in consequence.</seg>
<seg>No other important central bank increased the interest after the exchange losses at the stock markets by 7./8. June, when then several did it (the EZB and the central banks of India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).</seg>
<seg>A further factor is the oil price, between that the 22. March and 2 May around 24% rose and several absolute highest levels set up.</seg>
<seg>This was with security a highlight, and it is clear that it could have effects on the stock markets everywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg>Oil price increases contributed to practically all economic recessions since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg>However the oil price increases do not fall into the time window in the middle of May, when the indices gave way most clearly.</seg>
<seg>Who argues the fact that rising oil prices caused the exchange losses at the stock market presupposes that the stock markets reacted with delay of several weeks.</seg>
<seg>Now stock markets do not act necessarily particularly logically, and so a retarded reaction to the oil price shocks could be present.</seg>
<seg>As is the case for all other prices on the financial markets an increase causes attention also here.</seg>
<seg>If the oil prices shoot up, humans pay attention to messages connected with the oil prices and converse strengthened about the oil price history -- which an increasing sensitization for such messages causes.</seg>
<seg>The crisis in the Near East, which controlled the message in May, stands with the oil prices in the connection.</seg>
<seg>Possibly the investors noticed mischief-announcing references and the threatening word choice of different political participants due to the oil price increases strengthened.</seg>
<seg>Thus the deputy Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres in reaction to hostile expressions of the Iranian president explained Mahmoud Ahmadinedschad on 8 May: “The president Iran should realise that also Iran can be wiped by the map.”</seg>
<seg>In similar way the newspapers reported to 13. May, approximately at the beginning of the sharp falls in prices at the stock exchanges that Ahmadinedschad with its visit in Indonesia -- the most densely populated by the majority Muslim country in the world -- considered by students of two the Topuniversitäten of the country with standing ovations is.</seg>
<seg>This message may have been interpreted as proof for the fact that Ahmadinedschads confrontation course in the nuclear question for this pays off politically -- which may have given lift to the conception that the strained situation in the Near East too even still higher oil prices could lead.</seg>
<seg>These messages may be many further after the appearance away of the stock market as the monetary policy.</seg>
<seg>But the public reaction to it -- together with the recent rise of the oil prices -- may be responsible to a good part for the change of the market psychology.</seg>
<seg>The willingness to take risks change in the run the time, and events such as Ahmadinedschads and Peres' expressions can cause such changes.</seg>
<seg>Such things happen in with difficulty quantifiable way. Nevertheless the analysts should with their attempts to predict the development at the world-wide stock markets which expressions Ahmadinedschads give possibly likewise to much attention like that Bernankes.</seg>
<seg>, Your attention to the attitude of the public and their interaction with price adjustments may not please the economists concentrate world-wide messages and Spekulationsdynamiken.</seg>
<seg>Finally they would admit with the fact that economic events are less predictable (and the economists themselves less all-knowing), than they would have it gladly.</seg>
<seg>But a such focus results in intuitively a sense.</seg>
<seg>What really moves the investors?</seg>
<seg>Ahmadinedschad is a charismatic shape; Bernanke is not it.</seg>
<seg>Ahmadinedschad pursues an adventurous course; Bernanke does not do it.</seg>
<seg>And, perhaps most importantly: Ahmadinedschad is not a destabilizing influence, Bernanke is it.</seg>
<seg>The world-wide case of the share quotations in the middle of actually refers May, which always its letztliche cause may be, to an unstable market psychology.</seg>
<seg>It is with difficulty conceivable that it is to be fastened only at the opinions over the supposed monetary policy and not at more comprehensive and more deeply seizing problems fundamental for the global economic development -- including the power supply and the political tensions.</seg>
<seg>Why one should for Fairness more pay</seg>
<seg>Marks & Spencer, a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 branches in all of Great Britain, announced recently that she wanted to change her entire coffee and tea pallet over, altogether 38 lines, to fair trade, a Marketingsymbol for “ethical production”.</seg>
<seg>The chain sells in its 200 Café Revive Kaffeestuben already excluding tea and coffee with Fairtraide seal.</seg>
<seg>It increases likewise its purchase quantity of shirts and other goods from fair trade cotton.</seg>
<seg>The publication took place during “fair trade the Fortnight”, a two-week campaign for fair trade products, in which among other things farmers from developing countries told the Britisher on lectures at different places, how fair trade helped their municipalities.</seg>
<seg>The movement to a more ethical consumption won also in the United States at meaning, where the consumers ever more biologically cultivated, locally manufactured food as well as eggs from open land attitude to turn.</seg>
<seg>In Great Britain an inquiry resulted in that half of the asked ones recognized and knew the fair trade symbol that it refers to products, which offer the farmer in the third world better business conditions.</seg>
<seg>There is no comparable US study, but similar data and discussions with my own students point out that the number would be substantially smaller.</seg>
<seg>Dealers, who request the fair trade seal, must pay a price, which covers the costs of a lasting production and secures a minimum wage to the manufacturers.</seg>
<seg>For example the minimum price for coffee amounts to $ 1.26 per Pound, no matter how deeply the market price falls.</seg>
<seg>If the market price rises over this value, the fair market price increases, so that it per Pound around five cent remains higher.</seg>
<seg>Small farmers must organize themselves for their part in cooperative ones or other groups, which make a democratic participation possible.</seg>
<seg>Plantations and factories can use the fair trade seal, if they pay decent wages to their workers, health, safety and environmental standards to keep, trade unions or other forms of worker organizations to permit, good accommodations available make, if the workers do not live at home, and neither child nor hard labour up to take.</seg>
<seg>Not with all fair trade resemblance finds.</seg>
<seg>Brink Lindsey, director of the according to the free market oriented Cato Institute's center for trade Policy Studies, believes that the campaign for fair trade coffee represents a “well meant dead end”.</seg>
<seg>With some authorization it argues that the real cause for the case of the coffee prices is not the profit greed of multinational enterprises, but the enormous increase of coffee production in Brazil and Viet Nam, in combination with new techniques, which make it possible to cultivate coffee with fewer workers and from there more cheaply.</seg>
<seg>From Lindeys point of view out we should encourage the coffee farmers, if we want to help them, either, to give the cultivation of coffee up and cultivate more profitable plants -- and here it points out rightfully that trade barriers and subsidies of the rich countries are obstacles, which must be abolished -- to turn or high-quality products, e.g. Special coffee, which obtain higher prices.</seg>
<seg>At Lindeys argumentation is however strangely that the campaign for fair trade coffee can be regarded as exactly that, what it recommends: The coffee farmers are encouraged to cultivate a special coffee which obtains a higher price.</seg>
<seg>The representatives of the free market do not have to object anything to enterprises, which completely openly use Snob Appeal, in order to recruit for their products.</seg>
<seg>If the people $ 48 want to pay Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee for a Pound, because James Bond's favourite coffee is, the economists do not have anything against the fact that the market is distorted.</seg>
<seg>Why are they thus critical if the consumers decide itself to spend $ 12 on a Pound coffee from which they know that he was cultivated to donating trees without poisonous chemicals under shade, in which birds survive can  -- of farmers, who can now afford it to nourish and send to the school their children?</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the economists would answer the fact that one, if one wants to help humans to nourish and train their children, $ 10 for a fair not acted coffee to pay could, which tastes exactly the same, and then to a relief organization donates in such a way saved $ 2, which supplies poor children with meals and education.</seg>
<seg>That is a possible strategy, but has fair trade certain advantages.</seg>
<seg>The farmers know the fact that they must supply a product that pleases the consumers, both in geschmacklicher regard and in the cultivation way.</seg>
<seg>If their product sells itself well, they can be proud something to have produced which is in demand in the whole world.</seg>
<seg>From the view of the producers it is better to get a premium by the sale of a fair trade product to receive than a mild gift which independent they kept from whether they would have worked or not, and regardless of the quality of their product.</seg>
<seg>A higher price for a fair trade label to pay is not “market-more adverse” to pay than a higher price for a Gucci label and it reflects better ethical priorities.</seg>
<seg>Fair trade is not a national subsidy.</seg>
<seg>Its success depends on the demand on the market, not of political lobbying.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately this demand on the European market grows rapidly.</seg>
<seg>It remains hoping that it will be similarly high in all industrialized countries and everywhere, where humans can decide freely on their expenditures soon.</seg>
<seg>Pigs, calves and the American democracy</seg>
<seg>Regarding all the headlines over the victory of the democrats with the American congressional elections regarding November an important result of these elections almost went down.</seg>
<seg>And although this partial result revealed the lack of the political system in the USA, it repaired to mean faith in the sympathy of American average citizens.</seg>
<seg>In the Federal State Arizona can submit due to a sufficient number at support signatures a parliamentary bill to citizen for direct vote.</seg>
<seg>With the heurigen elections it concerned to tie up pregnant pigs or breeding calves the prohibition or hold in impacts, which prevent the animal to move freely to lie down or its limbs stretch.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps those, which are not familiar the modern agriculture industry with the methods, ask themselves, why a such legislation could be at all necessary.</seg>
<seg>Under conditions like it before 50 years in animal husbandry everywhere and like them in some countries also today to still practice, have all animals prevailed to enough place, in order to move and stretch.</seg>
<seg>Today however approximately 90% all American Zuchtsauen spend -- the mothers of those piglets, which are drawn up and killed for production by pork, bacon and ham - majority of their life locked up in box conditions, which are not larger than 60 times 220 cm.</seg>
<seg>Into it they can turn nor put down neither, stretch their limbs or go to more than one step forward or backwards.</seg>
<seg>Other Sauen is tied up to so short chains that they cannot likewise turn.</seg>
<seg>Also calves in calf meat production are their whole life into small impacts closed, where they do not turn, to put down separately or stretch can.</seg>
<seg>A goal of these animal husbandry methods is operational saving -- they facilitate the animal management and make the attitude possible of thousands or ten thousands animals under a roof. Thus are necessary fewer or smaller qualified coworkers.</seg>
<seg>In addition these methods prevent that the animals waste energy by too much movement or fights among themselves.</seg>
<seg>After protests of animal protection organizations the European union gave some years ago at its scientific veterinary committee a report over this kind to animal husbandry in order.</seg>
<seg>In the report of the committee one came to the result that the animals suffer not to be able themselves and nothing at all to do have to move her freely.</seg>
<seg>To this conclusion one could have come naturally also under employment of normal common sense.</seg>
<seg>After the publication of this report the European Union set periods, up to which time locking up the animals was to be forbidden.</seg>
<seg>For breeding calves the prohibition already approaches with 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg>Single box conditions for Zuchtsauen, which are already forbidden in Great Britain and Sweden, will be illegal in the entire European Union starting from 2013.</seg>
<seg>Gradually to be converted also measures are not it even their wings for the improvement of the living conditions of putting hens, which are kept closely zusammengepfercht usually in wire cages, in which to spread can.</seg>
<seg>In the USA country wide measures of this kind are not anywhere in view.</seg>
<seg>If my European friends asked me in the past, why the USA Europe in things animal protection limp so far afterwards, I knew to it no answer.</seg>
<seg>If the questions became more urgent, I had to admit that an explanation for it is possibly the circumstance that animals are to the Americans less because of the heart than the Europeans.</seg>
<seg>In the year 2002 however animal welfare activist brought a parliamentary bill in Florida over the prohibition of box conditions for Sauen to the vote.</seg>
<seg>For the surprise of many the proposal was accepted of 55% the voter.</seg>
<seg>Last month in Arizona despite expensive Gegeninitiativen of the agrarian industry the prohibition was then accepted likewise by small box conditions for Sauen and calves with 62% of the votes.</seg>
<seg>Neither Florida nor Arizona are particularly progressive states -- in both defeated George W. Bush 2004 his competitor John Kerry.</seg>
<seg>The voting results put thus the conclusion near that the majority of the Americans - them would have the opportunity to co-ordinate on it - would forbid the attitude of pregnant Sauen and calves in close impacts.</seg>
<seg>The Americans seems the animal protection exactly the same a request to be like the Europeans.</seg>
<seg>In order to thus explain the gap between Europe and the USA in things utilizable animal protection, we should take once the political system under the magnifying glass.</seg>
<seg>In Europe it succeeded to near-carry the requests of the voters within the range of the animal protection to parliament delegates in the respective countries and to the delegates of the European parliament. That led to appropriate national animal laws for the protection and to European Union guidelines, which considered to these requests.</seg>
<seg>In contrast to it requests within the range of the animal protection did not have measurable effects on the congressional representatives in the USA.</seg>
<seg>Neither country widely nor on level of the individual Federal States there is a legislation to the protection of economically useful animals.</seg>
<seg>The reason for it is to be looked for my judgement therein that representatives of the agrarian industry are able, to let millions of dollars walk into the bags of that congressional representatives who would like to be re-elected gladly.</seg>
<seg>In the range lobbyism and election campaign donations could not keep up the animal protection movement despite broad public support with these defaults.</seg>
<seg>In the American choice system money counts more than the opinion of the voters.</seg>
<seg>The party discipline is weakly pronounced and congressional representatives must the money for their re-election find -- and such elections line up in the case it house of representatives every two years.</seg>
<seg>In Europe, where the party discipline is strongly pronounced and not the candidates, but the parties, money a smaller role plays election campaigns financiers.</seg>
<seg>In the USA, where one is so proud on its democratic traditions, pigs and calves are probably hardly the only losers.</seg>
<seg>What is new at the new Afghan all party army?</seg>
<seg>(Possibly plotted by the Afghan provisional government) the murder of the Afghan aviation Minister by a mobilization shows that the Afghan society is deeply split.</seg>
<seg>The first reforms in the Afghan army will only deepen these ditches.</seg>
<seg>The Secretary of Defense in Hamid Karsais interim government in Kabul already appointed the highest officers of this new army.</seg>
<seg>The Minister, general Mohammed Fahim, a Tadschike from the northern region Pandschir, took over the command three months ago ago over the troops of the north alliance, which took Kabul, after American bombers had freed the way for it for them.</seg>
<seg>Altogether its appointments are a direct danger for Karsais intentions of uniting the country.</seg>
<seg>Afghanistan is a many people state, in which the Paschtunen with two fifth forms the majority of the population.</seg>
<seg>In each case a fifth of the population are Hazara and Tadschiken.</seg>
<seg>Are from the thirty-eight now officers raised from Fahim into general rank thirty-seven Tadschiken and a Usbeke.</seg>
<seg>Each to the military service drawn in member of the fifteen to seventeen million counting ethnic group of the Paschtunen, will thus serve under a command structure, which consists almost exclusively of Tadschiken.</seg>
<seg>The language of the Paschtunen differs from that one the Tadschiken however just as much, as English of Spanish and millions of Paschtunen in the able-bodied age has at best fragmentary knowledge of the tadschikischen language.</seg>
<seg>The geographical origin of the new military guidance is just as closely calm, as their ethnic profile.</seg>
<seg>Thirty-five of thirty-eight officers originate from the region north of Kabul, to which the province Parwan (where also the airport Bagram is) and the close convenient Pandschir valley, which belong former center of the north alliance.</seg>
<seg>That is called differently expressed that for siebenundzwanzig leaders from that altogether twenty-nine Afghan provinces remained locked the doors for the new military guidance of the country.</seg>
<seg>Possibly a so closely seized group could weaken the impression that it concerns with it a clique, nor, if she would represent at least a representative cross section to more than one dozen of Afghan parties.</seg>
<seg>That is not however also the case.</seg>
<seg>Eighteen of the thirty-eight highest officers come from the Jamiat e Islami, an Islamic party, which was stated over long time by the former theology professor, Mullah Burhanuddin Rabbani.</seg>
<seg>Exactly this party governed middle of the 90's of the last century for short time in Kabul and caused that chaos and bloodshed, which caused most Afghans to welcome the arrival of the Taliban.</seg>
<seg>Almost likewise many members of the army guidance come from the communist camp.</seg>
<seg>Sixteen of the thirty-eight officers were for a long time connected with this party, whose cheat in the late seventies of the past century to the Soviet invasion between 1979 and 1989 led, which cost two and a half million Afghan the life.</seg>
<seg>Today the communists are in Afghanistan approximately likewise like, like Hitler's National Socialists in Czech Republic or Poland.</seg>
<seg>Of course humans in Afghanistan did not join the communist party for the most different reasons and by any means all were convinced ideologists like also elsewhere.</seg>
<seg>But six of Fahims generals were professional coworkers of the communist party and remained also after the invasion of the Red Army in the services of the communists.</seg>
<seg>These six men and still three further communists, who served in the Afghan army than officers, collaborated during the ten years lasting occupation of Afghanistan with the Soviets.</seg>
<seg>One introduces oneself, how the Frenchmen would have reacted, if a quarter of the French officer corps had collaborated after the Second World War during the occupation of France with the armed forces.</seg>
<seg>In Afghanistan pieces of news spread by mouth propaganda rather rapidly.</seg>
<seg>Soon thus Afghan nationalists (to those almost all Afghans to belong) will know about the political background of Fahims generals, if they not anyway already do it.</seg>
<seg>Even these crushing proofs for the unilateral nature and selective organization of the army command could still to some extent be neutralized, if the generals brought at least professionalism and commitment for patriotic values into their work.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately however only ten of the thirty-eight of Fahim have carried officers a military background.</seg>
<seg>One was an early pilot.</seg>
<seg>In contrast to it twenty-four (the background of four generals is unknown) from the civilian range come - either from the academic range, from communist party tubes or, as in case of a former Mullahs, from the religious range.</seg>
<seg>Which effects have these statistic data now on the reality?</seg>
<seg>First it that the commanders of the international peacekeeping forces will meet in Afghanistan, as well as American of military and diplomat in case of a meeting with the Afghan vice-Secretary of Defense, on Abdul Rashid Dostum, means for its brutality and corruptness notorious commanders and communist, who stand still with old friends in the Red Army in Moscow in connection.</seg>
<seg>Further it means that the commander in chief of the Afghan armed forces, just as the chief of staff and the boss of the clearing-up are also communists, whose loyalties are uncertain and to which most Afghans distrust.</seg>
<seg>Does one know this country torn up by wars with such a team again one?</seg>
<seg>Is the presence of such a dubious crew suitable in Kabul for it, the confidence of three quarters of the Afghan population, which remained unconsidered during the appointment of the army command to win?</seg>
<seg>Or is this list of the appointed ones not rather the expression of a style of leadership after the slogan of “everything for the winner”? Doesn't a such beginning hold the danger (sometime in the future), to kindle again a bloody counterreaction of those their interests now in so cynical way was turned into?</seg>
<seg>Before they agree this unscrupulous grasp after power by a small and unpopular minority, the United Nations, European and American decision makers should think about answers to these questions.</seg>
<seg>The Irrationalität in honours</seg>
<seg>Three-way a high on the new Nobel Laureates for economics: Daniel Kahneman of the University of Princeton and Vernon Smith of the George Mason university in Virginia.</seg>
<seg>Like many Nobel Prizes these honors honour not only the fertilizing work of Kahneman and forge, but also the thinking schools, to whose guidance they contribute.</seg>
<seg>Kahneman is psychologist. It showed, in which way individuals behave systematically far less rationally, than orthodox economists subordinate it to them.</seg>
<seg>Its research shows not only that individuals act sometimes completely differently than it the dominant economic theories predict, but also that they do this in such a way regularly, according to plan and in a way, which one can understand and interpret due to other hypotheses. These hypotheses compete with those, which use the orthodox economists.</seg>
<seg>For most market players - and straight also for simple observers -- this no great piece of news seems to be.</seg>
<seg>The brokers at the Wall Street, who act with shares, from which know it that they are garbage, exploit the Irrationalität, which Kahneman and forge pointed out.</seg>
<seg>A majority of the Manie, which led to the financial blister in the economy, was based to exploit the psychology of the investors.</seg>
<seg>Actually this Irrationalität is also no piece of news for occupation economists.</seg>
<seg>John May pool of broadcasting corporations Keynes did not describe already long ago the stock exchange like a field, on which rationally acting individuals fought for it, the bases of the market happening to uncover, but rather as a kind beauty competition, with which it wins which can guess best, according to which the jury will decide.</seg>
<seg>The Nobel Prize one of the criticisms at the simplified free-market economy teachings, straight celebrates this yearly as it the price in the last year (of whose three winners I was one) did.</seg>
<seg>The winners of the last yearly had emphasized that different market players have different (and imperfect) information and that the inequality of their status of information has extensive effects on the function mode of the economy.</seg>
<seg>In particular the winners of the last yearly showed that markets generally efficiently and playing therefore an important role for the government does not remain working.</seg>
<seg>Adam Smiths invisible hand -- the conception that free markets lead as led from invisible hand to economy -- is not to be recognized, because there are not it, at least to part, there.</seg>
<seg>Also that is not for the anything new, which work day after day on the market make (and thus their fortunes that they draw advantages from the inequality of the market review for itself or thus that they overcome these).</seg>
<seg>For over twenty years so-called models of “rational market expectations” pull the economists into their spell. The models assume all market players status of information have the same (if already not a perfect) and perfectly rationally to act that the markets work perfectly efficiently, and that no unemployment it can give (if not greedy trade unions or governments such by the definition of minimum wages to cause); also a Kreditverknappung never occurs in them.</seg>
<seg>The fact that such models particularly predominate at the Universities of Americas despite all rebutting evidences shows also under also that ideology over science triumphiert.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately students of such structure study programs work now in many countries as politicians and try there due to conceptions, which go so far that one called them market fundamentalism to convert programs.</seg>
<seg>In order to say it completely clearly: The models of rational expectations contributed substantial to the economic theory; the consequence, with which its supporters applied it to economic thinking, helped to uncover, the weaknesses of many fundamental hypotheses.</seg>
<seg>Good science recognizes its own borders, but the prophets of the models of rational expectations do not show such a modesty usually.</seg>
<seg>Vernon Smith was a leader with the development of the experimental economics. You are the basis the idea that one can examine many economiceconomics statements in certain arrangements in the laboratory.</seg>
<seg>A reason for it that economics is a so difficult subject and that there is so little agreement among economists, agitates from there that economists would not drive through controlled experiments can.</seg>
<seg>Nature gives natural experiments. But so many things in most cases change so rapidly in them that it is often difficult to untangle which the cause for which was.</seg>
<seg>In principle we know in a laboratory controlled attempts would drive through and from it rather reliable conclusions to draw.</seg>
<seg>The critics of the experimental economics give to consider that the test subjects bring along ways of thinking, which are certain of outside of the attempt situation into the experimental situation. They mean that the experiments are not as clear from there not so cleanly and the conclusions from it as in the natural sciences.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless economic experiments provide insights into a number of important articles, like the improved handling of auctions.</seg>
<seg>The most important result was that the Irrationalität of the market players, which was located in the center of the work Kahnemans was confirmed repetitive in the context of laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg>To the rather amusing results those, which refer to Altruismus and self craze, belong to the experimental economics.</seg>
<seg>(Anyhow in experimental situations) that the test subjects are not so egoistic, like it the hypotheses of the economists show up presuppose - from it a group is exceptional - those of the economists themselves.</seg>
<seg>Is now like that, because the economics attracts individuals, who are by nature more egoistic as discipline, or because the economics to it contributes, to form and it makes the individuals more egoistic?</seg>
<seg>The answer is with large security: A little of both.</seg>
<seg>Probably future experimental research will help to each other solve the question about the weight of the two hypotheses in relation.</seg>
<seg>The Nobel Prize underlines, how important it is, people and whole managing in such a way, like it is, to study and not like that, as we would have it gladly.</seg>
<seg>Only if we understand the actual behavior of humans better, we can also hope to sketch a policy those effectuation that our managing better work.</seg>
<seg>Bush's bad intentions in the energy policy</seg>
<seg>In one of the surrealeren meetings of the World Economic Forum of this year in Davos experts explained from the oil industry that melting the pole caps -- faster happens, than it had forecast somebody -- not only a problem represents, but also a chance: Large quantities of oil are now perhaps accessible.</seg>
<seg>Likewise grant this experts, who fact that the United States the maritime law (the international convention, which certainly, who has entrance to offshore oil, and other rights to raw materials in the sea regulates) to have signed, do not represent a risk with international conflict potential.</seg>
<seg>But again they refer to the advantages: The oil industry does not have to ask the congress in its search for further oil reserves, never ending, for the right to pillage Alaska.</seg>
<seg>President George W. Bush has an uncanny gift to ignore the large message.</seg>
<seg>For years it becomes ever clearer that at its energy policy some is not correct.</seg>
<seg>Of an earlier energy law, which was dictated of the oil industry, even members of its own party said that “no lobbyist was forgotten therein.”</seg>
<seg>While it praises the advantages of the free market, Bush is only too gladly ready to give the energy industry enormous allowances even if high deficits are to the USA forthcoming.</seg>
<seg>The market fails in energy questions, but an intervention of the government should go exactly into the other direction, than the government Bush suggested it.</seg>
<seg>The fact that the Americans do not pay the full price for the environmental pollution, which results from its wasteful energy use -- particularly from their contribution to greenhouse gases -- , it means that energy under price is offered, which maintains again excessive consumption.</seg>
<seg>The government must promote environmental protection, interferences are into the price system -- by energy taxes -- an effective possibility.</seg>
<seg>But instead of environmental protection to promote, Bush pursued a policy, which leaches out America first and makes it still dependent in the future on foreign oil.</seg>
<seg>It is no matter to it that the large demand drives the oil prices up and for many in the Near East brings taking along gains, which do not rank among of Americas friends.</seg>
<seg>Now, over four years after the terrorist attacks from September 2001, Bush seems to have finally waked up in the reality of increasing dependence America; with oil prices the shooting up it was difficult for it not to notice the consequences.</seg>
<seg>But again the varying steps of its government will make the things only worse in next time.</seg>
<seg>Bush refuses still doing something for environmental protection and he equipped his constant prayer that the technology will save us, with very little money.</seg>
<seg>What is one to thus hold from Bush's recently explained obligation to make America within 25 years 75% independently of the oil from the Near East?</seg>
<seg>For investors the message is clear: Does not invest no more into the development of reserves in the Near East, the source of oil with the by far smallest costs of the world.</seg>
<seg>But without new investments into the development of the reserves in the Near East the ungezügelte increase of the energy consumption in the USA, China means elsewhere and that the demand will exceed the offer.</seg>
<seg>As that would not be enough, risks Bush with its threat to impose sanctions against Iran that it comes in the supply of one of the largest oil promoters of the world to interruptions.</seg>
<seg>Particularly since the world oil production achieved nearly its full capacity and the prices are than twice as high already more as before the Iraq war, this points to still higher profits for the oil fallow -- the only clear winner in Bush's Middle East policy.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless one should take it into account Bush that he recognized at least that there is a problem.</seg>
<seg>But, like always, a more exact view of its proposals points to a further bag player trick of its government.</seg>
<seg>To promote not enough that it refuses itself recognizing the meaning of global warming environmental protection or to put sufficient means to the research, in order to really change something -- also Bush's magnificent promise to reduce dependence on the oil from the Middle East has less meaning, than it seems.</seg>
<seg>Since only 20% of the US oil from the Near East come, it could achieve its goal by a slight misalignment of its purchase politics.</seg>
<seg>But one would think that the government Bush must surely notice that oil on a global market is acted.</seg>
<seg>Even if America were independent to 100% of the Middle East oil, a decrease of the oiling system from the Near East could have devastating effects on the world price -- and on the American economy.</seg>
<seg>Like so often at the government Bush does not give it a flatterful explanation for the official policy.</seg>
<seg>Does Bush make political equivocations, by giving support to anti-Arab and anti-Iranian feelings in America?</seg>
<seg>Or is this bare a further example of incompetence and disorder?</seg>
<seg>After what we saw in the last five years, the correct answer is probable that more than only little bad intentions and pure inability are in the play.</seg>
<seg>The Chinese Roadmap</seg>
<seg>China stands before the adoption of its eleventh Fünfjahresplans. Thus the way for the continuation of the probably most remarkable economic change in history is smoothed.</seg>
<seg>At the same time thereby the well-being issue is promoted almost a quarter of the world population. The world experienced so lasting growth never before and reduced one poverty in such extent never before.</seg>
<seg>Partial the long-term success of China is to be due to its almost singular combination of pragmatism and vision.</seg>
<seg>While a majority of the developing countries toward the Washington consent toward unrealistic increases of the Gross Domestic Product it was pushed China made clear again that it a nachhaltigeren and more fairly distributed rise of the standard of living aims at.</seg>
<seg>In China one that one reached a phase of the economic growth, recognizes it in that to enormous -- and intolerable -- Loads for the environment comes.</seg>
<seg>Without course changes the standard of living is in the long run endangered.</seg>
<seg>For this reason an emphasis of the new Fünfjahresplans is on environmental interests.</seg>
<seg>Even many of the rather backward areas of China grow in a speed, which would equal a miracle, if not different regions would grow still more rapidly.</seg>
<seg>While thereby the poverty could be reduced, however the inequality with the increasing differences between city and country as well as between coastal regions and the interior rose.</seg>
<seg>The development report of this year of the World Bank explains, why not only poverty, but also the inequality should be a request and in the eleventh Fünfjahresplan of China take one itself this problem decided on.</seg>
<seg>The government spoke about several years of a more harmonious society and the plan describes ambitious programs, in order to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg>In addition one recognizes in China that the difference between developing countries and better developed countries exists not only in a gap of resources, but in a gap of the knowledge.</seg>
<seg>Therefore one compiled bold plans in China to close not only in order this gap to create but also at a basis for independent innovations.</seg>
<seg>Of China role in the world and the world economy changed and on this fact also in this Fünfjahresplan consideration was taken.</seg>
<seg>Future growth will be based not so much on exports, but on the home demand, from which the necessity results for the setting in motion of consumption in motion.</seg>
<seg>Actually China with a rare problem has to fight: with a surplus of savings.</seg>
<seg>Humans in China partly save due to the weaknesses in the national social security system. A stabilization of the social security (pensions) as well as the health and education system to the decrease of social inequalities will at the same time contribute, the feeling of the well-being issue with the citizens will improve and present consumption in motion will set.</seg>
<seg>That succeeds -- and up to now China nearly always exceeded even its own high-put expectations -- these adjustments could lead to enormous loads for a world economic system, which is anyway already unbalanced by the enormous American household and deficits on the balance of payments on current account.</seg>
<seg>If in China one saves less - and if one, as announced from public side, pursues a more broadly diversified strategy for the investment of its reserves -- who become then does the American deficit on the balance of payments on current account from daily over 2 billion dollar financiers?</seg>
<seg>This topic is momentarily not current, but it could be soon so far.</seg>
<seg>Despite the clear visions of the future the challenge lies in the conversion of the strategy.</seg>
<seg>China is not an enormous country and it would have so far come, if there were no wide-spread decentralization.</seg>
<seg>However own problems result from the decentralization.</seg>
<seg>Greenhouse gases for example are a global problem.</seg>
<seg>While America means, it cannot afford to undertake somewhat against it the Chinese decision makers more responsibly acted.</seg>
<seg>Within one month after acceptance of the plan new environmental taxes were introduced on cars, gasoline and wood products: China used thus market-based mechanisms, in order to get the environmental problems of the country and the world into the grasp.</seg>
<seg>The pressure on local government official to produce economic growth and job will be however enormous.</seg>
<seg>They will be subject to the all-largest temptation to say if America already cannot afford a environmentalcareful production, how are in China to then function?</seg>
<seg>Around visions in acts to convert, the Chinese government will need good strategies, as for example the environmental taxes already introduced.</seg>
<seg>With the development of China toward free-market economy, problems resulted for the country, with which also industrialized countries have to fight: Particularist interests, which veil egoistic arguments behind a thin veil from market ideology.</seg>
<seg>Some become for the “Trickle down Economy so called”, enter, for a system thus, with which the prosperity is to ooze from top to bottom: One does not make oneself around for arms concerns, because in the long run all will profit from the economic growth.</seg>
<seg>Others again will turn against competitive policy and strict management laws: One lets Darwins selection theory their miracles achieve only.</seg>
<seg>In order to advance toward strong social and environmentalpolitical strategies, growth arguments are stated: higher fuel taxes, for example, would destroy our budding automobile industry.</seg>
<seg>With such, one would bring not only no growth to alleged growth oriented strategies, but also would threaten the entire vision of the Chinese future.</seg>
<seg>There is only one way to prevent: Open discussions over politico-economic strategies, in order to expose mistakes and to find clearance for creative solutions to the many challenges, with which China is confronted today.</seg>
<seg>With George W. Bush the dangers of excessive secrecy and decision making showed up within a small circle of Kriechern.</seg>
<seg>Extent of the expanded discussions and consultation of the Chinese guidance (even with foreigners) in its effort around solutions for the enormous problems, the contradicting Bush's tactics, however by most humans outside of China one does not really goutiert.</seg>
<seg>Do not market-keep house adjust themselves automatically.</seg>
<seg>One cannot place it simply on autopilot, above all not if the advantages are to obtain as large a broad effect as possible.</seg>
<seg>The management of a free-market economy however is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg>It is rather a balancing act, with which one has to react permanently to economic changes.</seg>
<seg>The eleventh Fünfjahresplan of China is a Roadmap for it how these reactions have to look.</seg>
<seg>Die Welt looks in reverence and hope for China, as the life of 1.3 billion humans will continue to change.</seg>
<seg>Tocquevilles democratic teachings</seg>
<seg>It appears only appropriate that the world debates today, 200 years after the birth Alexis de Tocquevilles, due to the war in Iraq the nature of the democracy.</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville is entitled the fame for the fact that he rejected the reactionary longing after offence and regarded the triumph of the democracy as our fate -- and before the dangers warned at the same time, which the democracy for the freedom represents.</seg>
<seg>Should we divide its fears still?</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville regarded the democracy not alone as political rule form, but primarily as intellectual order system that generally forms the habits and habits of a society. Thus it lent a sociological and psychological dimension to the term.</seg>
<seg>Democratic systems, then argued Tocqueville, determine our thoughts, desires and passions.</seg>
<seg>Exactly like the Renaissance one and, in 20. Century, homo sovieticus is “democratic humans” a form human Seins.</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville was the opinion that the systemic effects of the democracy can lead to the fact that the citizens refuse themselves to the reason.</seg>
<seg>They would only give then to judge events and values independently to however only take over in truth the raw and simplizistischen opinions of the masses.</seg>
<seg>Is probably most pronounced actually, which on the opinion called Tocqueville the grasp of “social power”, in democratic systems -- a viewpoint, which takes the increase of the Demagogie and medium manipulation of the modern trend in front.</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville believed that it does not give on a long-term basis effective possibilities for the restriction of this tendency.</seg>
<seg>Neither local democracy nor small societies, mutual national control functions still civil rights could stop the fall of critical thinking, which the democracy seemed to cause.</seg>
<seg>Schools could be little more than enclaves within the decomposing power of the social influences on the function of thinking.</seg>
<seg>In similar way it exists even if Tocqueville believed that a striving for virtue in the sense the antiquity or a religious faith sometimes raise the soul, a conflict between both and the democratic ideal, if they were officially ordered regarding the public life.</seg>
<seg>In this sense to Tocquevilles for instance the neomarxistischen theoreticians of the Frankfurt school as well as Hannah Arendt, which were afraid all above all different the decay of the reason in modern societies, belong to mental inheriting.</seg>
<seg>The French philosopher Marcel Gauchet actually gave démocratie contre inch même (the democracy against itself) to a recently published book the title La.</seg>
<seg>The democratic way of life, then these authors argue, are inclined to destroy independent thinking and to suppress the “advanced culture”; the result is a mediocrity, which makes the citizens susceptibly in relation to the enemies of the democracy.</seg>
<seg>But while the history of murderous Regimen, which intimidated and deceived masses zujubelten, strotzt only in such a way, the larger danger for democratic nations consists of the fact that their citizens withdraw themselves in favor of a direct need satisfaction into apathy and short term thinking.</seg>
<seg>The past becomes -- despite the rituals, which aim at a memory of historical moments -- smeared by a craze after the now and after the new one.</seg>
<seg>Even the allegedly formed dominant class is subject this Betörung.</seg>
<seg>The central problem of the democratic spirit is its lack of historical consciousness.</seg>
<seg>Really mean the deficits of the democracy that, like Tocqueville stated, the only one -- realistic however those which can be received not upright -- Away, which stands for us openly, a fate-devoted pessimism is?</seg>
<seg>I am not this opinion.</seg>
<seg>There are means, in order to fight, which one could call increasing “democratic stupidity” of our days.</seg>
<seg>The first line of defense is the effort around an education system, which brings really critical heads out, by (nowadays) the predominantly neglected subjects of the literature, history and philosophy.</seg>
<seg>_ if we want, that it inform and critical citizen consult, how/as the democracy they need, must our school stop, which in each case current feature approach and with begin, the analytic ability the pupil sharpen.</seg>
<seg>The largest obstacle on the way to this form of education are the mass media with their tendency for the cultivation of superficialness and scattering.</seg>
<seg>Many humans spend today a larger part of their life before the television than in the classroom.</seg>
<seg>The Passivität, to which the mass media encourage, stands in the diametric contrast to that active commitment, which distinguishes democratic citizens.</seg>
<seg>It falls however heavily to imagine that the mass media (refrained from fastidious daily papers) would become from own drive instruments of an education, the critical abilities of the citizens extended.</seg>
<seg>This concern regarding the mass media is not bare elitistische ignoring of the popular culture.</seg>
<seg>The question is not the popularity alone -- finally Mozart was popular at its time, and Shakespeares of plays attracted arms just like realms -- , but the refusal of the mass culture to provoke and provoke for thinking.</seg>
<seg>The result this omission is a general indifference and Passivität of the public.</seg>
<seg>Is actual one globalized medium culture, which is unable to promote the capability to critical thinking or cause higher feelings, already for a long time on the advance.</seg>
<seg>It is a culture, which threatens the democratic freedoms by its Achtlosigkeit, because she misses it to bring any form out of sense of responsibility -- it is in relation to the society, history or the community.</seg>
<seg>Is it too late to undertake something against a culture which kills the spirit in this way?</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville despised the elite of its time for its Selbstgefälligkeit in view of the entwurzelnden power of the mass democracy.</seg>
<seg>Will myopia also our leaders contribute to let its disturbing prophecy reality become?</seg>
<seg>Europe for all</seg>
<seg>Old-established members of the European union seem to doubt at present the future of the union, on the other hand we look in Ukraine with hope and admiration on the European union.</seg>
<seg>The fundamental goal of our foreign policy is it to participate on progressing the European Union because Ukraine stated that national unit does not represent a point of conclusion, but a beginning.</seg>
<seg>The European unit is indeed indivisible: If a nation is excluded, all are unfree.</seg>
<seg>We Europeans are unentrinnbar in a net imprisoned, our fates are with one another verwoben.</seg>
<seg>Each aspect of our common culture, if not the last century of common suffering confirms, us this.</seg>
<seg>Which concerns a European country directly, everything concerns indirectly.</seg>
<seg>We know us the close conception of two of Europe -- that the Betuchten and that the Habenichtse, that the chosen one and that the discharging -- never carry out again.</seg>
<seg>All, which live on the European continent, cannot do, them may not remain excluded from the union.</seg>
<seg>The present large European peace and the today's totalEuropean prosperity depend on it.</seg>
<seg>Of course some people murren that Ukraine is not Europe.</seg>
<seg>They are to come to Kiev and speak with humans, the young like the old, with factory hands, farmer women, lawyers, physicians and teachers, who were located and endured in the last winter for weeks in cold weather and in the snow, in order to defend their freedom.</seg>
<seg>Aren't they connected with those, the general de Gaulle in the French resistance assisted?</seg>
<seg>Aren't they one with those, which died with the fight for the Spanish republic into the 1930ern, which released Budapest 1956 and which fascism in Spain and Portugal terminated into the 1970ern?</seg>
<seg>Aren't they inspired by the same spirit as of Poland Solidarnosc movement and the peaceful masses, which brought 1989 out the Samtene revolution in Prague?</seg>
<seg>This is the true European spirit, and no doubts can break him.</seg>
<seg>Those, which mean, Ukraine is too backward for an European Union membership, says I: Also they are to come into my country and regard the mothers, who remain late in the evening at the work and to their children at their firm computer to explain, how one uses a computer.</seg>
<seg>They are to go into the language schools in each village and each city, in which young people prepare for Europe, by learning French, German and English.</seg>
<seg>Those, which doubt the European convicition Ukraine, should understand that Europe is not a question of the hardware and the motorways. It is the unstillbare demand for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.</seg>
<seg>I believe that our future is promising so much, as of Europe is proud past, and that we do not have our fate as forgotten borderland in a jerky region periods, but that we will codesign of Europe peace and unit as doers.</seg>
<seg>Self-determination is not equivalent any longer to isolation, because reaching national independence means today only the return to the world stage with a new status.</seg>
<seg>New nations can develop just as fruitful relationship with their former occupying forces as France to Germany -- a relationship, which is based on equal rights and mutual interests.</seg>
<seg>Such a relationship tries to develop my government to Russia, and by reaching this, we can contribute to the extension of the European area, in which prevails to peace.</seg>
<seg>Is natural it comes prematurely to do more to express than the high reputation which enjoys the prospect on an European Union membership with us.</seg>
<seg>We know that our part at this large building is not established over night.</seg>
<seg>We know that the large achievements of the European combination are to be found not in documents and explanations, but in innovative steps, which are to improve the life of all Europeans and ensure their security.</seg>
<seg>It will be to settle not simply, cheap or fast, an Ukraine will construct, which is worthy of the European Union membership.</seg>
<seg>But one will develop like the European Union it and one will complete.</seg>
<seg>We know that this represents a large challenge, but the price is worth the effort, and Europe should know that this is our goal.</seg>
<seg>The renewal work Ukraine consists partially of a creative fight, in order to terminate a nightmareful century, in fascism and communism -- Ideologies, which were born in the heart of Europe -- tried to achieve the upper hand.</seg>
<seg>Only few months ago our children and parents in cities faced everywhere in Ukraine armed troops, knurrenden dogs and even death.</seg>
<seg>The young journalist Georgi Gongadse, which wanted to clear the public up over the corruption of the old regime, was abused only a few years ago and cut back by the racquets of the regime.</seg>
<seg>But our Orangene revolution of the last winter shows that the Ukrainian people won.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I despite the today's doubts and difficulties remain with my unshakeable faith in Europe.</seg>
<seg>I refuse accepting despair as last answer to verworrene and cruel history Ukraine.</seg>
<seg>I refuse accepting the aspect that Ukraine is bound in so tragic way to the asteriskless night of the communist inheritance that we can never see the bright dawn of the peace and the true European unit.</seg>
<seg>If the European Union citizens think about the place Ukraine in Europe, they should look them behind the front, which they see, should them in addition, regard more exactly.</seg>
<seg>They should look past at the devastated wasteland, which communism caused, past at the poverty and the social differences, with those our cast-off former ruling powers tried, their mismanagement to extend.</seg>
<seg>Instead they should regard the face of our president Viktor Juschtschenko, which was disfigured last year in the election campaign by a poison attack, and of the words of the large Frenchman André Malraux to remind, for which “the most beautiful faces those are, injured themselves.”</seg>
<seg>The Muslim civil war</seg>
<seg>Is the gap between Sunnis and Shiites at present deeper in the Near East than the enmity between Israel and the Arabs?</seg>
<seg>In view of the reaction of some Arab governments to the decision the Hezbollah to attack Israel one could my.</seg>
<seg>Even as Israeli bombs on Beirut and Tyrus fell, condemned Saudi Arabia, perhaps the most conservative Arab-Muslim state of all, openly the acts the Shiite Hezbollah, which would have kindled the conflict with Israel.</seg>
<seg>Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict a state, which regards itself as a leader of the Arab-Muslim peoples, supported Israel so openly.</seg>
<seg>Beyond that is not of Saudi Arabia break with the Hezbollah an individual case.</seg>
<seg>Also Egypt and Jordan condemned those Hezbollah and her leader, sheikh Hassan Nasrallah decided for their Draufgängertum.</seg>
<seg>What is behind this amazing development?</seg>
<seg>Do we become witnesses of a fundamental change in the relationship between Arab nationalism and Islamic Sektierertum?</seg>
<seg>Does the Shiite Islam of the Sunni government of Saudi Arabia make more concerns and fear, than it feels obligated the Arab unit and the thing of the Palestinians?</seg>
<seg>The Arab condemnations the Hezbollah point to the fact that itself the gap between the Muslim denominations, which deepened in the daily force in Iraq already clearly, intensified in entire the Near East and.</seg>
<seg>President George W. Bush desire, the rigid societies of the Arab world, let should shake the modernization forces against the traditional elements in the Arab and Islamic societies begin.</seg>
<seg>Instead it seems to have provoked the atavistischsten forces of the region.</seg>
<seg>Opening this can of the Pandora could have rung in a new and still hässlichere era of the general force, perhaps can it only as “Muslim civil war” be designated.</seg>
<seg>The gap between Shiites and Sunnis existed since the beginnings of the Islam, but let step the geographical and ethnic isolation of not-Arab Shiite Iran as well as the rule of Sunni-Arab countries over its Shiite minorities this rivalry into the background.</seg>
<seg>The tensions separated far in the course of “islamizing”, which resulted from the Iranian revolution, because thus the denomination-bound identity of the Arabs as Sunnis into the background were continued to push, while a general “Islamic” self-confidence stepped out.</seg>
<seg>All changed, when Al Qaida, a Sunni terrorist group, attacked which took over much of the wahabitischen ideology and the personnel of the Saudis, in September 2001 America.</seg>
<seg>An expressly Sunni variant of the militant Islam now was on the advance.</seg>
<seg>The fact that the United States explained both the Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan and the Sunni Iraqi regime the war, encouraged this new, radical Sunni current only.</seg>
<seg>The recently self-confident Sunni Arabs notice Israel and the west as only a threat, the other one cover the “Shiite half-moon so called” -- the land sheet, which extends from Lebanon over Syria and Iraq up to Iran and is inhabited by the allegedly häretischen Shiites.</seg>
<seg>As guards of the holiest places of the Muslim faith in Mekka and Medina the rulers of Saudi Arabia feel this threat perhaps most passionately.</seg>
<seg>In the eyes of the Sunnis the Shiites do not only prevail over the oil-rich areas in Iran, Iraq and in the east Saudi Arabia, but they try also -- by the acts the Hezbollah -- to actually tear, the role of the “protector” of the central dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian question.</seg>
<seg>Because the Saudi royal house derives and the loyalty of its Shiite population doubts its legitimacy from a strict form of the Sunni Islam, the kingdom turned against the Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg>Ironically it was America, long time of Saudi Arabia Beschützer, which made the increase in power possible of the Shiites, by falling Saddam Hussein and bringing Shiite parties in Iraq to power.</seg>
<seg>The government Bush seems to recognize, what did it; while the Shiite sheet in the east of the Arab-Muslim world stretches, the USA try their protection of the Sunni sheet -- Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia -- to strengthen in the west of the region.</seg>
<seg>Israel, the once inexorable enemy of the Arab thing, seems in the middle to be embedded now into this defense structure.</seg>
<seg>But such a defense position is inevitably unstable due to pan-Arab feelings.</seg>
<seg>At present normal Saudi citizens before Al-Dschasira and other Arab satellite television stations stick, in order to along-pursue the events in the Gaza Strip and south Lebanon.</seg>
<seg>They see, how Arab (not Shiite) blood is poured and excluding the Hezbollah against it fights.</seg>
<seg>In its eyes those became Hezbollah a model for the heroful resistance.</seg>
<seg>This arranged the Saudi state to deepen splitting between Sunnis and Shiites.</seg>
<seg>After the kingdom had officially blamed the Hezbollah, the Saudi state called its official wahabitischen clerics to express Fatwas which condemn the Hezbollah as Shiite renegades and Häretiker.</seg>
<seg>Such condemnations can intensify only the konfessionellen dividing lines within Saudi Arabia and the region.</seg>
<seg>Will the Sunni regimes, if these contrasts deepen, arrive at the conviction that they need their own Hezbollah, in order to fight in their region?</seg>
<seg>If they should come at this conclusion, they need to search not for a long time, because many such fighter were already trained -- by Al Qaida.</seg>
<seg>Europe may not forget Georgia</seg>
<seg>The times, in which Europe could count on it that America in the backyard of Europe wars leads, closes peace and introduces the democracy, is past.</seg>
<seg>By the extension to be seen, belong to the European union and as also at the recent Russian gas crisis not only Ukraine to this backyard, but also Georgia.</seg>
<seg>Just like in Ukraine the democracy is put momentarily also in Georgia to the test and Europe cannot not afford it to ignore this development.</seg>
<seg>Georgia was the first post office-Soviet country, in which it came to a “colored revolution” and where humans its decision for democracy and European values with became and matured demonstrated.</seg>
<seg>The flags of the European union, which blow since then on all public buildings in Georgia, witness from a natural connection to Europe, which goes back as far as the history of a country, which since the time to ancient Greece a fixer a component that admitted of world at that time was.</seg>
<seg>Prometheus, Medea, which prove Amazonen and the ark Noah in neighbouring Armenia that European myths from here took their exit.</seg>
<seg>With its history, culture and its traditions -- among those also the critical, independent and even rebellious spirit from the days of the affiliation to the former Soviet Union ranks -- Georgia would be nevertheless the ideal candidate for a successful democratization.</seg>
<seg>It is the more precarious from there that this democratization does not succeed.</seg>
<seg>Everything had begun so well.</seg>
<seg>Political reforms, privatisation, anti-corruption measures, the search for new point politicians unloaded of connections with the earlier regime and the introduction of a per-European foreign policy encountered no resistance.</seg>
<seg>However the totalitarian attitude some leading politician steps today again to light, those under the pretext, the majority will too represented, ever more power actually tears.</seg>
<seg>Similarly the ancient Greek Hydra purchases also the political elite of Georgia again and again on the new.</seg>
<seg>Exactly those persons and rule practices, who one wanted to get rid with the “rose revolution” in November 2003, emerge now the shift levers of power. In addition they avail themselves of their networks extending beyond the borders of Georgia as well as their fantastischen wealth and their fate in political plot and manipulation.</seg>
<seg>That has to do few with actual democracy, which is characterized by division of power not only by elections, but also.</seg>
<seg>The government interferes into the affairs of the parliament, which tries again to steer the government work in the smallest detail -- in my case that was the attempt to determine nominating from Ambassadors and their routine of the day to!</seg>
<seg>A still more serious problem is judicial independence lacking, whereby the constitutional state undermined and urgently needed private investments are obstructed.</seg>
<seg>The Georgian democracy exists in the head, but not yet the hearts: humans despise the policy still as dirty business. Thus one leaves to those the terrain, which should actually have withdrawn themselves already long.</seg>
<seg>Hope for democracy is however in humans, the organizations of the citizen company and in the media deeply rooted.</seg>
<seg>Now it is located at Europe to ensure that this hope does not expire.</seg>
<seg>The USA already did all in their power, in order to support political stability in Georgia since its independence.</seg>
<seg>During the term of office of Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet minister of foreign affairs, who lost its presidential office during the rose revolution, was to be equated this stability naturally not always with democracy.</seg>
<seg>But the Americans invested generously into surviving democratic ideas and their Proponenten.</seg>
<seg>Although the rose revolution does not state as from Russian nationalists, the work of the foundation supported by financier George Soros was, these the democratic bases promoted certainly, encouraged and supported.</seg>
<seg>For the consolidation of its democracy Georgia needs however another kind of support, which can offer rather Europe.</seg>
<seg>The equilibrium of the forces, which must practice in law and local democracy following European models are arranged, those rather correspond to the Georgian reality as the anglo-saxon models of American development.</seg>
<seg>With a refusal of this challenge Europe its fundamental responsibility would mediterranen opposite a small, flexible country with old traditions would betray, where the democracy has a much larger chance on success than in the enormous and still very the Soviet spirit arrested Ukraine, from central Asia to be silent completely.</seg>
<seg>The refusal, Georgia in its fight for democracy to support would very probably retard the democratic process also in Ukraine, in Belarus and even in Russia.</seg>
<seg>It stands from there ever more on the play.</seg>
<seg>Although Russia its great power dreams and power instruments never abgeschworen had, one had to resign oneself to the inevitability of the democracy, at least at the borders.</seg>
<seg>But this hesitant acceptance of a certain normality in the relations with its neighbours was always already susceptibly to the sudden reoutbreak of Russia famous more irrational “Derschawa” -- an aggressive Ethos, which glorifiziert the state and refers its strength from the utilization of weaknesses of the others.</seg>
<seg>That is the key to understand the recent Russian gas crisis.</seg>
<seg>It is safe that each sign of a retreat of the democracy in Georgia and other post office-Soviet states of Russia will let neoimperialistische ambitions revive again.</seg>
<seg>It is the responsibility of Europe to convince Russia that there is no hope for a return to the past.</seg>
