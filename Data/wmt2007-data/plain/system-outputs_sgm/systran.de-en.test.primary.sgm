<seg>Our Charter of Fundamental Rights is first in this millennium.</seg>
<seg>We must succeed in making the European Union of the 15 Member States in such a way that we can take up the countries which are knocking on our door under appropriate conditions.</seg>
<seg>Article 87 must be incorporated into the area of general interest for social, cultural and charitable interests with, so that these important mechanisms can also be permanently protected.</seg>
<seg>There are some who think that we can create a single market in Europe, without dwelling on fundamental values and principles agreed.</seg>
<seg>For my part, I would like to welcome the clear and substantial speech by President Prodi.</seg>
<seg>As you know, it was decided in Amsterdam responsibly to separate the two roles and the High Representative is contrary to the Commission - not completely independently, but its task is the coordination of foreign and sicherheitspolitiken which fall within the competence of the Member States, and here we need to give a greater place of intergovernmental cooperation.</seg>
<seg>He expressed the wish that the Presidency in Nice points the way ahead.</seg>
<seg>One might wish a more extensive and better result was open, but I believe that we have made a good start.</seg>
<seg>I therefore that the European Council in Nice, this project it accepts and hope it will decide in concrete terms as project, not as a fait accompli to put into practice, of course, after the necessary reforms have been decided.</seg>
<seg>I have pointed out in concrete terms, however, that we can achieve very important objectives of the Community method in today's reality, such as, for example, a more effective action in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg>Only if we tie Russia to the West, and the European Union, we will be able to take effect on its policy and in contact with Russia and the debate will continue.</seg>
<seg>(b5-0767/00) resolution by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</seg>
<seg>In addition, it is at present this genocide and tries to eradicate media freedom and the rule of law in Russia, which are hardly exist.</seg>
<seg>In the expectations of the pensioners who are called Giuseppe Italia in Cremona, life and would like to drive on the Po with the ship, try to be fair, I voted in favour of the Piecyk report, which concerns the development and the development of the sea and inland ports and intermodal terminals.</seg>
<seg>The aim of the directive, which was recognized and supported by all the speakers, and the Commission is made by the result of the vote of the House unattainable.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I have, as I during the debate, before the vote, made it clear, for the Skinner report was already voted for risk capital, because I regard as very important.</seg>
<seg>My group colleague, Armonia Bordes was just yesterday of clear that only a minority is looking to use Community funds and pension contributions from contractor to cover the risks.</seg>
<seg>That is why the Charter is, rather, the current to reaffirm even rückschrittlichen practices of the national States it represents real progress.</seg>
<seg>Finally, Mr President, is a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European citizen on the table in which a whole article - Article 25, which elderly people are paid.</seg>
<seg>But if it received legally binding effect and to the Treaty have been adopted, as it calls for the European Parliament, with the time it inevitably to a standardization of the national law of the various European countries would do it would mean that the Court of Justice would receive a disproportionately large power that the centralization was strengthened by the European institutions and the independent powers of discretion of each people was restricted.</seg>
<seg>· an overload of the Charter with detailed regulation should remain reserved eliminated and these for secondary legislation.</seg>
<seg>I shall be voting in favour of a Charter, by taking part in the demonstrations on 13 and 14 October in Biarritz and in Nice on 7 December 2000.</seg>
<seg>Progress of the 12 candidate countries along the road to accession</seg>
<seg>I believe that a number of Member States have not yet understand that there is a link and the slow progress in the Intergovernmental Conference into great difficulty can bring to implement enlargement in the necessary period.</seg>
<seg>All we will only be able to achieve this, what I have spoken so far, in the long term if in the candidate countries, as well as in the European Union, the policy and the elite - and in this regard I give you very limited, Commissioner - finally to canvass for the fact that the enlargement of the European Union to benefit from them.</seg>
<seg>This is the general principle.</seg>
<seg>Let me now come to the second objective with which the Presidency intends to make the enlargement process forward during these six months.</seg>
<seg>I therefore propose working in this direction with the idea that we must examine in 2003, which countries are ready to join us on this date.</seg>
<seg>I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his very extensive and comprehensive report.</seg>
<seg>It is not in any way in the negotiations "" whether there should, it is only a question of 'how' and 'how much'.</seg>
<seg>But they did, because the prospect of membership of the European Union to give them hope for the solidarity of the European peoples and because this strong political and economic basis is offered to them.</seg>
<seg>A number of countries in the second economic criterion of competitiveness within the internal market as well as it advanced that they are quickly the readiness for accession.</seg>
<seg>We can therefore seek close coordination with the programmes of the national governments, the European Parliament and other institutions.</seg>
<seg>Each year, and that will soon, on 8 November, once more the case its - in each of the candidate countries with very great interest the Commission's opinion on the progress that has been made is expected of them.</seg>
<seg>It is right that we decided on the principle of differentiation, according to which each candidate country is judged according to its progress and services.</seg>
<seg>This debate is a further opportunity for my group to reaffirm that the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries and Cyprus and Malta, which are best secure future for all of us in Europe in the East and in the West.</seg>
<seg>This is a matter of the utmost importance, drawing attention in the public hardly.</seg>
<seg>Many believe jokingly that after the fall of the Berlin Wall remained the same time up to enlargement: five years.</seg>
<seg>The next natural opportunity in connection with the next elections to the European Parliament in the year 2009, but we want to try to ensure that as many countries as possible to join in 2004.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, there are six substantive issues, on which we have concerns about the method.</seg>
<seg>In fact it is the elected model of European unification, namely the simultaneous incorporation of all sectors, regardless of the traditions and characteristics of the parties, which leads to this impasse.</seg>
<seg>This in Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the 1980s, make sense to give all of us are fairly generally expressed today an obligation.</seg>
<seg>To name but about things very clear with the name there cannot be accessions to the off-peak rate.</seg>
<seg>It is a great and, at the same time, fine idea that we enlargements, not against the public good, and that is the best way to make the enlargements, in line with the public in its participation in the elections, because the elections are an expression of democracy and a form of involvement of citizens in the political system.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something briefly about the conditions for a scenario which has been requested here by several parties.</seg>
<seg>I would be surprised if they would not be pressure.</seg>
<seg>However, I have already pointed out that all countries are ready for membership are relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg>That is, the liberalisation of trade in the area of agricultural products is already made without Poland, who are concerned that the Polish agriculture collapses.</seg>
<seg>It has also been burdens, but peace and trade have the citizens of the countries of the Union closer brought. Monetary Union on the whole continue to strengthen this development.</seg>
<seg>The negotiation results should be used.</seg>
<seg>The only amendment that has been tabled is already included in my report, but I am pleased that the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance underlines the importance of equal treatment of citizens.</seg>
<seg>This includes not only the law in the public sector, but also that there are opportunities and adequate payment for young administrative officials.</seg>
<seg>This applies both to Latvia and to the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The involvement of the litas at the euro is planned for the second half of the year 2001.</seg>
<seg>. (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, for which I am the rapporteur, is the biggest and most important, but at the same time, we know the most problematic of the countries which are preparing for accession to the European Union; it is such a multitude of problems that there are even rumours about a possible exclusion of Poland in the first group, the group of countries acceding first.</seg>
<seg>As Poland and the Eastern, formerly too many promises, was what we did not keep to Communist countries.</seg>
<seg>If one point, again and again, is that when it comes to the Czech Republic, emerges. that is the problem of the Roma.</seg>
<seg>Slovakia has not been included in the second group, and logically it would like to join at the same time with the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg>Finally, I, at the same time, another one comment on the domestic policy.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, the agriculture sector affected, whose levels of productivity in the European Union is still in that, then it will be necessary, the agricultural market completely for the privatisation of land to open modernisation of farms and distribution structures and to increase the necessary capital income.</seg>
<seg>Bulgaria is very much for accession to the European Union and NATO.</seg>
<seg>Since 1990, the acute poverty is one of the most serious problems of Romania, but is under the present government that the economic situation is the better one.</seg>
<seg>I hope that these issues will be priorities in 14 days of assembling the new Parliament and the Slovenian government.</seg>
<seg>It must be emphasised, however, that a final fair and lasting solution must take into account both the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council, in other words, nothing but existing international law, as well as the European Union at the underlying principles.</seg>
<seg>Malta has moreover, stable functioning democratic institutions.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would like to play our part in this debate.</seg>
<seg>They must also be implemented the European Community law are not just law in the books, but also in the candidate States law in action.</seg>
<seg>In addition, this change makes heavy demands on people in the applicant countries at the same time ensuring their future, and the future of their children.</seg>
<seg>Special attention - and I agree with the previous speaker on is on the border regions to be set.</seg>
<seg>The Commission must not be left alone in this context.</seg>
<seg>The applicant countries are looking for a rapid economic growth, even if this is to the detriment of nature conservation policy has already mentioned.</seg>
<seg>There has been a change of bad habits, including in the field of health.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, enlargement is essential for the establishment of a strong and united European continent.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, which is responsible for the area of transport and the trans-European networks are aware of the need to coordinate the various sectoral Community policies in favour of a global regional planning policy.</seg>
<seg>However, before any reference to the fact that the transport infrastructure of central importance to the success of enlargement will be.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I would like to join those who see the main task of the European Union in the forthcoming enlargement.</seg>
<seg>In the former planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe on the traditional social values considerable pressure is brought to bear.</seg>
<seg>The PPE Group would not want to take responsibility for the accession of the speed of the candidate countries, because we cannot establish an accession date.</seg>
<seg>The second point is the inclusion of data.</seg>
<seg>There is another reason.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, the adoption of the enlargement and its positive prospects for the individual countries and for the European Union as a whole depend - and this has been considerably Denmark - on the fact that the social and democratic deficits of European policy is being reduced.</seg>
<seg>down-appreciating populism is the designation of technocrats people will stigmatizing when he expresses himself in a way which does not suit them.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and gentlemen, you have food and recovery, break it go further at 9 p.m.</seg>
<seg>It will be, albeit in the long term, a common currency for the whole continent.</seg>
<seg>These issues' internal arguments in the individual countries are opened up.</seg>
<seg>We demand it to the fight for a different Europe, a Europe of the peoples, which is released from this inhuman stigmata, in that all peoples to decide their own destiny and amongst themselves relations of peace, freedom, brotherliness and cooperation can make to the mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg>I would like to pay tribute to the work of these organisations that places, including to include, in particular, the Romanian challenge appeal which have its headquarters in Birmingham, as well as organisations in Ireland, which are supported by many people, including from the Irish maintenance artist Daniel p.m. donnell which a donation of EUR 1 million pounds committed and this sum. in Ireland and other parts of the world gathered.</seg>
<seg>The summit in Nice must above all be clarity in time to become capable of enlargement, whether and how the European Union can stand up for its part in the position and even wider.</seg>
<seg>Poland ask: are you have paid when we, ourselves, or should we second-class countries?</seg>
<seg>I am that, with good will and with the help of the European Union a solution can be found, the two communities harmonious coexistence and live in prosperity possible, as this was the case, for many centuries sure.</seg>
<seg>We are also concerned about the question of minorities, because the issue of the integration of these minorities, their linguistic integration in these countries is also important.</seg>
<seg>The conditions for membership is compliance with the basic criteria of Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg>We have heard a lot about the benefits of enlargement, but that is an area where we can learn from Lithuania.</seg>
<seg>Imagine, we would like to see all!</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to thank Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs and to congratulate her, but I would like to concentrate mainly on Slovakia, in particular on the minority policy.</seg>
<seg>I urge you to set a date in Nice, when you with the most advanced candidate countries, without naming - intend to put an end to the negotiations.</seg>
<seg>The European Union must help Bulgaria still on their way to enter the Union and, of course, ensure that the planning of this aid will take place more decentralised.</seg>
<seg>The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of civil society, the government and Parliament plays an important and - as we say - positive role.</seg>
<seg>We are about to overcome the division of Europe and not create new.</seg>
<seg>All of this is contained in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, and I thank her warmly on behalf of our group, for this report.</seg>
<seg>According to this understanding Cyprus should be, in my view, the issue is that of Europe's ability to accept political reality will decide.</seg>
<seg>I live close to the Baltic, which is a common concern for all of us.</seg>
<seg>The political vision remains.</seg>
<seg>We therefore have the desire of Hänsch with particular glad to note that, for the PSE Group said that the Commission should give a real evaluation of the effects of enlargement and the economic consequences if it does not come to enlargement.</seg>
<seg>I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling that it will not work without transitional periods in the interests of both parties, and it is precisely as Member for a border region, with Mrs Schierhuber as a farm in the vicinity of the Czech border, it is my concern that developing close common economic area without any major problems can be tackled and a positive result on both sides leads.</seg>
<seg>I would like to emphasise three points, as a Social Democrat.</seg>
<seg>questions first pillar gives containing EEA economy in applicant countries access to the internal market, which has demonstrated youth and science for legal exchange change, the European Union, on the other hand, however, not yet to extend their system of agricultural subsidies, since these countries from the EEA agreement would be positive incentives, in particular for the economies of the candidate countries - they need growth in order to make their society for the accession fit - as well as for the economy in the European Union, if it is estimated that the cost of enlargement is even two thirds of economic growth in the EEA model, possibly even more.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, you yourself Bangemann discharge of big idea to accept many of the candidate countries at the same time, this would contradict the principle to include every country according to its progress.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, we must do everything in our power to draw up to 2003, the European Union in the sense of the great speech by the President of the Commission Prodi for the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg>I want to address the relationship in the context parliament/advice by pointing out that, in the meantime, there are major delays in reply to written questions.</seg>
<seg>It is true concern that this is happening in a country which wishes to join the European Union.</seg>
<seg>I request that the report be referred back to committee, in which the necessary steps are to be drawn up.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, today, we shall be a total of three reports on this subject, including two of me, discuss and perhaps to vote on it.</seg>
<seg>That would affect all stages of the food chain favourable.</seg>
<seg>Safe food resources in the entire chain costs.</seg>
<seg>We must therefore agree with Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and include the ban on mixing so that animal feed more will certainly and European consumers are properly protected.</seg>
<seg>The 1999 directive has been well thought through and it can register still a success because there could be reduced burdens.</seg>
<seg>But then simply to allow a mixture, is not the solution.</seg>
<seg>Very briefly, we must insist on the Amendment No 37, concerning the dioxin problem.</seg>
<seg>On this point we are an opinion.</seg>
<seg>As a result we will buy meat, milk and their products which are not made on the world markets by no means the emerging and appropriate feed limits laid down by the Union as European consumers further, namely in a system in which raw materials on the world markets is acquired, where each material or any preparations can be mixed unhindered, before the products are introduced into the territory of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Before the second reading, the Commission should inform us of the planned procedures for risk assessment.</seg>
<seg>However, it would be fatal if, for example, Amendments Nos 39 and 40 were adopted, since there will no longer be possible for Member States to intervene with newly discovered dangers quickly.</seg>
<seg>Consumer protection begins with the animal feed in feed ingredients, defining and finally official controls.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Paulsen on the undesirable substances to feed animals is an important issue, which is a highly controversial, like all the important issues.</seg>
<seg>The debate on the excellent report by Mrs Paulsen, who is present here today was highly emotional on some points, and following the current debate we must surely go out to the feedingstuffs industry strict conditions apply but later, the quality of mixtures may be amended.</seg>
<seg>Each of these three proposals will contribute, both individually and in joint cooperation to the removal of the most significant shortcomings, which came to light by the dioxin crisis.</seg>
<seg>Amendment No 33 the re-exportation should be prevented by feed shares which do not meet the requirements of this directive in the exporting third country.</seg>
<seg>The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 41 and 42, 43 and 44, which has proposed introducing the possibility of dilution of contaminated animal feed raw materials under certain conditions.</seg>
<seg>This should be sufficient in view of our promise that we will create a system for the rapid exchange of information within the framework of the new proposal on the creation of a food authority, which will be the whole of the food and feed chain off.</seg>
<seg>Commissioner Byrne, with this directive on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs corresponds in fact our old problem, namely the question of open declaration.</seg>
<seg>and for me that is already the profits of the present in the morning.</seg>
<seg>Because if we were to do that if we were to implement it quickly and quickly to go through the codecision procedure, it is certainly a great benefit, and I am sure that we in the Council will be very strong and united.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the future too, at least, can occur, but it is not impossible that contaminated basic products enter into animal feed.</seg>
<seg>The BSE scandal was the worst, most well-known example.</seg>
<seg>As our rapporteur said, it would be extremely useful if we had a label with open declaration, is on the list of ingredients.</seg>
<seg>I think that the technical skills and the judgement of the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in relation to agriculture and also in relation to animal feed is clear, in the sense of a practical and workable solution, which is to be used and understood by the farmers and consumers concerned.</seg>
<seg>So far, the positive part.</seg>
<seg>I see this as a legitimate right to information, which we must take into account.</seg>
<seg>On behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, I would ask you, Madam President, the relatives of the victims of Brittany and the local authorities to be conveyed by Marin, Galicia, where most of the victims, the sympathy of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg>(Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg>- would like someone to speak out against the tabling of this oral amendment?</seg>
<seg>The rapporteur has explained to us the state of affairs.</seg>
<seg>Most of the technical proposals deserve our firm support, as for example in the area of food safety, decommissioning of nuclear power stations in the first generation, environmental protection and the fight against dumping, the essential code of conduct for companies from the West, active in the East, and much more besides. these tasks are enormous and therefore absolutely priority.</seg>
<seg>At the same time continue to be dealt with considerable difficulties, particularly in the area of the budget.</seg>
<seg>An extension of 13 countries does not only change the geopolitical context of the European Union, but it has also changed their structure, because on the one hand, the population will increase (+ 28%), on the other hand, however, the number “disadvantaged” regions.</seg>
<seg>It is to be noted that in the candidate countries a competitive agriculture and food production will be because of its high economic and social importance for the successful transformation and restructuring process of crucial importance.</seg>
<seg>In this context, I would like to express the wish that the outermost regions, which are the poorest six of the seven European Union among the ten receive Structural Funds alone, not only because of the GDP criterion, but also because of the geographical, demographic and, above all, social indicators.</seg>
<seg>We reject this Europe in the interests of the French, we can its enlargement to the countries of the East and peoples who are exempt from the Communist dictatorship and cannot just yet know, over the technocratic and totalitarian trap them with this step will fall not in good conscience to agree.</seg>
<seg>We would have it with the reports on the situation in the countries and in at most a brief, concise decision stop there to be transferred.</seg>
<seg>The system of subsidies, subsidies and quotas currently practised must be replaced by free trade and adapting to the market.</seg>
<seg>The importance and significance of the problems which enlargement brings do not deal with the deviousness, to discuss it in the European Union we are talking about.</seg>
<seg>to talk about enlargement does not mean for me to confirm membership of certain countries to Europe or not.</seg>
<seg>our neighbouring country determined efforts over the last ten years for fulfilling the accession criteria.</seg>
<seg>Latvia has its place in this House, not only because its overall, the right to this “confidence advance” sees progress gives, which is essential for a successful conclusion of these negotiations, but also, above all, because it is at home in Europe.</seg>
<seg>I believe that Poland, the state which deserve our support and commitment from all the applicant countries hardest, because without the extremely important initiatives of Poland communism would not have been brought to the case and we would not be here today, in order to deal with this problem.</seg>
<seg>The Polish people, who is still largely of Eurosceptics, this might not apply in the same way.</seg>
<seg>I appeal to Prague, this signal, to respond to this request, to take up this amendment dialogue and to ensure, together with this House that this legacy of a nationalist era can be overcome.</seg>
<seg>. I welcome the report by Mr Wiersma on Slovakia's application for accession to the European Union and to the largest part of its conclusions support.</seg>
<seg>with great pleasure that I offer on this occasion, the elderly and pensioners of the Republic of Bulgaria my special greeting.</seg>
<seg>Even if Romania make further progress and the European Union adapted their institutional structures and policies in order to be able to cope with enlargement, I do not see why it should not be included in the Union.</seg>
<seg>The position expressed in the report is clearly too hard, but a solution to the problem of the settlers could look, which is extremely difficult, as well as the country return for both sides.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, a number of statements, which are contained in the Republic of Cyprus on accession to the European Union in the draft report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal, it is not helpful.</seg>
<seg>In view of the lack of good intentions of the Turkish Cypriot ethnic group and Turkey that will be no easy task.</seg>
<seg>Stenzel report (a5-0243/2000)</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, I was the victim of an easy food poisoning, although I fatal-proved in the European Parliament had been streamlined.</seg>
<seg>For all these reasons, I voted in favour of the ban on mixing proposed by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg>We must urge the ASEM countries in this resolution to put pressure on the military regime in Burma to ensure that democracy is restored there.</seg>
<seg>We are not being consistent in our approach and in the implementation of the measures.</seg>
<seg>Now is not the time for small courage and despair.</seg>
<seg>A number of important points in the regulation are firstly, regulation of the burden of proof.</seg>
<seg>Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>So are the reasons why we need legislation to combat discrimination.</seg>
<seg>and also because of its us now specializedlegal many amendments have been tabled by the same level of protection against discrimination on the grounds of race, on the one hand, and on the grounds of religion, disability, age or sexual orientation is to ensure, on the other hand.</seg>
<seg>It had to be trying to achieve a balance, prudence and a good legal technology, and his report reflects, in my opinion, these qualities.</seg>
<seg>In addition, they are members of the view that discrimination is not so much that special legislation will issue.</seg>
<seg>The funding for the programme is not enough to be guaranteed in order to replace the work, those in the fifth framework programme is implemented, and I hope, in other resumed. framework programmes it is our task over the cross-border cooperation programme.</seg>
<seg>on the need to combat discrimination, there is general agreement on how to mass and by what means, the opinions are divided.</seg>
<seg>In the committee, I had the opportunity to resist me that experts can come to speak, who is no NGOs.</seg>
<seg>We also welcome the directive to a large extent regulation, which also means equal treatment for disabled people that appropriate adjustments in the workplace are provided by the companies.</seg>
<seg>We put it in such a way to fight discrimination in all areas of human coexistence in Europe effectively.</seg>
<seg>All in all, the great Anglo-Saxon democracies have taught us that racism and discrimination, with the help of liberal democracy and not by the restriction and gradual watering-down of freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of association and the economic freedoms are opposed.</seg>
<seg>In a proposal, the equal treatment of homosexuals in the holy marriage is called for.</seg>
<seg>In this way, the European Union in specific cases in which this is discrimination or the equal treatment of its citizens, can take a clear position.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to deal with the question of the exception of religion.</seg>
<seg>concerns have been expressed from various sides on the potential interpretation of the explanatory statement to Article 1, which is still somewhat unclear, but between sexual orientation and sexual behaviour are different.</seg>
<seg>In this way, a hierarchy of types of discrimination arises.</seg>
<seg>In neukaledonien is due to the skin colour in receipt of benefits.</seg>
<seg>Together with the recently adopted directive 2000 this adjustment of the directive is the declared determination of the European Union have to face an open society which is free from hackneyed ideas models, and especially from the stigma of racism entrenched in European history.</seg>
<seg>So those who say here in this Parliament, the values which we all want to defend, need to be enshrined in a European directive are to be mistaken.</seg>
<seg>These hard produced results must not be touched.</seg>
<seg>Finally, an important role of the media in this task.</seg>
<seg>Experience has also taught us that the promotion of legislative proposals on the fight against discrimination is essential, but not enough.</seg>
<seg>We must prevent a pointless bureaucratic disorder which Europe has been restricted to a purely materialistic, politically correct Community without deeper sense.</seg>
<seg>In my view, this Parliament decorated actually reserved legislation which wanted to propose to the European Commission to a Christmas tree.</seg>
<seg>Allow me first of all to the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, to thank two excellent reports.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, I can accept your amendments, by both the importance of prevention and combating discrimination must be underlined.</seg>
<seg>The second category aims to make the text of the Commission's proposal substantive while the third category consists of a large number of amendments to this proposal in line with in June last year adopted directive against racial discrimination to be introduced.</seg>
<seg>In particular, in Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 proposes deleting the reference to discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg>I know your reference to Amendments Nos 21 and 45 to natural and legal persons and did not not-formalize groups of people not to approve, as this proposal is about the employment only to individuals.</seg>
<seg>The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.</seg>
<seg>We cannot expect public support for peacemaking operations, if our troops are threatened with the weapons which we ourselves have delivered.</seg>
<seg>In my own country, I could not even without permission buying a shotgun, while I did not need any approval to the opening of an arms trafficking in my garden shed.</seg>
<seg>Another important point is the ban on exports, promotion and marketing of equipment or know-how which provides primarily for purposes of torture.</seg>
<seg>Having said that, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Titley, on his excellent report, of course.</seg>
<seg>Apart from the importance of the commitment we must extend our view on the one hand as priorities, aimed at military action directly, since disarmament, implementation, intensification of the work of the police and customs authorities and, on the other hand, since the candidate countries mentioned by Mr Wiersma.</seg>
<seg>If the money circulation was inspected, then it would be much more difficult to evade the rules governing the sale of arms.</seg>
<seg>The aim of the annual review is to identify such potential improvements.</seg>
<seg>The European Union is currently examining whether this project can be continued beyond the scale of the project, which result in November of this year.</seg>
<seg>A methodology and indicators were established which are introduced at the next Council of Ministers for Research.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, Mr Busquin.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the problems of the SMEs, of course, we have to ensure that the SMEs, as provided for in the budget decision is taken into consideration in the framework programme properly.</seg>
<seg>This seems to out-crystallize at least from the debate on the budget in Greece, and many even specifying the attitude of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the multidisciplinary nature, I share your concern.</seg>
<seg>The first point which he mentioned specifically in its declaration, the participation of the European Union in national programmes.</seg>
<seg>Therefore we could not speak of a European research area if we finance only 5% of the research budget.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, Mr Busquin.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, was due to the efforts to secure the funds until the end of 1999 at the very beginning of this financial year, the number of the amendments we are to vote for the financing of new projects correspondingly low.</seg>
<seg>However, I would like to point out again that Portugal met all the previous period to our satisfaction.</seg>
<seg>Question No 2 by (h-0730/00):</seg>
<seg>The definition of the oil tax at a high level, does not mean that the Community competition rules are not respected.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, Mr MacCormick will know the following: to encourage the Member States with fiscal means a certain industrial sector, violate them the rules on state aid, in this case fiscal aid that roughly equal subsidies.</seg>
<seg>a clear case is, for example, the nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg>Subject: the euro and budget line minority languages have achieved since 1983 existing budgetary allocation of the European Union in favour of minority languages until 1995 a constant increase in the year its highest level with 4 million.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I am sure you know colleagues in Parliament that the Structural Funds - and this is new - show a great deal of money for cultural activities, because I insisted, together with Commissioner Barnier that the Structural Funds invest not only in roads and in airports but also in people.</seg>
<seg>That is why the Commission will enter into next year, no further financial commitments.</seg>
<seg>As far as specific proposals for financing, then I cannot take a position on this subject since we must accept the usual across-the-board approach.</seg>
<seg>I consider other possibilities.</seg>
<seg>And it applies to prevent, because we are talking here about millions of small and medium-sized enterprises throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg>Do the provisions concerning the elk hunting, the treatment of the meat intended for energy consumption on hunting, for example?</seg>
<seg>If we were to apply the provisions on meat from animals hunted for internal demand, a bureaucratic disaster intended for the elk hunting.</seg>
<seg>At the end of this report, I intend to present proposals to improve the transport transports. this with the problem of inadequate enforcement of travelling time limits will respond.</seg>
<seg>We discussed this issue before at my meeting with the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance.</seg>
<seg>Our question is: what measures does the Commission intend to take?</seg>
<seg>General product safety obliges the manufacturers to clear up their customers about the possible risks.</seg>
<seg>The case of Maryam ayubi is extremely worrying.</seg>
<seg>Question No 14 by (h-0745/00):</seg>
<seg>The attitude of the European Union in this sitting on ministerialebene in Vientiane, including, of course, in relation to the question of whether it should take place at all or the level at which the European Union should be represented on the developments in Burma by December will be dependent.</seg>
<seg>One last comment.</seg>
<seg>The elections are an important step in the involvement of the inhabitants of Kosovo in the organisation of their communities.</seg>
<seg>I can assure you that these elections was more democratically and better than elections held in our countries, where I was often or to which I, as an observer, was present.</seg>
<seg>However, we did not see it as a beginning, under any circumstances, as the end of the process.</seg>
<seg>it more efficient and more coherent control of the arms trade, as well as greater transparency is approved.</seg>
<seg>Now I see that every year, more supply contracts for weapons and software is closed.</seg>
<seg>On the basis of false information, virtual realities we cannot make relevant decisions.</seg>
<seg>The regulation with which these activities have been made and the same Directorate-General, should be reviewed.</seg>
<seg>These bodies must have the possibility of using an internal auditor, however, it would be sufficient to make for the financial controller certain minimum requirements for the Court, the condition.</seg>
<seg>With this proposal, as the Commissioner well knows, in Parliament not unanimous agreement.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, I have nothing against an independent internal audit service, for which we are giving the green light today, in the van Hulten report by Mr!</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg>We are of the opinion that the modernisation of administration is urgently needed.</seg>
<seg>An independent gegenprüfung is essential in order to avoid errors.</seg>
<seg>The money is to be spent in the future more effectively and more effectively, and this is, of course, also be better to ensure that the funds are used for the purposes for which it was envisaged by the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg>Now to the proposed amendments to the following: the introduction of this additional recital the Commission agrees.</seg>
<seg>I would therefore like to thank you for your comments and your advice.</seg>
<seg>I would like to sum up the proposals in this report which, in my view, are the most important and most effective firstly, establishment of a group of experts from the Member States is appointed senior figures up to generally recognised for defining parameter for the protection of minors in the media, secondly, to contribute; introduction of a selbstkontroll code by all the television companies; three: the possibility of promotion and access to filter systems, both for the television and the Internet.</seg>
<seg>I cannot agree with the demands of the Liberals, unfortunately.</seg>
<seg>It is and remains primarily a task of the legislation of the Member States, which does not rule out a konsensuale communication on certain parameters in the dialogue with all those involved at European level by any means.</seg>
<seg>Under the circumstances, in my view, it is the task of parents to protect their children at home this type of programmes.</seg>
<seg>Parents are particularly dependent on aid in this field, it must include the following: parameters for the protection of minors in the media throughout the territory of the European Union, the appointment and economic availability of filter systems, legislation on the protection of minors and the responsibility of the media, companies and operators in the private and in the public sector.</seg>
<seg>If, during debates in committee some people say that there is no evidence of the negative impact of the various forms of violence on television on children, I am surprised and see this as a serious limitation.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the introduction of a selbstkontroll code, it should be noted, particularly in technical terms that broadcasters in some Member States have already produced a control code for television, which will make it possible to switch off their television.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>Above all, in my report is commendable generalisations are replaced the power of decision by the return to the Member States.</seg>
<seg>That is the least that we can do in order to ensure the area of freedom, which is a fundamental right of every European citizen.</seg>
<seg>There are still payment arrears in 1996.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like the rapporteurs, Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani, thank for her work.</seg>
<seg>I commend this report to the House and to support the adoption of Mr Evans of put forward amendments.</seg>
<seg>Our human resources are our sole future in a world in which everything is knowledge.</seg>
<seg>And I know many: it does not solve the problems of green and white and black or red books, but by means of specific measures.</seg>
<seg>But Parliament has fulfilled its role and putting pressure so that researchers are acceptable, in the text.</seg>
<seg>Their current visit takes place at a time which is of great importance for the future of European integration.</seg>
<seg>However, we know that this process is not yet complete, and therefore runs the risk of losing their vitality.</seg>
<seg>If we do not now, in this difficult and stormy transition phase of European and international history, when we are going to manage it?</seg>
<seg>None of us can today to state, accurate to know when and in what order we will achieve these targets, but we are all us by means of the fact that the fact that, if we believe in them and is aimed at them annexed to the distance we have already put behind us half.</seg>
<seg>It must ensure that Mrs nutzniesserinnen persuaded of the professions are, with the same inequalities must not occur in the more traditional sectors, less qualified jobs, part-time work on a voluntary basis, sometimes not limited contracts, as well as difficult access to decision-making positions.</seg>
<seg>The Council could be evaluated dealing with a proposal on indicators, on the basis of which the major progress.</seg>
<seg>In short, on the fourth pillar equal opportunities means supporting the integrated approach to equality of gender mainstreaming and the specific directives.</seg>
<seg>I am thinking in particular of the acts of violence against women, one of the central issues of interest of my government activity, and I know that this is a very special issue as you request.</seg>
<seg>We know that the measures to encourage women to the reconciliation of family and professional life, in particular, even if it is still a lack of studies on the current situation of the family and the role of women in the family, which is no longer the traditional role, because society have greatly changed and with it the family structure.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes, some people seem to believe that to be the case, but it does not agree with a number of colleagues in this House.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, let me say to the conclusion that the equal opportunities in their own four walls begins.</seg>
<seg>I think this is a serious and zwielichtig position, and I think that it should be considered in terms of the projects proposed by you, because it is not certain that we arrive here at the practical implementation.</seg>
<seg>In this area there is no equality.</seg>
<seg>The image of the European women as it arises from our reports from our guidelines, does not meet those Danish women who give a refusal by the majority of the euro.</seg>
<seg>So, in my view, it is significant that the report will take place on it, in all areas of society, for example in the labour market, must have a numerical balance between men and women to be produced.</seg>
<seg>But that is precisely why it is a missed opportunity that this report marriage and the family were completely ignored.</seg>
<seg>We should heed the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, better!</seg>
<seg>We have heard that the previous presidency restructured and then abolished the equality Ministry.</seg>
<seg>The medium-sized pay of women is on average to 28% below that of men, which contributes to the fact that women account for the largest part of the poor, and makes it more difficult to their participation in the social and political life.</seg>
<seg>That is really excellent.</seg>
<seg>Europe-wide today a process of impoverishment of working women, in France too, where it is less than 3,650 francs have 15% of them month to life.</seg>
<seg>It has not all countries will follow your example and I hope that the example of France in other countries will bear fruit.</seg>
<seg>The history of the Women obviously goes back now.</seg>
<seg>We really need to help the applicant with the adoption of the acquis communautaire.</seg>
<seg>I need your support.</seg>
<seg>That is not the case, but it is a satisfactory text, and the Committee on Legal Affairs decided, after careful consideration, and a detailed debate to present any amendments.</seg>
<seg>After lengthy debate, the Committee on Legal Affairs has come to the conclusion that it was not appropriate legal uncertainty over six years to sustain and that the period of three years was more than a reasonable period of time, in order to be able to identify with the appropriate resources and an average care whether a statement irregularities were present or not.</seg>
<seg>That is Amendment No 15, which deals with fraud.</seg>
<seg>The objective, above all, a simplified, but nevertheless qualitative communication with sufficient flexibility in the basic regulation to manage to improve the procedures for the collection of customs duties and greater harmonisation of the rules governing the registration with the customs meets one of the requirements of the single market, and this has been achieved here, even those that many countries could be enthusiastic in order to be able to join quickly in world trade.</seg>
<seg>I would like to thank Parliament, and in particular the committee chaired by Mrs de Palacio Vallelersundi spent for the efforts of the two institutions on this matter and the interest which you have brought to it.</seg>
<seg>Welcome</seg>
<seg>I would not like to see the vote is affected by it, but the translation of the French version really must be reviewed.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report.</seg>
<seg>It is recognised that fremdsprachenkenntnisse are a necessary condition for mobility.</seg>
<seg>In addition, we believe that the Member States, to a great extent, should decide on taxation.</seg>
<seg>I somewhat regret that we did not have a chance, received a majority in favour of the need, too, to formulate a period of proceedings in respect of documents.</seg>
<seg>- (FR) In the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam, we had at that time, the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination on grounds of sex, race, ethnic origin, religion or sektiererischen) (the belief, disability, age or sexual orientation welcome.</seg>
<seg>The problems of certain minorities in these countries are all aware.</seg>
<seg>The reasons for the amendment, it is clear that the aims of taking action against the rules in force in the Member States concerning the age which are not entirely justified, for development-psychological reasons and in professional life any significance.</seg>
<seg>I think that everything in a new Article 12 a) was drafted together, renounceable.</seg>
<seg>to glaubensbekenntnis. religion and the EPLP welcomes the principle of the relevant worthy of protectionness.</seg>
<seg>. (SV) We welcome Christian Democrats on the whole, the proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for the implementation of equal treatment in employment and occupation.</seg>
<seg>But just States on the staffing of the internal audit service and nothing on the financial importance and, therefore, on the use of such a service.</seg>
<seg>The European Union has decided to set up a common military jurisdiction in order to meet the so-called Petersberg objectives (crisis fight and conflict resolution outside the territory of the EU), but does not have its own defence policy.</seg>
<seg>Without weapons the world would be much safer.</seg>
<seg>The resolution is aimed not at a drastic reduction in the sale of arms to the promotion of a policy of disarmament off, I would just like to make regulations in order to safeguard for the armaments industries further profits.</seg>
<seg>In its communication, the Commission recognises the problem, however, is proposing a concrete measures, because the idea of the liberalisation of the market and competition, everything is imprisoned in their proposals in the explanatory statement - and in particular for children, the harsh reality of the unaccountability of the multinationals, it makes no difference to which the thirst for profit, the impact of its programmes and products, and which are of any responsibility to parents who are encouraged even for the acquisition of new products, in order to protect their children.</seg>
<seg>Like the rapporteur, I also believe that the measures should not be limited to no more than the protection of young people from violent and damaging to the conventional television programmes but must be applicable to all the media.</seg>
<seg>at an average of three hours a day is television apart from sleeping and for adults alongside the work - the most important human activity.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, women are often possibilities “flexible” fixed-term contracts and low wages are typical of the sectors in which mainly women are employed.</seg>
<seg>They are the first victims of cuts in public funds, the privatisation of the health sector, the restriction of the right to health care and medical treatment, cuts are still more tangible with the right to vorbeugungs and information programmes.</seg>
<seg>b5-0792/2000 by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, on the crisis in Peru.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I would actually like to that we have other urgent here not only in connection with or, but after a thorough debate in committee, a debate on Latin America.</seg>
<seg>We must do everything possible to ensure that it can achieve Peru with countries who are equal to the challenge and able to satisfy the demands of the Peruvian people for political renewal and substantial democracy.</seg>
<seg>The joint debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>We now know, Afghanistan is not far from it, Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium, so that we can imagine what the role of these political - not only political - mafias during the extension of the drug trade do not play.</seg>
<seg>The Commission is urged to an assessment of the humanitarian aid programmes in favour of the Afghan people, so that no one is on the ground forgotten.</seg>
<seg>This conflict brings untold suffering.</seg>
<seg>For years, there is a budget line, within the framework of mine clearance and prevention programmes are funded.</seg>
<seg>Let me here to the reference made by Mrs Paciotti Members say that I shall ask the question, of course, this very day, within the Commission, what has happened to the money for mine clearance and is going to happen.</seg>
<seg>b5-0794/2000 by Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnapping of the Spanish jesuiten guerrillas in Colombia, in negotiations,</seg>
<seg>We all regret this and would not wish to have to speak again about Colombia.</seg>
<seg>The Commission has offered to coordinate the actions of this package, the Commission plans in the next few days to promise considerable resources for this.</seg>
<seg>Once again, with two different yardsticks is measured, what I find regrettable.</seg>
<seg>Like the behaviour of the Albanian opposition party is particularly close incomprehensible it deliberately for a solution to an Albanian problem in Macedonia.</seg>
<seg>I regard it as an extraordinary achievement of the Macedonians to be clear in their country with one another.</seg>
<seg>I therefore believe that this balance can be permanent, but the government to find a solution to the question of university and many other issues with great courage, needs visible signs of success and requires strong support, without being jeopardized peace in the whole region.</seg>
<seg>Within the framework of the national programme for the year 2000 provide PHARE funds can be used for the support of the university in the coming academic year in 2001 and 2002.</seg>
<seg>I must stress that already all Greek Members in the European Parliament have spoken on this issue.</seg>
<seg>Since all these problems concern Greece, which is the biggest shipping sector in the European Union, they are basically the security of each type of transport throughout the Union.</seg>
<seg>In the last few years in our waters far more people lost their lives, not only by great driving gap, but all too often in our fishing communities.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, innocent victims must now keep so that shipowners can impose its objectives in the broadest sense.</seg>
<seg>We must be clear about the fact that it is also a question of the credibility of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Finally I would like to stress that the Commission is firmly convinced of the fact that the issue of European legislation must be on the safety of passenger ships, a matter of the highest priority in the European Union and that it is important to ensure that these laws throughout the Community and rigorously applied uniformly.</seg>
<seg>I apologise for the fact that I was late, for reasons which are sufficiently well known to you is something I want to make a brief statement on the two items on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade and in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general, as well as the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>Commissioner Verheugen will speak like Mr Solana to the two issues which are on our agenda this afternoon, the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg>We must be prepared to honour this commitment as soon as the will of the people is respected.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, I will take part in this debate without reservations; I wanted that Parliament is in view of the dramatic consequences of the outbreak of violence in the Middle East, just one month after the expectations created so confidently here in this Chamber today only as a judge who is able to condemn this or that.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, my contribution today is not based on all kinds of remote analyses, but on my own experience of the past week, because I was travelling in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip, when it came to the outbreaks of violence.</seg>
<seg>As opponents of the violence we cannot put the force of the Israelis and the Palestinians on the same footing.</seg>
<seg>I would like to ask the House at this decisive moment to adopt a declaration of solidarity with the courageous people who defended freedom today in the streets of Belgrade, the same solidarity which we Europeans just a few years ago in other cities give people who are fighting for their freedom.</seg>
<seg>The Europeans would undoubtedly be well advised to take us here in this House by the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council opportunity with both hands.</seg>
<seg>The status of Jerusalem is a difficult point in the negotiations.</seg>
<seg>For many years, he has succeeded in deceiving with its propaganda machine and brutal pressure on the media people in his country, but unfortunately, many in the Western world to feign them a false picture of reality.</seg>
<seg>Since the curtain falls to this tragedy, it is the duty of this Parliament as a symbol of a united, free Europe, to support the masses before the Yugoslav parliament and help Mr Kostunica and compliance with the exercise of its mandate.</seg>
<seg>This attitude is irreconcilable fear the worst, at the same time, and the events of this moment to emphasise these words, which I have noted a few hours ago.</seg>
<seg>I wonder whether the Commissioner on this point have action plans in order to show that we really think Kostunica as the legally elected representative of the Serbian people and as a partner with which the European Union has to do from now on.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament would like to protest at this historic moment, since tyranny goes off the rails and democracy triumphed, its full solidarity.</seg>
<seg>The next item is the debate on Mr - on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the (a5-0237/2000) report on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2000/24/eg regarding the extension of the guarantee of the Community for any loss of the European Investment Bank for loans for projects in Croatia [COM (2000) 289 - c5-0336/2000 - 2000/0122 nationals.</seg>
<seg>The new political course followed the next legislative and presidential elections in that country is to be welcomed.</seg>
<seg>It is an advisory task force, whose aim is to offer to Croatia its authority and technical assistance in the Treaty negotiations.</seg>
<seg>We must not forget that Croatia was until recently the classic example of a privatisation programme completely failed, of which only a few of the privatisation profited. this whole process must be supported.</seg>
<seg>The contribution in the form of an EIB loan of EUR 250 million euro under debate for the period 2000 to 2007 can be a milestone, but rather the wearing of aid.</seg>
<seg>So it is not entirely correct, if in this report is the question of democracy.</seg>
<seg>When Croatia and the Slovak Republic became independent half a century ago, in particular, for the first time, they were servants of the Hitler regime.</seg>
<seg>We cannot see of course the question of guarantees and the question of Croatia from the debate in the last night and development in Belgrade.</seg>
<seg>If it is true that Milosevic and the will of the people have gained the upper hand, we hope that it will take days before the practical introduction of normal partnership relations between Serbia and our Europe of democracies.</seg>
<seg>I declare on Friday, 6 October 2000, suspended session of the European Parliament to be resumed.</seg>
<seg>(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)</seg>
<seg>My question is: who is empowered to speak on behalf of the European Parliament to the Statute?</seg>
<seg>I would ask you, Madam President, to take all possible steps in order to speed up the current matter procedure in the Committee on Petitions on the proposed the protest letter in which the petitioners opposes the current situation in which Community rules on radiological protection are in flagrant breach of more than thirty social groups and NGOs.</seg>
<seg>The autopsie made in Georgia showed that it was clearly a murder, probably in connection with torture.</seg>
<seg>We have the opportunity, your dream - not in the rest of my - a great step forward to make.</seg>
<seg>This is the basic legislation and the basis for any other legislation of genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg>It is clear from a fat cell in the others.</seg>
<seg>(The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.50 p.m.)</seg>
<seg>The next item is the report (a5-0291/2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council [COM (2000) 379 - c5-0508/2000 - 2000/2219 (cos)), the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the social agenda.</seg>
<seg>The importance of this open method of coordination to highlight does not mean that this method is to step social minimum standards in the place of social legislation, since we establish social rights in Europe to produce social and dare to legislate, which are necessary in the context of a single European market.</seg>
<seg>In our opinion, we call for dialogue and cooperation with civil society and, in particular, with women's organisations in the countries which are currently preparing for their accession to the European family, because here too we must introduce a harmonious development in time, which is the model to the rest of Europe in theory and in practice.</seg>
<seg>to the activities listed in the report of the Commission also general agreement.</seg>
<seg>On this point in my speech, I would like to remind you of a seminar which is organised on this matter on 4 and 5 December in Biarritz, and which I will lead.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the fight against exclusion we reached on 17 October on the Social Affairs and Employment Council major progress and appropriate objectives defined in the fight against poverty and social exclusion, which will serve as a basis for the national action plans.</seg>
<seg>I have heard from some quarters that it agrees with the report after reading the diagnosis, but not the offered recipe.</seg>
<seg>Technological development and the new organizational forms are certainly also for a flexible cooperation in which controls on rigid process, but rather on objectives and results is less.</seg>
<seg>precisely on the rickety views are to be reduced in our eyes, which is blamed for those who do not expect a liberalized market that it regulates all the best.</seg>
<seg>It has made a significant contribution to social peace in our country and the confidence in direct foreign investors strengthened.</seg>
<seg>The method chosen seems to me, however, doubtful.</seg>
<seg>When we talk of a Charter of Fundamental Rights and face a European Constitution favourably, we should not be short-sighted, but must openly that all necessary steps need to be taken, even if they require more precise rules.</seg>
<seg>I would like once again to critical lack of initiatives to the new challenges in the health and safety of workers' participation and the labour relations.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I would also like the rapporteur, the Commissioner, as well as Mrs Pery this presentation to Minister to congratulate the social policy agenda.</seg>
<seg>We know that these points are controlled by the conservatives in Europe, but we, in our group, lay particular emphasis on this.</seg>
<seg>The third basic feature is the enlargement of the Union.</seg>
<seg>The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg>The actions of the Commission should be complemented by a review of the impact of the access for the individual to medical care, social security and pension system, as well as by an analysis of the shortcomings in the organization of work, and perhaps the question of general reduction of working hours.</seg>
<seg>In this way, Mrs Europa close will feel, but Europe will benefit from the interesting and innovative ideas which will arise in relation to this programme.</seg>
<seg>We expect an annual report of the President of the Commission in the context of an annual debate in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, I am delighted that an improvement of the measures are envisaged for the care of children and the impact is to be facilitated by professional and family life.</seg>
<seg>My group will take this into account in the final vote.</seg>
<seg>(The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg>I think it is extremely positive, and the proposal for a decision on the programme for the period 2001-2005 well thought through the new approach by the Commission.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, the many reflect that we supported the amendments to the common position, which the Commission and the Committee on Women's rights in this matter will take.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, I have received questions in the course of the past year from several companies who felt a certain impotence in connection with the testing methods, not least in those cases in which an appointment had to be used against the Commission's decision in the Court of First Instance.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to take this opportunity to ask Commissioner Monti, when the implementation of a public, effective and efficient list is to be expected on state aid and, in addition, when this is done a long time ago in prospect indicators asked.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, I would point out to Mr Monti that broader field should be given to the credit trade in the next report.</seg>
<seg>As I said, does not only apply in the area of energy policy, but it also applies in all other areas.</seg>
<seg>Mr Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work that they have done on the two reports in which they make a flattering picture assessment of the work of your people and the Directorate-General for Competition.</seg>
<seg>I stress this because the market cannot regulate everything and there is and should not be unlimited competition in this sense.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, nobody can dispute the fact - and I, of course, not today - the fact that state aid to change the conditions of competition and of evil is in as much as they favour the inefficiency of the companies.</seg>
<seg>It was to be heard at least as it abstreitet strange that the reduction of state aid in the period 1994-1998, although the Commission acknowledges this.</seg>
<seg>My opinion is, of course, the xxix. report by the Commission on competition policy, but that is not what we are not looking to the past.</seg>
<seg>In the time available to me, I should like to refer to the following three issues: the modernisation of competition law of Community activity in 1999 for the implementation of the competition rules and, finally, the state aid.</seg>
<seg>The Commission has always firmly against kartellbildungen intervened and against the abuse of dominant positions.</seg>
<seg>Mr Rapkay, the Commission attaches great importance to the support of its competition policy by the European Parliament, and I do not have the impression that this assistance is waning.</seg>
<seg>This system can be activated either at the request of a Member State or in accordance with Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, a regulation which during the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union only for the Member States with a derogation, at present for Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom applies.</seg>
<seg>In the future the recourse to the capital market should remain the only possible option.</seg>
<seg>I therefore ask that the report in its present form meets with the approval of the House and that in the field of the rebpflanzgutes the European internal market can be used.</seg>
<seg>The fact that it must be changed, is due to the development of the phytosanitären regulations and to scientific and technical progress which has been made, particularly in in-vitro-vermehrung.</seg>
<seg>As this precautionary principle also the possibility of genetic modification is mentioned, for example, the intensive use of pesticides can be reduced.</seg>
<seg>Finally, I would like to say that we call for the wine grower who would have to follow the opinion of Marianne Mrs Maij-Weggen and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and vote for its abolition in the interests of the precautionary principle, when just the articles and amendments which I referred to earlier, unfortunately, should not be withdrawn, like it.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, if you permit: Commissioner, could you give us your position on the amendment of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy state? this is Amendment No 1.</seg>
<seg>The only controversial point was whether I had been able to take the decree immediately on the withdrawal of the mandate of Mr Le Pen after its transmission by the French Government to the Minutes or not.</seg>
<seg>I would remind you that the vote will take place at 12.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg>In the field of justice and home affairs, I am optimistic about a solution for civil judicial cooperation.</seg>
<seg>The preparatory group will fully their task of 19 November, the date of the next conference at ministerial level, to continue.</seg>
<seg>We need such a stimulating climate, as Mr Moscovici pointed out, and I have been able to fulfil the very strong feeling of a common, historical responsibility with the Heads of State and Government at an historic moment for European integration.</seg>
<seg>It must be paid attention to the fact that we do not stay in these issues of qualified majority behind the spirit or the climate in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg>The small countries are not command recipients of the large countries of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>I would be grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council if he would clarify this point.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica was a historic event.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, progress has been achieved in enhanced cooperation and the extension of the qualified majority, but there is still a profound differences of opinion about the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council, as you pointed out.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me that we are moving in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg>Anyone who does not share of closer cooperation, has the freedoms of a passenger on the back seat of a motor vehicle.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to interfere - even less than you - in the internal affairs of Germany, but I am of the opinion that this position is totally coherent and in all other respects, goes in the direction requested by the Commission, if I am not mistaken.</seg>
<seg>We have an exchange of views with the Member States on this issue, which shows that all Member States are in favour of maintaining this upper limit after enlargement.</seg>
<seg>This will certainly not be the case.</seg>
<seg>First of all, we sometimes have the impression that in Biarritz obsession with a certain amount of discussion between small and large States prevailed.</seg>
<seg>It has to be said that, in my opinion, not sufficient Community procedure must be protected.</seg>
<seg>Even after the accession of today's candidate countries, each Member State must retain a junior or a senior Commissioner.</seg>
<seg>The wording of Article 93 is all the more difficult in view of the fact that it will be almost impossible after the first successfully accomplished accession to make progress towards a qualified majority.</seg>
<seg>The citizens of these countries must be convinced of the undisputed advantages that any new European Treaty brings with it.</seg>
<seg>It would be called upon to underestimate the deep-seated reasons for this crisis wanted it to assume that the fears of a final peace without new vibration, which is the prerequisite for compensation had since generations, could take place.</seg>
<seg>The only very weak ECHO worries me on Parliament's demand for democratisation.</seg>
<seg>Surely it can be charged to the forces which call for the implementation of a comprehensive reform before enlargement.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, the decision of the Heads of Government of Israel is to freeze the peace negotiations because of the use of violence in the region and its efforts on the formation of a state of emergency government with the leader of the opposition, Mr Sharon to focus on.</seg>
<seg>Of course, we have taken the victory of the Yugoslav people and the election of Mr Kostunica with indescribable pleasure to the President noted.</seg>
<seg>I commend Mr Baron Crespo to ask his Italian colleagues for a reason why they take part in Italy with one expressed a Communist party in the government and with a different expressed a Communist party, della Rifondazione Comunista Partito prepare for participation in the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg>There would be progress in the codecision procedure.</seg>
<seg>The Commission is, with the possibility of a simple majority of votes in the Commission better able to provide the impetus in the future.</seg>
<seg>Now, in the European Union are used a visionary, whose position is fixed by the year 2030, but people with solutions which are able to recognize the problems which enlargement, which can be achieved in 3-8 years brings to find answers to them.</seg>
<seg>It is therefore a work under conditions which has been open or was not enforced from above.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>If this fundamental point of focus is lost, it is difficult to understand at best any longer, at worst we killing each other.</seg>
<seg>Democracy is better in Europe, but the European democracy is ailing.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament has today on 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, a simple and serious: you can bring the European Constitution, we want them.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the island is actually a sufficient condition.</seg>
<seg>I to the heart of the matter will be limited by focusing on the main points of the report by Mr President Gil-Robles, to which I would like to say briefly that I think it is excellent.</seg>
<seg>First of all, simplifying and clarifying the Treaties.</seg>
<seg>I would like to leave it at that, because the report of the University Institute of Florence is here - at least for me - not to the debate.</seg>
<seg>According to the information - we are very technical, see it to me the Centre, which are present in the presidency, is a clear majority of the language versions contrary to the Italian version of the application of the cohesion policy only on the most disadvantaged islands and not to the islands to be generally referred.</seg>
<seg>Mr Duhamel, you are certainly in agreement with me in the statement that there will not be a success if Nice is no place, or at least no credibility to think about the future of European integration, at least not in the present framework.</seg>
<seg>It is also necessary in the European Constitution to determine the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union clearly and to include the dynamics of European integration in areas in which it is essential to act together in the foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg>It could also be necessary in order to overcome continuing blockades.</seg>
<seg>We need a clearer distribution of responsibilities and a clear definition of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg>As you know, there are different views on this in the various Member States, with the various social forces.</seg>
<seg>The ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be, however, sadly, exactly the opposite, and that is why we cannot accept it.</seg>
<seg>Because in the strengthened European House it will probably give people at the military, at the monetary and fiscal policy at the table, and then the others as well.</seg>
<seg>The second version is clearly not right, because on the one hand, the economically backward areas are covered by the structural funds already and it would not have been on the other hand, after this interpretation a reason for the adoption of the Declaration No 30.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I shall concentrate in my modest short 60 seconds to Olivier Duhamel's report, which is excellent, because it really calls a spade a group and the lyrismus of our rapporteur, a moment ago, we have finally convinced.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, the unity of Europe, of a political nature can be.</seg>
<seg>In our view, the new Constitution should be ready for the next European elections and be able to come into force.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the name is applied would call strongly disadvantaged” both on the island regions and other regions, and after the proposal by Mr Barnier here, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention of Vienna, a modification of the Italian text needs to be made.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>As the honourable Member said that she wanted to vote against it is rejected this amendment.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, it is obviously a recipe for chaos.</seg>
<seg>. I welcome the adoption of the Trakatellis report by Parliament, it is nevertheless see high quality and safety standards for derived from blood or plasma.</seg>
<seg>If the European parliamentary immunity is independent, the French authorities to lift the immunity of the Members of Parliament would have to turn themselves Le Pen at us.</seg>
<seg>I am very disappointed at the vote of the European Parliament with the report on transport with vegetative propagation material of profit.</seg>
<seg>alcohol, tobacco and drugs, for a product which can cause enormous damage to consumers and their fellow men, others keep but we see in it a means of creating jobs and a gushing source.</seg>
<seg>The rapporteur generally welcomed the proposals on this subject, contained in the Commission's White Paper to be decentralized is concerned about the possible impact of the reform, which seeks, in principle, the implementation of competition rules.</seg>
<seg>In the debate last night, I would congratulate Jonathan Evans on his work, but I had right at the outset my clear criticism to Liberals, when do not even ultra-liberal orientation of his report say.</seg>
<seg>The target group again this priorities in order to ensure in the next three years, half of all new jobs developing projects on the green fields in the Objective 1 area.</seg>
<seg>In view of the indignation that the consequences of this policy can cause, sometimes at least partly toning down by national interventions, AIDS and other economic or tax incentives the situation.</seg>
<seg>(The sitting was suspended at 14.06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)</seg>
<seg>We are now in October 2000, just before the adoption of decisions on the number are of the budget 2001.</seg>
<seg>This did not prevent the Council to cut in agricultural expenditure 555 overall million.</seg>
<seg>We are also of the opinion that 400 jobs cannot be created simply more simple obendrauf.</seg>
<seg>I can only say that we agree with you on the Council.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the management of this House for Members did not reverse there.</seg>
<seg>The European Court of Auditors makes us at present to a few concerns.</seg>
<seg>Finally, the budget of the Ombudsman from us is to be dealt with.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, we believe that the candidate countries should be forced to research.</seg>
<seg>We also propose that Parliament continues to be regularly informed.</seg>
<seg>And if a legislative consultation will take place in the Social Affairs, to culture and environment - which will be Commissioner speaking time is right - we, the Commissioner for the budget, the Finance Ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets, in order to pray together that no financial inconsistency is committed.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your friendly welcome.</seg>
<seg>It already approved at first reading of the budget for 2001, which is justified, without being engage in tactical considerations, the objective of an appropriate use of funds which the Community institutions must be aimed at further, would have been only damaging.</seg>
<seg>Before you decide on the 2001 draft budget, I would like to highlight a number of objectives, on which consensus between the Council and Parliament, and which is an agreement between the two branches of the budget authority can lead.</seg>
<seg>In the structural policy, we are in a similar situation.</seg>
<seg>The consultation in the summer, as Mr Colom I Naval referred to - had a good result, namely that information must be improved in the future with expenditure-effective legal foundations at Parliament's disposal.</seg>
<seg>May I remind you that in the last year the agreed financial plan for the Balkans only 1.85 billion has been earmarked for the entire period until 2006.</seg>
<seg>I ask once again for it - the Commission makes its proposal on the table - to examine and take into account as an opportunity, this proposal also equally.</seg>
<seg>The material has proved to be very useful, both for the programming of the 2001 budget, and for the discharge for 1999.</seg>
<seg>As far as I, as a Member of the Committee on Budgets, the work of this Committee, and how much I appreciate the work of the rapporteur and the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets worthy, do not want to miss I as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, however, to draw attention to two amendments which the committee in plenary presented and whose importance is not insignificant in spite of smaller amounts.</seg>
<seg>With these measures, we want to make legal control fully functional again, to restore confidence in the legal security of the European Union and to strengthen the European Union as a Community of justice.</seg>
<seg>The immediate withdrawal of the initiative taken by the Commission was a clear violation of the political will of Lisbon and the priority of this House.</seg>
<seg>This decision was very strange and left many of us with the feeling that this important programme had become simple the ball between the Committee on Budgets and the Commission.</seg>
<seg>My third point is the European agricultural policy, as it is now before us in the preliminary draft budget.</seg>
<seg>If employment is a political priority for the Union, the fisheries must remain as another sector of the economy not sidelined.</seg>
<seg>I am particularly pleased that the funding for the programmes agreed at the end of the last year could be ensured Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000.</seg>
<seg>The shortfall in our Mediterranean aid, for example, amount to the budgets for several years.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in recent years, I was speaking on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on whose behalf Mrs Iivari said this afternoon.</seg>
<seg>But I would also like to say to the Members this afternoon that we should not lose sight of the fact that the European Union is used only 1% of GDP, and a large proportion of it is administered in the Member States.</seg>
<seg>I will now turn to the overall strategy.</seg>
<seg>Here I would have involved at the strategy of my group, because the trend is the starting point for our convictions to give European citizens a cost-benefit ratio as favourable as possible.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, we must work on a Parliament which advocates transparency, efficiency and effective democratic control of the European institutions.</seg>
<seg>Then we need to think about how we solve this problem.</seg>
<seg>We want to promote democratisation processes and we want a balanced relationship between the traditional policy of foreign policy, which we now have before us.</seg>
<seg>The biggest problem in the new budget for external measures.</seg>
<seg>Economic economies is, of course, necessary, is supported by us, and we should not also mogeln away.</seg>
<seg>This is an extraordinary initiative, particularly in the first reading and it is a thankless initiative, since it will not find majority in the current circumstances.</seg>
<seg>However, the scope of the budget allocation for the Kosovo raises some problems.</seg>
<seg>With the budgetary policy, we need to win the confidence of the citizens in European policy.</seg>
<seg>All the measures for the strengthening of small and medium-sized businesses are therefore to be supported.</seg>
<seg>The scope of the implementation of the budget.</seg>
<seg>If you have this strategic line as approach to the budgets of this and the next few years, then this Parliament will take its place in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg>With the transfer of 175 million euros are about EUR 25 million more at its disposal than we had hoped for.</seg>
<seg>The subject of the Council, the commitments made MEDA has no problem, because eight years arrears in payments have accumulated.</seg>
<seg>I believe that Mr Duff has been present this morning when we made at the European Council in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg>My answer is quite simple.</seg>
<seg>Ramiro Zapata was the last one of the murdered 25 human rights activists and the Colombian press recently published the 100” plan of the paramilitary groups, with 100 human rights activists should be killed.</seg>
<seg>The present attitude of the Council makes me a little more than seems satisfactory in July, the European Union, as we have seen in many crisis situations, internationally always than the latter to go into action, and to make its voice heard.</seg>
<seg>My question is, and I am coming to the end, if there is no opportunity to exert greater pressure than by the President in its information has been proposed, and whether the support which we want to give to the extent that is substantially different from the support of the United States that it is not on the fumigation of the plant, but on the new cultivation of other cultures and not on the military, but on the social aspects.</seg>
<seg>The issues raised by me and other Members refer specifically to the situation in Colombia.</seg>
<seg>As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 will be taken together.</seg>
<seg>Subject: taxation of financial transactions, the call for a tax on speculative capital gains more in the last few months ground. ever so many ATTAC committees (association pour une rating sur les transactions of financières et pour l 'aide aux citoyens) in France and Europe has been set up and in the French National Assembly and in the Senate of amendments tabled.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, we should reply to the question that she would have an influence on the volatility of the foreign exchange markets, in particular, with a rate of 0,1 parts per thousand, while the speculators count on devaluations in the order of EUR 20 to 50%.</seg>
<seg>Paragraph 26, it also calls for the establishment of an international arbitration organisation for the cancellation of the debt of the countries of the South.</seg>
<seg>They were independent of including the reference year, with the euro, the case, whether one regrets or welcomes this.</seg>
<seg>What has been said by Danielle Auroi earlier with regard to the countries of the South, I would like to add that the estimates of specialists contain interesting figures, for example, that a tax of the kind that would provide the Tobin tax revenue from 50 to 250 billion dollars, whereas according to the calculations of the UNDP USD 40 billion per year would be enough to ensure a minimum of living conditions for the hundreds of millions of people who are in the countries of the third world everything.</seg>
<seg>In recent months the disease has been identified, among other things in different parts of France.</seg>
<seg>Now, as the representative of the French Presidency is here, I would like to know whether the cows slaughter from the European Union budget or from the national budget is paid and whether it is appropriate, in your view, to settle it from the EU budget.</seg>
<seg>I ask you for your consensus that it can now be answered.</seg>
<seg>The margin for manoeuvre both of the government concerned is limited by international law.</seg>
<seg>I am baffled, how can the Commission comment in February, but what it needs, and the Council in July.</seg>
<seg>If the Union in the name of subsidiarity has such a procedure to the day it exempts in reality of one of its task, which can be met, as this in the last few weeks, both in the north of Italy and Spain did.</seg>
<seg>How can I as a Member of the European Parliament, of which this majority is concerned, allow 11.5 billion pound from British taxpayers' money - that is our current annuity - is spent in the general public does not lie behind it?</seg>
<seg>With a flexible attitude on the part of the Council an agreement could be found in order to complete the budget at second reading.</seg>
<seg>If someone has yet to be convinced, be it on the proof.</seg>
<seg>Joan Colom I Naval, the Vice-President responsible for buildings, have already presented this strategy.</seg>
<seg>As Mrs Schreyer has already mentioned, this year's draft budget contains many political messages. the reorganisation of the common agricultural policy, the new structural programmes, security and better implementation of the structural policy, the implementation of the decisions of the Lisbon Summit, to the creation of a stronger and more competitive European Union and for the fight against social exclusion.</seg>
<seg>NATO's war destroyed too much and great suffering left.</seg>
<seg>Despite the agreements made from time to time I ask whether it is possible to achieve this objective in the context of the existing budget commitments without the agricultural budget, which is essential for sustainable agriculture sector in the current Member States, to undermine it.</seg>
<seg>And I answered quite clear to them and Kostunica must get its opportunity here and I hope that in the next few weeks or months for an amnesty will ensure that, in the meantime, however, for the fact that I am at the political level and in relation to the budget to the introduction of these two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, political conditions attached.</seg>
<seg>The elections in Yugoslavia shows two things, people have enough of the dictator Milosevic and they have confidence in Professor Kostunica.</seg>
<seg>I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners are quickly released.</seg>
<seg>If we do not do that, it will inevitably come down to a financial plan on rearrangements and cuts both with the general social and environmental expenditure and in cooperation.</seg>
<seg>initiatives are in demand for the solution of the huge social problems such as unemployment.</seg>
<seg>Of course, something I consider to be extremely important, namely that we started with Category 4, which have not yet tackle. is not entirely clear whether a solution succeeded there, not because the Council is not under any circumstances to cooperate fully established.</seg>
<seg>With every budget work, it is important to set priorities.</seg>
<seg>This is with a view to the expiry of the Treaty in the near future, not very serious, but it would be questionable if would make the following the practices, such legal framework on the ECSC the opportunity to continue.</seg>
<seg>This brings me to my third point, which is now before us.</seg>
<seg>The new financial agreement does not give that mistrust towards the politicians in the European Union is growing, I have experienced.</seg>
<seg>Bravo to them.</seg>
<seg>The dialogue between all the institutions concerned have made an unprecedented cooperation possible, which I hope will allow deeply to arrive at an agreement at first reading.</seg>
<seg>We are in favour of the European values in a European union-sceptical country, now have a further argument for the European Union: a more effective protection of personal data, which is of great significance for the citizens in modern society.</seg>
<seg>I noticed that in my own country, a change in the law on personal data are to be carried out by the influence of Members to the decisions of the Commission been spent.</seg>
<seg>On a number of other points, we also see here the judgment of practical problems must be seen to make sure.</seg>
<seg>. (FR) The Commission would first of all like to refer to the commitment that we all have to the citizens to guarantee the protection of personal data produced by the institutions.</seg>
<seg>With this statement, the Commission accepts that the scope of the regulation is restricted solely to activities in the context of the first pillar.</seg>
<seg>In accordance with the political agreement reached with the Council, the Commission and the rapporteur for adoption at first reading, they will therefore any further amendment which is not included in the Paciotti report approved by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, reject, apart from Amendment No 69, the correction of Amendment No 41.</seg>
<seg>It is therefore essential that the staff of the inter-service group is supplemented immediately within the General Secretariat of the Commission so that legal instruments with general scope for their examination by the Commission on the basis of Article 299 (2) a thorough impact assessment can be given to all the proposals.</seg>
<seg>From the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market, it is close to my heart to emphasise that we really can only deal with directly, which is the same.</seg>
<seg>In view of the importance of fisheries for the outermost regions that makes me very much.</seg>
<seg>Since chaired by Delors an inter-service group for the outermost regions, was set up, we have travelled a long and fruitful way, and I must that this group, which has so far, which express sincere thanks in remote locations living European.</seg>
<seg>The Treaty of Rome contained a reference to the French overseas departments, but it still took until 1989 and up to the POSEI programmes, programmes for the solution of the specific problems which can be attributed to remoteness and island situation until the European Union finally recognised that the permanent nature and the combined action of the structural disadvantages of the outermost regions, established a special treatment in comparison with other regions of the Community.</seg>
<seg>I do not doubt that the proposals which the Commission will present to the Council will be characterised by these characteristics.</seg>
<seg>This question is all the more relevant closer, the enlargement of the EU to the east is.</seg>
<seg>This right of differentiation is nothing else as a result of the principle of equality to be different, therefore, that is what is different.</seg>
<seg>It is a document which my group and I regard as rich in ideas and proposals which get to the heart of the issues and turn into any of the subjects which are in the outermost regions cause for concern.</seg>
<seg>In your report, Mrs Mrs Sudre has rightly stressed the need for permanent working.</seg>
<seg>When it comes to economic diversification we have made progress in a number of key areas.</seg>
<seg>It depends on the fact that a large number of projects is proposed in the context of the eppd but in parallel with the work on the ground, we must demand that the selective fully analyses specific access of each of these outermost regions.</seg>
<seg>Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg>Of course I will inform the President of your comments.</seg>
<seg>I am concerned about the fact that many equipment could be made and the decisions of the House in question, because the necessary provisions for such a case is lacking.</seg>
<seg>Both the food authority and proposals that have been presented to us, which are aimed at guaranteeing food safety, the support of this Parliament are received, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg>The focus of its activities on the scientific advice, because the debate on food safety must be pursued equally on an objective basis.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I should not like to miss this opportunity, the rapporteur, for his constructive work and for her willingness to take into account the opinions of the other committees to thank means.</seg>
<seg>When we are confronted with a potential risk, the precautionary principle must be applied.</seg>
<seg>As far as the controversial issue of whether we are to include issues in the field of this authority as food as well as the advice and support of the posts which carry out the risk management, we are of the view that at least the possibility should be given to this authority for food standards in all matters of food safety of issuing an opinion and to offer their support.</seg>
<seg>In this respect the rich traditions is of central importance.</seg>
<seg>This recognition will find it not by legislation, not by regulations, but by integrity, by scientific top quality by independence by accountability, transparency and comprehensibility.</seg>
<seg>good scientific knowledge is certainly essential if we want to evaluate the risks associated with the food chain, from the stable to the table, better.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, there is no doubt that the creation of a European agency for food safety, as our rapporteur would like it to be supported in general.</seg>
<seg>Even if the programme is still the necessary resources, as well as the necessary support, we do not need an additional representation applies particularly to an agency with each of the 15 Member States of the European Union in such a way restricted area.</seg>
<seg>Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers, because the consumers who want to eat healthily and we must make it our concern.</seg>
<seg>If we do not get a new framework directive, we will only be able to smile at all in the field of food safety.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, in the European Union Treaty changes are needed so that sanctions in the food sector are put at the Commission's disposal, as these are already in the field of competition.</seg>
<seg>I support all the partners involved, whether in political, administrative or in other working groups who work on the strategy food for all.</seg>
<seg>I do not agree with this opinion in as much as people are much more than just a body.</seg>
<seg>The authority must be a real head of the coordination of the network of national agencies, which should cause and coordinate a network of centres of excellence for food safety at the level of the individual regions.</seg>
<seg>That is why its Amendment No 11 and my Amendment No 17 would have to be brought fully compatible with each other.</seg>
<seg>The reform of food legislation in the European Union should take place at the level of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>In his report, so many amendments are not actually presented as a priority.</seg>
<seg>In the report we drew up this demand clear what I very much welcome.</seg>
<seg>The creation of a European food safety authority is to be extremely positive.</seg>
<seg>In the interests of all European citizens, it is to be hoped that these criteria are complied with.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, specific time limits must be established to keep within the European Commission, in any case, which gives cause for concern, are justified.</seg>
<seg>The European Union must ensure their citizens in the food sector as the highest possible standards.</seg>
<seg>The Commission is now proposing the creation of a European food authority.</seg>
<seg>I am concerned that Europe is once again the risk to afford a blown-up bureaucracy is unable to act.</seg>
<seg>The more we create new bureaucratic levels and the more money we spend less, can be caused.</seg>
<seg>prevent similar and parallel work in several institutions.</seg>
<seg>It is important, however, to ensure that in the shadow of the discussion on the White Paper, the fear of public before bureaucratic Europe, which influence on the quality of the products will be without approach are effectively against deception and mislead consumers is strengthened.</seg>
<seg>As you know, the strategy for food safety in the Commission has the highest priority.</seg>
<seg>The Commission will adopt a proposal for a regulation which will form the framework for future health protection measures in the food sector and the general principles and objectives of food law is defined.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg>But now to our report, I consider the Commission's proposal as positive and have to say that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation of Parliament an intensive work to be done in order to improve it as much as possible, especially in certain areas.</seg>
<seg>As our colleague, Mrs Bonino, clearly and explicitly mentioned in the Commission's proposal for a regulation is a further step forward.</seg>
<seg>We believe that the proposal for a regulation from the Commission for too vague.</seg>
<seg>It is essential that the equipment for mine clearance, according to which we work to finance for tracking and evacuation work of instruments which can be deployed on the ground, is easily and sensibly organised so that they bring aid, particularly in the developing countries.</seg>
<seg>In the past eight years we have provided more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget for the fight against landmines.</seg>
<seg>However, we do not punish the people for their incapable government.</seg>
<seg>As I have already said, is, in my view, it would be good, but counterproductive and wrong to make the accession to the Convention of Ottawa to binding and condition for the support of mines, which can be implemented immediately by the European Union.</seg>
<seg>I do not accept Amendment No 19.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, the international community must especially improve coordination at global level and in the countries concerned.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the Socialist Group agrees with the comments made by Mr Van Orden and is also proud of the role of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>We remember the Soviet toys bombs in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much for an excellent report.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the mines are kambodschaner eternal guards.</seg>
<seg>In relation to uniformed forces people have a legitimate distrust which has developed in long years of war.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I am pleased that there is a European legislation in the form of a regulation on anti-personnel mines and that we now have a good report by Mrs Bonino is here on this regulation.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing today with a very sad matter.</seg>
<seg>The mines as do not lie mainly in crisis regions, namely in areas where different initiatives could be taken in order to tackle these crises.</seg>
<seg>In two kilometres of the Bosnian village refers to the year 1999, a sign mine risk of an area which does not, however, prevent that a little boy plays there.</seg>
<seg>It is tragic that the civilian population in the inability of their leaders will suffer.</seg>
<seg>If you will allow me, ladies and gentlemen, in the name of our institution to be called a special relationship with you country within the framework of our common project welcome to build an area of prosperity, which maintains security and peace in the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg>all mines are in dumps.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I agree with almost everything there, which my colleagues have said before, that I do not want to repeat.</seg>
<seg>Their view of open cooperation is equivalent to a relapse into the institutional system dominated by Commission officials.</seg>
<seg>We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, that decisions are taken as close to those affected as possible.</seg>
<seg>But since the main amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party have just think a large majority, I have voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz, for two reasons: firstly, because I had the opportunity to vote in particular on paragraphs 2 and 5 separately and, therefore, to express my opposition to both expression.</seg>
<seg>In other words, at the table of the common European House will some policies to feed la carte, while others will have to be satisfied with the unity menu.</seg>
<seg>and democratic control diminish. must not, however, in our view, there is the major problem of the European Union, not in the list of these rights or their incorporation into the Treaty.</seg>
<seg>The instrument of the referendum and the relevant amendments to this report have already been mentioned.</seg>
<seg>With the election to the European Parliament in 1999, the turnout was 40% only if it accounts for the countries with a duty to vote and those which, at the same time, national elections held with the European elections.</seg>
<seg>In order to achieve the desired objective of a European Constitution, it is not advisable to impose strict legal figures and methods, whose disastrous consequences would be lacking the desired objective.</seg>
<seg>A real social condition would have the most important achievements in favour of the world of work, women and immigrants and the citizens' upwards adapt.</seg>
<seg>. (PT) I did not vote for, although I do not agree that a laudable intention of strengthening and deepening, one of the European Union, as well as the simplification of the texts, which are necessary for its citizens.</seg>
<seg>The distribution of powers</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, it is crucial that the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the European Union is a link with the human rights convention of the Council of Europe.</seg>
<seg>The report by Mr Gil-Robles is me, however, to help because it contains the proposal that some Member States of the European Union in certain issues, sectors and areas vote a joint approach.</seg>
<seg>If on more and more important issues will be decided by qualified majority voting, basic standards of democracy are being violated.</seg>
<seg>Today, it tries to prevent making strengthened cooperation more flexible and here, too, will be covered.</seg>
<seg>The present report is to give concrete expression to the point of view of our Parliament (resolution of 13 April 2000).</seg>
<seg>On the whole, we face a so-called flexible cooperation positively.</seg>
<seg>The British Labour Members of the Socialist Group welcome the agreement on his contribution to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference on the problem of closer cooperation, even if they do not agree with all the details.</seg>
<seg>These island regions must feel an active part of the European Union, which it then I hope in a paradise for tourists, as well as for the indigenous population will turn.</seg>
<seg>In the Middle Ages, these areas and their people did not belong to Europe, and today they are not regarded as a truly European.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, make the specific features of these regions, which generally from their island status and their distance necessary for the European continent, but also from their chronic dependence on a few products or just one product result that to overcome these obstacles appropriate, specific measures are taken.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I apologize if I put a stop to the Presidency and to the interpreters, to listen to my last explanation of vote and I would like, in particular, my solidarity with the translators of our explanations of vote, in the case of the Italian ornella buson to state.</seg>
<seg>from these texts, it is clear that this Agency is aimed at the restriction or paralysis of the national protection powers in order to put it to the service of the Commission's objectives.</seg>
<seg>This does not prevent the Commission and Parliament, to call this institution 'authority', although this appointment contradicts the philosophy behind this mechanism completely.</seg>
<seg>This does not exactly what the report proposes to which the Bowis feeling is food safety, which basically regarded as another pretext, by means of which one of the process of strengthening the powers of the Commission, to the detriment of the national authorities and the security of the citizens to make further progress would like.</seg>
<seg>I therefore consider it appropriate, by this statement on behalf of the European Parliament, which has always been the incredible acts of respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all religious communities, to condemn.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, I see that would undermine the rapporteur, but it is not just to vote on the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on money, but we are voting on a certain direction.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to ask you to see that the budget line a-206, acquisition of property, accordingly, to adapt, depending on what amendments are adopted, so that we do not exceed our own limit of 20% of all administrative costs.</seg>
<seg>Before the vote on Amendment No 929</seg>
<seg>Section VI - Economic and Social Committee</seg>
<seg>(a5-0276/2000) report by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation with additional technical measures for the recovery of the kabeljaubestandes in the Irish Sea area is a (ices VII) [COM (2000) 0190 - c5-0219/2000 2000/0071 nationals.</seg>
<seg>(Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg>The food surpluses is introduced by the export subsidies to the European Union at dumped prices on the world market, for example, which leads to serious competitive disadvantages. for the food industry in many developing countries.</seg>
<seg>In order to make adequate financial resources released for additional assistance in the Balkans, the Member States must ensure funds from the existing budget.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, Parliament has succeeded in obtaining a number of important tasks - not least in terms of increased efforts in the fight against unemployment and poverty, a number of important environmental and equal opportunities, we voted against the attacks that right to life programme and the European Women's Lobby.</seg>
<seg>With regard to travel expenses for Members of the European Parliament, we stick to our view that this should be paid only for the costs actually incurred with travel.</seg>
<seg>I go to - and I hope that the Commission is also constructively on appropriate solutions - that we will make the three years between 2002 and 2006 with a transitional arrangement.</seg>
<seg>Above all, in order to give to the national parliaments a veritable foot, the European Commission has presented a proposal for a directly binding regulation in the context of the regulation and liberalisation anger, instead of joining already submitted a directive, which is to be whipped in a proper procedure blatant effort by Parliament and the Council of Ministers in order to 31 December of this year into force.</seg>
<seg>We therefore support the reform process instigated by the Commission and reject the other preference for this sector.</seg>
<seg>They came into dependence on raisings of credit.</seg>
<seg>Nicholson report (a-0276/2000)</seg>
<seg>The misuse of funds for military targets must be avoided.</seg>
<seg>We have always held the view that the cost of the reduction of emissions are borne by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases primarily by the real causes, namely by big business and to the detriment of their superprofits have to go.</seg>
<seg>Report Moreira da Silva (a5-0271/2000)</seg>
<seg>These funds should be used as the expenditure on research policy in all 15 Member States of the European Union are concerted and coordinated.</seg>
<seg>In order to make provision for it, it is right to give us clear about these substances.</seg>
<seg>That concludes the vote.</seg>
<seg>It is to take the place of national format already applicable everywhere.</seg>
<seg>The balance of payments-doistic loss as a result of this change is minimal.</seg>
<seg>Just imagine that it mainly small and medium-sized companies are affected.</seg>
<seg>For years, we insist on the harmonization of the efforts.</seg>
<seg>I am referring to integrate that this report is of central importance to the citizens, the small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro area and to increase the adoption of the Economic and Monetary Union.</seg>
<seg>With the free movement of capital with the single currency or no obstacles greater differences must exist.</seg>
<seg>In spite of this, the European Parliament and the Commission, will give a great deal of attention to that.</seg>
<seg>I support the twin-track approach of the rapporteur, in which she wishes to make the hesitant banks to move.</seg>
<seg>We cannot force the banks to loss-pregnant business, but as politicians, we know the amendment tabled by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs, who tabled for the PPE-DE Group, support where measures appears before the end of next year and, ideally, the existence of the appropriate standards during the introduction of the euro and is called for.</seg>
<seg>The amendment by Mrs Peijs and myself aims in the direction of some banks at a table, not to make targets but because we cannot increase the pressure from the political side it any longer.</seg>
<seg>If the completion of cross-border payments remains as expensive as today, the credibility of the new currency and observation system is called into question.</seg>
<seg>In our view, is this form of the gathering of statistical data on the Union a relikt exchange of the past, which is now no longer be justified in an integrated, single area and the proper operation of the internal market affected.</seg>
<seg>When I hear the contributions made by some of my colleagues in the committee who belong to this House has more than I do, I have the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, to which the European Parliament undergoes now, for the fourth time falls into this category.</seg>
<seg>I thank you in advance for your support for my report.</seg>
<seg>If you withdraw ourselves at European level, then we must once again to give the regions more opportunities.</seg>
<seg>The SME is in the first place to job creation, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, and in this way, plays a key role in social cohesion and regional planning.</seg>
<seg>Through the careful study of the proposals and the vote with many interested parties it made a contribution to the clearer wording of the programme and its optimum preparation.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, we must strive for an added European value.</seg>
<seg>It follows that small and medium-sized enterprises and are only if unemployment is small and if the public authorities at all levels are free from debt and sufficient funds available in order to compensate for these into the investment budget.</seg>
<seg>Businesses need clarity.</seg>
<seg>Above all, if a one-man operation or a company of 250 employees have a project, it is not only to be able to sicherstellungen of land with 120% - security, but it should also be possible with a good idea to be financed.</seg>
<seg>The national States and the regional or local authorities have acted as huge financial pumps, which are there but also the taxpayers' money, namely that the majority of the population, including the poorest to pump driven amounts to large companies and therefore the pockets of their owners and shareholders.</seg>
<seg>Small and medium-sized businesses, bringing thousands of tender seedlings which serve large companies as seed for human work strength and ideas.</seg>
<seg>I would like the Commissioner concerns in connection with all the measures proposed here with priority on the fact that a slight and rapid access to assistance and information are set so that those who manage these companies are able to use this information effectively.</seg>
<seg>They will find their place in the multiannual programme.</seg>
<seg>Finally, I also welcome the idea that we meet once a year, in order to assess the implementation of the programme.</seg>
<seg>The recent actions against the Greek minority in order himare seriously, measures to democratisation, to strengthen the institutions and for the protection of human rights in Albania.</seg>
<seg>A substantial number of Albanians leaves his own country because of insecurity in their country, because of the social difficulties because of the prämodernen society and family structures.</seg>
<seg>We need, particularly in Albania cut preventive measures, which are an aid in the structural or reconstruction of the country, in order to make such a decent life possible in the region.</seg>
<seg>The documents are being an example from the others, and the European Commission is refusing to publish the report, for example, that is, among other things, the customs assistance mission (cam) prepared by the Albanians.</seg>
<seg>Let us look the truth in the eye.</seg>
<seg>Mrs Karamanou, congratulations on a broad and comprehensive route ïhorizon your report.</seg>
<seg>It is an extremely important question which results from a historical, social, political and economic conditions.</seg>
<seg>We will never know the true number of deaths.</seg>
<seg>Common business creates peaceful links.</seg>
<seg>But what I find totally unacceptable on this report and on which I would like to refer to open this was a cause and effect, namely illegal immigration with a process of weighted visas and migration possibility is confounded. it are quite the reverse!</seg>
<seg>The major institutional reforms derived from the Treaty of Amsterdam had effects on the treatment of the problem of the refugee and immigration policy.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly and lastly, the action plan and its implementation must be considered on a regional basis.</seg>
<seg>But this request is, of course, issued to us to save European regulation.</seg>
<seg>The strength of Community action now needs to be underlined.</seg>
<seg>I also advocate that on changes to existing legislation of the EC codified proposals into which the changes to the existing directives or regulations are trained.</seg>
<seg>The principle of subsidiarity, we have understood correctly points in both ways: decisions at the lowest possible level to make, to see that the lowest possible level can sometimes be a very high level when it comes to general values, whose loss threatens if they were not equally protected everywhere.</seg>
<seg>The report is an example of clear, concise and I hope they will also colleagues in all seriousness to take note.</seg>
<seg>The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market has not put Members with its enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg>This is a point I made in the report on the SLIM project, because we have to read out the Community legislation Mr Medina article of the Treaty is a sample is difficult to understand given even for specialists.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, certain aspects of the report in my cause little enthusiasm, because I would have liked to see more community-end” 'report to you on the internal market, and it is evident that the report is not out of it.</seg>
<seg>For the EU institutions, it is important that we have the explicit commitment, the quality of the legislation, in particular with a view to subsidiarity, to improve.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>Continuing this Constitution could affect the attitude and the adoption of the citizens negative towards the euro.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, we with very great care in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has prepared the Karamanou report.</seg>
<seg>But as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to use our oral question and this debate in order to speak both sides - our draft resolution is addressed to both sides - some ideas, and I would like to do so with great attention.</seg>
<seg>This is the demand of the peoples of the Union, whom we represent here.</seg>
<seg>much water has gone down, that the Rhine Agreement expired and was not replaced.</seg>
<seg>I can understand the reasoning of the Commissioner, but not those of the Director-General.</seg>
<seg>We could say that we 11 months after the closure of our vessels continue to pay for the previous agreement and for the last of the previous one.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, a year ago, we had a similar debate and the fact that it has taken a year before the negotiations are resumed shows just how difficult it is to find fish stocks for our extensive European Union fleets.</seg>
<seg>The second agreement, the state of affairs was clear.</seg>
<seg>But we must understand that everything is high, fisheries resources.</seg>
<seg>I am therefore to be clarified particularly interested in the fact that the Group of the PPE-DE has shown no only to support the fisheries agreements to defend and promote but also decided to promote their extension.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, the exploitation of the fishing grounds of the Sahara continued since the suspension of the fisheries agreement by fleets in the Community and others, neither control by the Commission or by the Member States is subject: we are talking about an important fleet from the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg>I understand that, because the fisheries was a source of income and created jobs for one, based on European standards, poor region.</seg>
<seg>Another aspect I would like to emphasise is the phasing out of subsidies for fishermen and schiffseigner limited at the end of the month, those than compensation for this one year's stop served. this situation is intolerable, because everyone wants to work rather than subsidies to highlight.</seg>
<seg>I am Andalusian parliamentarians for one year, on the courses in the offices to negotiate in the Fisheries Committee and in the discussions with the Commissioner and propose initiatives so that the special characteristics of the Andalusian fishing fleet is taken into consideration, which carries out the catch company in Morocco.</seg>
<seg>Spain has developed favourably the difficult neighbours, which we have again and again in history between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco, in an excellent way.</seg>
<seg>As a Spanish Andalusian Members and I call the right thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families to conservation and protection of its jobs which are at risk for almost a year, and which we must also protect from this Parliament.</seg>
<seg>We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg>We almost 12 year history of full kanzleitrost, delaying tactics, hopes, personal suffering for the people concerned about placebos about the tenacious defence of old rights of citizens who were looking for nothing more than their right.</seg>
<seg>As you know, the matter is extremely complex and concerns approximately 700 workers at 25 Italian universities.</seg>
<seg>If the Italian legal order is reformed and amended, as was the case for the university staff, in our opinion, the Commission cannot intervene as long as every European citizen has the same access for all categories of careers.</seg>
<seg>crime is that two people do the same work side by side works, but to be different and had paid different working conditions.</seg>
<seg>At worst it is, I think, if we have to draw attention to the fact that a court decision is to the benefit of a few may only reassuring words and is not to continue their life is important.</seg>
<seg>I expect an answer from the Commission to the point that it is in accordance with the decision of the Court of Justice in the case allué against Article 48 (2) of the EC Treaty if the legislation of a Member State, the duration is limited to one year by contracts by foreign language assistants in every case, with the possibility of enlargement, while in other teachers such a limit does not exist in principle.</seg>
<seg>Now, in my opinion, these issues relate to the heart of the fundamental principles of freedom, in particular freedom of movement, together with the European right and from these principles, there can be no exceptions.</seg>
<seg>We have, as today's debate shows that there is still a great many binding, a great many obstacles to the internal market, not only in this case.</seg>
<seg>We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg>(The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg>In kondolenzschreiben at Austrian federals President Klestil and Chancellor Schüssel I expressed the Member and the whole of the Austrian people, on behalf of the House at this difficult time our sympathy.</seg>
<seg>Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg>I support the proposal of Mr Ceyhun, and would be very grateful if the Council could say whether it intends to submit a new proposal in this matter.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group considers this event as so important that we believe that it has not been dealt with properly in the form of an emergency.</seg>
<seg>Mr Baron Crespo, I have the impression that you agree with, if I have understood you correctly that reason.</seg>
<seg>Some time ago, we debated, Madam President, in this House, the sanctions against Iraq.</seg>
<seg>It is absolutely essential that we hold a debate before implementing the promised changes by the British authorities for this, and the Commission must speak out clearly on the legal provisions in this matter.</seg>
<seg>(a5-0314/2000) of Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic on the conclusion of an agreement on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, in particular in the area of the fight against organised crime, washing the proceeds of crime, as well as the financial crime (10213/2000 - c5-0394/2000 - 2000/0815 nationals.</seg>
<seg>Concrete steps must follow the declarations of intent, so that determines the proceeds of crime to be frozen, taken and collected.</seg>
<seg>The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice must not remain in the hands of a specialised body under the exclusive control of the national governments.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, Article 8 of the draft Convention restricts the reasons for the refusal of legal assistance, the requested Member State can refer to the essential interests.</seg>
<seg>First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Marinho on his work and to point out that the efforts to support the fight against financial crime, prudence is called for.</seg>
<seg>If terrorists and weapons or drug dealers in money laundering, that must be prosecuted and punished revealed, of course.</seg>
<seg>It is our task to seek out the proceeds from organised crime to determine to freeze and learn to take.</seg>
<seg>In view of these points are addressed in the amendments and the debate in the committee to judge, I am very confident that the European Parliament is voting in favour of it.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me that the list of points of initiatives in a direction which makes the protection provided for in Article 6 of the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms to be destroyed.</seg>
<seg>In reality, however, things are not as simple as that.</seg>
<seg>Finally, the PPE Group supports the compromise amendment on the activities of the lawyers, on which we have reached with Mrs Roure.</seg>
<seg>The second measure, the second instrument is the harmonisation.</seg>
<seg>That is a Portuguese initiative, which several speakers have already spoken.</seg>
<seg>And in such a way that the purpose of the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council read and the Ecofin Council on 17 October this year.</seg>
<seg>The best way for a strengthening of parliamentary and judicial control of Europol is the full integration of the Europol Convention in the legal framework of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>a step in the right direction, which is aimed at the European Parliament for a long time, is the creation of a temporary place on judicial cooperation.</seg>
<seg>This is the sense of guarantees, namely in the development of this aspect of freedoms.</seg>
<seg>and the European Parliament is the supranational Community body, which establishes the relations. of my speech, I would like to ask you to stand firm on the basis of these relations and our rapporteur your agreement.</seg>
<seg>Only if clarity on the institutional model and the rules which exist for the future European judicial area, the citizens and the European Parliament on the various measures proposed by the Council will be able to speak.</seg>
<seg>Eurojust is a logical part of the efforts by the citizens is the fight against serious organised crime to offer an area of freedom, security and justice, as well as a high degree of safety.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we can only congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on her excellent report, which she makes in implementation of a decision taken by the European Council in Tampere.</seg>
<seg>There is, however, as with Eurojust of coordination at the level of the national public prosecutors and judges in order to fight against all forms of serious crime - and I agree with the approach of the rapporteur - then too, declared an extension of the concept: it is no longer only cooperation with purely cross-border crime, but it concerns cooperation in the fight against crime.</seg>
<seg>We from 1 January 2001 the opportunity to have to engage in this provisional unit to judicial cooperation, the Commission intends to give the debate on the presentation of the final Eurojust place recovery.</seg>
<seg>It has been mentioned by all sides honestly position - I believe - without going into front but rigid positions.</seg>
<seg>The problems in connection with the expenditure was not very worrying for the Fisheries Committee other areas are of greater interest.</seg>
<seg>It is really unacceptable that we may not have clear objectives and the results measure. exist in any other institution.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, in the field of the hierarchy of teaching power it too has actually arrived unacceptable interference, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg>I would like to make it clear to the fact that the programme has played a positive role in certain questions.</seg>
<seg>It is obvious that this work will not automatically lead to duality in consortia as regards the common financial responsibilities, the problem is more complex.</seg>
<seg>We are therefore genuinely supported these 3.4 million recovering and we can say that more than 90% we have succeeded.</seg>
<seg>Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after nine months of work and long struggle for a consensus is now before the European Charter of Fundamental Rights in the proposal.</seg>
<seg>I hope that this Parliament, even if it is only today to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the coming weeks will not let there be no doubt that it is the Council, the legally binding effect of this Charter required and that this Charter must also open people access to the European Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg>As you know, this position agrees with that of the Heads of State and Government at the meeting of the European Council in Biarritz, which approved unanimously and without the Charter, and I can therefore you on behalf of the Council only amendment to endorse this position by announcing a few reasons for it to you.</seg>
<seg>Above all, however, I am convinced that the Charter will by their content emphasis - as I would like to say - epochale importance to obtain.</seg>
<seg>The European Trade Union Confederation, for its part, has on - as he calls it - the presence of gaps weight, as, for example, the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum income.</seg>
<seg>Apart from this, a number of figures, and, in particular, some members of the European Parliament, proposed to include an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which already contains a reference to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg>Our group agrees with the exception of the British delegation of the Charter unanimously.</seg>
<seg>We are, as the European People's Party together and unanimously for the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is included as soon as possible to the Treaties, so that it also unfolds direct applicability in law for people in the European Union.</seg>
<seg>They have shown us that we can approach the European issues in a new, exemplary way, which is superior, due to their democratically open and transparent operation and the possibility of the citizens' participation in the form of the Intergovernmental Conference.</seg>
<seg>The right to health, social security, housing or on a minimum income are completely lacking or are to be included in the area of solidarity.</seg>
<seg>Fourthly, the Charter - and this is particularly important for me - comes from the indivisibility of civil and political rights and fundamental social rights.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, this is the umpteenth charter only demonstration of the Union's ability to produce meaning-meaning texts and declarations of intent again and again.</seg>
<seg>The representative of the Court of Justice has already given to recognise that one could be enthusiastic about the Charter, and the representative of the Commission in the Convention in Turin legal importance attaches to the document.</seg>
<seg>Since the time of the market is finally the hour of the Europe of rights receive the concept of citizenship of the European Union is a relatively new concept.</seg>
<seg>The Charter is drawn up like a text that can be legally binding effect.</seg>
<seg>I can also say with pride that a representative of my parliamentary group in my own country, Mr Gunnar jansson, has played a very important role in the development of this Charter.</seg>
<seg>As I said last night, and I do so again today, in this respect, there are still too many lack. throughout the Union will be able to us in such a way in our quest for judicial and police cooperation, not always identified the side-effects of the crime, eliminate and prevent innocent become passive victims.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, the draft resolution of the European Parliament to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the same ambiguity as the work of the Committee.</seg>
<seg>The Italian Constitution provides, for example, the limit of morality and the Convention on Human Rights, the limit of the rights of others and public order.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, with today's vote at 12 noon we conclude a process which began in 1984, when this Parliament approved the draft of the Treaty on European Union, in which an explanation of the rights, and which has already been demanded in 1989 with the resolution de Gucht have resumed.</seg>
<seg>The Charter will have consequences if it is enshrined in the Treaty or not.</seg>
<seg>That is to be welcomed and not, as Mr Bonde to think seems to fear.</seg>
<seg>Now it appears that the 21st century, with all its fighting for the release of the disadvantaged social classes, passed useless and nothing has taught us.</seg>
<seg>The Charter fills a gap in the EC law and strengthens the protection of individuals with regard to the European police, in relation to the authorities, the fight against fraud, as well as the competition authorities.</seg>
<seg>I cannot understand the rejection, however, which is justified by the frailty of the Charter.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I can continue where Mr Gahrton stopped.</seg>
<seg>Allow me a third comment on the rights of citizens of third countries.</seg>
<seg>The Council of Europe also have extensive experience of these forms of monitoring alongside the Court of Human Rights on which we can build.</seg>
<seg>In view of the text of the Charter, on which we will be approving today, I hope, by a large majority - it is clear that we will achieve more and more timely protection of fundamental rights in our Charter than the accession to the European Convention on Human Rights should be set up.</seg>
<seg>It is therefore necessary to progress further.</seg>
<seg>I believe that we should pursue this objective if we are to achieve the necessary support for the charter by the citizens of Europe.</seg>
<seg>after its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will help me as analysis scheme for this report and, as far as my personal intellectual potential and staff resources available to me, I will allow you to rights and countries divided analysis of the implementation of the Charter in the fifteen Member States of the Union.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to begin by echoing the words of Mr Moscovici and to acknowledge the important contribution made by the members of the European Parliament to the debate in the Convention, and in particular the role of Mr Mendes de Vigo, whom he has played in the Praesidium of the Convention in the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg>I would just like to dwell on some of the most important elements of this debate.</seg>
<seg>The Convention established fundamental rights, from the various legal instruments of the Council of Europe, which result in treaties and the constitutions of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:</seg>
<seg>Given the current state of affairs, our Parliament must make it clear to the Turkish people that at present there are at least three conditions for its accession.</seg>
<seg>Such conditions, only by decision of the Parliament could not have been asked.</seg>
<seg>That is why I took the proposals made by Mr Morillon on the conditions for the accession of Turkey to the knowledge which deserve a great deal of interest.</seg>
<seg>I am happy to be able to say that the Turkish Government recognised in the meantime, this accession partnership as a basis for further cooperation so that we can have a legitimate hope to achieve precisely that what we wanted to achieve with our policy, namely the forces of reform in Turkey to help to give new impetus to the reform process and it with regard to the membership of the European Union want to make progress.</seg>
<seg>For me, the most important factor is that after Helsinki in Turkey, in which the Turkish public, a debate was released on the conditions for the accession of Turkey to the European Union, a debate which supports and calls for the forces of reform of the country.</seg>
<seg>This text is present to you the position.</seg>
<seg>It is time to give the necessary impetus for a future accession.</seg>
<seg>I would nevertheless - I do not know how the vote goes out - which urgently ask Turkey to take this issue seriously.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes the European Parliament for the reception and care of relations with the political parties, the NGOs and the press to start actively, and is endeavouring to improve their difficult and tense relationship for Grand National Assembly.</seg>
<seg>Mr Morillon, your report is, in my view, very realistic and responsible.</seg>
<seg>during your visit to Turkey in March, you mentioned the problem of the Kurdish people, just as it is today, at least with names.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, it is of great naivety and great arrogance to assume that the Europeans could persuade the Turks to one - and I quote - “radical change in their habits and its mentality”.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report fills me with great concern.</seg>
<seg>(a5-0325/2000) recommendation by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the adoption of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487/1/00 - c5-0570/2000 - 2000/2233 (avc))</seg>
<seg>In any case, we must at the next occasions when we discuss the power of data processing, to realise that a engmaschigere is necessary and, therefore, greater legal security which the citizens control.</seg>
<seg>Recommendation (a5-0325/2000) Duff / Voggenhuber</seg>
<seg>We would like to make the following points:</seg>
<seg>The rights contained in the Charter are enshrined and by the national parliaments are already defended in national constitutions, which represent the people and their cultures close.</seg>
<seg>1, plans: collective expulsions are fixed illegally”, that this ban in times of war or in cases of serious problems can be exposed to the public and in Article 52 (.</seg>
<seg>We will give a brief statement in the following to these three reasons, in that order.</seg>
<seg>The right of a government to the arbitrary suspension of its own constitution is characteristic of a tyranny.</seg>
<seg>But today we have every reason, I repeat, to be proud of how we dealt with this important stage for Europe.</seg>
<seg>A society which knows only rights, but not commitments becomes an egotistical society.</seg>
<seg>This is our struggle is primarily made so that the promised fundamental rights are implemented through political decisions.</seg>
<seg>The Convention method is very interesting and efficient for the development of a basic text, which requires a broad consensus, but in no way justifies taking away from the European Parliament, as representatives of the peoples of Europe and also the opportunity to amend the text.</seg>
<seg>This Charter must be improved, and our Parliament must propose a strategy to its updating and enrichment.</seg>
<seg>It should therefore not be decided and proclaimed at the Council meeting in Nice, but of the summit the stimulus for a European debate should be given on the Charter.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately, the tendency seems to be to pursue the path of reason to suppose that a charter with a purely political and not binding scope to national governments.</seg>
<seg>designation by the Cologne Summit as a “committee”, this has declared itself to “convention”, a concept which is in disastrous way of 1793, in fact and the excesses of the French Revolution, in the form of terrorism, which can be justified from a Convention.</seg>
<seg>The method applied, made ausgrenzungen and the uncertainty regarding the nature of this text, a clear throw light on the new totalitarian approaches which already exist in the heart of the process of European integration.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately, the European Parliament, in this field to the full implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam has a konsultative function, but there is a way to use them in such a way that right decisions are delayed.</seg>
<seg>However, the views of the divided.</seg>
<seg>That was a century ago like that, and after it had been pushed into the background, something it has now completely to the fore.</seg>
<seg>What we want in any case, these are opportunities which allow criminals to get through the back door in the internal market.</seg>
<seg>We also support the creation of a future cooperation office for the support of the fight against organised crime and money laundering, as well as the various proposed measures to achieve these objectives.</seg>
<seg>That is a provisional unit of judicial cooperation is established, which consists of one representative for each of the public prosecutor's office, judges and police officers with staatsanwaltschaftlichen powers of our 15 Member States.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, as a Member of the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee, I am deeply involved in Turkey the prospect of accession of Turkey.</seg>
<seg>The behaviour of Turkey on Cyprus is unacceptable.</seg>
<seg>However, we support the critical comment by the rapporteur on the lack of an effective evaluation of the granting of loans from the EIB and the lack of transparency and public control of the activities of the Bank.</seg>
<seg>Despite its differences and is Turkey was an integral part of the European reality.</seg>
<seg>The inclusion of Turkey into the European Union has become a question which today is more topical than ever.</seg>
<seg>Mr Morillon said that Turkey is to be at pains to see the European Union as exclusively Christian club for her which seeks to exclude Turkey.</seg>
<seg>Turkey will then become real democratic state if it had to learn to live with their past have will, as it has created the democratic Germany which we demanded the same living with its past.</seg>
<seg>As soon as the government in Ankara have understood that the status quo is not acceptable for Europe and the rest of the world, great progress will be able to be reunited island and a comprehensive, a fair, lasting and international law appropriate solution be found.</seg>
<seg>Why are not all these questions in the European Commission's report mentioned?</seg>
<seg>In this balanced framework we must continue our working decided to the promotion of rapprochement between the Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg>If you examine the Armenian issue in connection with the EU accession - remember what I say the Armenian issue in connection with the EU accession - then the project, which we have discussed today, will not start so is this.</seg>
<seg>For this reason we call so much that after the first five years of the implementation of the Barcelona process is a result drawn in Marseilles, so that we are in a position to lay down the necessary guidelines.</seg>
<seg>But we have managed to maintain dialogue and sensitive issues such as stability, terrorism, emigration, to raise human rights.</seg>
<seg>Apart from this, the Council has attempted to make especially since 1995 for the Mediterranean, more extensive resources which are appropriate to the objectives of the partnership.</seg>
<seg>This is an extremely important issue, and I would also like to say, as someone who comes from Central Europe.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, as you know, there is a saying in English, according to a show without star like Hamlet performance without first totengräber.</seg>
<seg>We are about the combination of policies to internal market issues and a consensus on the introduction of the cumulation at the time of the conclusion of sub-regional free trade agreements between the partners and the adoption of harmonised protocol on the cumulation.</seg>
<seg>We also have the Commission's intention to give new impetus to the Barcelona process note with satisfaction.</seg>
<seg>I drew attention to these aspects, because the key to revive the process is to be found in this area and the political agenda must be increased in Barcelona.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, our main task should be to guarantee the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean, and we must do everything in our power to enable this cooperation are enforced and the commitments on the basis we say, self-interested generosity - of the European Union to be used efficiently.</seg>
<seg>These are important and practical questions which I would like to ask - and I thank Mr Brok, who made directly this debate before the appropriate consultation for the Presidency and the Commission possible on these issues.</seg>
<seg>The world is moving to a in the meantime unstoppable globalisation, and in such a scenario an organisation is necessary in large blocs action on the vast area of international competition as the main players.</seg>
<seg>It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries of the EUR 4.7 billion given up in the MEDA i-program which expired 1999, only almost a quarter.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the Commission's proposal for a new impetus is positive and we fully agree with the priorities which Mr Patten mentioned in his speech and reaffirmed here this afternoon.</seg>
<seg>This is an alarm signal for the European Union to play a much more active role in the Mediterranean and which has strengthened our European continent historically and culturally.</seg>
<seg>But it is even worse that at the same time as we exchange different points of view in this House, essentially, sometimes even more Palestinian is killed.</seg>
<seg>Aid for reconstruction</seg>
<seg>If we do not help the resources for the implementation of this regulation in December, then today we thresh empty straw.</seg>
<seg>However, we must want and our eyes not before the role they play, do not complete, and the Member States do not do that we hope to see.</seg>
<seg>The mass media in that region were often responsible for the tragedy; media are used, which are quite freely according to the rules of our democracies.</seg>
<seg>I am also a very happy man, because the European Parliament, as I believe that succeeded with constant pressure, a Constitution which could not be originally called particularly favourable to change for the better.</seg>
<seg>Once again, unnecessary expenditure on unnecessary meetings really must be avoided.</seg>
<seg>However, we must not only direct our view on Kosovo.</seg>
<seg>In fact that some programmes of the performance reserve in the so-called “power-related reserve, which were allocated is regrettable.</seg>
<seg>In Feira he accorded the status of the countries involved in the stabilisation and association process as potential candidates for accession.</seg>
<seg>I refer once again to the main real objectives of the CARDS programme: institutional stabilisation in the sense of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and recovery, as well as regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg>It was right that the European Union reacted positively to the seizure of power by President Kostunica.</seg>
<seg>A first meeting took place on 6 November.</seg>
<seg>What initiative in accordance with the request of the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, the Presidency intends to take in order to play a more active role, so that the full and complete implementation of the UN peace plan is guaranteed?</seg>
<seg>How can this recovery without the settlement of this conflict?</seg>
<seg>I can only say that France and Germany - and I say no more than the Council here - raised these issues on a bilateral meeting last week in vittel and approved the creation of a working group for the solution of this problem.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, the Union gives further substantial aid to these two countries, through its various programmes, especially TACIS.</seg>
<seg>The presidency would like to take the question from the honourable Member to remove the cause some confusion.</seg>
<seg>Allow me to clarify, so that he knows that the request of both texts is to strengthen the criminal framework for combating organized gangs of human traffickers.</seg>
<seg>In the report which the Turkish Council of Ministers on 21 September this year adopted reform programme, the changes in the law are included the section on several projects in: inclusion of measures to increase the effective equality of men and women in the socialeducational area in civil code; stronger fight against violence in the family; better condemnation of these acts of violence by setting up special family judges, as well as the ban on the possibility of a penalty reduction with crimes for reasons of welcoming violation.</seg>
<seg>The Presidency has to give a reply on this.</seg>
<seg>next week will take place in France at my invitation a meeting of the European Conference, namely with the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg>Do you that model, namely Austria bilateral majority decision-making in the future will be an instrument believe in order to take decisions at the European institutions past and to create a new institution or a new group here in order to be able to get round the unanimity in the Council?</seg>
<seg>The Council has not discussed the letter, but the Presidency has, of course, Mr Cem think the text of his answer was sent to all Member States.</seg>
<seg>It is, moreover, from the opinion of Mr Cem, as the President-in-Office of the Council, did not reply to Mr Moscovici, according to its opinion is the Cyprus question with the further consideration of the accession partnership between Turkey and the European Union, cannot be taken into consideration?</seg>
<seg>We must be aware that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is far more than a simple agreement on fishing and that the agreement should not, as he knows a deterioration in relations between the European Union and Morocco could be forthcoming.</seg>
<seg>I must, therefore, to express my scepticism about the outcome.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that this is the strengthening of cooperation between the Member States, but also the protection of the rights of individuals to be made possible.</seg>
<seg>The supplementary questions must be made by other Members.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, the Commission has announced in on 4 October 2000 adopted a report on the European Union's oil supplies, the fact that it will submit a plan for energy saving and the diversification of energy sources to the European Council in Gothenburg, which is to help the energy efficiency in buildings, particularly in the transport and to strengthen.</seg>
<seg>It is in this spirit that we raised 9 on the occasion of the vote on the resolution on the embargo within the framework of the Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations on November an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with the international human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg>It is therefore a matter for NATO to take the measures which it considers necessary, so that this does not happen again.</seg>
<seg>(The sitting was suspended at 6.55 and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)</seg>
<seg>If we give money, it is the prerogative of that which gives money to clearly define the political objectives and the Commissioner did it again and again.</seg>
<seg>His visit will send out a signal and the entire policy which we are pursuing, give a perspective.</seg>
<seg>If we see it in a region in which political arguments are quite possible, we are mistaken.</seg>
<seg>And the second requirement, which was raised by the two rapporteurs and must be supported by all of us, is the regular consultation and information of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>The Heads of Government also underlined the determination of the Union to build on this process of technical and economic assistance.</seg>
<seg>It was Parliament that supported the Commission's proposal for the creation of a European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg>As the House knows, we do not believe that an explicit reference in the regulation required.</seg>
<seg>The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg>for cooperation, the participants an enlarged and updated framework which forms the work programme for the next decade, agreed Asia Europe 2000.</seg>
<seg>I think that in Europe, it reminds us of the importance we have for Asia, not only in terms of economic and trade, although it should be referred to the fact that Asia is due, amongst other things, the recovery of its economic situation, to the fact that we have kept our word and was Asian markets for exports in the last two years openly.</seg>
<seg>I believe it was a very good political commitment, but we have some problems.</seg>
<seg>As you know, the Commission will take ASEM very seriously, and we support the Commission in this regard.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to improve the existing mechanisms for the implementation of Community law in order to increase legal certainty and to overcome the current slow pace.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, it should encourage the creation of new regional organisations and start where there is already a presence of the Community, as in the western and southern Pacific.</seg>
<seg>That is the condition for a truly sustainable fishing industry.</seg>
<seg>I believe that the future of fishing in international waters, depends on these organisations and the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, is still too small to the attitude of the United Nations, both in the Convention and in 1982 mentioned in New York to defend here we have a very active presence in these organisations in favour of a responsible fisheries.</seg>
<seg>I therefore also believe that a particularly important role for the Commission and you should fishermen to cooperate request and propose solutions, we can all agree on that.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the Commission has to accept any number of tasks in connection with the negotiations, which must be conducted in the context of the regional fisheries organisations.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I have the same problem as Mr Nicholson, a much more acute.</seg>
<seg>So far, the proposals for a solution to the Committee on Agriculture.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes we even wonder to what extent perhaps the cyclical sales crisis is caused by speculation of the company structures mentioned, which find themselves control of the sector in this way, depending on their interests.</seg>
<seg>The additional European Union aid, which is proposed in the Garot report, is, in my view, unnecessary at a time when in Agenda 2000 and the forthcoming enlargement with Central and Eastern Europe, the reform of the agricultural policy is on the agenda.</seg>
<seg>I almost regard this as a major achievement, which the rapporteur put down here, which shows how we can make in administration, listening to a certain objective, which is clearly here.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, the largest producers and those who are integrated with stored companies would have been far from this instrument and the merit of the systems are already task on their individual savings, bankers' loan, balance cash.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first to directly to say that I welcome in principle the Commission proposal to set up a compensation fund in the sense of the Austrian agriculture.</seg>
<seg>I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.</seg>
<seg>After hearing you want market organisation for intensive animal husbandry and a reduction in agricultural policy if it is dependent on the ground, production dependent on the ground.</seg>
<seg>The pig market rules exist and we should not make the mistake of the existing pig market regulations which work in principle, in question.</seg>
<seg>In the Commission's view, it is the farmers who join the compensation fund to subject to a discipline is justified, simply because this wars in return a guaranteed income, while others which do not join, do not get that income guarantee.</seg>
<seg>(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)</seg>
<seg>The income which are based on the VAT accounts for traditional own resources 36% and 15% of the total amount.</seg>
<seg>Another part of the reform, which is a priority pointed out by the Court to a large extent, is to increase the value of the product and success measurement within a system of allocation of resources in accordance with the terms of the priorities and clearly defined, quantifiable objectives.</seg>
<seg>That is a good thing, and I would like you, Mr Karlsson, the members of the Court of Auditors very warmly and the services of the Court of Auditors, I would like to thank you for supporting the reform of the Commission in such a way in your report.</seg>
<seg>I now hope very much that this proposal at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice has not simply ad side or swept under the carpet, but that we deal with it seriously.</seg>
<seg>The reality, as it is presented in the annual report is a rather sobering.</seg>
<seg>The number of past mistakes are too high, such a guarantee would be accepted.</seg>
<seg>The figure for high and civil engineering works was too low around 240 million.</seg>
<seg>I could imagine the report of the Court of Auditors also more user-friendly, underpinned by clear recommendations, for example, or two per chapter.</seg>
<seg>In 1995 were adopted a convention on the protection of the financial interests of the Communities.</seg>
<seg>The Commission and the Member States should consider it in this light and make use of the results of the report as a tool for improving the management of the financial resources of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>I am aware that this report and the work of the Parliament will help in the context of the forthcoming discharge procedure for greater vigilance with regard to the Community expenditure.</seg>
<seg>And now, Madam President, I would like to mention, and that we should wait that somebody comes from the Council.</seg>
<seg>The Court of Auditors did not give precise data on as in past years where these errors occurred.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union is approaching, and in the report by the Court of Auditors, it is clear that in the applicant countries a great deal still remains to be done.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we met recently a Convention with the Court of Auditors, with the question of whether we can obtain information before a progress report from the Court of Auditors for the secret kämmerchen and also agreed on the fact that we actually keep quiet about it.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to address the Council and ask the question why the decision on Article 24 of the financial regulation is still outstanding.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps some common sense of the European Union can play its rightful place in history to the solution of the problem and George Bush, namely that in the waste paper basket.</seg>
<seg>It is not our task to make scapegoats either in our institutions, nor in our Member States.</seg>
<seg>. I am pleased about the fact that Members of Parliament are of the opinion that the situation was more satisfactory with regard to the procedure for the presentation of the annual report in Parliament and in the Committee on Budgetary Control, as in previous years.</seg>
<seg>We will have the opportunity to discuss all points.</seg>
<seg>If it is crucial from the point of view of the auditor, we call on all the facts, which must be mentioned.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and gentlemen, as you will have noticed, the last part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors has been marred by a fatal virus that has crept in his contribution and to this House.</seg>
<seg>Some amendments, such as Nos 1 and 18 are in connection with matters which affect mainly the United Kingdom, and it must be said that all the representatives of the United Kingdom, from the political groups, the Socialists, who are the People's Party and the Greens, it with great vigour to have defended and her in the Committee on the Environment has adopted.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in March of this year, we adopted the directive on Passenger cableway installations.</seg>
<seg>We are of the opinion that, in these cases, the trade should not be burdened with the manufacturer obligations of product safety law.</seg>
<seg>We have heard the reasons for them and for the resumption of the arguments of the industry, which has been expressed in the committee.</seg>
<seg>It should be sufficient if the vendor can give general information about products to the buyer and the lack of information and documents refers.</seg>
<seg>Finally, a small request to the European Commission to Article 4 on the European standards and the question of whether these must be published.</seg>
<seg>The exceptions which apply to sales mechanisms of voluntary organisations and non-profit-making organisations, as well as the derogations for markets or from the hull sold second-hand goods are welcomed by me.</seg>
<seg>credibility of product safety and after-sales increase the value of the European label in particular moment difficult and forward-looking.</seg>
<seg>If we ask the Commission elsewhere in the near future, to submit a proposal on the safety of services, it is hard to see why we are to regulate the aspects of the services here with and want to wait, instead of the Commission's proposal, which are already demarcation between the individual provisions that difficulties will arise and that legal uncertainty in the course of time will increase.</seg>
<seg>I would like to explain briefly the centre of gravity of this proposal.</seg>
<seg>We are now taking the opening of the system for third countries, especially for the accession candidates: we simplified procedures for the implementation of emergency measures at Community level, so that we in the recommendation of a regulatory committee to be able to take action immediately.</seg>
<seg>No substantial additional responsibility is imposed by the new regulation on these shops.</seg>
<seg>The proposal in Amendment No 11 to replace the word “manufacturer” by “dienstleistungserbringer” would not create clarity, but it would cause confusion, because the directive does not contain a definition of “dienstleistungserbringer”.</seg>
<seg>The Commission supported the rapid establishment of such a network, but this still to be agreed between the Member States.</seg>
<seg>Such certification can be used as evidence, it is not a 100% safety.</seg>
<seg>I explained in detail now, why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36 and part of Amendment No 7, as well as the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of Amendment No 27 and 34, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31, 35, as well as part of Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, since the Commission's current proposal is improved by these amendments and will be more clarity.</seg>
<seg>Obviously we do not belong to the Group of the Party of European Socialists, in view of Mr Crespo as an Italian socialist.</seg>
<seg>In my view, there is no contradiction between Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the order I leave the decision to the President, and I would remind the House, however, that I am in any case against all three amendments.</seg>
<seg>Those who are not part of the European Union Mediterranean countries have to fight to tensions in the economic development of the most serious problems certainly due to the regional inequalities to be constantly there.</seg>
<seg>The attention that legal immigrants in question, which must be created, instruments for financial support that all young people in the sense of a harmonised European immigration policy as well as appropriate legal instruments to ensure fair treatment of these immigrants wishing to return to complete a technical or higher education in the European countries to their country of origin, in order to take up a professional activity there.</seg>
<seg>I would like to highlight a factor which really decisive in this matter I reviewed the lack of equality in the labour market.</seg>
<seg>. (PT) late, but still the Commission presented the programme for the support of the Community framework strategy for equality between men and women (20012005) which differs from the previous programmes and, in particular, by the end of this year of the expiry of fourth framework programme head on.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, some of the improvements proposed by my group into account, on the other hand, were called for studies which, together with the situation of women in the national labour markets and inadequate access to the insurance systems, which we need to deal with, gender-based statistics reliable data.</seg>
<seg>- My party has serious reservations about the application of Community law to the sale of consumer goods in place of the application of the concept of the mutual recognition of standards.</seg>
<seg>Now we understand this, and the amendments tabled by labour offer the guarantee that the loading remains untouched by voluntary organisations and is excluded from the directive.</seg>
<seg>Amendment No 15, the Commission gives plenty of conflict in the language regime of the Agency, which is, in our view, a very worrying development.</seg>
<seg>The simplification of the decision-making process, the establishment of decentralized use centres, not only in Pristina, which would be a separation of yugoslavia) and finding a solution to the problem of the dual structure with board of directors and administrative committee could as positive measures for the recovery of the major shortcomings within the European Agency for Reconstruction demonstrate.</seg>
<seg>We are therefore voting against the Commission proposal and Parliament's report.</seg>
<seg>an adaptation of the existing Community legislation in this area can therefore be regarded as justified.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, the fund offers the possibility that, in the form of cofinancing by Member States more or less disguised State aid is granted.</seg>
<seg>. (EL) Despite its serious failings in the Morillon report clearly goes further than the Commission's proposal on the accession partnership between the European Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg>However, we have voted against it.</seg>
<seg>We must recognise, like the rapporteur, that Turkey has made progress in certain areas and that positive signals are to be registered.</seg>
<seg>Our Parliament has fought for this recognition, since 1987 and the adoption of this amendment is proof of the coherence of Parliament on this issue.</seg>
<seg>The Union must provide more concrete proposals and design the enlargement to include Turkey as an essential geopolitical strategy.</seg>
<seg>Such ulterior motives are not worthy of Europe and Turkey.</seg>
<seg>For several years, I know the role of one of these regional organisations, the NAFO (organization for fisheries in the north-west atlantic) as a Member of the delegation for relations with Canada, to see that the States of the region, including Canada, belong, as well as all those who use traditional fishing zones in the region, such as France, Spain and other European countries.</seg>
<seg>It will only be satisfied if its own gunboat fleet under the star circle banner carries out their fisheries policy.</seg>
<seg>The most important does not therefore be satisfactory hegemony ambitions of the Commission by weakening the European position, which would contradict the proper implementation of the principle of subsidiarity completely.</seg>
<seg>Finally, after laborious negotiations, a final result which deserves to be defended.</seg>
<seg>With this proposal, which is aimed at the replacement of three directives on waste incineration, the quality of air, water is aimed at improving the soil and public health by reducing the emissions of rubbish particles in connection with the incineration and co-incineration and, in particular, the emission of dioxins, furanen and heavy metals.</seg>
<seg>It seems important to me, in addition to refer to the innovation that is no longer only from emissions into the atmosphere, but also in the water and the soil is mentioned.</seg>
<seg>During the discussion of the proposal has been improved.</seg>
<seg>The introduction of much stricter limit values for nitrogen oxide new co-incineration in cement kilns, for example, is a step forward, which will provide an incentive for the reduction of emissions, even if the proposed standards do not reflect the state of the art.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and gentlemen, in particular an excusing you, Mr Blokland, that I was delayed for several minutes.</seg>
<seg>Finally, I would like to say that this directive is an important contribution to the reduction of the negative effects on the environment and the risks to human health.</seg>
<seg>It would be taken into account to the European Parliament high, if it makes the concrete implementation of the essential principle of solidarity for the rejection of any form of discrimination, which would give the fight against exclusion and in view of the responsibilities of the introduction of a system of new impetus in the name.</seg>
<seg>However, there are huge differences from one country to another, and there is a lack of detailed and comparable statistics, which provide information on it certainly which system where the way in which the best results should be what its weaknesses, etc. from this very reason, are, in my view, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has written statement stressed the need for the Commission to before the definition of any accepted rules for the supplementary sickness insurance issues a Green Paper in which all these disparate data and the relevant information to be structured and evaluated.</seg>
<seg>Until now, this has, to a certain extent, a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg>The danger that not entirely healthy citizens and older people because of their high risk only private waste can allow themselves to be assured, is not acceptable to society development.</seg>
<seg>The second approach, which the rapporteur in his introduction described and which is supported by many colleagues, is the promotion of the necessary regulations and codes of conduct for the introduction of forms of mutual acceptance of the costs between the insurers who guarantee all the provision of high-quality services and working against the dangers of the development of discriminatory practices and a risk and consumer choice.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, it cannot be right that is dependent on the money, which is high on the waiting list.</seg>
<seg>The new proposal from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is right to make the first and only then adopt a survey in the form of a Green Paper, whether we need a directive or a recommendation.</seg>
<seg>In the Netherlands, structural changes to the system we are discussing at the moment.</seg>
<seg>On this basis, the Commission should take an initiative and expressing specific aspects as guidelines for the health systems of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>An absolute unity solution cannot give it is probably the insurance.</seg>
<seg>I therefore believe that we need to Mr Rocard for his report, in which he calls on the Commission to a service, a Green Paper, which offer us a view of the current state of insurance in the Member States and at the same time, the starting position for the future, and allowed the content agree.</seg>
<seg>Both build on a three-column model: national, operational and private.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the supplementary pensions, the European Union has certain provisions, and it also a Green Paper tabled, of which the proposal for a directive came out.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Rocard and congratulate him on his report, and I congratulate Mr Marinos to his committee's opinion.</seg>
<seg>This study will be the basis for a report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament in which initiatives or measures are proposed.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets, I am pleased that they have all been adopted.</seg>
<seg>We have voted in favour of the basic data from the programme which the multi-dimensional tackle the phenomenon which measures in the areas of health, education and housing, consistency and complementarity are among others, neighbouring policies, as well as the participation of non-state operators, also from social exclusion the people affected.</seg>
<seg>That means that we must use the cyclical growth stages, in order to create a balance or surplus.</seg>
<seg>Here I would just remind you of the fact that the last Ecofin Council asked the Commission to take up from next year this long-term aspect of public finances in relation to the ageing of the population on the evaluation.</seg>
<seg>One of the positive features of the programme of the Dutch is the special consideration - as I said at the beginning, the impact of the ageing of the population on the national budget for the coming years.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the accounts results in a surplus of one and a half points of gross domestic product for the year 2000 in the case of Germany.</seg>
<seg>If we add the development of exchange rate of the euro to the dollar, we have a clear negative impact on inflation.</seg>
<seg>It is aimed at introducing a public distribution system with private capital education systems in agreement and they are clearly compatible with support for the creation of a specific unit trusts, which can receive long-term tax incentives and with the solution to the problem of the ageing of the population is helpful, perhaps.</seg>
<seg>Third, leading us results from this principle, namely the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg>That several proposals for legislation are currently being discussed, all of this must be reminded the efficiency and effectiveness of Community regulations and therefore, as I hope, the confidence of consumers will increase.</seg>
<seg>But this relatively low rate of prevalence is not a reason for complacency.</seg>
<seg>Quite frankly, I was disappointed that in yesterday's declaration by Prime Minister Jospin has not acknowledged the extremely positive role of the Community in recent years.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the increased incidence of BSE, requires not only in France but also in other Member States, for declarations.</seg>
<seg>The Veterinary Office of the Commission focuses on preventive measures to combat BSE, now top priority to controls in the Member States.</seg>
<seg>As regards their safety, I would like to repeat that there is already a whole range of measures which ensure that meat and bone meal do not represent a threat in the transmission of BSE.</seg>
<seg>Yes, it is hard to believe that it has taken four years in order to adopt a measure which I consider the protection of public health as a fundamental.</seg>
<seg>Mr President-in-Office, I would explicitly that the Council has finally its opinion on TSE regulation.</seg>
<seg>In the current situation, the only option is to break the cycle of the BSE infection to ban the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs.</seg>
<seg>In this connection, I would like to mention that we have tabled an amendment which I hope will be adopted by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.</seg>
<seg>The policy must make changes here, so that really responsible for this crisis is the responsibility and concrete decisions with a first step towards the completion of this dramatic crisis are done.</seg>
<seg>They must therefore be taken into account.</seg>
<seg>The firm labelling for beef, which it does not concern a minimum labelling which is only for two and a half months into force, allows a normal traceability of the origin of the animals, and that we have specified risk material far too late prohibited.</seg>
<seg>The citizens need to be fully informed about the characteristics of the test which I have mentioned.</seg>
<seg>Mr President-in-Office of the Council, at that time, you have nothing, or almost nothing is being done, as well as your colleagues in view of the effects of Chernobyl, the AIDS epidemic and the contaminated blood products are dormant. as justification were always indicated, we do not want to delay the public in panic.</seg>
<seg>The French ban will cause a considerable need increase, but this is the supply of raw materials is limited.</seg>
<seg>Consumers have lost their confidence, and in order to put a stop to this phenomenon, compulsory BSE tests for cattle and sheep must be introduced.</seg>
<seg>It is now more important than to work in the spirit of the Commission's proposal on the fact that animal bone meal meet the highest safety standards.</seg>
<seg>Otherwise, I am no time, once does not agree entirely with what our colleagues, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs others said.</seg>
<seg>Because blithely times, the Council and the Commission, you have a sufficient financial basis and to carry out an energetic policy now.</seg>
<seg>We must address this problem.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am very pleased to hear in this House that the CAP at any price is to be revised.</seg>
<seg>We have the soil, the appropriate climate and the know-how to increase in order to replace animal meal immediately by not genetically modified plant proteins, and yet we have not the right to cultivate on our own soil the plant proteins necessary for feeding the animals and feeding the population while at the same time we finance. set-aside land for this reason, our group have tabled an amendment in which the Council and the Commission are invited to look for ways in order in Europe, the cultivation of these plant proteins, which represent a suitable replacement for prionenhaltiges animal meal and American genetically modified soya.</seg>
<seg>Food must guarantee safe food for the people.</seg>
<seg>I think it is a model that France has finally decided to take this step.</seg>
<seg>But the gentlemen do not help them!</seg>
<seg>That is why I am surprised that, under these circumstances, kadaver may still be processed or used.</seg>
<seg>Recently in Britain, the Phillips inquiry was published on BSE.</seg>
<seg>I would like to suggest to the European Commission to use the precautionary principle with beef from France.</seg>
<seg>We therefore had no certainty and know what the scientific evidence situation is and what action is needed.</seg>
<seg>In addition, I have of course taken note of all the proposals, which I am very sensitive.</seg>
<seg>If people come from the Member States and tell me that the legislation have not been properly implemented or not, then we would have to think again about it, but perhaps not because the scientists tell us that it was necessary, but because it is in the European Union, the compliance with the law.</seg>
<seg>If we do not want to listen to us, then one invites us best not even in.</seg>
<seg>The Commission is of the opinion that the readmission agreements for clarification and coordination of these measures play an important role, and now the negotiations is the first readmission agreements of the Community to Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco.</seg>
<seg>What proposals does the Commission on the basis of Article 31 of the Treaty on European Union?</seg>
<seg>(The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg>The aim in this period was the reduction of the public deficit to achieve a more satisfactory monetary policy, a lower interest rates and a higher growth.</seg>
<seg>I always say that the euro was not introduced on 1 January 2002, we have said it in our bag; we have it in different coin, but we have it in our pockets.</seg>
<seg>The current limit values for nitrogen dioxide and lead have not been crossed, not even the ozone threshold in the Athens city centre in accordance with Directive 92/72/eg. but it is evident that the calculations were made in this summer.</seg>
<seg>Subject: a representative of the Directorate-General for Competition from the European Commission believed state aid for the audiovisual sector at a seminar of the French Presidency on cultural industries that would be imposed legal investment commitments to the broadcasters only by the fact that they were urgently required by law, state aid.</seg>
<seg>It must be respected and protected '.</seg>
<seg>But that does not happen automatically, because this new growth is extremely inegalitär and can be monitored, as we in the USA for almost a decade, by continuing instances of insecurity and exclusion, poverty and the urban ghettobildung are accompanied.</seg>
<seg>The governments of the Member States did not adopt this definition, which is a little too easy and too weak.</seg>
<seg>In the cold climate developing it is more and more people who cannot keep up the sidelines turned out and are excluded.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in this House we hear very often be praised, like a litany of the European social model and the social market economy, which mean many a contrast to the chaotic model of the United States of America would form.</seg>
<seg>(technical disturbance)</seg>
<seg>This is an enormous amount of money.</seg>
<seg>In addition, all the political levels must be involved.</seg>
<seg>I agree that it is essential that the causes of poverty better to know, and I are in favour of preventive measures by means of innovative and practical answers, including the social partners, local and national administrations and the joint action of the citizens against exclusion as a result of mergers, restructuring and relocation of companies, depopulation and strong settlement of the urban areas.</seg>
<seg>We had a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and the role of social and structural reforms.</seg>
<seg>This is a legal problem because in the text of the Treaty only on social exclusion and poverty is not mentioned.</seg>
<seg>These proposals are, I think, a pragmatic response to your request.</seg>
<seg>However, agreement on the strategy does not necessarily mean agreement on the detail.</seg>
<seg>If we define a clear and binding framework for the Member States, the various systems, which must meet these requirements should have a longer period of probation.</seg>
<seg>Renewable energy will not be a panacea for solving this problem, but no one should be in any doubt that they can contribute considerably to his report, and also to the diversification of energy sources and to reduce our dependency on oil and natural gas, which would make us, on the other hand, well.</seg>
<seg>I want to reiterate three of our demands.</seg>
<seg>The definition of a realistic objective indicative values can only increase the confidence of the citizens in the energy policy can be pursued.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, a consistent policy in the field of renewable energy sources has a symbolic value for the future of Europe.</seg>
<seg>With these agreements, the Member States of the European Union must demonstrate that they will make a contribution to achieving the Kyoto objectives.</seg>
<seg>It would be if a category were excluded, the gaining of energy from waste, on the whole, can contribute to a pity it is for small projects or as part of the accounts.</seg>
<seg>The formation of peat in assimilation and forest faithful creation is the other vegetable biomasses.</seg>
<seg>I would like to inform Mr Chichester on the fact that in my own country at Sea coast quite modern wind-powered devices have been installed. this is a project which is undoubtedly taken very soon in operation.</seg>
<seg>The dispute over the abandonment of nuclear power in Sweden and Germany and it is led, among other things, has shown that without any visible environmentally friendly and at a competitive price energy alternatives which can be made the debate is inevitable in the sand.</seg>
<seg>That is why the Member States must draw up binding objectives.</seg>
<seg>That is why I am optimistic about the future potential of renewable energy sources, if the right incentives are created.</seg>
<seg>I think it was a great deal of courage to the position of renewable energy again and again in such a way as she deserved it.</seg>
<seg>A very sharp rise in oil prices will doubtless lead us with greater rigour aware of the problems with our dependence on fossil energy sources.</seg>
<seg>We cannot therefore accept Amendment No 28.</seg>
<seg>It is a sure, however, that the terms used do not constitute an infringement of its right of initiative and that they in the internal electricity market must not be incompatible.</seg>
<seg>In the Commission for the reconstruction of Tajikistan, where 25 000 widows live amongst 26 participants was only a woman.</seg>
<seg>Although the proportion of women has been relatively small, studies have shown that the presence of women in the peacekeeping troops of the UN will lead to an improvement in the relationship with the local population and the general standards.</seg>
<seg>The report lessons in this area is detailed and repetitions in which we ask the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats to take in terms of an official document.</seg>
<seg>Politically speaking, I can interpret this Amendment No 19 rather than tactical defeat or tactical withdrawal rate as substantive compromise, and that should be the subject of women.</seg>
<seg>They have been held.</seg>
<seg>In Portugal, where the women have access to the diplomacy only after the revolution of April 1974, Ana Gomes, has recently in East Timor and our ambassador in Indonesia, the role of women and their awareness of the problems and the suffering of a people who were 25 years in his freedom struggle alone, which can be exercised world and, in particular, here in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>So far this very few of them have done two or three, I hear.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, in future, this dimension must be taken into account in the development of the policy of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, the conditions are not defined and no distinctions are taken.</seg>
<seg>Please send to the Council our protest.</seg>
<seg>They are people with other experiences experience, which are essential for the policy and in particular for the settlement of disputes.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, if the sector to be legally regulated needs to be reviewed, must, of course, a number of points.</seg>
<seg>In the last few weeks I have found that both sides of international trade union circles and at certain national trade unions great interest exists.</seg>
<seg>You are second objection, also for the fact that housewives paid?</seg>
<seg>All those who work at the moment black, received a work under decent social conditions.</seg>
<seg>More and more frequently resulting from this project has two to three families united and a single help working together.</seg>
<seg>We were in a plenary session during the first October part-session, when we heard in the debate on the situation in Yugoslavia by the courageous reaction of the Serbian people, as we remember immediately, you, ladies and gentlemen, who called for lifting of international sanctions.</seg>
<seg>Europe has shown that the viability of its civilisation in world history and its political creator strength in shaping the future development.</seg>
<seg>There must not be any doubt about the fact that the question of the status of Kosovo is a democratic issue.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, we would like to have a chance to prove the Europe that we are under its own steam, recognising the true principles of democracy capable of developing the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro in Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg>I must say that I - when I spoke to you at the time, it was very impressed, as you have carried out this very difficult situation, and how you decided was.</seg>
<seg>That is brought into the next protocol in order, Mr Watson.</seg>
<seg>Access to documents and information on the activities of the institutions will also allow the citizens to make the decision-making bodies responsible and proposes to greater effectiveness.</seg>
<seg>The fifth important amendment is, in my opinion that annual reports, particularly on the documents which must remain secret or which are still secret at least.</seg>
<seg>This question is still unknown, and there is also the possibility of provisions that restrict transparency more remain in force, and has, among other things, on this point, we have tabled amendments.</seg>
<seg>The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is opposed to the proposal to exempt documents which influence in terms of foreign policy and security issues, automatically and as a whole from the principle of public access.</seg>
<seg>If we want the people really can exercise their rights, we need trained staff who take and pathfinders by the complex labyrinth of the institutions have the information looking for citizens to a certain extent at hand in these contact points in particular.</seg>
<seg>registers are essential if we do not want from the public a insider public becomes.</seg>
<seg>It is very gratifying that Parliament has managed to create a broad majority for more transparency.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs for their very good work is progressing.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, openness and transparency in the European Union are included in a good light.</seg>
<seg>That should be the case, then that is a miscalculation because it is the reliability and credibility of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens.</seg>
<seg>That document is currently the most different things and we want a comprehensive access to many types of document in different ways as possible to guarantee.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the position of the Commission on access to documents clearly from the internal manual, which was distributed at 11 October to the staff of the Commission and that it is aware of how they are to handle applications for the right of access to documents by Members of Parliament.</seg>
<seg>This regulation must be scrapped or at least be supplemented by the duty of a serious interest.</seg>
<seg>The usual form of international cooperation with the diplomatic traditions and rules, and that, for example, everything is done behind closed doors - is not appropriate for modern forms of cooperation, as they have been developed by the European Union.</seg>
<seg>We should not confuse it with the role of the European Parliament or in future interinstitutional agreements.</seg>
<seg>A step forward for the use of the right of citizens to information and knowledge.</seg>
<seg>However, it is not the only one, whom I would like to express my thanks, a big thank you also deserves Hanja Maij-Weggen of the PPE-DE Group, which is due to the Hughes procedure co-authoress consolidated in the report.</seg>
<seg>Transparency must be a cornerstone of the activities of the European Union as a whole, but that is not enough, the right to be able to have access to the documents for the implementation of transparency alone.</seg>
<seg>So the European Parliament demands that the European security and defence policy are involved in the future into the structures of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg>When President Prodi, on 3 October to Parliament, he spoke of the institutional triangle and drew attention to the fact that in a European system based on controls and balance the smooth functioning of each institution contributes to the common interest.</seg>
<seg>I must admit that the major challenge in this regulation is the exact definition of the documents.</seg>
<seg>I would like to emphasise that the Commission could accept all of the amendments, at the appropriate time, like practically no.</seg>
<seg>In some cases, I would be happy to vote for the Commission's proposals, and Members must have a list of the amendments which the Commission can support, and with the amendments which do not want to support them in their hands.</seg>
<seg>own resources of credit institutions</seg>
<seg>Finally, and this was the most controversial point required the Committee a staunch accelerated procedure for the implementation of this legislation.</seg>
<seg>These changes take the place of a number of other proposals in the report, which will probably be rejected in the vote and replaced by the new amendments, which are the result of this consensus.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in view of the excellent result for the report and the response of the Commission this morning is quite obvious, if you look at all the aspects on which we voted - that we should postpone the vote in accordance with Rule 69 (2) on the draft legislative resolution, with the Commission and the Council to enter into negotiations can be successful.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I am sorry to say that the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats (PPE-DE) in favour of postponing the vote, but I must point out that your coordinator came to me, in order to vote to tell me that you wanted to postpone the vote until the November II part-session, instead of this evening.</seg>
<seg>I would propose a postponement of the vote for a different reason, Mr Goebbels has already said, this is a very important matter.</seg>
<seg>I do not know what costs a roll-call vote, but there is certainly a few thousand francs or Belgian francs from our budget.</seg>
<seg>I know that in France, whole herds have been slaughtered, and does not seem to be the best solution.</seg>
<seg>removal of animal meal in animal feed, not only for cattle and sheep, but also for pigs and poultry fish.</seg>
<seg>That is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg>Such arrangements would be likely to repair and farmers solidarity message give the confidence of consumers, which we want to convey to them.</seg>
<seg>There is an urgent need to go further, and a change in the common agricultural policy in the eye to take.</seg>
<seg>The ban on the use of meat and bone meal as animal feed is only the first step along this road.</seg>
<seg>However, we very much regret that the amendments tabled by our group did not agree.</seg>
<seg>I think it would be logical to reduce the working time of persons employed in the polluting companies.</seg>
<seg>Finally, let me emphasise that the general spread of the use of hazardous waste must not cause us to compensate for us in the production of such waste.</seg>
<seg>If, for example, the pensions were not so low that they are not sufficient for living there would be fewer arms.</seg>
<seg>The report provides funding to the tune of EUR 100 million for a period of five years for the reduction of poverty.</seg>
<seg>The proposal to introduce a second Luxembourg process in the area of social exclusion which includes guidelines and national action plans, receives my unqualified support.</seg>
<seg>The report calls for the list of qualitative and quantitative indicators for the social exclusion.</seg>
<seg>With the presentation of its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion of the Commission at the request of the Council, to create a 'June 2000 entitled' initiative for cooperation in this area.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I abstained for a very specific reason: in this report, in my opinion, in environmental terms not progress, which I had expected and hoped.</seg>
<seg>I hope that this system in all the cities of Europe may be spread.</seg>
<seg>Some of the proposals of the European Parliament are unrealistic and do not meet my agreement.</seg>
<seg>We need even better in the future to make existing bestpractice publicly better known.</seg>
<seg>Great paid environmentally aware, should have the opportunity to contribute in a liberalised market voluntarily to a cleaner energy and other all this with the old remains.</seg>
<seg>The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg>It is about the following three reasons: first of all, this motion corresponds to the process of consolidating democracy and the increased demand for respect for human rights, in particular with regard to the indigenous communities.</seg>
<seg>In this debate we would like, as previous speakers have said, the solidarity and support of our institution in relation to the Central American Parliament expressed this would happen at a time when we support that the European Union's external relations with the countries iberoamerikas has other priorities.</seg>
<seg>I do not have the reservations with regard to human rights, which are our esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Seguro, President of the delegation responsible for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, authorised was to be expressed.</seg>
<seg>Finally, the Commission also points in the dialogue with the Central American authorities reiterated the importance which we must attach to the regional integration process as an instrument for the consolidation of democracy and the development of this area.</seg>
<seg>In order to clasp to power, he did not hesitate to take the pointless debate on the “ivorität” one wave of xenophobia released: hatred of the others who strangers, which burkinabé or the malinesen on which a great many live and work for many years on ivorischem soil.</seg>
<seg>A precondition for the creation of a genuine democracy in the Ivory Coast is the establishment of an independent committee of inquiry on the crimes committed and the formal obligation to respect for human rights and the internal peace.</seg>
<seg>Some believe that democracy is of relative importance when it comes to Africa, this is complex procedures and it is time to allow for its work and I am, however, of the opinion that there can be no compromise on democracy and that in the Ivory Coast is today the same question, for example in Guinea, where we know that people are not arrested and give it a democratic system.</seg>
<seg>Let me finally: dictatorships are only possible because there are people who live in poverty, who do not have access to knowledge and information.</seg>
<seg>It would not illogically, if the European Union demanded today new presidential elections in which all countries this time could participate.</seg>
<seg>In many parts of Africa, we are dealing with very different ethnic and religious mixtures.</seg>
<seg>With these elections, the national representation of the political parties must be possible, which were excluded from the presidential elections, even if only partially, the shortcomings of this first choice to regulate.</seg>
<seg>on the situation in Burma.</seg>
<seg>a large-scale offensive is being waged against the fine and the Karen people and, as the un-correspondent said, there is no sign of a dialogue between sdpc and NLD.</seg>
<seg>That is why we reiterate the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.</seg>
<seg>I hope that the European Parliament will give a clear signal to the Burmese people by the handling of this matter in the topical and urgent debate that the desperate situation is not forgotten that we acknowledge that the situation in Burma is worse rather than better, and that we are determined to do something about it.</seg>
<seg>It has been a long time coming.</seg>
<seg>It is precisely in Asia, there is a risk of economic and political reforms are decoupled that there can be economic progress and economic liberalisation without liberalisation in the political arena and without strengthening the rule of law, although I believe that without a functioning state under the rule of law, trade, aid and investment in the long term, will be lost.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I agree with the previous speakers in many important points because much of what is happening in Vietnam is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg>The Human Rights Watch, which Mr Swoboda mentioned, declared in the meantime that Vietnam clear on the issue of human rights has recently made some in order to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg>These top secret documents give us a rare view behind the scenes of the policy of the Vietnamese government.</seg>
<seg>However, the Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation only through dialogue between the military regime, which can be achieved democratically elected opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg>There is also a strong pressure on the part of the Vietnamese authorities in the direction of self-censorship, of the independent press.</seg>
<seg>The next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg>We also need the help and support of the European Union, not only in the south-west of England, but in all areas.</seg>
<seg>I would ask you all to support our resolution.</seg>
<seg>It is imperative that the European Union is not confined to exceptional aid after the entry of disasters.</seg>
<seg>The Commission has taken two initiatives in this respect.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, it was a purely linguistic mistake with the inclusion of one of the amendments to the joint resolution.</seg>
<seg>The vote to postpone, that is to say, to transfer to the Commission.</seg>
<seg>(Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg>The report is based on the fact that an increasing proportion of the visit of patients in Europe is covered by supplementary health insurance.</seg>
<seg>I find it somewhat strange that we want to tie the hands of the Commission proposal for a directive, but a Green Paper on the current state of the voluntary insurance and patient supplementary assurances from the Commission requires at the same time.</seg>
<seg>In view of the fact that the proportion of elderly people in the population is growing considerably, it is important to take to improve the health of people throughout Europe in mind.</seg>
<seg>We cannot go along with that.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, much speaks for an accelerated procedure in the implementation of the results of the Basle revised version of the capital adequacy regelungsrahmens.</seg>
<seg>As regards the sense of urgency, which draufgesetzt Mrs Villiers, in the sense of need made by the Commission, by demanding the adoption of measures in an accelerated procedure, that is to say that the rapporteur recognises that this regulation will not have any influence on the anti-competitive practices which are common in the United States, unfortunately.</seg>
<seg>Of course we also have to take care that Basel does not result in addition to the fact that higher capital requirements another drawback is on the banks.</seg>
<seg>Having said that, I would like to point out that the participants in the economy, in my view, the approach as satisfactory, these provisions in the capital, which support the issues in connection with the risk is the basis.</seg>
<seg>These are some of the initial ideas on how we could achieve a swift legislative process which would be monitored and effective in the current provisions of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg>So now is the moment to be recognised that the institution of the European citizen-assigned” come and enough is enough evidence given that it is now the maturity for its own budget.</seg>
<seg>The PPE-DE Group supports the view of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the powers of the Ombudsman should be extended, the quicker, so much the better, in particular as regards the investigative powers of the Ombudsman as laid down in Article 3 of the resolution in 1994.</seg>
<seg>An Ombudsman is, of course, subject to secrecy rules but important the citizens would be interested to know that he or she can have access to documents which remain closed to the rest of the citizen as a citizens' representative.</seg>
<seg>The starting point of this report was then the recommendation made by the Ombudsman to the Commission to do with the selection procedures organised by the access that applicants and applicants to its own corrected audit work.</seg>
<seg>We believe that the attitude to exclude adjustments to the Community institutions, and indeed all competitions should take place, with maximum openness and transparency in order any suspicion of partiality, injustice or incompetence of the administration.</seg>
<seg>I refer, for example, to an amendment concerning the demand for the undeniable evidence of an oral review.</seg>
<seg>Bösch here have already mentioned briefly on the amendments to the report.</seg>
<seg>After I had put two questions to the Commission for the management and organisation of the last internal advertising, I have precise and detailed answers to this change.</seg>
<seg>This administrative processes are made openly and transparently.</seg>
<seg>First of all, with the audits carried out by the Commission, the corrections always take place anonymous.</seg>
<seg>meant July 2000 was clear.</seg>
<seg>Votes</seg>
<seg>(Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote)</seg>
<seg>During the review of the directive on own resources of credit institutions carefully several interests which need to be weighed up in conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg>So the idea of a European police academy for the Member States of the European Union and for the applicant countries developed.</seg>
<seg>The rapporteur also shares this view, and the European People's Party shares him as well.</seg>
<seg>The social situation in most Member States of the European Union needs to happen is intrinsically cross-border cooperation between the various police services.</seg>
<seg>Most speakers seem to think it is essential that the College is only a permanent seat.</seg>
<seg>The umpteenth provisional, but not revocable resolution, in which the Council is usually a small gift for our Parliament.</seg>
<seg>The rapporteur would like to see kriminalitätsvorbeugung crime, provision of services, innovation and monitoring of the borders involved and to see the protection of internal security amended in line with the maintenance of public order.</seg>
<seg>That was the ideals which proposed to us, and so were the State in which they have worked.</seg>
<seg>I would welcome a homologation standards in some Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Since the Commission has worked towards the Member States committed to the initial thinking in this matter, which has been working on the initiative of the European Parliament, at the European level, to bring an action in order to build something which we could consider a European police culture at the highest level of professional ethics, which create respect for the rights and freedoms of the citizens and the effectiveness of the fight against crime.</seg>
<seg>This provides a development of the police academy primarily at government level.</seg>
<seg>For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.</seg>
<seg>- (SV) I have voted against the provisional unit of the European Police Academy.</seg>
<seg>There is no doubt that many of our courts and bedächtig work very slowly, and it is very difficult to persuade them to act quickly on these issues.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, since it is based on the Brussels II regulation, which does not apply to the children of separated parents living as well as unmarried.</seg>
<seg>My mother took part in such a divorce and kidnapping before 85 years, and it is this very day.</seg>
<seg>I would therefore like to say to the House that the Commission in the action plan on the mutual recognition of civil decisions - which I hope we will see the end of the year - proposes adding to the extension of the scope of the Brussels II regulation and thus this regulation on visiting rights and the highest priority to children so that they apply irrespective of unmarried couples as children of partnerships.</seg>
<seg>We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg>In the meantime, the sport - it must be said - is closely linked to other sectors, for example with companies in the audiovisual sector or the advertising industry and the sports goods sales.</seg>
<seg>What we need is an intelligent and flexible interpretation of the current rules.</seg>
<seg>Basically, it is an attack on democracy, so far we have often to see things out this control space.</seg>
<seg>The Commission will therefore expect an answer to his request for detailed information on the measures provided for by the British Government.</seg>
<seg>The proposal was put forward by the Minister of Finance in connection with a preliminary draft budget half a year before the statement on the general budget, in the spring of 2001.</seg>
<seg>I also think that what Mr Simpson said in extraordinary way has helped us to confirm the probable intentions of the government of the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg>by traffic jams, we lose a lot of time, not only do not only develop high costs, but that is a very big problem for the environment, and I therefore if the British Government is using the money to resolve the problems seems all have something in it, in particular, of all the citizens of Europe.</seg>
<seg>We are more or less the only oil producers in the European Union and have the highest petrol and diesel prices in all the countries of Europe - we pay 1.20 pounds in the United Kingdom for a litre of diesel.</seg>
<seg>This item is closed.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament has a duty to assure them that it is at his side, I would ask you again to observe a minute's silence in order to bring our solidarity and confusion in relation to it.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, I would like to support this proposal as a whole, because I was one of those who asked to take up this point.</seg>
<seg>We have come a long way.</seg>
<seg>The European Union will develop as quickly as possible with the new government in the United States will come into contact with its relations with the most important groups.</seg>
<seg>In view of what I cannot understand the surprise of enthusiastic report by Mr Prescott on the comment that he negotiated, why it is not only Mrs Voynet, but, I believe, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, was also rejected by almost all the other European ministers for the environment.</seg>
<seg>There is a danger that we have lost the momentum which American negotiator change their position and we must completely from the start.</seg>
<seg>The main point at issue are this time the forests.</seg>
<seg>A permanent warming would have for some EU countries as a result of that part of its territory is flooded or quilted.</seg>
<seg>They have a high level of prosperity and low prices for products from oil.</seg>
<seg>I congratulate the Commissioner on his efforts in the Hague and wish him more success.</seg>
<seg>No doubt it was better to come to an agreement as to a bad because the American proposal has been totally inadequate and for Europe under any circumstances acceptable.</seg>
<seg>Climate change have far-reaching consequences in the developing countries.</seg>
<seg>I would like to repeat it in English: Forest Focus from being carbon sinks tonne of carbon sources.</seg>
<seg>Only if the European Union remains credible, it can play in the discussions and the actual measures at COP 6 “b” to Bonn, the initiative.</seg>
<seg>We must make our own assessment of the events and prepare documents in order to compete with the various parties and the “umbrella group” into contact.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the next step is following the COP 6 or the continuation of COP 6 of the fact that the agreement is ratified in the Union.</seg>
<seg>before the European Council we will - and I, Pierre Moscovici on next Sunday a closed the sitting at ministerial level to implement, which I invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, and on Monday, on the occasion of the meeting of the General Affairs Council will be another meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference.</seg>
<seg>The minimum number of participating countries should be set at eight, while the possibility was to be replaced by demand a unanimous decision by the Council which is currently in a right of veto, by recourse to justice.</seg>
<seg>It is regrettable that, but I must stress this.</seg>
<seg>The European Council will therefore also be discussing the state of the negotiations and with enlargement.</seg>
<seg>The Lisbon European Council had adopted guidelines for the promotion of innovative and competitive Europe.</seg>
<seg>Consumer protection is a request from the Europeans ever greater importance for obvious reasons, which I do not need to go further.</seg>
<seg>We must prepare for this unprecedented enlargement.</seg>
<seg>This is indeed the criteria on the basis of which we must assess ultimately the Nice Summit.</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>First of all, the candidate countries must take on the acquis communautaire and convert. this are also our task.</seg>
<seg>It is very much because of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we do not want this to be a wonderful promoted.</seg>
<seg>The text could be better formulated; but it can be improved and determined after Nice.</seg>
<seg>I think it is simply out of the question that many governments has swept the question of the inclusion of a reference to the Charter simple in Article 6 of the Treaty on the table.</seg>
<seg>They do not even want to incorporate it into the Treaties, which the proof is that this text is to be made, this elaborat aside.</seg>
<seg>In the World Trade Organization we react with a common voice unpleasant.</seg>
<seg>I believe that, in view of the fact that a rather gloomy prospects of success the burden of the Intergovernmental Conference with a more complex and controversial issue would not be clever.</seg>
<seg>I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the French Presidency to do its utmost to ensure that this gap is closed, because it is working extremely destructive.</seg>
<seg>to trade policy, the Commission has drawn up a proposal which must be carefully examined.</seg>
<seg>Although some progress with the previous agreement could be reached on the extension of the formula, it also has the formula of the codecision procedure with unanimity was brought in matters of nationality, social security, the reception and practice of independent employednesses works and cultural policy into being.</seg>
<seg>The fact that this question is in itself is a clear evidence of the failure of a policy for the strengthening of links of mutual trust between the countries of the Union.</seg>
<seg>That is the situation in which we find ourselves at this Intergovernmental Conference for months, because there is no their toys.</seg>
<seg>The experience of this year have led us to the opinion that we must rely on the progress that needs to be made after Nice, with a view to the future of Europe in the konstitutionalisierungsprozess of the Union, not only in the method between the government representatives of the negotiations have exhausted in the meantime.</seg>
<seg>If the qualified majority does not become the rule, then, that certain Mr Prodi, those decision-making earlier quite rightly been blocked.</seg>
<seg>This aspect of the subsidiarity was not mentioned in today's debate, but it is of great importance.</seg>
<seg>We have done, the extension of 1995 took place it was so intelligently led by Carlos Westendorp reflection group for Amsterdam, there was in such a way, and now we will have a nice and will be virtually at the same point, Mr President: We circle to us about the institutional issues without finding solutions, the possibility for the fulfilment of an extremely ambitious task which enlargement on 27, give.</seg>
<seg>Do not let us the frustration which will in any case lead to the Nice Conference when it comes to an end result, without even the great disappointment of the peoples of our Parliament to add.</seg>
<seg>In the past we have shown that this objective is possible, and as a citizen of a Member State which has benefited from a regular transition to membership, I look forward to an enlarged and peaceful Europe with great expectations.</seg>
<seg>But if you have a right of veto, it must be clear that this should also apply to everyone else.</seg>
<seg>However, a first change in 2004, which will be elected Parliament will be necessary, because some Member States at least before the election or during the parliamentary term 2004-2009 will come to it.</seg>
<seg>Mr President-in-Office of the Council and has raised the issue of closer cooperation, it moves towards a consensus on this matter.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, at first sight it is about in Nice leftovers and about the necessary adjustments in the context of enlargement.</seg>
<seg>Even though we would have only one spark that mentality in as much as we have less stress on negative developments in our part of the world and positively to place more emphasis on current processes, then we would be happier than is the case at present.</seg>
<seg>We should not just goods, but also because of the services, investment, intellectual property and the competition which include the majority decision by the Council of Ministers and that Article 133 (1) of the Treaty change accordingly.</seg>
<seg>The right of initiative of the European Parliament would open but also in this sensitive issue of party-political arbitrary door.</seg>
<seg>We must also be capable, as one of you said when he referred to the American optimism and the way in which the Americans to speak, to highlight what is which advances.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to tell you that there is no problem in my view the large and small countries.</seg>
<seg>We have done a great deal, but we have always put this old problem, and I do not believe that a development would arise here, because only one country has moved, because we have to be repeated here, I would like to do with very strong national political, democratic realities of 12 of the 15 countries.</seg>
<seg>Mr President Védrine, you stated that perhaps to tension-loaded climate here, and you also spoke of a certain pessimism.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to ask you to make every effort to improve the safety requirements in the appropriate manner, so that such an incident does not happen again.</seg>
<seg>I believe that we have to make provision for what we did not take much evidence that the guests of this Parliament in this House as guests to consider to have been able and fear of threat not have had.</seg>
<seg>hospitality, hospitality and respect there.</seg>
<seg>Thank you for your comments, Mr Tajani.</seg>
<seg>The best honour that could be done to lluch Ernest and his life is to follow his message - Catalan they are called dìaleg. ability we all the dialogue in the Basque country, a chance to give?</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, everyone can of course express its opinion.</seg>
<seg>(b5-0549/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Council on the political situation and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan;</seg>
<seg>When I speak of organisation, I also believe that the European Union, which is of such great efforts should also have responsibility for it.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, you will see the clear will of Parliament in the decision to create a security and defence policy, on two pillars: the balanced civil crisis management and in the event of a failure on military crisis management, and these two pillars complement each other.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in view of what I shall try delay is already underway and the commitments which I have even now, the speech I had prepared to reduce something.</seg>
<seg>These relations are produced in particular on meetings between the NATO Council and the copsi and meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European applicant countries or allies.</seg>
<seg>For example, it is referred to the events in the Balkans, of which one can say that everyone has taken its role to the full.</seg>
<seg>During this period we held the United States too extensively about the developments in the context of the European security and defence policy to date, which is an essential condition for this is that there is a harmonious, as this is the case at the moment.</seg>
<seg>The second annual report of the European Union on human rights has been presented to the European Parliament and a human rights forum will be held on 13 December in Paris.</seg>
<seg>You see, do not want this policy not becoming the competitors of the Atlantic Alliance which today is the basis of the collective defence of its members to set up or a permanent European army.</seg>
<seg>If I mentioned the figure of 100 000 men, this does not mean that we want to exceeded the objectives laid down in Helsinki, but that we have a reserve of different qualifications and specializations, so that we can ensure that the objective of the Council is adequate 60 000 men in all operating conditions can be achieved.</seg>
<seg>Let me now turn very briefly to the real political sense of this new task, adopted by a majority of our public deal with which Europe is becoming an instrument of political influence what is missing so far.</seg>
<seg>However, we are now facing the problem that we have to ensure that we should strengthen the liberal democracy in Europe, the talk is referring to the entire continent, because it is concerned with enlargement and the process of enlargement.</seg>
<seg>We must unite three areas into a coherent whole Community policies, the CFSP, including the ESDP and national measures of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>Despite the complexity of procedures within the Commission, we do not need 60 000 soldiers strong force, in order to achieve our objectives.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, the possibility of granting humanitarian aid must be found.</seg>
<seg>I do not agree with the cynics who state that Europe get a toys nothing, however, to use the too - it is essential that the rapid reaction force will not be immediately applicable in many situations.</seg>
<seg>The European Union should not form with fixed own defence troops.</seg>
<seg>To conclude, I would like to express the concern of my group on the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan to expression and to ask the Commission and the Council, as far as it is possible for them to increase their efforts towards a peaceful solution and an aid to the civilian population, particularly now before the beginning of winter.</seg>
<seg>To put it in simple words, where, when and how the European rapid reaction force should be used in the future?</seg>
<seg>The interview makes, like the appalling record of these two months Intifada was ourselves on 270 deaths, mostly Palestinians clear and nearly 10 000 for life obstructed often injuries amounts.</seg>
<seg>That is why it is also constantly trying to set up an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction of the worst kind.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, and contrary to what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it would be possible and desirable that the European Union is doing the Middle East, in view of the conflict and the escalation of violence in more than in the past, especially now, during the transitional period, in which the United States.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in my speech I would like to refer to Mrs Lalumière's report, which I think is very good and clear.</seg>
<seg>But there is no political concept, and there is still no real common foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg>The European Union has only one problem, namely the fact that it did not win the interests of public opinion in such activities so far, although this much sustainable and much more effective.</seg>
<seg>A further point is of course the question of the distribution of the budget.</seg>
<seg>This foreign I despite the large number of obvious insurance on this subject, which has to be heard in the last few days like coincidentally again and again.</seg>
<seg>Our potential is currently still very limited. Member States should finally take their defence expenditure, which differs considerably from country to country.</seg>
<seg>Even those who question the use of the resolution, for example, for the creation of the Euro army in the so-called must recognise the important political content of this resolution and its influence on the cohesion of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The first appearance of a defence minister in our Parliament is historic so that we reserved for the night sitting, so that the impression of our Members is not too strong.</seg>
<seg>For all of these conflicts, civil crisis prevention is better than a military action.</seg>
<seg>Russia is doing, want to be long-term political Union partner of an undemocratic regime?</seg>
<seg>Europe will therefore be no new military alliance, as some, I believe, probably due to incomplete information proposed.</seg>
<seg>I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure at the end of the debate.</seg>
<seg>In view of the scale of the task four committees were concerned, why a new procedure was used in the production of four parallel reports.</seg>
<seg>The measures proposed in the White Paper must in their entirety serve to modernise and making the whole operation more efficient the Commission.</seg>
<seg>It would therefore be appropriate to apply the reform as an opportunity to limit their intervention to the areas which do not contain spending.</seg>
<seg>The past evaluation differences are not only political nature, but above all a mirror the cultural differences between the fifteen Member States.</seg>
<seg>The main task of the new internal audit service, that you, Mr Kinnock, as is subordinate to the Vice-President responsible for reform immediately is the analysis of the internal control functions and systems within the Commission.</seg>
<seg>Cooperation has taken great pleasure, and I believe the process, the Commission has to present an important reform which is so crucial to the future of the European Union, in depth and wealth derived, since we have four in it.</seg>
<seg>They should expect it to be transferred to other European institutions or be seconded to the national governments or work in the private sector.</seg>
<seg>Our committee therefore reiterates the importance it attaches to a strong Commission, an independent, efficient, transparent and politically responsible.</seg>
<seg>As the Committee on Budgets, we are of the opinion that the drafting of the budget following activities are due to the low profile of expenditure and because of our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament, as the budgetary authority of problems.</seg>
<seg>That is to clarify the firm will of Parliament to implement this reform, together with the Commission.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the four rapporteurs for the work they have done.</seg>
<seg>This is shameful, in view of the fact that the European Union is a champion of the modernisation of the economy.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteurs to support the work of the Commission, it is a fact that the recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts a comprehensive and consistent response in terms of the quest for real government policy is granted and not only after a better management of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>The change of attitude is to find its expression in a transparent administration.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion there is no structural tomorrow it with a more and more important than the 15 throughout the world, 20 or more countries - a whole continent. the more industrialised part of the world pulsates within the Union and in the Commission on their structures.</seg>
<seg>Changes are never easy.</seg>
<seg>The Socialist Group has, however, of the opinion that the management of the Community operates at present very effectively.</seg>
<seg>We know the outcome, and that is why many of the members of the Commission and its administration have dealt with this issue in depth and expertly.</seg>
<seg>Thousands of project applications are already more than one year to an evaluation.</seg>
<seg>As we have seen in the debate, it is not so much about principles, objectives and opportunities of the reform, but rather about procedures, speed, timetable, possible malfunctions or undesirable consequences in its implementation.</seg>
<seg>Firstly, I should like to inform the House that, as Mr van Hulten said that today's meeting of the College a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement was adopted within the framework of “rules an advisory group on the behaviour of the public service is established in level 1 of the programme to the White Paper planned.</seg>
<seg>Mr van Hulten, as far as I know, has taken up this point again in the course of this debate.</seg>
<seg>The main purpose of the revised version is simplification, the increase in transparency, the strengthening of the budget principles, then increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the budgetary procedure is mentioned specifically fewer exemptions, less incomprehensible exception.</seg>
<seg>It is also very uneconomic directly for the Commission when contracts conducted in such a way that cost X 20% are replaced, costs y 30% and then the evidence are replaced by small sums are often collected and examined.</seg>
<seg>The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Sauquillo (a5-0337/2000) Perez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the relations of the European Union with the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission after these relations (2000/2051 (INI)].</seg>
<seg>The latter aspects particularly relate to the NGOs.</seg>
<seg>Of course, this is not enough, but it will, in any case, to protect us against excessive representations of the weakness of our development aid.</seg>
<seg>We return, because this is in itself a good framework.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I returned from Mozambique today, where the European Union has provided excellent humanitarian aid after the flood disaster, but is once again reconstruction projects, for which we have already given money prepared, delayed, since not all signatures are not in Brussels.</seg>
<seg>In view of this situation, a greater commitment and greater efficiency are necessary in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment.</seg>
<seg>We now have a harmonised system for the production of country strategy papers and indicative programmes for cooperation in all developing countries.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, the establishment of SEM did not provide a solution to that far existing imbalance of eight blown-up authorities.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I attached great importance to be here with this debate on the first package of shipping in the European Parliament, because you will be dealing with three important texts, which is the first essential step in this field which, unfortunately, moved by the recent events so much in the eye of the public.</seg>
<seg>This would provide the possibility of the Presidency of the Council to discuss with the Member States in order to achieve your proposals on the basis of an agreement in the Council and the text at first reading to assume that if necessary by a qualified majority.</seg>
<seg>This rapid and targeted procedure whose result two Erika packages and six proposals are, caused enormous dynamism.</seg>
<seg>The lessons to learn this Parliament this morning, should lead to the conclusion that the maritime law is throughout the world in a shameful constitution and it is time that we put them in order.</seg>
<seg>to vessels which do not meet the standards that a clear signal must be that we do not stand in European waters or in European ports.</seg>
<seg>With the oil tankers tonnage of low we have received a compromise between the 5 000 tonnes of sustainability, the limit value of the IMO and the 600 tonnes of sustainability, the ceiling proposed by the Commission.</seg>
<seg>This information must be made available to European, national and port authorities, as well as the interested public.</seg>
<seg>The border-spreading nature of the marine environment that pollution in one area can spread on a wider area, calls for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution.</seg>
<seg>In cooperation at local level, nature conservation associations are involved.</seg>
<seg>The amendment of the directive in the sense of a stricter application, a harmonisation of the legislation, particularly as regards the selection of the ships which can be examined and the scope of the various examination forms, is, of course, be viewed positively.</seg>
<seg>I would like to point out that the urgency, which you are now calling for is not there.</seg>
<seg>I believe that with the limits of liability for the classification societies between the Council and Parliament will have to think again, regardless of what is adopted today.</seg>
<seg>a voyage data recorder, a black list, totally in agreement with all these things are we I would ask you to draw attention to a few points.</seg>
<seg>In view of the disastrous situation in maritime transport and anarchischen Europe of the challenge set itself and eleven months after the wreck of the Erika, the European Union will be able to show a procedure which has been so rapidly processed, like none before.</seg>
<seg>To what extent can be considered the liberal logic is contrary to a high level of safety in maritime transport.</seg>
<seg>Whatever technical measures are always been one of the main sources of uncertainty will remain as long as they did not stop the exponential growth of transport in the zone Channel and the North Atlantic due to the strangulation of the North Sea ports.</seg>
<seg>It would be good for the President-in-Office to face, even if it would create order in his country.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, since the break-up of the tanker, Erika, apart from political pressure has been put together a package of measures to improve the safety of ships at sea.</seg>
<seg>Greek vessels that have gone down in such a way, without simply in the field storm prevailed, Mr Gayssot.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, it should be clear when we talk about these issues, that between our oil package with stocks on the one hand, and the fact that we continue to use fossil fuels, on the other hand, there is no link.</seg>
<seg>We should have the political courage to implement our environmental ambitions.</seg>
<seg>That is, in this area, we have a great responsibility and must, as it seems to me that any institutional self-love leave aside.</seg>
<seg>In Finland, for example, it is essential that Russia is involved in these agreements.</seg>
<seg>This relates to both the stricter requirements regarding the construction of the rules for the classification societies, exacerbated by oil tankers, better rules on port state control and which will also be a result.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, today we are talking about maritime safety at sea, on the basis of three reports, on which I must congratulate the rapporteurs.</seg>
<seg>As regards the three new proposals on safety at sea is concerned, there is an urgent need for me to congratulate the three correspondents: you have new measures in a very short space of time, the proof of this provided that our Parliament is determined, to increase maritime safety of people for the strengthening of controls and strengthening of the design requirements and that, in future, such disasters can no longer be tolerated.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, a series of highly maritime disasters, particularly with oil tankers hard hit our continent in the recent past.</seg>
<seg>More than 80% of accidents are due to human error, but for the human error, there are reasons to social aspects.</seg>
<seg>Someone spoke of traceability '.</seg>
<seg>With the directive on port state control compliance with international standards to be controlled, and no new regulations are to be introduced.</seg>
<seg>set out in Amendment No 18 port state control to the rest of the seafarers relationship in the implementation of the provisions on seafarers' hours of work is already by the existing directive 99/95 covered.</seg>
<seg>I note with pleasure that the rapporteur made a reference to the system for the evaluation of the conditions in Amendment No 21, and we agree with the proposed main axis of endeavour, but more needs to be done on the wording in order to make the whole clearer.</seg>
<seg>Amendment No 4 and the part of Amendment No 18, reference to point “k” purchase, are not acceptable.</seg>
<seg>I can assure you that a shipowner intends to register such flag states to allow a ship these its intention, as soon as this proposal is in force, to take into account.</seg>
<seg>The Commissioner spoke in this time of dozens and dozens of articles quoted 18 minutes and demonstrated the position of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council on a package of measures on the trans-European network for the collection, production and distribution of the statistics of internal affairs and except-joint goods transport (edicom) [COM (00) 0458 - c5-0401/00 - 2000/0201 (committee on economic and currency))</seg>
<seg>by withdrawing the motion for a resolution, I would like to say, however, convinced that Parliament's voice could have produced better if it had made a special and resolution on the special meeting of the European Council in Nice on the important and difficult questions of the Intergovernmental Conference, instead of her for consultation within the framework of a single, all the other items on the agenda for the summit comprehensive resolution to deal with.</seg>
<seg>(More than twelve Members rose from their seats, the oral amendment was not taken into consideration) (Parliament adopted the resolution.</seg>
<seg>(a5-0337/2000) report by Mrs Sauquillo Perez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the European Union's relations with the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission in these relations (2000/2051 (INI)]</seg>
<seg>I did as a sign of protest because the European Union is unable to intervene in this area but in such a way that it would have this itself.</seg>
<seg>Although neither the proposal to amend the existing directive on port state control, the Watts report the real needs to be fair, they contain some aspects but a step in the right direction, and we have, therefore, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, voted for the report.</seg>
<seg>It is therefore regrettable that the Commission's proposal the idea was not followed up to establish a genuine European coastal supervisory authority according to the model in the United States of the existing “coast guards”.</seg>
<seg>An essential condition for the safety of ships, the protection of life at sea and the environment is the fight against the unaccountability of shipowners, strict measures to control the condition of vessels, the severe punishment of shipping companies which violate the safety provisions, the improvement of working conditions of seafarers, their specific training and composition of the crew, so that they are able to do justice to the vessels increased requirements.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, the rapporteur Hatzidakis is exactly the opposite.</seg>
<seg>The sinking of the Erika in December 1999, raised the question of safety at sea, on the political agenda of the Community, and the Commission has proposed these texts on which we voted today, almost a year after the terrible accident, at the insistence of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>The current compensation funds are equipped with inadequate measure; that is only too clearly the disaster with the livelihoods of the fishing industry in the Shetland Islands was not adequately compensated for their losses.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, I have already mentioned that I went in former times to sea.</seg>
<seg>The rapporteur's proposals aimed at harmonization at European level, can only be positive.</seg>
<seg>The sector is very important, as it concerns the classification societies.</seg>
<seg>This would be a great success, because on the eve of enlargement, we do not need rigid supranational Europe, which hierarchical and is but a flexible, close to the peoples of Europe, based on respect for national democracies.</seg>
<seg>The struggle for power between many Member States have more and more in the public, to regulate the view of possible compromises.</seg>
<seg>In Nice, the most important task is to ensure that the institutions of the European Union work efficiently.</seg>
<seg>I personally expect in a week to the summit, which will take place hopeful.</seg>
<seg>I too am not in favour of an automatic link of qualified majority voting and codecision and also believe that every decision must be taken to extend codecision for each individual case.</seg>
<seg>In the amendment to Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extend qualified majority voting, which currently apply in the Council to trade, since other areas such as public services, intellectual property, health or education.</seg>
<seg>Parliament therefore depriving itself the right to influence and is still remains silent in tribute in relation to the partynesses, national duty feeling and the governments and forgetting its obligations towards the citizens.</seg>
<seg>In addition, I have voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the future Treaty which is adopted in Nice.</seg>
<seg>It is a mistake to share the Union in two classes. that I cannot accept that a third of the Member States is progressing faster.</seg>
<seg>its new role heralded the end of the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.</seg>
<seg>In this report there is a great deal to do, that the British Conservatives support which applies in particular to the emphasis is placed on the enlargement of the Union.</seg>
<seg>The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament support the report on the implementation of a common European security and defence policy.</seg>
<seg>In addition, against the peoples of the European Union, which the new military expenditure, on which the report refers, in any case, to finance and not even have the guarantee that these forces are not used a daily, on behalf of the “maintenance of order 'against it.</seg>
<seg>The proposal is just as serious that a state which does not want to take part in a task is obliged to make a financial contribution, which is divided between the States involved in this war.</seg>
<seg>by military means there is no solution from outside, because they repair neither the cause of the conflict or incur a reversal in public opinion.</seg>
<seg>That military operations should be able to be funded from the budget of the Community and the Member States a financial contribution to carry out these tasks, even if they do not wish to take part (paragraphs 49 and 50).</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, it would be for the European Union to face, and if it should concentrate on the priorities of the Petersberg tasks to reverse and more on civil and humanitarian solution models.</seg>
<seg>I support this report by my colleague, Mrs Theorin.</seg>
<seg>But the needs of this group are only put forward in order to state the demand for the “fiscal (n) tax deductibility of financial services and adapting the prices and costs to the financial resources of the private ".</seg>
<seg>It is quite incredible that we should still recommend the twenty-first century that Member States, for example, domestic workers should ensure entitlement to social security and pensions.</seg>
<seg>For many young people undeclared work is threatening to become the first contact with the labour market.</seg>
<seg>It is worst, if it is still far women from countries which have accepted this work and to see perforce no other way of denying their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg>The reform of the Commission will be judged by its results, hence the need for regular progress reports from the Commission during the whole programme period for December 2002, and the importance of the expected total balance.</seg>
<seg>Not so long ago, due to the various scandals and management weaknesses came in March 1999, the resignation of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg>Finally, I think it is absolutely necessary to remind you that we look at the same time, greater consistency and greater transparency of the Commission in their day-to-day administration, but also a greater sense of responsibility for its part of this reform is essential for the future under strict limits on the delegated powers.</seg>
<seg>The Conservatives support the statement in paragraph 7 of the report is to ensure that democratic control and to be made the system of the three pillars functional.</seg>
<seg>(The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)</seg>
<seg>We have received the information - and I want to add straight away, I cannot believe it at all - that the Council and the French President, the only 30 minutes tomorrow will be in order to discuss.</seg>
<seg>I therefore exclude one I detailed and reasoned opinion.</seg>
<seg>We should vote in any case, and I personally am in favour of a resolution, as Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others have proposed.</seg>
<seg>On these texts into the night work within one, which also applies to the numerical division of voice in the Council and the distribution of seats in Parliament.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, I would like to argue strongly not to remove this de Roo report from the agenda because he has produced a very good and at the last Earth Summit during the French presidency next Monday and Tuesday of this common position is drawn up.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much, Mr Parish.</seg>
<seg>In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, whose chairman he is also often it smoking.</seg>
<seg>The political basis is clear: harmonisation of the market with a view to a high level of consumer protection, health and building on existing legal provisions and new scientific findings.</seg>
<seg>Their living conditions and view of life is about where health is becoming more and more important.</seg>
<seg>This rule knows exactly the same at all in their spare time, but not safe consumed drugs to be used if no other than the person erosion of these drugs is one.</seg>
<seg>It is precisely went yesterday in the United States against tobacco multinationals processes with a conviction because of poisoning and false information about the safety of the products to end.</seg>
<seg>As regards the cigarettes, which are prohibited in the European Union for health reasons, but also from the European Union to be exported, we believe that the completion of these exports is the only correct and consistent.</seg>
<seg>Instead of drawing lessons from the defeat of 9 October of this year in Luxembourg, we remain with an attitude which is not legally tenable.</seg>
<seg>I listened very carefully to the Commissioner did not say to Mr hume: essential job losses in this sector.</seg>
<seg>It is the Parliament and the Council, which has to approve this proposal for a directive, and has, among other things, to consider the appropriate legal basis for it.</seg>
<seg>I do not think that we should move on a narrow path because, regardless of its content, which is substantially as Mr Maaten and others have pointed out, there is a risk that this Parliament, for the Council and the Community institutions in their entirety, if this Parliament and the Council approve by the leader of the Group of the European People's Party and restrictive interpretation proposed by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, in the legislative work of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law, will be bound hand and foot.</seg>
<seg>its weakness lies in the fact that the focus is on the promotion of free competition.</seg>
<seg>To conclude: since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament is able to coordinate matters of environmental and consumer protection and, of course, it will cooperate closely in this respect with the Council and the Commission.</seg>
<seg>It is true that has nothing to do with tobacco, but the decision of the Court of Justice could have been issued as well as to an advertising ban on alcohol or an advertising ban on chocolate, since, as you know, sugar can be harmful to health.</seg>
<seg>I do not understand that a majority of this Parliament wishes to introduce more generous export regulations than one of their own governments of Member States envisaged - those governments that are the many industries which refers.</seg>
<seg>proven that 80% of the smokers want to put a stop to offer the tobacco industry, but only a few strategies in order to these people are to be supported.</seg>
<seg>If we continue to tell other countries which health standards should do it by expanding our sensible proposals for the internal market since exports, then let us place all the excellent work by Mr Maaten in question.</seg>
<seg>We support the implementation of this test by a test laboratory accredited in a country according to a uniform method recognized throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The effects of tobacco on health are now widely recognised and legislators and public are to be introduced, as it were, have come to the conclusion that it is time, strict rules and regulations on this product.</seg>
<seg>Community legislation will fit for this reason very well into the future international regulations and the risk of developing away from trade barriers will be turning at the same time, the consumer protection will strengthen and a high level of public health will ensure.</seg>
<seg>Instead, we should wait for the whole question of additives in the Commission's first report was being addressed.</seg>
<seg>As regards laboratory tests the amendment is superfluous concerning the authorisation of tests, since in another article stipulates that only such products should be placed on the market, which correspond to the provisions of the directive.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, this report is very clear: at the moment, the period of validity of directives is limited, following the summer time only five years in any case must be submitted to Parliament for enlargement.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on the regulation of the summer time which we are examining today, I think it is a good proposal.</seg>
<seg>I therefore think that we should be in this House on this issue too, for a long time, however, the Member States and the people of the regulation of the summer time already largely adopted, and it was recognised as part of our annual rate.</seg>
<seg>I am in favour of the fact that the issues concerning the time zones and the harmonisation of summer time rules, as proposed in the power of decision by the Member States is preserved.</seg>
<seg>It would propose more summer time at the end of September about six months after its approach to end.</seg>
<seg>We support the proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report to be produced in 2007, as mentioned in Article 5.</seg>
<seg>It is clear that interventions cannot be accepted in the human germ line.</seg>
<seg>We will have, if we accept this compromise, a system which guarantees the therapeutic progress and the protection of patients in Europe are not only in such a way that it is, but better, and that is why I call for this compromise.</seg>
<seg>These groups should continue to fall within the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg>I am glad that we have managed to put forward for the germline therapy a barrier.</seg>
<seg>I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on his report and thank him for his efforts to find a compromise in view of the differences.</seg>
<seg>These programmes are the prevention of cancer, the prevention of AIDS, drugs and health promotion. your breaking off the end of these plans and the work of the established networks would mean.</seg>
<seg>It is extremely favourable, the land in the run-up to be drawn up in order to proceed and as quickly as possible, even if a second reading to approach is needed, as far as possible, the point at which a decision can be taken.</seg>
<seg>We must also bear in mind that both the prevention and promotion and monitoring to become increasingly important, and that is why it must be measured and greater importance to a higher budget be made available for it.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, on the occasion of the Trakatellis report on the extension of the current European action in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about the direction in which European policy in the field of public health concerns.</seg>
<seg>I understand that the Council has expressed its fundamental agreement.</seg>
<seg>In the European Union is the paradox that the borders have been abolished for free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, there is still the 15 borders in the fields of police and justice in criminal matters is maintained your move by the Member States is made more difficult.</seg>
<seg>that the initiative is a real and substantial progress in the creation of a European criminal law area if it only covers areas and is limited to their effect, does not, however, it remains with the real needs of many European citizens who have been to date there, if they have practically helpless outside the territory of their wohnsitzlandes victims of crime.</seg>
<seg>What did we call for these people?</seg>
<seg>At the same time, is to ensure that the experts who have direct contact with the victims are given specific training.</seg>
<seg>victims must not become twice victims, victims of crime and only then the system.</seg>
<seg>In this context it is also important that the Members who are informed of the victim of family and professional on a confidential basis circumstances and, if required, the necessary support to be able to count, and that they do not have anything from the press.</seg>
<seg>This is regardless of the type of crime.</seg>
<seg>We must move away from either at national or European level, even the basic principle that an individual must always bear the responsibility for their own actions.</seg>
<seg>In other cases, it may be necessary to gather the necessary information in a language of the Union which is not their own.</seg>
<seg>I am pleased that Parliament positive response on this first text to such important issues so that the area of freedom, our fellow citizens protection in situations offers security and justice which we are building, with which it is often very difficult to get along with it.</seg>
<seg>Vote on request for urgent procedure</seg>
<seg>(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)</seg>
<seg>Therefore we agreed during the night of 23 to 24 November with the Council on the salient points of the budget, which is certainly not glossful, but quite sensibly.</seg>
<seg>The Commission was therefore a revision by EUR 300 million suggested. resisted the Council in hand and foot.</seg>
<seg>But I know from conversations that it is more difficult for a multiple, to formulate a negotiable Council position to be given a mandate and to allow the purely national egoisms resulted in a reasonably sensible and reasonable pan-European decision.</seg>
<seg>I hope that the work for a common recruitment office, as stated in the new German, therefore, a European position authority, so that we really do make the problems over the next few years to all the institutions - the Council come to exactly the same as the Commission, the Parliament and the other institutions - namely the staffing levels in the coming years, together framework.</seg>
<seg>The Council has denied this revision, we should really have the data - and I would like to warn him as a precaution: the flexibility instrument in two consecutive years, in fact, in less than 15 months and the first time less than six months after the adoption of the financial perspective - to take up weakens the flexibility instrument financially, because it impedes their restoration and possible cumulation intended to a level of 600 million.</seg>
<seg>This considerable amount, which reflects the high need in the year 2001, can be financed, in particular, by the use of the flexibility instrument at a value of EUR 200 million.</seg>
<seg>In view of this new situation, at second reading, the Council adopted a budget which is an increase of 2.5%.</seg>
<seg>Finally, before you adopt this budget, I would like to stress that the Council attaches importance to the observance of a number of basic rules regarding the keeping of budget appropriations in the reserve, the legal basis and the organisation of the expenditure.</seg>
<seg>and contrary to Nice are, I believe, all three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - with the result led quite satisfied.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and gentlemen, once again find of diseased animals BSE has also made it necessary for the budgetary field immediate action, namely the protection of public health and consumer protection, but also with the aid for farmers affected by this situation.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, the Council established a multi-annual amount which is only a guideline for the framework programme to support the reconstruction of the Western Balkans, but is in line with the financial perspectives.</seg>
<seg>And we still hanging choking with a few million euros went further.</seg>
<seg>My sincere thanks to Mrs Haug.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, remember that this 1% of the budget of the European Union are very well utilised.</seg>
<seg>If I have understood you correctly, you said that we must not use the reserve, because this is against the rules.</seg>
<seg>I therefore think that we, together with many others, which I cannot mention of the shortness of time very good things have seen.</seg>
<seg>While the agricultural expenditure, which accounts for almost half of the entire budget increase in the light of the letter of amendment in the coming year, over 5%, the growth of the whole budget is only 3.5%.</seg>
<seg>We now see a great risk that in the next few years, the argument between MEDA, Mediterranean State projects and the Balkans will increase, although we all know that, as a matter of urgency, funds are used here.</seg>
<seg>happy about the difficulties to be overcome to act on the way to the objective of the up-piled up to fulfil the commitments made in Helsinki with the applicant countries to move without definitively going beyond the Union and future Europe into the conditions more efficiently.</seg>
<seg>But progress has been made, real progress, even if they do not go as far as the presidency - which I would like to say, has seen a great openness national - would have liked.</seg>
<seg>For the statute for European political parties a new legal basis is intended, and Parliament has the right of complaint in accordance with Article 230 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg>In recent months, three important steps were taken forward.</seg>
<seg>This is the aim of the declaration in this context, adopted in Nice and introduced considerations, in order to coordinate the fight against doping at European level.</seg>
<seg>The ecological threats - as is well known - the climatic warming.</seg>
<seg>In Nice, the European Union continue to be used the standing committees required for the investigation and leadership of a common foreign and security policy: a political and sicherheitspoli Committee, a military committee, as well as a European military staff.</seg>
<seg>For this cooperation, for your support and also for us, given the inclusion ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Madam President, the French Presidency.</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>We now need to examine the text in Parliament carefully.</seg>
<seg>I also refer to it, Mr President of the European Council that the costs are borne by the taxpayers.</seg>
<seg>I see it as a failure, not only in the European Union has announced the ambitious goal of changing the institutions and to improve the efficiency of the European Union, in order to be able to accept new members properly, but also in terms of another important objective, which has been highlighted perhaps too little, namely on the rapprochement between the European Union and the citizens.</seg>
<seg>the right questions is, in our view, those who have been impressive ', which had together-flowed on the eve of the summit from across Europe in Nice.</seg>
<seg>Firstly, the Fifteen have signed the grundrechtecharte too hasty in a tränengasgeschwängerten atmosphere.</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>My group is disappointed by the Treaty and the future which it brings us, with all the forces concerned we will therefore fight against it.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, you have the floor.</seg>
<seg>Finally, I would like to reply to Mr Hager that the instrument of closer cooperation is, in my view, useful, in order to make Europe more dynamic and study the way it earlier - I believe - I support Mr Romano Prodi formulated. this completely.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I would like to know whether the jurisdiction of the European Parliament in favour of summer time is a new service after Nice.</seg>
<seg>So far, the pharmaceutical companies may be deterred by the complexity of the clinical trials by the States, and also by our Parliament will have brought to the fore are clearly encouraged to develop the market for pädiatrische medicines, even if these are not great enough to ensure the profitability of investments.</seg>
<seg>. (FR) target the summer-time regime, which was initiated at the time of the oil crisis for reasons of energy saving and extended until 2001, to be resumed?</seg>
<seg>It is always the position of crime victims is not protected effectively in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg>This European initiative will benefit many passengers and therefore holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, is with us, as well as the Council Presidency, which comes to the House and to stress that in this House, probably never before such a consensus has emerged in the evaluation of the results of a summit.</seg>
<seg>Europe, which is in motion, is one which has done his job within six key areas under the French Presidency in six months, it seems to me, in spite of everything.</seg>
<seg>Above all, however, I fear that the United Kingdom, France and Germany will be able, now over decades between Member States of different sizes and between the institutions made sensitive balance to be upset.</seg>
<seg>It is difficult to see to what extent the Nice decisions actually facilitate the enlargement of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be very brief today.</seg>
<seg>All of this I can only draw the conclusions that I, when the Treaty of Nice should be taken will be voting against it.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the most important result from Nice was that, in spite of everything, a treaty came and now place for the candidate countries can be created.</seg>
<seg>The real beneficiaries of this conference are Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, gentlemen, saying 'no' to Europe.</seg>
<seg>So we forget Nice and make our views of postal nice., if you will allow me to put my hope for the project of a great Convention announced by Belgium, for its presidency proved: because we must find a new approach, we need a new method of history, we must speed up because 2004 will be too late, is to give far too many risks.</seg>
<seg>Instead, the spirit of Nice was clearly to ask ourselves how we can block, how can we intergouvernementalisieren as we can, at home, as supporters of the national interests to be celebrated really be able to push forward instead of concern for the European Union.</seg>
<seg>What we are to Amsterdam and Nice are Europe's poor princes that the Europe of the national administrations and not a Europe of political agreement.</seg>
<seg>With the essential issues we cannot do without more qualified majority voting.</seg>
<seg>It is true that, I reject the words of Mr Bayrou on since this morning, I sit here first on the side of the President of the Republic, in a personal capacity and on all sides of this hails criticisms, moderate, friendly criticism, it seems to me, but in any case criticisms.</seg>
<seg>We must not forget that it is the first time since 1957 this scheme that was really reformed or economic interests.</seg>
<seg>We are dealing with constitutional systems, and therefore the authority cannot be mixed.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, Minister.</seg>
<seg>But it was not included in the Treaties, or there is a reference to the Charter in Article 6 (2) of the Treaty on European Union.</seg>
<seg>Finally, some positive aspects are mentioned, for example, the revision of Article 7 of the Treaty, the article on political parties and their statute, the right of Parliament to take the other institutions in the Court of Justice - an important factor of political control, the new formula for the European Commission, the inclusion of the lex in such a way prodi” laid down in the Treaty, and the composition of the Commission President is the strengthening of the universe a reasonable compromise, which I accept and which will work safely.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, we have already what happened in Nice, made a rigorous evaluation.</seg>
<seg>We consider the things Charter was included in the Treaty, not even a reference.</seg>
<seg>We want to prove to the Heads of Government that we can do better.</seg>
<seg>Despite the self-praise this morning, the Intergovernmental Conference was not sent to the French Presidency to a successful conclusion.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, it is not so easy to criticise the French Presidency now because it is not present.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the model of the Intergovernmental Conference has surrendered.</seg>
<seg>2001 budget (continuation)</seg>
<seg>This does not mean, however, that we could not have done more and some not better.</seg>
<seg>The Commission is forced by such ceilings set in the context of a limited budgetary priorities that must do any authority.</seg>
<seg>In the vote on this debate, following a long and difficult process of decision-making is on the European Union's budget for the year 2001 to end.</seg>
<seg>We have therefore as follows: resorting to Article 272 avoided; we have a budgetary crisis the financial perspective, in spite of the use of the flexibility instrument has been maintained.</seg>
<seg>addressed to the Council, I would like to say that with this play so quickly the bullets will not go out and that we will play so long before we have achieved the desired result.</seg>
<seg>We do not want the resolution Colom already contains a review proposal for the coming year, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we share his criticism that a solution distort the nature of several years of the major objectives of the external action of the Union, and the definition of the financial perspective in this way, with regard to the financial unterausstattung of category 4.</seg>
<seg>In order to achieve all this in order to be able to fulfil our long-term commitments in the future priorities must be set.</seg>
<seg>Only in this way will the money which is to us for our fellow citizens at our disposal is meaningful and properly spent.</seg>
<seg>If we take into account the supplementary budget which can be expected, then it will lie with nearly 8%, while we in all the other areas - it is the education policy, it is the whole area of internal policy, including research, foreign policy, the administration which pre-accession aid - a total of only a growth rate of 1,1%.</seg>
<seg>Since cooperation is so good, then we will have the opportunity in the supplementary budget as early as January to pursue it.</seg>
<seg>We also welcome it if not yet regulated relations between Russia and the Baltic States criticism is practised.</seg>
<seg>with great interest we have social and internal developments in Russia.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Even if President Putin guarantees for the democratic development of his country, it is not automatically guarantee for a stable and democratic Russia is still the democratic constitutional structure not lived reality in Russia.</seg>
<seg>We should not do it a secret, apply to build a Europe of economic cooperation.</seg>
<seg>As far as the Caucasus is concerned, Mr Van Orden, is quite right.</seg>
<seg>Anyone who looks at Russia from the outside and gets also managed to direct impressions of the country and Russian partners, is in danger of selective quickly explain the reality of what is the country into the picture in Russia.</seg>
<seg>political field the common strategy on Russia is a permanent dialogue on defence and security policy and create but a permanent mechanism.</seg>
<seg>I would like to stress here that we must make it quite clear, in fact, Russia in a political union with Belarus is.</seg>
<seg>Are you, Mr Patten, prepared to support such a project?</seg>
<seg>As the honourable Members know, at the last summit between the European Union and Russia by Romano Prodi, a wide-ranging dialogue was put on matters of energy.</seg>
<seg>I very much hope that I will have at the beginning of next year, even the opportunity to visit Kaliningrad not just because Immanuel Kant has spent his whole life there.</seg>
<seg>Once again, I congratulate the honourable Member, on an excellent report on an extremely important issue to which we will change in the next few years here in Parliament certainly repeatedly.</seg>
<seg>You place me in a very difficult situation.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I would like to say that this debate has been very necessary because the BSE crisis has huge implications for animal feed on production and imports of feedingstuffs.</seg>
<seg>The Council made during the many meetings with Russia at all levels to express its concern to move in particular the Russian Government in order to avoid excessive use of force and a possible extension of the conflict, independent and effective investigations of the violations of human rights, to carry out the support group of the OSCE in fulfilling its mission to provide aid and, finally, for the transport of humanitarian aid is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, on a point of order, indeed it is also the case in the House that questions which must be answered orally, not enough to be provided in writing.</seg>
<seg>(Interruption by Mr Posselt)</seg>
<seg>This directive dates from 1992.</seg>
<seg>And in this respect we must work.</seg>
<seg>These groups, however, seems to have been included in the new proposal.</seg>
<seg>The presidency and some Member States already have received many letters from the association of the European sugar industry to the Commission's proposal, which it will take into account in its deliberations.</seg>
<seg>Question No 6 by (h-0886/00):</seg>
<seg>First of all, I must say that the President-in-Office did not answer, in my view, the question by Mr Korakas yet.</seg>
<seg>Now is the time to set up this authority and I believe that the European authorities are well aware of the problem and that we must make progress.</seg>
<seg>In order to bring it to the point, the representative of the Presidency, in this case, of Ambassador in Algeria, met with Mr Mr Ahmed taleb?</seg>
<seg>We welcome and of the General Assembly of the firm definitions of the accreditation proposed in this context of the preparatory committee of the NGOs to the preparation process and for the special session in September 2001.</seg>
<seg>The text on the accession partnership, contains a number of references to the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</seg>
<seg>The Council has already pointed out to the honourable Member on his last answer, the process will allow better protection of the rights of people to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions.</seg>
<seg>I would like to press, however.</seg>
<seg>It will take on, in particular, political control and strategic line of a military operation in crisis management.</seg>
<seg>I would just like to remind you of the fact that the system of the Treaty makes a difference between the treatment of indirect taxes, for their harmonisation for the establishment and functioning of the internal market which is necessary to - in such a way that in Article 93, and the adjustment - in accordance with Article 94 - the legislation which affects the establishment and functioning of the common market directly, and it is the direct taxes.</seg>
<seg>I would like to say a few words about these three key areas.</seg>
<seg>If the behaviour patterns in doubt that everyone is fighting against everyone remains could blow up the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe based on regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg>We need, at long last, cooperation with the former Yugoslavia, a mutual cooperation.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, our group supports the work of Mr Baltas in connection with the report on the possibility of the negotiation of a stabilisation and association agreement with the Republic of Croatia.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, over the years when I was President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I had the opportunity to be many Croats in their efforts to promote freedom and prosperity, it, as with other peoples of our continent, with its integration into the European institutions.</seg>
<seg>On the basis of the development of Croatia in this year, I am convinced that we should be able to submit a tough pace because that was Croatia in recent months.</seg>
<seg>That is the approach followed by us and the speed with which we put ourselves in the last few months to developments in Croatia, confirmed this.</seg>
<seg>We owe it to the people in Croatia, that we support them and their government in the coming years in general, and we are very grateful to the honourable Member that it recommends us to continue along the same path.</seg>
<seg>In this context, it is incomprehensible that in the spring of thousands of supporters of the Laskar Jihad could draw on the Moluccas this year in order to heat up the conflict there.</seg>
<seg>In East Timor militias deny the refugees to return and AIDS are under threat.</seg>
<seg>On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would just like to comment on three points.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr maijweggen on his excellent work.</seg>
<seg>To that extent, it does not represent an exception.</seg>
<seg>continued violence in the Moluccas, in Aceh and Irian Jaya cause great suffering on the people.</seg>
<seg>Tomorrow, the formal presentation of the Sakharov Prize here will take place.</seg>
<seg>According to recent news from the Indonesian archipelago, begs the question as to whether the situation is even more serious still more seriously, for President Wahid and its comrade-in-arms, as the rapporteur explained.</seg>
<seg>If we want to help Indonesia, then we must this with money and acts; words alone are not enough.</seg>
<seg>In my view, the present report on this point is important information work.</seg>
<seg>It is obvious that the difficulties in the country can be overcome overnight.</seg>
<seg>Protection of the financial interests of the Communities</seg>
<seg>The obstacles to their own businesses, especially in staff recruitment and in its structured structure must be removed.</seg>
<seg>The Commission must therefore ensure that an internal reform process in its announcement that fraud will not be tolerated and any fraud are rigorously applied.</seg>
<seg>I think that really has to be the consequence of Nice.</seg>
<seg>We welcome negotiations between the Member States on the adaptation of legislation in the field of crime, but we do not wish to accuse our countries of a federal EU prosecution authority.</seg>
<seg>I should also like to know why the publication of the Commission's document on this subject was delayed until one day after the Danish referendum on the euro.</seg>
<seg>I invited to set these countries in particular, because, in my view, it is time to ask it to pillory.</seg>
<seg>I am really sure that OLAF is keen to make the choice of higher managers transparency.</seg>
<seg>However, we must be careful that we do not have problems with all the concentration on the problems of the Commission our own, but we also surveyed. quite considerable problems.</seg>
<seg>We are trying to extinguish the fire and stifle the smoke.</seg>
<seg>Nobody can understand that, I too.</seg>
<seg>to ensure that this objective is achieved in every respect, I would like to highlight four questions, which in my opinion has played a leading role in the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control.</seg>
<seg>For Parliament is the problem with the Treaty.</seg>
<seg>It is true damaging if the Commission, Commissioner, as guardian of the Treaties, to respect for the rights of Members must be explicitly mentioned.</seg>
<seg>It has the possibility of approval for a certain period of time on a central transfers these budget lines, particularly those which are intended to increase the amounts entered in the budget, until further internal investigations are final. it may even the President of the Commission proposal to demand the resignation of Commissioners in an environment serious problems have been identified - a sort of European Union Emperor circumcised.</seg>
<seg>The report calls for detailed inventories of operational activities, thorough examination of budget lines and irregularities, as well as internal Commission evaluation of performance.</seg>
<seg>Commissioner, ausgangspunkt of the transmission of information to the European Parliament is the Treaty and the interinstitutional agreement.</seg>
<seg>The result of this common position would be, however, if it were not changed that we do not only have no weapons equality at the end in relation to North America, but not even within Europe.</seg>
<seg>I do not know why could not be achieved here, as with all the other directives, at the end of a compromise achieved.</seg>
<seg>It is a proposal which is afraid of a long and I travelled stormy way in order to overcome some of the problems that exist.</seg>
<seg>The first amendment relates to Article 4, in which the issue of the competent supervisory authority for the supply is regulated.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, the present proposal would create confusion and we would release a search for the most favourable in any case area of jurisdiction, as well as potential disputes at a very delicate stage in the adoption of a company.</seg>
<seg>In the United Kingdom, the voluntary code of conduct offered by the takeover committee has worked satisfactorily. it is in the best way, a good example of how, with an extremely complex matter, for which a legal regulation is appropriate less well, try to be circumvented can in takeovers.</seg>
<seg>More important, however, is that we should be able to make progress on the task of creating a competitive, dynamic European economy set in Lisbon.</seg>
<seg>The large areas of conflict are right in assuming executive committee, for example, versus shareholders, major shareholders versus small shareholders, business versus capital market to regulate in a minimum form European for us here in the European Parliament at the end of it.</seg>
<seg>The text of the common position of the Council is improved by some of the amendments tabled by Parliament as to points which could lead to interpretation difficulties and called for a much faster implementation of the directive concerns.</seg>
<seg>It is by no means certain that the proposed definition of an appropriate price is better than another, because the various current provisions in force in the Member States are all very sensible.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the right to information is given to the artist to get to know the requirements for a period of up to three years, with a professional art dealer who is sensible because they have to keep a record of the buying and selling.</seg>
<seg>Hence the Austrian legislation is not to be attacked in demand and the European legislator, that would only lead to the basic conditions positive for artists and auction houses.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the need for a common position is all the more with the subject we are dealing with, since only makes it possible for the European Union to look seriously at international level to ensure that the interests of artists world are protected.</seg>
<seg>I trust in the wisdom and the weitsichtigkeit of this House.</seg>
<seg>In 1998, only 274 in Germany has benefited from 7000 artists who have surrendered their rights of resale rights, with 40% of the budget was spent on collection and administrative expenditure.</seg>
<seg>In short, there is no need for harmonization in this area.</seg>
<seg>A similar amendment had been rejected at first reading.</seg>
<seg>We assumed that the translations could be provided, despite this very tight and difficult timetable.</seg>
<seg>But we are now so far that we unfortunately cannot postpone this any more.</seg>
<seg>We have proposed in the committee to do this one year before.</seg>
<seg>Of course, this Parliament supports the values mentioned and it will continue to defend.</seg>
<seg>As a result of the technological developments, as well as the modified markets inevitably a change will take place.</seg>
<seg>We cannot find an argument in order to exclude competition.</seg>
<seg>The reduction of the centrepiece of the postal sector, the universal service which transport from briefsendungen a weight limit of 50 grammes would cause for national postal operators seriously the risk to be able to guarantee a universal service at a reasonable price for the whole population in all the regions more.</seg>
<seg>May I remind my Conservative colleagues in this Parliament of a disgrace which they made in the United Kingdom, when they wanted to privatise the British post.</seg>
<seg>From the safety net for the postal service users, we have taken a hammock for these large companies of the postal service, which can rest in it and continue to do what it is still permitted.</seg>
<seg>I am very satisfied with the outcome, because we wanted to exclude the new technologies in the definition of special services from the scope of the universal service.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, and we know that it will not tolerate.</seg>
<seg>The European Commission does not therefore propose for the second stage, the complete liberalisation of the postal services.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to see such a future for the other countries of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Mr Bolkestein accused the Frenchman a unliberale attitude recently in the Dutch press, then at least a newspaper article was mentioned.</seg>
<seg>For this Spain could say something which has been set up and such a fund, that is to say, it is up to the uncertain legal bases of the Fund, which virtual criteria of its composition and the discretionary decisions to express its application.</seg>
<seg>We are voting tomorrow, then I, for the amendment tabled by Mr Atkins or by Mr Sterckx, hope because otherwise I would find myself obliged to vote against this report.</seg>
<seg>Royal Mail is involved in this competition and distributed in my letter Malmö, Sweden.</seg>
<seg>From the debate that we have learned from the dispute, or rather, the Commissioner Bolkestein, with its follow-up of the liberalisation of the postal services in the absence of any assessment of the first phase and in violation of the rules laid down in this directive we have learned in prison? that, under the guise of progressive and revaluing terms - such as modernisation, liberalisation or support for technological recovery - which can hide the dismantling of the social quality of a country.</seg>
<seg>The planned protection of the universal service by setting up a compensation fund which private operators make contributions to the financing of the universal service obligations of the postal service providers in remote areas, might not be of stocks.</seg>
<seg>These shortcomings and this delay has contributed to the fact that in the debate, and resources are often confused with one another.</seg>
<seg>We speak, Madam President, in the discussion of this matter of economic and social cohesion.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, carried out, please allow me first of all to the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, to congratulate because it, of course, a complicated and difficult work which he had to try to find a balance between different proposals attitudes and expenditure and objectives.</seg>
<seg>I fear that the result will be that the current have higher his position is set at the taxpayers' expense further be able to strengthen and expectations for new providers some more.</seg>
<seg>I am pleased that our liberal party friends from other European countries to support the position of the British Liberals.</seg>
<seg>I actually think the liberalisation desirable and welcome the advantages for consumers who will result from it.</seg>
<seg>justified because it relates to the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union, which place the completion of the internal market, the free movement of goods and services in a competition-certain environment to the fore.</seg>
<seg>The provision of such a service forms the cornerstone of Community policy in this area and all our activities are focused on the improvement of the service.</seg>
<seg>The special services are another important area where innovation must be encouraged and the modernisation be promoted.</seg>
<seg>He also said that he was practically the entire postal market opening up to the end of this decade for inevitable.</seg>
<seg>I advocate that the obligation laid down is incontestable for the provision of a universal service and guaranteed in the future.</seg>
<seg>For this reason I cannot and do not want not just sit and watch if the future of this sector is at stake, because we fulfil the tasks conferred upon us all in Lisbon, flawed.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.</seg>
<seg>I would remind you, however, that the priority objective of this common organisation of the market is to secure for its products guaranteed access to the Community market.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately we have been able to achieve unanimity in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in the long run. for that I thank my colleagues, as well as Mr Fernández Martin, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation for their support.</seg>
<seg>For example, we should continue to be our concern because of banana production in some ACP countries where and in some countries in West Africa, respond to small producer countries in the Antilles, which are traditional supplier countries on the banana market and in relation to which we have commitments, which we must not forget.</seg>
<seg>I would therefore ask for this report in its entirety, exactly the same as in the Committee on Agriculture, in which Members of this Parliament is supported.</seg>
<seg>from the United States, the historical reference periods originally, in the meantime, however, a solution with its own historical reference periods had been rejected is approved.</seg>
<seg>strong interests, especially those of us who are not, however, banana growers are American capital into commercial companies, play a role.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes, it seems as if the Commission is to the proposals on the deregulation of trade and agricultural production in the international scale even further from us as the Cairns Group.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, the Commission and the Council on a solution which could jeopardise this production seriously, especially after 2006.</seg>
<seg>In the various WTO decisions, it does not mean that we should not give preferential systems to our traditional suppliers countries.</seg>
<seg>The transitional period should be guaranteed income compensation aid for Community producers and the marketing of the production of the areas around fifteen years, therefore, but at least ten years amount sixth ultra-peripheral must also include what is therefore an aid to the mechanisms which bananas produced marked out there.</seg>
<seg>I hope you will listen to our arguments, because the system of preference, even if it is set at EUR 300, proposed by the Commission, but in reality could prove ineffective because the ACP producers are expenditure-braked by the wind dog procedure '.</seg>
<seg>Votes</seg>
<seg>(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)</seg>
<seg>The Commission cannot accept the remaining amendments.</seg>
<seg>Before the vote:</seg>
<seg>(Parliament accepted the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg>(a5-0383/2000) report by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the reform of the budgetary control methods and bodies (2000/2008 (INI)]</seg>
<seg>most smokers are neither on the full risk or about the consequences of their actions in the obvious.</seg>
<seg>I have been in my long political life, from 35 years.</seg>
<seg>However, I fear that this hope is dead.</seg>
<seg>This is our last attempt to clarify that labels and photographies on cigarette packets the actual consequences of smoking.</seg>
<seg>Lehne report (a5-0368/2000)</seg>
<seg>This is an assessment, and which I still think this is why I voted against the report in its entirety voted.</seg>
<seg>The Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market is absolutely right when she insists on the rejection of the ceiling and in a minimum amount, which should not be less than 7%.</seg>
<seg>In its vote against this directive, my group would like to that extent, to set a political respect nature, when we should not be in the European Union, unnecessary to lay down rules.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the former is a dictatorship of Stalinism have to be condemned, but we can give the slightest confidence in Mr Putin, the butchers of the Chechen people, the godfather of various mafias that Heads of State who wish to remove any opposition and civil society (trade unions, political parties) in order to strengthen its own power?</seg>
<seg>Indonesia is such an intensification of relations has not been characterized particularly to earn because, in recent years, not to have the governance of this country is by a high level of democracy or taking great merit, but we must also have the Indonesian citizens in the eye, which is why we welcome this intensification of relations and this aid.</seg>
<seg>This unit should only deal with crimes committed by EU employees.</seg>
<seg>. (FR) the Theato report on the fight against fraud will enable us to the opinion that the European Central Bank, surely the best proof of their much-quoted independence, considered an accession to the agreement on the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) no sense.</seg>
<seg>That concludes the vote.</seg>
<seg>We must realise that there are only two options: either we belong to, or we do not belong there.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and gentlemen, do not give us cause for a change of name.</seg>
<seg>The tariff only system is an important element, which provides for the balance of the Commission proposal, which is an important basis for this, so that we can make any progress at all in the Council.</seg>
<seg>measures for the marketing of these bananas are in the national and regional programmes for promoting the development of rural areas.</seg>
<seg>Europe and the United States work together with the defence of our common values closely.</seg>
<seg>We will probably also talk about a new WTO round, as well as about the effects of the many new bilateral trade initiatives on this WTO round, which is currently being discussed in the American hemisphere.</seg>
<seg>It has been pointed out that the transatlantic relationship has been substantially increased in the last ten years, and this is thanks to the efforts of President Clinton, above all on the American side, but I believe in the history books will one day be noted that these new relations with Europe with the transatlantic declaration of 1990 and with the transatlantic agenda under the Spanish Presidency has made an important contribution, which had the proportion of the success of these relations in December 1995.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, it will be important to make a change and to write a transatlantic agenda for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg>I would like to quote the opinion of representatives of the Dominican Republic to the conclusion that the WTO should be originally an impartial arbitration body which ensures that the common rules are complied with and that the countries with the free world trade is to be able to make.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, we can be pleased about the collapse of the Communist hochstapelei, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union only one superpower left, namely the United States.</seg>
<seg>I know that he has a successful and very constructive dialogue with Parliament and the committees involved in these matters.</seg>
<seg>The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:</seg>
<seg>These objectives, which are the main objective and the secondary objectives, test to be, at which the specific proposals put forward by the Commission should be judged.</seg>
<seg>As you know, such a solution - mechanism in one country with the possibility of the provision of services in the Union as a whole - could cause an avalanche in those countries with a lower taxation.</seg>
<seg>The standard rate was allowed to fall below 15%, but given the Member States the right to use one or more minimum rates of not less than 5% and there are now exemptions provided in this case.</seg>
<seg>We have asked the European Commission for monitoring in order to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and that the Council and Parliament are informed.</seg>
<seg>In short, the purpose of this proposal is right, but the wrong method was conceived, and if we really want to support the electronic economy of Europe, a VAT exemption from our own e-enterprises and not the attempt, our problems would be too transferred to others, the right signal for it.</seg>
<seg>In order to be able to meet the demands for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, we need to take all possible measures to restrict it.</seg>
<seg>The only case where so far, no tax is levied is that by a third country to the European Community is delivered.</seg>
<seg>The positive discrimination in favour of air transport must be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg>businesses from third countries are still not taxed.</seg>
<seg>CDs are not very ancient, are to be taxed and via the Internet, however, that these programmes are to be exempted from tax.</seg>
<seg>However, the proposed solution is not prove technically feasible and as an obstacle to the development of the Internet transactions in the European Union, although all here-long but their extension.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the Union will lose toothless and productivity.</seg>
<seg>We should devise ways as we electronic commerce to encourage us to be able to and no new methods to break in how we can tax.</seg>
<seg>The liberal State represent the principle as little as possible, while the United States are cited as an example.</seg>
<seg>the Primarolo group prepared simple rules which must be implemented.</seg>
<seg>As objection is the group of view of me in this Parliament that fact should be corrected in the newspapers that benefit of reduced VAT rates, while the reduction is not applicable to the digital newspapers.</seg>
<seg>A tax on kerosene can give it is only in the international consensus, in order to guarantee fair competition.</seg>
<seg>In particular, I welcome the fact that the report has one of the most important statements made by me in my report to the Committee on Transport and Tourism, this Parliament a few months ago, we support to achieve that, as long as there is no doubt that it is politically difficult to come to an international agreement on the taxation of kerosene must examine alternative instruments in the short term at least, to the same effect, including a emissionsabgabe.</seg>
<seg>The industry is in fact responsible for 100% by air traffic control duties and airport taxes for its infrastructure costs, amounting to USD 4 billion in 1998, unlike other modes of transport such as rail and road transport, which are still heavily subsidised.</seg>
<seg>The current situation is unfavourable.</seg>
<seg>In this context, we must unfortunately note that there is a problem with the emissions of air transport, even if it is not so much in percentage terms, but it is growing rapidly, and that is why we should not talk down.</seg>
<seg>This plan will be for the development of SMEs, both inside and outside the Union harmful, particularly in view of the proposed reduction of the threshold value for the release of the tax on an unacceptable low level of annual turnover of 40 000.</seg>
<seg>If we are to be attachment-let in the question which is to be discussed, we actually jeopardize the future of electronic commerce is important for Europe.</seg>
<seg>The starting point, according to which a providers of services, which is based in a third country, which provides a customer in the Community, in one place, needs to be able to be registered, must not lead to a shift from tax revenue between the Member States.</seg>
<seg>The debate in the Council is still under way, among other things, in view of the attempt by the Commission to bring the issue of VAT and electronic commerce in the short term to a successful conclusion to try, I think it is the most appropriate to accept Parliament's amendments, but not yet formally in the discussions in the Council, as far as possible to get through.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, I cannot accept the proposed amendments.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much for the fact that you have taken care of this week, all these different subjects.</seg>
<seg>The Commission, for its part, has only three months after the accident their responsibility and adopted a first package of measures, which has been fully confirmed by the European Parliament on 30 November.</seg>
<seg>It is true that there is an urgent need for more than fifteen existing directives or regulations to unify the practices and to carry out more stringent monitoring of the application of Community standards, in order to prevent the occurrence of considerable and unacceptable differences if necessary in the field of maritime safety in the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs de Palacio for her persistent efforts in the field of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg>I would like to remind the honourable Members that, with safety in air traffic within the European area and in the field of the USA applied compensation do not agree with the sums used in other countries.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, I would like to tell you that it is the French law, which would have the possibility of konfiszieren or of freezing the resources of a specific society in order compensation for damage or others to pay what could impose liability, which goes beyond the amount which is designed in accordance with objective criteria of the current international regulation on pollution from mineral oils.</seg>
<seg>The Commission is of the opinion that these measures are a step in the right direction and to create fairer tax systems, which lead to offer incentives for a more rational and efficient use of the road network.</seg>
<seg>In view of the criticism, especially from Ireland and France, it came to this amendment, and now the matter receives a completely new idiom: you from the British Chancellor of the Exchequer now as a consumer levy for all, and therefore also for British lorry drivers, it represents.</seg>
<seg>I am obliged to ensure that consumers, the current food, whether they come from the EU or from outside, meet the highest standards.</seg>
<seg>Of course I understand the concern of the honourable Member.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, unfortunately I have to say that your answer me is not enough.</seg>
<seg>The issue raised by the honourable Member is very important.</seg>
<seg>In Nigeria Chevron of the Group of the ijaw have accused of, the violence against the people and even Nigerian soldiers have led to have paid to fire at demonstrators at the fleet warri database.</seg>
<seg>In its report, which was adopted on 15 November the Commission came to the conclusion that the operating aid in accordance with Regulation 1540/98 no solution to the problem of the South Korean price practices could be found.</seg>
<seg>I believe that the intentions in its entirety is very reassuring the reality, but in such a way that our shipyards close in the meantime.</seg>
<seg>Question No 38 by (h-0868/00):</seg>
<seg>Commissioner, I can understand that you do not want to change their decision, although ten Member States do not want such a tariff.</seg>
<seg>This initiative is based on a Council regulation on amending the Regulation establishing the current GSP.</seg>
<seg>I represent several zuckerrübenanbauer and I am therefore very concerned.</seg>
<seg>This work is taking place in the committee, but it had to be this week, since Poul Nielson on a Balkan journey.</seg>
<seg>We are currently at the safeguard clause, and if Mr Clegg needs arguments for the talks with his zuckerrübenanbauern, then he can contact me at any time.</seg>
<seg>I would like to thank Mr Liikanen for a reply very positive in every respect.</seg>
<seg>I will raise this issue with my services, as soon as the question of the budget is clear for the next year.</seg>
<seg>My services and I are currently trying to limit the consequences of the geographical distance between the parties process and the future Court.</seg>
<seg>In the same way as the courts in Düsseldorf, Munich and elsewhere in Germany in patent law specialist - and there is also such a specialised Court in London - would also have a court of the Community, which meets and decides cases relating to Community patents, highly specialized its.</seg>
<seg>If such a provisional situation does not verstetigt itself, the Commission, in a letter from July last year, the Member States concerned reminded 13 of its obligation to establish national Community trade mark courts.</seg>
<seg>As the honourable Member knows, submit a complaint has no influence on the continuation of the project.</seg>
<seg>Question No 47 by (h-0877/00):</seg>
<seg>The Commission will thus make it to lose the appeal only in the terms laid down in the regulation, use.</seg>
<seg>The question is, however, to whom the students must address, in order to be able to make sure that complete this course of studies and its conclusion in Great Britain have given the right to recognition of their research findings to them.</seg>
<seg>The limited King, for example, one of the earnings-fullest Finnish Members of Parliament could be chosen.</seg>
<seg>The whole can also be seen as a question of competition, because in the southern Baltic Sea, on the distance Stockholm - Helsinki, which is still allowed duty-free sales, while he is prohibited between Umeå and Vasa.</seg>
<seg>We absolutely must rectify this situation by encouraging and supporting multilingual content, because this is absolutely crucial to the success of the European content industry.</seg>
<seg>I am thinking, in particular, the problem of small investors and companies cannot be a sound business development refer sufficient guarantees.</seg>
<seg>In order to achieve the ambitious project of this European eContent programme for a successful conclusion, the planned procedures must be simplified and protected.</seg>
<seg>That is why it must be the aim of the public support measures for Community content industry to achieve a high level of education and cultural diversity.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, there are the communication networks, which are dependent on content, in order to fill their virtual area inexorably. you again believes it is natural that these content they are buying up and without special consideration for the production rules to be able to use.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I welcome this eContent programme very much and would like to draw attention to two points.</seg>
<seg>I therefore support the amendments in which the implementation of specific measures in the field of new technologies is called for.</seg>
<seg>First of all, to the social and cultural role of digital contents: here, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament stresses the social and cultural aspect of digital content.</seg>
<seg>Environmental noise</seg>
<seg>Indeed, I am grateful for the fact that the Christian Democrats, as well as by the way, a part of the Liberal Group supported these a specific amendment to limit the noise caused by aircraft.</seg>
<seg>Now, the Commission's proposal for European harmonised noise indicators tabled six years later and constant pressure from the French Government.</seg>
<seg>This is a modest proposal in the Scandinavian countries, already stricter standards than it for the year 2012 to be proposed.</seg>
<seg>orly, shiphol, Barcelona and other airports are already sufficient standards.</seg>
<seg>Another important point, which was tabled by us, and which will be particularly important in connection with the problem of aircraft noise is that there should be additional noise indicators apart from noise indicators laid down by the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg>Since there are no common standards in the European Union, it came here to a clear distortion of competition between airports and the unequal treatment of nationals of different Member States.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the amendments tabled by my view of my colleague, Bernd Lange are so important.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I must first say that I welcome this report.</seg>
<seg>That was in principle the idea of Amendment No 36, although I think that this idea is not yet fully invented.</seg>
<seg>We should look at it very carefully and then for both levels combined approach, limit values for the individual emission sources and, on the other hand, quality standards for emissions to create.</seg>
<seg>We need more time, and I regret that we did not have these, even though I support the framework directive in general.</seg>
<seg>As soon as the Member States have submitted comparable information, the Commission is on the question of Community limit values and in an advisory manner in order to reduce the noise exposure, and on other measures will then report back to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg>Food additives other than colours and sweeteners</seg>
<seg>These are the three criteria.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, Mr kollege. me is similarly: you have a dry eye, and I have a frog in the neck, as we say about here with us, but rather the flu.</seg>
<seg>chronic food problems also increase the risk of cancer.</seg>
<seg>At that time, it became apparent that the Commission on the right equipment not imposed in order to introduce appropriate measures.</seg>
<seg>Tomorrow the next stage is on the design for Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, Mrs Paulsen, sitting of the Liberal Group in the saddle and have the opportunity to improve this directive even further.</seg>
<seg>Now a better instrument is to the Member States and the Commission have at its disposal in order to ensure that the Community provisions on animal nutrition are properly implemented and emergencies third countries by advocating a rapid response are possible.</seg>
<seg>We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities, and so far, in particular, these issues have been treated shabbily.</seg>
<seg>The planning process must be implemented honestly and innovative.</seg>
<seg>The multiannual programme for the years 2000-2004 sustainable urban development is a suitable instrument for it, and the implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent instrument for the coordination and implementation of actions.</seg>
<seg>less transport and the withdrawal from fossil fuels at local level are essential if we are to achieve a change in the current climate threat.</seg>
<seg>Many believed that the financial framework is too small.</seg>
<seg>Within this framework should be main partners, the Commission and the networks of the local authorities, which are legally responsible for the development and implementation of measures in the field of sustainable urban development.</seg>
<seg>The Court of Justice of the communities and even the dispute settlement committees of the WTO are of the opinion that the precautionary principle can be applied in the environmental field and in the field of public health, isolated even against the Europeans, as the outstanding procedure for raw milk cheese shows.</seg>
<seg>not harm reduction or compensation, the objective must be the primary objective must it be harmful to the health of people and property or has to stop.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, in 1996, the European Parliament approved in accordance with the precautionary principle, a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in the whole of the European Union, we would have only…</seg>
<seg>absolute scientific certainty on new substances and products does not exist and it will never be.</seg>
<seg>If the precautionary principle is to be implemented efficiently and in a credible way, it is important that all the key parties involved, including representatives of civil society, in the political decisions which will be taken in the context of the application of the principle of involving.</seg>
<seg>Finally, the public health and the environment from above all other considerations, economic, must be a priority.</seg>
<seg>The basic conditions for the use of the precautionary principle is that the fear that it could be harmful consequences, is scientifically justified.</seg>
<seg>Professor George Carlos, an American, whom the Food and Drugs Administration fit in the last seven years a study on the effects of radiation on human health, merely announced yesterday in Lisbon, there would be a risk that the use of mobile phones the incidence of Alzheimer's disease increases brain cancers, and from hautschäden.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the environment and public health are like a complex machine with many roles we monitor and control in order to be able to intervene, so that no damage is happening.</seg>
<seg>In the application of this principle in any case must prevent innovation and economic activity is a barrier to exercise restraint and stop in the industry, and this is the competition is avoided.</seg>
<seg>It will not have escaped Parliament that the Commission agrees with most of the issues raised in your resolution.</seg>
<seg>The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.</seg>
<seg>confirmed in its Article 2 of the right to lives. and whenever the terrorism in Spain for human life, is the whole of the European Union in one of their most basic principles injured.</seg>
<seg>We do not want to replace the legally established institutions but to urge them to protect our rights and our freedoms, without having to give way to the terror.</seg>
<seg>Votes</seg>
<seg>He reminded us of the comments of the Council for the classification of budget lines on the vorruhestandsprojekts at the Commission and the administrative costs in connection with the fisheries agreements.</seg>
<seg>(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)</seg>
<seg>I think that is outdated.</seg>
<seg>These will be 23,428 approval as too little and welcome them necessary growth potential.</seg>
<seg>To this end, which has become effective from the centre of the past year, led, as expected of us - to a dramatic slowing down of the approval of projects and the implementation of payments. in the result was the annual implementation of commitments of this fund at the end of June 2000 with under one percent.</seg>
<seg>This text is an ideal Charter for a practical closure of the Secretary-General of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg>Before I left they said to me: “christmas is just around the corner and we in Bergamo celebrate Christmas and the celebration of the Holy Lucia.</seg>
<seg>In addition, our strong criticism is directed against the production of agricultural products, as well as against the European Union information means begins in order to sell this surplus.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I voted for the report more Garcia Margallo y Marfil on the increase in value-fiscal treatment established services electronically.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I will try to create even before 2004, with a few comments on Malta remedy.</seg>
<seg>I want to say, however, with some ceremony that this was the maximum what I can accept in Europe that is too liberal in my view.</seg>
<seg>a time-limit would encourage the post to further develop and modernise their services, as well as to facilitate planning and investment.</seg>
<seg>They will continue to exert pressure on the money they do with the feed in the 150-gramm-grenze and to strengthen their position.</seg>
<seg>The liberalisation of the postal services in the form proposed by the Commission is not uniformly. I therefore for the report and the amendments have been adequately explained or correct which go in this direction.</seg>
<seg>De Roo report (a5-0378/2000)</seg>
<seg>We also have 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31 our reservations about Amendments Nos, because we are not convinced that they are consistent with the rules of the World Trade Organisation.</seg>
<seg>against a globalisation, which is the most elementary human rights underfoot.</seg>
<seg>That would be contrary to the attention of the national identity (Article 6 (3) of the Convention).</seg>
<seg>It must be emphasised that the linguistic minorities were not weighed down by the globalisation of the Internet, but that new ways of cultural and economic openness to be found.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in the absence of other results gefeil revealed in Nice at least the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The joint resolution of the underlying tone is much too one-sided in this respect.</seg>
<seg>The delay in the publication of the written conclusions, which are still officially available after four days - is not yet how difficult it is, decisions which have been taken in the general disorder clear, to make clear paper.</seg>
<seg>The only way to avoid dangerous conflicts for the future is to remain with the traditional approach according to which Europe is based on mutual respect for national communities.</seg>
<seg>The summit in Nice was on Sunday to end with an agreement which is included in the draft Treaty.</seg>
<seg>The resolution on Nice, put to the vote today does not reflect this.</seg>
<seg>Finally, a comment on social policy, France with the idea of its presidency to address wanted. in the long run it apart from the declarations of good intentions and fine, substantive vague documents, which are totally inadequate in view of the existing problems and the great dissatisfaction, as it has been clearly expressed by the workers in Nice, with a handful of little things remain.</seg>
<seg>With the really important issues, such as taxes and duties, social policy, asylum and immigration, everything was obvious from the old person.</seg>
<seg>impressive at the debate on Nice is the idea that the Treaty has ultimately neither mother or father - it is not one child. the French Presidency was issued in expediency ourselves, instead of promoting clearly the results of the Intergovernmental Conference and the reasons for it.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, the influence of national democracies is waning, because the right of veto is continuing to limit and the European Parliament to be given more power.</seg>
<seg>If we had in the year in which I was born, 1944, at the time of the conclusion of the Chicago Convention foresee these effects, at that time, aviation fuel and other aircraft need would probably not have been agreed by the taxation to be excluded.</seg>
<seg>Since there is no such thing as zero risk, the scientists must, or at least the politicians the criterion of proportionality, to use unsafe risks weighing and their responsibilities.</seg>
<seg>In addition, this Parliament has fought for this reduction in the appropriations for the innovative measures available was offset by the use of the flexibility framework, held in a statement on the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg>In this important area must all role to play, as there is in this global market in which we are now, the new ideas - properly financed, relevantly and realistic supported - which will ensure that we can maintain our place in particular at the forefront of technological development in the new sectors of industry in Europe and in the communication technology.</seg>
<seg>On the question of the budget in the previous speech words have been said already serious: EUR 400 million are in fact only a minimum of funding, and in the second half of additional funding to the opportunities offered by the flexibility instrument to be used to be able, as was expressed in the report.</seg>
<seg>I believe that, as the report also concludes, saying the loss of European added value must go hand in hand.</seg>
<seg>As we all know, unemployment is very high economic into that in the European Union and technologically less-developed regions, particularly in the ziel-1-gebieten. innovative measures must not only be borne by the State will technological nature, but also to promote economic and employment.</seg>
<seg>When I go and see back in my own region, East England, that only one regional administrative bodies in the last period did not use these funds, I doubt whether we were as effective as we need to be in the future, so that we can be described as welcome new communities.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr, Mr Markov, for their constructive and very expert opinions on the proposal for a report on the innovative measures of the ERDF in the period 2000-2006 and wish to express my appreciation.</seg>
<seg>Energy efficiency and environmental aspects has its place in these directives you cause for innovative actions for the third issue, which concerns the regional development and sustainable development.</seg>
<seg>However, we would like to see these projects at regional level are elected, as Mr Berend finish in his contribution well understood.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>That is why we call in this report and in the three amendments, which were also proposed that the Commission is stepping up its efforts to achieve an international arbitration procedure before the World Trade Organisation.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me that the Commissioner must show towards the industry that it is doing everything in order to meet the foreign risk for our industry.</seg>
<seg>Finally, we hope that the shipbuilding Convention at the meeting of the group 6 of the OECD is discussed on 18 December.</seg>
<seg>However, it looks as if finalkept in track always the few a delay, so that we never reach the finishing line.</seg>
<seg>As you all know, only the introduction of the procedure will take up more than six months.</seg>
<seg>For the large groups for their political lawyers after demand less State means that the state and its finances are to be exclusively to them at our disposal.</seg>
<seg>But for this purpose, precisely to the shipbuilding industry and jobs to be consolidated and families security dependent on the sector can be given, on 31 December 2000 aid needed, because the market situation is marked by equal opportunities, but by unfair competition and dumping.</seg>
<seg>improving the competitiveness of the EU shipyards is supported by the Commission, but in view of the considerable price undercutting by the Korean shipyards productivity progress achieved is not enough.</seg>
<seg>The Council stressed that this support mechanism must not distort competition within the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The presence of the average suffered nuclear submarine in waters of Algeciras Bay, extended to a diplomatic conflict between military nuclear and colonial power and a Member State now a second category, as the recent expulsion of Nice is his rights in and does not mention is infantilen declarations.</seg>
<seg>When the medical report, which has spread in the country of the owner - that is, the British press, known weight of the disease, it has no transfer took place in a hospital, but a change to the classification of hospital.</seg>
<seg>Of course, we await with interest the answer from the Commission in order to determine whether the objective has been achieved.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I too would like to express my and my sympathy to the family of the murdered local Council at the beginning and the members of the European People's Party disgust about this fascist barbarity of ETA and their accomplices have expressed.</seg>
<seg>I also consider it advisable, the submarine Tireless as soon as possible, as soon as the appropriate climatic conditions are given to transfer to the repairs to Britain.</seg>
<seg>The Members have asked whether the Commission is of the opinion that the directive 89/618/euratom on the instructions of the population with a radiological emergency situation and the directive 96/29/euratom is eligible for the definition of the basic safety standards with regard to this submarine and have therefore introduced what steps.</seg>
<seg>We are not justified in the context of the usual complaint procedure to make this answer publicly while we can say, more generally, what it said.</seg>
<seg>There is an aspect of the Euratom Treaty, which is the transport of contaminated waste between the Member States of the European Union. Gibraltar is now to the United Kingdom, and contaminated waste from one part of the United Kingdom in another part of the country, without passing transported in another Member State of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Spain also needs to win the confidence of the people on rocks.</seg>
<seg>We now have a Member State which behaves in this way with the public from another Member State, as it would do with any other country in the world, as if there were fifty years after the beginning of European integration societatis none affectio as if European solidarity would not have made any progress.</seg>
<seg>In fact implemented in British waters at a certain time as a German submarine.</seg>
<seg>There is being discussed, but the citizens direct its attention consciously or intuitively towards the European institutions.</seg>
<seg>Because of the cuts made by the Labour Government in the defence budget, are less money for the acquisition of new military equipment in order, so that in future on cases more is expected in which faulty technology for absolutely necessary repairs must be deactivated.</seg>
<seg>The competence of the Community, how much this perhaps also some quite different wishes extends, however, neither to the classification of ports to implementation of repair work at submarines still on the questions of technical safety of nuclear reactors or on a submarine demands that must be brought to the repair elsewhere.</seg>
<seg>In order to be able to help them better still, we would have to call on the Community institutions, to increase the financial, human and material resources of the UNHCR.</seg>
<seg>I call on the Commission to increase as well as always show in all its agreements with the NGOs the UNHCR coordination body financial support for the UNHCR again.</seg>
<seg>In other words, it must have access to the civilian victims and their teams in the field must be able to move safely and the necessary resources to fulfil their mission.</seg>
<seg>In November the Commission adopted a report 22 on the common asylum procedure and a uniform status, valid throughout the Union of the recognised asylum seekers on that is the final objective of the common European asylum system laid down in Tampere.</seg>
<seg>I would like bezeigen my respect for all the work that has been done for success in his new position by Mrs Ogata for the UNHCR, Mr Ruud Lubbers all wish closure.</seg>
<seg>It seems important to us for the restoration of a political amnesty to press in Yugoslavia, but it is just as important, in our opinion, that we condemn the renewed outbreak of the attacks and terrorist activities at the border between Albania and Kosovo, Serbia, in all clarity, because this is in worrying form of incidents during the Kosovo conflict, which includes the Western powers responsible.</seg>
<seg>paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 our compromise resolution contain clear demands.</seg>
<seg>I also appeal to the President Kostunica to investigate what happened with people such as Mr Ukshin Hoti, with whose fate we has repeatedly been involved here, and whose fate we know nothing at all.</seg>
<seg>I can also support the appeal to the KFOR to prevent further attacks in the Presevo Valley.</seg>
<seg>I welcome from KFOR introduced step towards solving the problem and are continuing to call on all parties to exercise restraint seriously.</seg>
<seg>b5-0916/2000 of Mr Baron Crespo and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;</seg>
<seg>This clause was adopted in March in the Palais. moneda I know so well because I had the privilege, with the inauguration of President of the Aylwin number for the regime of General Pinochet an end after the plebiszit which, to be present.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something about the resolution, for which we will be voting, of course.</seg>
<seg>The international community must exercise their right to democratic control, not as interference in the internal affairs of an independent country, but as a political, cautious and preventive action.</seg>
<seg>The situation in the prisons and the police stations where, among other things, ill-treatment and torture are on the agenda, is completely unacceptable.</seg>
<seg>This treatment would correspond exactly in Western Europe, and due to the protests the Minister hikmet Sami Turk postponed the transfer so that throughout Turkey a social and political consensus can be drawn up on a prison reform.</seg>
<seg>The matter is urgent, and we have therefore decided to put this item on the agenda.</seg>
<seg>January is to be made for the next year, the process and accused him in a meeting of Tunisian opposition in France have participated at 8 which it denies, however.</seg>
<seg>If the Members and officials of these organisations are to hold a meeting on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, their homes are surrounded by the police, and who, on the road dares itself by men in civilian clothing one attacks.</seg>
<seg>The second case is only part of a network of harassment.</seg>
<seg>My group, like this Parliament, is following the human rights situation in Tunisia and the rest of the world, with special attention.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, measured we wonder a little.</seg>
<seg>The negotiations went extremely well and I am very pleased that we are making progress here and I hope that the outcome is in the discussions which the honourable Member has addressed.</seg>
<seg>Several Members referred to the position of the prisoners in Turkey.</seg>
<seg>b5-0912/2000 by Mr Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;</seg>
<seg>We should not be inferior to them, as I believe that in this position.</seg>
<seg>In this context, held the seizure of power by the military who contributed in any case to exacerbate the situation.</seg>
<seg>This attitude is part of the continuity of the policy of the French imperialism.</seg>
<seg>The Commission is very concerned about the recent violence.</seg>
<seg>The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.</seg>
<seg>Unfair competition can destroy the loss of know-how and jobs have a good climate and shipbuilding in the long term, lead to a monopoly situation, which is damaging to world trade.</seg>
<seg>Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg>That is why I would like to thank all my colleagues for their cooperation, also at the amendments and experts in the committee, which has contributed significantly to bring the resolution signed, sealed and delivered.</seg>
<seg>We are delighted about the adoption of the social agenda by the European Council in Nice, and we hope that the Member States will use this opportunity to develop and better coordinate the social security and health care systems more for the elderly, in order to start at the same time, however, other measures to guarantee their reintegration into working life, such as lifelong learning.</seg>
<seg>The promotion of lifelong learning, an issue which has already been mentioned in the debate is something which I also support.</seg>
<seg>people over 60 or 70 years can do, of course, many useful things, but it is not right to link their income at that age for the work they have done.</seg>
<seg>The European Central Bank has already warned urgently in its monthly report from July 2000.</seg>
<seg>In my view, the Member States can tackle the problem with the help of their legislative instruments better.</seg>
<seg>Thanks to its proposals for an active life at the age of society as a whole generation.</seg>
<seg>The promises must be adhered to, but the pensions are to be guaranteed by means of these countries, without the payment at the expense of the common monetary policy of the European Union must be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg>We have seen the greatest social revolution in the last 100 to 150 years, as the age has been doubled by people.</seg>
<seg>It gives meaning to the calculations of the lives of enlargement, which was made possible by the medical progress.</seg>
<seg>They could be paid - which was so involved in the whole of society - older workers separate but young workers were not included, and many positions have been deleted.</seg>
<seg>The family and tax policy should cause more that women and men who have family obligations can choose whether they want to be employed or not.</seg>
<seg>My brother and I accompanied him.</seg>
<seg>future initiatives in the field of public health are rather on health and care issues at the age and towards the promotion of healthy ageing.</seg>
<seg>Amendments Nos 2 and 3, in which he is in favour of a change in the text and "demographic development requires the use of the term in place of the wording of the population” “obsolescence taken up.</seg>
<seg>The advertising and promotion measures in the sector and the authorities do not receive the emphasis is to be placed on European issues, for example, to overlap with.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the Committee on Budgets also meant to be able in principle to take a positive attitude towards the Commission's proposal.</seg>
<seg>It is therefore very important to create a balance in this area and to the promotion and advertising measures is very well developed.</seg>
<seg>I believe that in the marketing, with the sale in the training programmes lifelong learning should be brought more into focus, because the new technologies, the use of the promotion of a modern logistics completely new opportunities to give.</seg>
<seg>I would just like to start by congratulating Mr Dary on his excellent report.</seg>
<seg>The next point is that when we talk about exports and intervention.</seg>
<seg>No special payments for no demand products should be carried out and no publicity campaigns for these to be carried out.</seg>
<seg>Everyone has sufficient food and if we support for a product is, of course, directed against the use of a product.</seg>
<seg>Amendments Nos 18 and 24, first part, by which time intervals, in which the suggestionable issues and products are considered to be reduced from two years to three years in order to improve the effectiveness of aid instrument.</seg>
<seg>In the Greek version Mrs Jutta Haug is defined as rapporteur, and Mr Mann, Mr Markus Ferber as rapporteur, as a woman.</seg>
<seg>We can see here, as with small changes in practice large effects can be achieved.</seg>
<seg>It is provisionally last Friday in Strasbourg, namely Strasbourg 12 days lost the presence of Parliament.</seg>
<seg>In conclusion, I would like everything, especially the few who have found it worth the effort on this Friday to be present at the last sitting in Strasbourg in the year 2000, to wish you all a happy Christmas and a happy new year, but above all wise.</seg>
