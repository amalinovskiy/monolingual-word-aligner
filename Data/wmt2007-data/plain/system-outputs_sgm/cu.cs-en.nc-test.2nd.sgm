Racially divided Europe
In fact, the extreme right is its racism and that the use of immigration issue in its political benefits.
The Italian lega Nord, Dutch vlaams bloc French le penova National Front - all of this are examples parties or movement outcomes of common averze against immigrants and promotes simplistic view on how to address the question of immigrants.
While individua like J??rg Haider or Jean-Marie Le Pen come and (never quite soon) go, the question of racial and racism from the policy just right disappear.
For the growing racial roztříštěností in European countries are two factors: aging populations and otevírající the boundaries.
Right and left party concentrated around the political center hiding before this problem head in the sand doufajíce despite everything that the question of immigration, once itself will disappear.
But she will know how to America's racial history.
Race relations stand in the United States have long decades in the center of political debate, up to the extent that racial divisions are as important as income, and often Moreover, the political preferences and attitudes.
The first step to grip racial policy is understand the earliest days and the consequences of racial intolerance, even if it means that, become home truths.
In the United States of the postaraly massive economic sociological, psychological and politologické surveys.
Result from them, that people different race to each other much less trust that white only unwilling to promote social expenditures, because they are seen as assistance minorities, and that racially dilute communities are much less effective public administration, rampant corruption in them, protežování and crime, and there is less productive public goods to one tax the dollar.
This does not mean that the solution is eliminate all diversity and build racially homogeneous community, but that to begin to build solid public policy addressing relations between different race, we must primarily never admit the existence of these problems.
Of course, even Americans are not in this direction United.
Some of the occupying positive discrimination, which minorities admits preference for the adoption of the workplace, college and in the allocation of public procurement.
This policy is viewed not only as compensation for historical grievances, but also as a way of the creation of a positive examples of human and suppression of continuing, and perhaps bezděčné discrimination.
But it is even many people who rail against positive discrimination and who argue that, for that there were jobs for minorities and to the black family remained together, just a quality, rasoslepá "policy in combination with policies of the free market and promoting family values.
Aid family values is crucial in any policy, as did not the cause of poverty in the US is a huge amount of households with one parent (read: the free mother) in the black communities.
While we solution, but this is mainly on that American policy to racial question at least an position.
Minority of course, a massive well under way towards integration and economic success.
In the 1950s, not blacks sit in front of the bus; today it is two black occur at the tip of American foreign policy.
American right-wing politicians, of course, even now takticky use of racial question as a political tool.
For example, Pat Buchanan, former aide Presidents nixona and Reagan, who in the US presidential election ran as an independent.
Recently, with the success of a book with the dying, the West "on how vymírající population and the invasion of immigrants threaten America and the Western civilization.
On each one such book, however, is ten additional that America's racial question dealt with serious analysis.
In Europe but political analysis and debate on relations between different race significantly is lagging.
In the case of this question talks very badly, within the meaning of immigration quotas and frontier restrictions, and not in the sense of social problems and opportunities that racially mixed Europe offers.
To stop the illegal immigrants, of course, is needed clear immigration policy.
It did not goes further: America's racial politics also do not controls on the US-Mexican border.
Europe is rich and kvapem older. Europeans, protected generous social programs, refuse to do, "dirty work in agriculture or perhaps in kožařském industry.
The rise of immigrants is therefore inevitable.
Europeans, but never leave miss an opportunity to America criticized for any of its failures in politics to minorities or for any of racism on the other side of the Atlantic.
When the začteme into the press, it is impossible to nevšimnout a complex superiority to the United States in the question of racial policy: they, Americans are with rasismem problems, we Europeans, we are against him immune, perhaps to poblázněné neonacisty and similar them.
But it to what in recent weeks since Paris to Amsterdam, shows that racial problem is in Europe much deeper and that just as in the US is based on the sad truth that race relations are fundamentally complex, and that trust and cooperation between the human race is not always taken for granted and easy.
Start if the main European political parties with the gravity and frankness invest in understanding of racial tensions in Europe, and if the question of racial one of their main priority vězme that individuals le penova stripe will not be delayed with that this vacuum filled with its hate message.
The battle with the exception of French
The attention of Europe is now law focused on enlargement and the European Constitution, that is currently be EU Member States.
For the fate of new and enlarged Europe, however, will be equally important result of a few French rozmíšek with the European Commission.
France decided to that will be unilaterally ignore the Stability and Growth Pact, because its future budget deficit well over the 3% of GDP.
The French love to boast rational and hard-headed reference, but as regards budgets, then descartese replaced confusion concepts.
When the Irish government in 2000 lowered its budget surplus of $4% of GDP of only half of one percent of France, belonged to its critics of the front.
The Stability Pact already violated and other countries, but France is the first to do so with pošklebky and open defiance.
However, this should not by surprise.
France simply applies to the rules of the EU undeserved habit of its own culture viewed as an exceptional.
The French, for example, constantly vetují reform of the common agricultural policy of the EU.
But even children know that this policy is a good and completely nezaslouženým gift from rich European (and in particular, the French farmers) at the expense of struggling farmers in developing countries and consumers in the EU.
France is also seek to return to the old politics rescue non-profit private companies standing on the verge of bankruptcy money taxpayers.
The EU's Commissioner for Competition Mario Monti into such battles cannot go: needs the support of those who believe in free market and a level playing field.
The story of this is simple.
The French government plans to save the company alstom, which has developed a series of high technology products, including a French train TGV, but recently declared bankruptcy.
Government says that the plan to save alstomu never not give up; that it is led by all well known dirigistickými motives: to maintain employment protection of investors, etc.
Moreover, because it is alstom technological companies pulls the French government also card research and development and he argues that investments in research and development stimulate growth.
Saving alstomu zestátněním is clearly wrong.
The company is composed of many different parts of the, some of which are profitable and other krachují: it would be so obvious firm out.
Profitable part, such as TGV, buyers easy to find, while non-profit operations should be closed.
Money French taxpayers would be more effectively deployed to temporary support brought workers than subsidies, which will be kept alive nonprofit factory.
It is important that the European Commission have France ušít in question competition in the peace special rules, as it has already apparently happening in the budget deficits.
The Commission must undermine the State aid French private companies, like prevents the subsidies in any other member country of the EU.
In this field the Commission has reached a certain success, particularly when forced Germany to abolished government guarantees on the state-owned banks.
France as a whole and firm alstom particularly should not be exception, and should hold the same standards.
If the Commission will act to the EU more remind playground for the French state officials.
France is now took the lead role in the EU foreign policy, where Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin increasingly looks and act as foreign minister of Europe.
At the same time, France's key rules common economic policy and State aid private companies.
Lose the European Commission of its credibility and will eventually remind less pařížský circuit?
Defeat in the case of alstomu should for Europe profound implications - and not only about competition.
The war on oil
For decades America through democratic and Republican presidential administrations gives in the field of oil policy several přímočarých objectives: to maintain the world oil prices to what is level; what nejbezbolestněji restrict domestic oil consumption; to reduce the possibility of dependence on imports from abroad; diversification of sources of oil imports.
While it may seem, none of these targets for the Bush administration's unchanged.
Many observers believe that Bush complaint against new direction, because he seems that the invasion of Iraq these objectives completely protiřečí.
Substantial increase in production in Iraq would likely to increase the US dependence on oil compared to other energy sources, because with regard to new stocks probably oil prices fall.
It will be as a result of mean an increase in the light of the US to oil imports, especially from the Middle East.
Ironically, however, that the US should over the Iraqi oil sector far more powerful pre-war during the UN's, oil-for-food "(in which the not Saddam Hussein, but the UN indicated the level of Iraqi oil sales abroad) than in the future will have a democratic Iraq.
If the Bush administration was a permanent, safe, varied and cheap oil supplies, could simply repeal its ban on Libya, Iran, Iraq, and Sudan, and oil would be a řinula.
America's interest in the Iraqi oil but not kept or economic, and energy policy.
The Bush Administration recognized that the Iraqi oil is primarily a critical geopolitical asset.
Who controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq.
Saddam's power means that control of the world's largest oil supplies.
The role that oil in his power sehrávala, very well aware.
When Saddam was forced to confront the invasion and slaughter, threatening zapálením Iraqi oil fields.
Much of the subsequent harming and plunder oil equipment and pipelines in the country reflects widespread perception that dominate the oil means dominate Iraq.
At a time when the US planned to invasion, as it became a priority security oil fields.
The aim is to strengthen the oil supplies or reduce its prices for Americans, but to get rid of Saddam power, in posledku established and to consolidate the new Iraqi government.
The future of Iraq directly depends on the fate of Iraq's oil production.
But because of vrtochům oil industry, especially for as unstable conditions, it is difficult to predict how will the next few years, the Bush administration able to fill in Iraq their goals.
The logic is simple.
The US must oil revenues used to of America's national sejmuly tax burden of the financing of regime change in Iraq.
Any plans reconstruction rely in the long run on the ability to Iraq to export large volumes of oil.
Can if Iraq oil zpeněžit, then President Bush cannot meet promises, which gave the Iraqi and the American people and the world community.
Before an invasion of Iraq's oil production capacity to three million barrels per day.
During the period, which is needed to produce the Iraqi government Iraq will not be able to increase production to this level.
Each increase in Iraq's oil production will require preparing reserves to develop, so large investments legitimate parliamentary government and political stability.
Early realization these requirements expectation nor the Bush administration.
Political stability is the main precondition increase production capacity.
Historical experience from Iran, Kuwait, Russia, or even of the Iraq suggest that from the recurrence of political stability is needed about three years before the capacity of significantly increased and new, higher levels is here to stay.
Iraq needs a few years, to write a new constitution, a legitimate democratic government, have the distribution of income from oil among the regions, a new investment laws and made its economy attractive to foreigners.
It also needs a time in the negotiations with international oil companies and neighboring countries, the technical analysis and feasibility studies and for reconstruction, modernization and survey of their owners of oil deposits.
As a hopeful, so it seems, a time frame, which assumes that during this period ending the occupation and Iraqis establish their own democratic government and that will be achieved political stability.
The situation, of course, can develop very different.
Tension may continue for years.
Moreover, should surprise no one should not even if I under democratic government production of Iraqi oil suddenly stopped.
History suggests that workers strikes and similar shocks that can extracting oil stop are greater threat in democratic than in undemocratic countries.
If Iraq can in the next few years its production capacity significantly raise, it becomes a barrier to both foreign and energy policy the US.
How will the US long-term reconstructing Iraq finance?
Who will pay the efforts of Iraq's fragile democracy?
For the US occupation will be sustainable if will not be able to ensure that the Iraqi people food, health care, and other basic services?
The hard questions that are in principle nezodpověditelné until will in Iraq stable, a democratic regime capable of control and to guarantee the uninterrupted flow of oil exports.
Let murderers mobilized of human rights
If that were so deeply depressing, the report could be šibeniční anekdotou Millennium: Libya was elected předsednickou countries of the Commission for human rights in the UN!
When Caligula choose to the Senate his horse, had his horse at least for kopytech blood.
Procedure was, of course, completely legal: the Presidency each year is shifting from one of the region to another.
This year proposed chairman Africa and nominovala Libya.
Only voted against the US and Canada.
To their eternal shame, European countries refrain from voting.
Is the telling commentary to address moral bankruptcy of the UN that this Decision comes at the time for the organization of such a delicate.
President Bush called the UN to make it clear that takes seriously their own binding decisions concerning Iraq: could, otherwise capture neslavně as well as the company nations, which is in the 1930s expressed as incapable of when should face aggressive political approaches fascist Nazi Germany and Italy.
Choose now Libya to head the authority of the UN, who is responsible for human rights, he will help to strengthen the legitimacy and moral authority of the world's organization.
Recall: Libya is totalitarian tyranny, its leader, Muammar Gadhafi, enriching their sometimes erratic behavior extrémistickými political approaches and supports the world's dictators.
Is leading the one of the nejrepresivnějších regimes of the world where the at the polls, nothing nepředstírá and dissent with respect to its neck.
Under his rule Libya helped terrorist organizations from around the world - from the IRA to different Palestinian extremist groups.
Yet is under the UN sanctions because of the role played a ten years ago in bomb assassination plane society panam over a Scottish Lockerbie.
In the last decade, status as a symbol of the UN peacekeeping ideals of the world's constantly faded.
The organization of itself as a totally unable to stop the war in the Balkans. But in at least one case - in Srebrenica - the Dutch mírotvorné the UN force, and watched worst massacre in postwar Europe, when the Bosnian Serbs killed around six thousand bezbranných Muslim men.
The Dutch investigative commission later admitted that their banner of the UN was a war crime complicity.
At the moment in Rwanda began genocide, leader of the UN responsible for mírotvorné operations ordered the evacuation of the UN troops of the country, and leave field completely open nejkrvavějšímu genocidnímu massacre since World War II.
The official UN named Kofi Annan.
It is a heavy and poor record in history, which is the UN to - perhaps in vain - to make up for the fact that, in the Iraq crisis appears as the voice of reason and international legitimacy.
But when the UN inspections in Iraq reminds Salvation Army sent odpravit group gangsterů to bolster Libya to chair the Commission for human rights may in history write as the final failure organization, which life began with as many expectations.
The usually do not die - and it is good reason to ensure that the UN will lame on.
But will only the shadow of what it should and could be.
The United Nations, no one hypocrisy neodpáře.
Autoritáři before the gates
Last Thursday me judges Indonesian central court in jakartě sentenced to one year in prison.
As the editor of intelligence weekly rate was, according to the Court provinil nactiutrháním against commercial magnátovi on behalf of the Tomy winata that I indirectly signaled its possible share fire textile market for Southeast Asia in jakartě and that I disseminated lies stoked the riots by.
It is my case, where he similar a harbinger of the end of the further short-term experiment with democracy in Indonesia?
She "trouble" to which I allegedly stoked, was in may last year, when almost two hundred hrdlořezů indicating the winatovy followers he was office weekly pace, threatened by firing buildings, excessive staff and wounded one reporter.
In an effort to help to peaceful resolution of the situation was to persuade to act on the central police station jakartě, but to his horror, I found that the station control the leaders of the gang.
Those me beating and digging, while the police to look elsewhere.
Fortunately, the US to help přispěchalo many journalists are zapnutými dictating machines and cameras.
Their broadcasts, which led to the public outrage forced Parliament organize public hearings.
It was summoned by national and jakartský police chief and leaders gang were on the basis of a strong public pressure charged with crime.
Winata itself, however, police investigation escaped, and that only on the basis of public declaration that his followers act without his previous knowledge or consent.
Winata then made their own criminal the Ahmad taufika, which in that Article, he wrote teuku iskandara aliho, who had editoval, and me.
Annual proceedings then said many suspect reversals of which all zvýhodňovaly winatu.
So primarily a suit sepsaná police and the national representative as a tawdry way fraudulent documents that police accused two own officers.
Nevertheless, the court refused to our request for deferment management, until the bursts právoplatnost State sepsané actions.
The case of officers implicated in falsifying presumably leads into lost.
One of them was even was promoted to master of the fledging (and the United States) financed by the anti-terrorist forces in jakartě.
The second then was sent to police academy, where training advanced training.
The sixth month consultation action was the presiding judge in tříčlenném Senate suddenly povýšena on the municipal court in the city of the hour drive from Jakarta.
One of my lawyers noted that for 35 years practice in the courts have never had to be the presiding judge removed from not yet the case.
Judge, despite the elevation continue to předsedala court in another case pending in the same building.
To her vacancy he judges, who in previous winatově civil suit decided against the pace.
And finally winata committed during the testimony of křivopřísežnictví when denied that would with him pace to talk.
Before the Court was played a record of this telephone conversation, the tribunal heard místopřísežnou box testimony reporter, which led conversation, and two editors, who there were seen as proof of the existence of call was presented an official record telephone company and professional witness concluded that the voice on nahrávce really belongs tomymu winatovi.
The Judges, however, rejected the pace that was winata arrested and tried for křivopřísežnictví, and told us that we have a right to the police, which were made.
The judge then rejected and our request for a court decision to solving the winatova křivopřísežnictví.
Given the so pochybenému management was my conviction and nepodmíněný punishment no surprise.
Still, I am not losing the hope that eventually zvítězíme to begin to appeal pace discussed courts of last resort.
Higher Indonesia's courts are cleaner, the President of the Supreme Court is loyal supporter of democracy and freedom of the press. The case of the weekly rate might become památným victory our democracy, much as it became famous Decision US Supreme Court in the case of New York Times vs. Sullivan.
By increasing laťky for action for libel ensure that the American journalists can carry public officials to responsibility.
No country knows better than Indonesia that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are proven a democratic development and that kriminalizace journalists is early signs of authoritarianism.
In the 1950s was Indonesia liberal democracy, until in 1956 nezahájil President sukarno in support of the military campaign against the press.
Conceal critical of the vote facilitate the consolidation of his unchecked power and in June 1959 declared sukarno the beginning of the "managed democracy".
During the first few years after sukarnově fall in 1966 were all the benefits of real democracy, including press freedom restored (for the communists but not).
Regime of President suharta, however, the early 1970s launched a strong action against the press, leading to the prohibition of media and imprisonment of many journalists.
Once was brought under control press has quickly okleštěna and other political rights and Indonesia's democracy again failed.
After suhartově fall in 1998 Indonesia became a third largest democratic countries and the world's largest democracy Muslim communities in history.
Two parliamentary elections and two direct presidential elections -- including the recent of the second round of the presidential about - are free, fair and peaceful, which demonstrate that Islam and democracy there may be together.
By the enemies of democracy, however, never sleep.
Radical Islamist groups are carried out of unthinking bombings, while groups are strong authoritarian inclinations penetrate potential circles around of Megawati Sukarnoputri.
President Megawati, however, had suffered defeat in their quest for re-election.
Will the newly elected President susilo continue prosecuting journalists?
It is my conviction, as well as processes and conviction of other journalists, mean the beginning of the end hard-won third democracy in Indonesia?
The answer lies in question what aid can Indonesia's fighters for democracy to obtain at home and abroad.
The loss of Indonesia - potential lights hope for all combatants for democracy in the global Muslim community - would be a terrible slaughter.
The death penalty morálnost
The United States are often criticized for refusing to abolish the death penalty.
Many people now argue that the abolition of death penalty is a prerequisite civilized system criminal law.
Nobel Gary Becker with this opinion disagree.
European governments are neoblomně oppose the death penalty -- the European Union he even expressly prohibited -- and some Europeans see its application in the United States for barbarous.
Many European intellectuals he argues that not only the death penalty, but the general any punishment can not criminals.
But, while Europeans, in which the crime of the last half-century has far below American levels, long could for most of the crimes afford relatively "soft" approach, during the last years of twenty years, they saw a sharp increase in crime.
American crime, by contrast, fell, partly because the wider application of punishment.
They include and the death penalty.
I support execution people usvědčených of murder, because -- and only for this reason, I believe that this avoid another murders.
If I do not, building would against hrdelnímu punishment, because reprisal and other possible motives should serve as the basis of public policy.
Serious empirical research death penalty began in the US průkopnickou studies isaaca ehrlicha, published in 1975 in the American economic review.
Some subsequent studies revealed much weaker discouraging effect, while others have reached the conclusion that this effect is far stronger.
The data available, however, are quite limited, so, no one should its conclusions based solely on econometric evidence.
Public policy in the field of any punishment, of course, cannot wait until will have a perfect evidence.
Even in a limited availability of quantitative evidence, however, there are good reasons to believe that the death penalty is discouraging effect.
Most people -- and killers especially -- is the fear of death, especially when it comes quickly and with a high probability after the murder.
As in the debate on the suicide said philosopher David Hume, "No one never neodhodil life until stood for it to live.
Or such is our natural terror of Death??? "similarly schopenhauer believed that" as soon as the horrors of life can to phase in which outweighs the horrors of death, one of their lives to end.
The death of terror, however, set a considerable resistance. "
Opponents of the death penalty often proclaim that State has no moral right take someone life, even though nejodsouzeníhodnějšího killer.
For anyone who believes that the death penalty deters, but it is absolutely wrongly concluded.
To understand why, suppose for each killer, which is executed (and who is not vyměřen, for example, life sentence), the number of murder reduced by the three, which is far lower than in the number of their estimates deterrent effect places Ehrlich and some other.
This means that for each nepopraveného killer would have died three innocent victims.
If so, the government neuplatňovala the death penalty, indirectly, it "from" many lives.
Saving three innocent lives for each popraveného man appears to be very alluring trade, and even two zachráněné on lives for execution represent a convincing the costs and benefits of a capital punishment.
Admittedly, the falling number of survivors lives per execution this argument in favor of the death penalty losing to pádnosti.
But even if any hanging saved the only human life, would still was this "trade" desirable in the case that would have been saved life better than life taken, which would normally true.
Many people have objections to compare the quality of the preserved and zmařeného life.
I personally, I do not see how the such comparisons avoided.
Consider "kariérního" criminals who oloupí and kill victim that led true life, leaving behind several children and husband and wife.
And assume that popravou such criminal could be save the lives of a single victims.
To my obviously, save lives such victims must have greater weight than the zločincova life.
Not all cases are, of course, thus uncertain, but comparisons of individuals must form part of any reasonable social policy.
This helps explain why should be the death penalty vyměřován only for murder, and not a less serious crimes.
If we should measured taking lives and, for example, reducing the property crime, then it argument in favor of mírnějších punishment for much stronger.
Although the heavy assault health, including some hideous crimes rape may its significance some murders approximate and could possibly call for the hardest punishment, I personally its application in such cases nepodporuji.
A powerful argument for reducing the death penalty exclusively on murder is the so-called "limit deterrence."
If, for example, the assault trestalo popravou, they would perpetrators motivated by their victims to kill in order to avoid justice (which is significant reason why the severity of the punishment should be the seriousness of the crime).
One of the complications associated with hrdelním what may be the fact that the killer will sveřepěji impede justice, which could lead to further death.
Limit deter here while plays an important role, but I believe we resistance killers to apprehend, sometimes even at the cost of losing their life is, in fact, indirect evidence that the criminals are from the death penalty really fear.
Of course, I fear risk that will be executed innocent people.
My support the death penalty would be greatly ochabla if the percentage of executions of innocent people were actually as high as many says.
I believe, however, that review process in the US has a huge protection -- perhaps not so much against suffer inequitable conviction as against unfair he had -- so cases kill innocent people there is little, if any.
This process extremely helped development identification through Moreover, the DNA.
And so may be repeated that debate about the death penalty is essentially debate about his frightful effect (which prolonged process may appeal reduce).
To understand that some people invoke the evidence skeptical, even if they personally believe that, at this point the wrong, and that against them in this question is even a common sense counted.
Take someone life is very alarming, even if it was a life, but sometimes it is necessary to take even very unpleasant steps to prevent even worse behavior, which frustrates the lives of innocent victims.
People versus Putin
In Search of successor first democratically elected Russia's President Boris Yeltsin's I helped with selection of Vladimir Putin.
Whereas Russia now dominate structures at the edge of the KGB and Mafia and the same structure manipulating the judicial system is that Yeltsin wanted to put in place of his successor in order to avoid future prosecution.
But we who we are Putin chose, we were instructed to search for someone who would protect Yeltsin and his family, but someone who would continue in his reforms.
Yeltsin did not fear and neusiloval on their survival, but the survival of the democratic ideas, already to Russia said.
Yet it is now this idea at risk because successor, for which we decided.
Deny their responsibility for support Putin.
We were close friends, but we worked in emergencies and I never doubted its sincerity.
Putin act in accordance with their the beliefs.
The problem is that his conviction -- including the view that Russia can prosper, only if it control the sole source of power -- are flawed.
This fundamental error leads Russia to political crash.
Of course, no one nezastává high function without doing errors, errors even fundamental, which is particularly true a times.
Yeltsin was no exception, its mistakes, however, the IMF recognized.
For example, when the following New Year's Eve 1999 went into retirement, requested relief for the fact that the war in Chechnya.
Putin, on the contrary, it seems unable to understand and acknowledge its mistakes and insists on a policy of long after he had its failure to be clear the entire world.
One of the Yeltsin errors was that at the top of the his program of reform to impose moral priorities.
Russia should restitution for stalinismus and system of the Gulag.
The entire nation without exception was expressed sorrow, as it since 1945 show Germans.
This failure is important, because Putin's unconditional faith in central power to result in the state capture security guards.
Indeed, the direct result of national remorse for an era of the Gulag should be the prohibition of the Communist Party and diskvalifikace workers KGB from the political functions.
Although in the postcommunist societies where persecution and collaboration were so widespread -- and boundaries between them often neostré -- are such political lustrace complex, find a solution is possible, as in the Czech Republic.
Inaction leave the Russian security structures without injury, capable of political return, which they had succeeded.
A resurgence of political structures of the KGB during Putin's government and their efforts to conceal dissent again have transformed Russia in the country sběhů.
It is impossible to silence independent policies and independent media, nezadusíme if independent sources of money, which is why Putin's Kremlin focused their attacks on the so-called "oligarchs."
This is why was zorganizováno court and the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
The security forces, which dominate the Kremlin, hope that the removal of independent resources money destroyed in Russia independent political life.
Without independent myšlenkových bases is beginning to uchytávat atmosphere of fear.
Fear, however, is not only humiliating; it also allows mismanagement state.
Yeltsin intuitivně understood that fear and vertically controlled, centralized decisions are right choice for the management of modern country, and therefore insisted on reform of relations between citizens and state.
Putin has still not understand that centralized political system today cannot understand mistakes and to remedy is, as well as those of the Soviet era.
Putin does not well educated man with absolute and deep frankness leads Russia to the same destruction that accompanied the break-up of the Soviet state.
People are beginning to realize it.
Understand that Putin's desire to build a powerful and effective modern state cannot be implemented, because the modern state is run from above, but well informovaným electorates, which state officials to recognize and correct its mistakes.
Putin appears inability of his regime also fears.
This is one reason why Russia began to behave as aggressively to its neighbors, Ukraine, Georgia, and why seeks to maintain the military presence in places like Transdneister, odštěpenecký region Moldova.
The Kremlin thinks that děláním shoulders in the immediate neighborhood, Russia can Russians at home convinced of their všemocnosti.
Given the vykleštěnosti debates in Russia and the Kremlin's ability to manipulate elections, the only option, which remains those who want to maintain democratic in Russia, the idea is regime change.
Insisting on iluzích could not help.
Those who oppose Putin must over what they want, and declare that if the cannot ensure compliance with the Constitution, they have the right to the compel all necessary means.
On the subject of power today in Russia cannot decide only at the ballot box.
As in Ukraine, in Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan, for it will determine in the streets.
Daňte and utrácejte (please)
The excess taxation may otupit incentives and slow growth.
Too low taxation but may lead to the same.
Governments are skrovnými tax revenues cannot ensure basic public goods.
Worse yet, the low tax revenues in poor countries often created by deficiencies system collecting taxes (rather than from low tax rates), which, inter alia support unproductive businesses.
The importance of well proposed tax system demonstrates India.
In Bangalore the high tech companies built areály at world level, full bred turf and high-speed networks for remote data transmission.
Beyond these areály but lies open stoky, anybody nesbírané garbage, and roads in havarijním condition.
Although the company's new technologies at any moment terabajty convey information to remote continents, local transport moving nearly medieval speed.
Businesses in Bangalore therefore operate their own bus line, hire private supplier drinking water and mounted generators to protect themselves against výpadkům supplies of electrical power.
State this mess cannot correct, because it is broke.
India's public debt exceeds 70% of GDP, so more than half of tax revenue is interest payments.
Debt, however, did not because of excessive spending in the past.
India's government spending is about 15% of GDP, the average in the OECD around $40% of GDP.
India's financial problems are more of bad koncipovaného and managed by tax system.
Rates and rules income taxes natural and corporate is, as international standards appears to be uměřeně.
Nevertheless, the government of India select income tax of only about 3.7% of GDP, therefore, about half from South Korea, and other Asian Tigers.
In India roughly one-quarter of the GDP of agriculture, but not wealthy farmers do not pay taxes.
Exportně aimed companies operating in the software industry and other areas have on its gains tax holidays, although their employees income taxes must pay.
Despite prudent rates are widespread tax evasion.
To cheat on occurs because the government to invest staff or to systems odhalujících tax podvodníky that rarely threatens path behind bars, and if they are caught, often through bribery avoid difficulties.
At the point of view find that avoidance "direct" taxes on income and profits reflect turmoil in a system of "indirect taxes" imposed on the production and consumption.
More than 60% of indirect taxes, which have the same proportion of the total tax revenues are in India excise taxes.
The basic consumer tax was determined to 16% of the value of output firms.
Furthermore, there is a range of relief relief and increases.
For example, to category as food products, match cotton yarns and computer is imposed "reduced rate tax" of 8%.
Some products, inter alia polyester threads, cars, conditioning products and tires are burdened by an additional "special consumer tax" (sed) of 8%.
In "goods special importance" is imposed "added consumer tax" (aed, beware difference from sed).
Relief from consumer taxes are numerous and complicated and apply the inter alia to firms to the total annual sales to 10 million rupií and to firms based in certain disadvantaged or underdeveloped regions.
Overall, the liberation divided into 70 broad categories, rozčleněných into 259 items 52 conditions and 7 lists, each of which contains the data.
Tax relief to say about abuses.
Lower officials, already enjoy considerable freedom in the application of the conditions for a price may be persuaded to the fact interpreted more positive manner.
Goods zdaněné high rate (for example, polished žula), as the goods sold zdaněné rate low (for example, neleštěná žula).
Avoidance industrial taxes is the nakažlivější than tax avoidance of profits and revenue.
If one company excise haunts and tax rate is in comparison with tax-free profit margins in business high, its competitors must also cheat, simply because to stay.
As the tax evasion spread, governments introduce "additional" and "special" taxes, encouraging other fraud.
The choice of direct taxes are also.
A transmitted výběrčímu taxes for favorable classification, the difference between the value of polished and neleštěné granite and reporting lower than actual sales creates a "black" funds, which cannot be put into tax returns.
Pokoutní plans to circumvent the indirect taxes not only weaken the state's ability to provide basic public goods, but also discourage firms from the introduction of produktivnějších technologies that require procedures involving operation in large.
Whereas the indirect taxes can be easier to escape from the provision of many small organisations instead of a large, cannot be achieved the economies of velkovýroby.
The most remarkable that in the software industry, which are from indirect taxes exempt all units is Indian society efficient size.
India could emulate example of China, where rationalization indirect taxes in 1994 to prepare the ground for a boom?
Or coalition government vitální democracy are not such reforms capable of?
Last year the government led by the party BJP legislation to testify a reduction in the budget deficit.
After a working group, which should have the task of formulate necessary changes in the tax and spending policies.
This year in July, this group, proposed tax increases (not No erasures expenditure), inter alia through the removal of the most relief from indirect taxes.
It seems that India's new government under the leadership of the Congress proposals also inclined.
If Congress and opposition parties dotáhnou thing to end, they make a large piece of work to sustain economic growth and for the spread of the view that democracies cannot do what is needed to encourage development.
What is wrong to Turkey?
On December 16 candidate comes up before Istanbul court one of the most famous Turkish writers orhan pamuk to face charges of "insults national identity," which supposedly committed by voted for open discussion on Turkish Armenian genocide 1.5 million in the years 1915 and 1916.
Pamukovi now threatens to three years in prison.
Turkey's efforts to pokutovat and close to prison those who have kept official line, leads me to believe that I remain true when I opposed this starting accession negotiations that country with the European Union.
In December 1999 granted the European Council Turkey the status of the candidate countries of the EU, of which logically imply that Turkey for a specified date nespecifikovanému joining a union.
The Council subsequently asked the European Commission to in October 2004 decide whether Turkey sufficiently fulfills political criteria membership -- including democracy, the rule of law and respect for rights ethnic minorities.
It was the one of the recent decision Romano Prodi, which I was a member.
Of 30 members of the Commission them 29 konstatovalo that Turkey fulfils the criteria enough, and conduct so may continue.
The only I disagreed with it.
My decision, shaped by the Commission report, which he G??nter Verheugen, then Commissioner for EU enlargement.
This report refers that in 2003, in the EU Member States the asylum application 21 370 Turks and 2 127 applications were accepted.
Governments and the EU itself in other words recognized that the Turkish government in 2003 perzekvovala more than two thousand citizens.
The Commission, meanwhile, the report regularly about Turkey, in which allows that slightly islamisticky oriented Prime Minister Recep Tayyip cabinet erdogana continues in the reforms, even slower pace.
Even this report, but also in the major pochybeních: violations of human rights, including torture continued, the influence of the army was and remains too high, freedom of speech to the general, nemuslimské religious and cultural minorities, potýkaly with discrimination against violence and to women was sufficiently strongly prevented.
From the start of the accession talks this year in October much has changed.
In addition to the current prosecution orhana pamuka is not only with other cases unacceptable behavior.
In March 2005 police violence rozehnala demonstration to celebrate the international on women.
In may have been prohibited activities of the Union Union teachers, as an education 14 million Turkish Kurds in their language.
Intolerance, stretching back to the top of the Turkish government.
Foreign Minister Abdullah gül recently in Copenhagen decisively, press conference, as in the audience espied Kurdish journalists, which then Danes refused to him.
Similar actions and attitudes my opposition from October 2004 sufficiently justify.
Even if, however, these deficiencies remove, Turkey would still should be taken into the EU, because it is not a European country.
Christianity, feudalism, Renaissance Enlightenment, democracy and industrialization Europeans have made of us who we are but made from the Turks what they are they.
Thus, I believe that the reforms that have been introduced in Turkey's insistence on the European Commission would continue even after its entry.
Rather, I suspect that will be uvadat.
Turkey's admission, moreover, inevitably lead to the entry of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and perhaps Georgia Armenia, Azerbaijan and.
The first three of these countries are certainly evropštější than Turkey.
But even if left three kavkazské Republic party, but included successor states of the former Yugoslavia, it would create EU about 35 members.
What it was the EU?
The EU is simply club friends.
It is based on the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital, and citizens.
The Commission as guardian of the Union's contracts, these four basic freedoms to protect, which means that sometimes must member country to convince and, if necessary, to make a change of laws.
Protialkoholová policy in Sweden, the Volkswagen law in Germany and discrimination foreign investment funds in France, they are cases that made the Commission unpopular.
However, are necessary.
At the time I left the Commission, I was on the fifteen hundred similar infringement proceedings.
EU membership in short, it takes the need to take a strong measures that have a profound impact on the internal affairs of the State.
It would be possible if the members of the Union will become so disparate country.
The EU would then become victims of what the historian Paul Kennedy described as "Imperial overlap."
The Union would would unacceptably rozředila.
Therefore, the former French President Val??ry Giscard d 'Estaing worried that its membership will lead to the collapse of the EU, and therefore former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: "Turkey's admission would be more than the EU can stand."
The strongest reason against Turkey's entry, however, is genuinely democratic: most of the population of the EU will simply adversity.
Bolivia's crisis, Latin America's failure
Bolivia is not in any measure of the typical Latin American countries.
With the exception of Haiti is that the poorest state in the Western Hemisphere and what in the stability is doing even worse, because there since independence occurred more than two hundred upheavals.
In the region with a strong indigenous past, but multiple and isolated the presence of Bolivia is, together with guatemalou apparently the only Latin American countries, where indigenous peoples of the majority of the population.
Its topography and ethnic distribution gives rise to autonomistickým, and even odtrženeckým forces that threaten national unity bigger than anywhere else.
And, of course, Bolivia is, together with paraguayí on this subcontinent also the only state, which has the sea.
Should therefore considerably unwise apply the current bolivijskou crisis in the rest of Latin America.
Zevšeobecňovat is only too easy: elsewhere are institutions stronger poverty -- and in particular the extreme poverty -- is reduced and the battle for natural resources has been largely settled.
Even in places like Venezuela, which has a huge oil reserves and traditionally based nationalist government survived the status quo to foreign investment in energy sources almost eight years of governance President Hugo Ch??vez.
The existence of indigenous movement is not reality in many countries -- from chiapasu over "araucaniu" and amazonii after ayacucho -- but not in Latin America does not constitute a real threat to national integrity.
Bolivia's crisis is not particularly worrying example and even hyped "domino theory" that in the case of Bolivia advocated Lyndon Johnson and Che Guevara, there seems as valid or even half sound.
Yet the current Bolivia's crisis points to a "democratic deficit" which suffers from today's Latin America.
In Bolivia, Ecuador and Haiti fell from one or another reason elected leaders.
Cuba in Mexico and Nicaragua democracy is either imperfect or none at all, and in Venezuela, Colombia is again from one or another reason under threat.
None of these cases is not the same with another; all include varying degrees of risk of damage or reconciliation.
The question is what we can do with this state of affairs that contrasts with povzbudivou prospect that here before only a few years ago převažovala.
The Conference Organization of American States (oas) in Fort Lauderdale Florida took delegation of the United States from other a good idea, and he was its support for practically sank.
The story began a few years ago, when they were the foreign minister Argentina Dante caputo and the United Nations Development Program with sepsáním reports of democracy in Latin America.
Concluded that the early warning system before democratic crises in the region would help intervene before the situation vymkne control, as it is now in Bolivia.
Caputo and the UN then convince Chile's President ricarda Lagos to the initiative up and, with several colleagues it began to enforce.
Lagos did so, but initiative is not too far.
The report on the state of democracy in Latin America published in 2004, the about her frankly barely to.
The US and the new Secretary-General oas, Chilean Jose Miguel insulza, this plan revived during the conference oas in Florida, but eventually him sunk rational fears of Latin American leaders, the whole idea is directed against Venezuela, to which joined also anachronický fear Hispanic of violating the sacred principle non-interference.
Although the continent unable to this idea agree, the concept of early warning system deserves attention.
With the current situation in Bolivia has the Western Hemisphere many nenadělá, and it is this situation dangerous for all.
Evo Morales, leader of the opposition and coca growers, may be honest if somewhat disoriented Democratic leader, but really in his stoupencích nedřímají authoritarian desire?
Hugo Ch??vez perhaps by Morales and other Bolivian dissidents, but do not feel Venezuela and Cuba temptation vměšovat in matters of the country where before almost 40 years ago died Che Guevara when a partisan war?
The business community of Santa Cruz may be carried out his threat secession, but there is really the oil and gas reserves in the region divide rather with indigenous mountain peoples than with Brazil průmyslníky of são Paul?
Than events they arrive in these excess, it might not from the matter, if they began to engage oas (rather than the US).
The region will this engagement continue to need -- in time to demand and the proper democratic platform, which will differ from traditional intervention by the US and from traditional indifference Latin America.
The decline of France?
The French are notorious their sensitivity, if not directly upjatostí - the status of France in the world.
The French State invested huge amounts of money in the promotion of the French language and culture, but still, the French painfully aware that the position of their country in the world is not what was once.
No surprise, because its report of the European Commission, in which the level of the French economy in comparison with other European countries fell in ten years of the third on the tenth place, created in the last Presidential election sebezpytování and polemiku. Before long, President Jacques Chirac accused of his rival Lionel Jospin's that made, the decline of France. "
The OECD and Eurostat - European authority, which for these data responsibility - thought that aspect of this debate ended when show that France, Germany, Italy, and Great Britain enjoy the average roughly the same level of the population.
The broader disputes was eliminated.
Care-worn discussion of bankruptcy France "again out in the context of this year protests against pension reform, with's rising disputes about fiscal policy towards the European Commission and with bickering, with the United States on the war in Iraq.
The top-selling book literature fact in France is now the controversy has spilled Nicolas bavereze called la France qui tombe declining (France).
Book is prošpikována citacemi de gaullea and Napoleon.
Recent spectacular successes reached France under the author in the 1970's, when was initiated operation rychlovlaku TGV and plane Airbus.
Baverez also denounces the mitteranda and Chirac for their common, talent win elections and change in France outsidera. "
The success of books is itself a certain problems.
What, however, are species?
Baverezovy arguments bankruptcy are not as strong as the author considers.
For nejkřiklavější evidence of the French fall, for example, as the loss of jobs in industry.
Deindustrializace, however, is routine in all advanced countries.
France in this regard is even more than most of its competitors in rich countries and, unlike Germany, Britain or the US is France in industrial sector retain the share of the global market, what should the early 1970s.
Also under výstižnějšího scale competitiveness, which are foreign investment, France doing very well.
According to a recent reports published the Council for economic analysis rose direct investment in France in 2001 to 60 billion, which is almost twice as more than in Germany.
In the past three decades, also improve the competitiveness of France (by 20%), the higher productivity growth outweigh the rapid growth wages.
At the heart of the long-term economic problems France is not just the fear of job losses in industrial sector.
France remains strong industrial power in the traditional areas, such as automotive and aviation industries, but is lagging behind in markets with innovation, where smaller businesses developing new technologies.
On research and development in the field of high-tech, for example, France spends just $30 billion a year, compared to 51 billion in Germany, 98 billion in Japan and 265 billion in the US.
In short, baverezova analysis shows the wrong direction.
In the last two decades France through a series of vital reforms: the economic and financial liberalization, the price control and exchange rates, the credit restrictions, the European trade liberalization, lowering inflation and trade deficits, the euro and vynucenou globalization domestic firms.
The trouble with any of these reforms to do.
France is the problem is the fact that can take account of the new world, which includes is already itself become.
The French state capitalism is dead, and France, with its dying only hard offset.
It is not the only country whose - Prime Minister Lionel Jospin - felt an excuse to one day after on TV said that State is not an all-powerful. "
For this French schizophrenia there are many reasons, but it is certain that the key reason connected with the political hrátkami in the past 20 years.
Until 1981 led in France obvious dividing line between right and left.
But since then mitterandova and Chirac's administration otupovaly its ideological edge, in order to undergo a formidable process of adapting to Europe and to globalization.
One dose, shock therapy "in the manner of Margaret Thatcher could twenty years ago cause of a new political awareness.
Consensual driblování direction from the reforms, however, the French to live in a world and think in another.
This is what is a key reason for political disaster, which occurred during the last presidential election campaign, when the leader far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen was in the second round presidential election at the expense of the prime minister Lionel Jospin's.
Also the rise of extreme left, in the presidential election to 10% of votes, suggests a political failure.
France needs rather than political economic revolution, where to deal with reality, whose part of a I realize that the decline of France "is the fear that the French cause themselves.
The value of the European values
Europe's leaders renewed talks on the constitution, which last December zkrachovaly because of the controversy over the voting rights.
Similar disputes, of course, are subject to compromises that are likely to be found.
Still, however, is needed a clear understanding of what is really a constitution.
European integration podepírají two basic principles: solidarity and subsidiarity.
Both principles lies at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, the economy, sociology and justice.
Over the years are present in laws and the institutional framework of the European Union - in contracts in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which is cites the preamble) and in a recent of the draft constitution.
In short, are inscribed in history and ideals of the EU.
But what solidarity and subsidiarity really mean?
Věnujme first Solidarity, which is open at least two interpretations: static solidarity is only in the distribution of income and wealth, while the broader concept of dynamic solidarity includes their creation.
In the postwar history of European integration was dynamic solidarity strong in the first period - in an era of the European Coal and Steel Community, and both in the strategy of economic development (recovery), and in the contracts, particularly in the Treaty of Rome.
But this does not mean that was later dynamic solidarity potlačována: its expression, for example, is the European Monetary Union.
So while some countries should from the euro immediate benefits, but the put in place, because they believed that it in the long run, will have a positive effect.
Dynamic solidarity in other words means upřednostnění policy that supports investment, innovation, economic growth and employment.
But as shows GDP growth in the EU, was in the past decade dynamic solidarity podkopána.
Particularly troubling is zaostávání in research and development.
The so-called the Lisbon strategy of the EU, adopted in 2000, with the promise of creating a nejkonkurenceschopnější economies in the world threatens the increasing emphasis on static solidarity, which is reflected in a high cost of social security and high taxes needed to its financing.
The static solidarity is given aging populations, together with slower growth led and leads to structural fiscal imbalances.
One of the tasks for the future of the EU is addressing today's dominance static solidarity aimed at the old people over dynamic solidarity favor young people.
The Union, after all, cannot afford to continue to ensure that the current consumption převažovala over investment needed to ensure future prosperity.
Subsidiarity the concept of solidarity similar to that she has two interpretation: subsidiaritu vertical and horizontal subsidiaritu.
Vertical subsidiarity lies in the distribution of power at different levels of government and sovereignty: the EU, the national states, and regions autonomous commune.
Most of the this principle is federalism.
In European contracts are clear statement vertical of subsidiarity.
All this, however, to obsáhnutí vyvstávajícího institutional and constitutional arrangements Union?
Horizontal subsidiarity lies in responsibility and freedom of the people, as well as in the social and economic power.
Includes relations between the state, companies and market.
Society and the market, however, have their own rights and sovereignty them by the State nepropůjčuje.
So the problem lies in ensuring autonomy each of these areas.
Example horizontal subsidiarity is internal European market, which produced a new kind of economic freedom and increased competition between firms that eliminoval protection, they provide national governments.
Horizontal subsidiarity means that in society or in the economic sphere of State cannot interfere with freedom and responsibility of the individual, which must be respected as far as possible.
It also means that wherever freedom and individual responsibility is not sufficient to achieve the objectives of the necessary for human dignity must support to provide a "nadřazená power."
Such aid should, however, should be implemented in ways that are natural potential of the individual, society and market.
But this is possible only in the case where it is the role of horizontal subsidiarity clearly conceived, which is not the case of the European treaties Charter of Fundamental Rights nor activities of the European Convention.
In short, solidarity mean more redistribution than growth (which is the way in which the generation of today's expressed solidarity with the next generations), while subsidiarity began to mean more redistribution of political power than careful vytyčování borders between state, civil society and market.
Today, both values defined in ways that favor state.
Concentration in the market oriented growth is often associated with half extraneous matter values America.
These values are, however deeply rooted also in Europe and should be withdrawn again to light.
The EU should renew their economic vitality efforts at such a model of solidarity and subsidiarity, which would be balanced in favor of the market and society, and that would decrease social and economic impact of the State.
State institutions should ensure public goods (such as defense, justice, fiscal and monetary policy), the company should ensure social goods (for example, culture, education, and help needed people) and market should provide goods economic (which are associated with profits growth and employment).
In the 21st century Europe needs reconsider the value of the two of these principles - solidarity and subsidiarity - if a historical objectives integration: freedom and prosperity needed to overcome differences and political rozkolů, which in the 20th century triggered tragedy.
Such is the spirit in which must be the European constitution written.
Politics of values
The debate on the US elections not yet neustala.
As President George W. Bush won the three million votes more than Sen. John Kerry's and návdavkem achieve majority representation Republicans in both houses of Congress?
In response is a consensus, but many explanations invoking the same two issues.
One of them is the question of personality.
At the time of uncertainty and the threat of people have more confidence in the president, who know than in the candidate who is neodzkoušeně.
The second issue are value.
People voted for a set of values rather than for some concrete policies.
Some (as the says) has agreed to Kerry's policy, but they gave voice Bush, because it is its general attitudes made sense of peace.
In the way the vote, are now the United States was deeply rozpolceny.
Arc blue (democratic) States to the East, North and the West surrounding the enormous red (Republican) in the middle of the region and to the south.
What's more, these divisions, will create and local level.
The leveraged division of electoral districts so as to benefit a political party is no longer necessary.
People they tend to move to areas in which most people share their values, whatever the Republican or democratic.
What value is exactly?
For those -- as the claims -- are associated with "God, weapons and gay."
Its role in them plays religion, including literalist biblické truth in terms of the story creatures.
Possessing weapons is the ultimate test individualism and use of weapons in wars is damnably.
Homosexuality and other "advanced" practices are denied as free.
As the political scientist recently said Andrew Hacker, "the Bush kandidatura focused on profit majority that provide roughly 60 million people have a chance to feel good."
This is all the phenomenon, or similar trends exist elsewhere?
One answer is that the politics of values as American phenomenon may now be most, but in no case is universal.
Europe and other parts of the world are divided the same level.
Undoubtedly, depends on personality and under the external political differences may conceal also questions values that still nevystoupily to the fore.
Traditional political divisions based on a dispute about the fundamental values, however, to play in elections still smaller role.
For example, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, other important leader, which waiting elections, while plays a moral card and talk about political strategies, but in fact, above all represent hodnotovou set of the middle class.
When talking about "modernization," about "of things in the twenty-first century," he is getting on sugerovat strange, but by a mixture of change and stability.
Conservative opposition remains so without effective response.
Even questions such as tax cuts or stricter rules asylum play quite based on a string, which managed to affect the Republican side in the US.
A similar picture exists in Germany, where's external influence mindset policies even lower.
German debate is still largely debate on political strategies.
When the opposition to the government talks about reform health or the recent fighting unemployment, then the hidden rivalry concerns rather than kompetentnosti values.
Under the current fighting political debate in Britain, Germany, and elsewhere in Europe, however, they are based conflict.
The battle for the those that can be induced to "of had a good sense," he was, however, may be fully aware that it is only part of the question of policy.
Religion is likely to happen an important factor in European policy; public opinion polls show that religious practices are one of the few big differences between the Americans and Europeans.
Also weapons play in the minds of Europeans different place; most Europeans regarded as an important their lack of.
Moreover, it is in Europe unmistakable and a feature of pacifism.
Yet podceňovanou role here, however, also plays a question of political correctness (gay).
Most importantly, however, is the fact that Europeans divides Europe itself, as in any European State arises "ethnic question".
It is a matter of values on the fear.
People want to know where they belong, and then turn against the US and toward Europe, or against Europe and the direction of their country.
Either way, leaving the realm of political strategy, and even policy and enter into the sphere of symbols and myth.
It is in any case, the risk that democratic countries face for the politics of values is a dangerous development.
Again, makes fundamental divisions into companies whose largest democratic success was just eliminating fundamentalism of politics.
Enlightened public debate must be dispute about political strategy contained in the community of values.
Insist, therefore, the main objective of the policy of freedom.
"The period of interest
One vlaštovka spring does and one month normal growth of jobs and rising prices in the United States does not mean that America's central bank continues to worried economic difficulties and deflation.
Come, however, a time when the world's interest rates will rise, because the central bankers are prepared to fight with rising inflation.
Whether this moment occurs when - this fall, in 2005, in 2006, or in 2007 - will, America and the global economy contend with financial vulnerability, reflecting the success of monetary incentives for slowing reduction of production and alleviation unemployment in the last three years.
Short-term interest rates are very low: a mere 2% in the euro area, only 1% in the US and zero in Japan.
Expansionary monetary policy was successful, but only that stlačila interest rates to historic lows -- and that investors convinced that the cost of borrowing remain at current levels for a long time.
The result of monetary stimulus was an increase in asset prices: if interest rates very low and expects when the very low will remain, then everything bears a decree dividend or rentu, becomes atraktivnějším - and thus in the money expression cennějším.
This explains the large differences between current real estate prices in the US, shares in New York, London, and Frankfurt and long-term bonds around the world with what one would normally considered their fundamental value.
So what will happen when central banks begin to increase interest rates?
In 1994 triggered rising Short-term rates also growth rates of long-term - and price declines long-term bonds, which was at least twice as large compared with what at that time forecast standard models.
Interest rates in peripheral economies of the developing world, moreover, grew much faster than rates in the developed industrial core.
The first danger, which we should not fear for 2005, and in the future, when the rise of the world's interest rates are most likely the - is therefore another wave of financial crisis in the so-called emerging markets.
In countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, balance of the 1990s, shows that the rising interest rates can expand and flow of capital are remarkably quickly turn regardless of how favorably perceive economic policies of the country's leaders of the IMF and the analysis of big banks.
Rising interest rates in emerging markets is now abnormally low.
International cash flows - aside from the flow of funds to the US - not yet reached levels, with no talk about "irrational exuberance", but still it may take place before the growth rates.
But this is the prospect of alarming, for if of the 1990s is a lesson, it is the realization that, no one should exaggerate the stability of the international financial flows.
A second danger stems from high asset prices within the first industrial core.
In America's central bank apparently prevails views - which I - that information technology revolution continue the growth rate of potential performance in the US remains very high, and if it is therefore a relatively large.
This implies that interest rates might have to remain low after a long time.
Confidence in the central bank is, moreover, high and last residues premium for inflation risk of the 1970s have already been of interest rates vyždímány.
As a result, remain interest rates in the ratio of the 1980s and 1990s low even after the power of the economy return to its potential.
All this, of course, is the good news for those who own assets as long-term bonds, stocks or real estate.
The increase in long-term asset price was in fact, the real reason for reducing interest rates: enrichment holders of bonds and, above all, property owners, after all, stimulates their expenditure.
The bad news, however, is that, even though assume that interest rates remain even some time low, have remained thus low indefinitely.
The bottom line is that with the rise of interest rates will fall asset prices.
It is in such periods, particularly asset prices fall quickly and significantly - we learn how well our central bankers meets its main task: reducing financial rozkolísanosti and promoting economic stability.
In such periods also find how many owners long-term bonds, real estate or shares is held not because they their current prices for attractive in proportion to the prices of basic, but simply because their price in the past few years increased.
This is for economic stratégy the key question, because those who are long-term assets bought because their price in that time seemingly perpetually rising, they are sold immediately after the price trend begins to turn.
In particular, the US trade deficit is in the future potential source of huge instability, if there is a significant decline long-term asset price.
Problems with which will key strategists the world economy during the next few years face, will certainly different from problems, which faced in the aftermath of a bubble Nasdaq.
The risks associated with inflation are less likely to dangerous than those resulting from the collapse of the performance and threats of deflation.
What we learned, however, in the 1990s, all of this does not mean that the coming calls will manage easier.
Contradictory America's Future
Recently I learned something interesting: American economists of international finance and American economists inclined to domestic economy have very different -- indeed, contradictory -- views on the likely impact of America's huge current-account deficit.
Economists of international finance for more likely to be the financial crisis, after which will follow painful, and perhaps more permanent recession in the United States.
Macroeconomists focus on domestic economy on the contrary, nepohlížejí about the fall of the dollar as to the crisis, but as an opportunity to faster growth.
Macroeconomists inclined to domestic economy sees the situation roughly as follows: at some point in the future foreign central banks begin to be less prepared to continue to buy a vast amounts of dollar-denominated securities and strengthen as America's currency.
To end its massive programs buying $, the dollar will fall -- and will fall sharply.
According to this view, however, until the value of the dollar will reduce to foreigners become more attractive American export goods and in the US will rise employment, the labor force will be diverted into newly oživeného export sector.
It will be a similar what happened in Britain after leaving peg the exchange rate, leaving the pound devalued in relation to the Deutsche Mark, or that what happened in the US in the late 1980's, when the dollar depreciated against the pound, the Deutsche Mark and, above all, the Japanese yen.
Economists of international finance future sees much pochmurněji.
Are convinced that the end of the large programs central banks to purchase $will not only to a dollar decline, but also to a sharp increase in US long-term interest rates, which immediately overrides consumption expenditure and with little delay přiškrtí valve investment spending.
Of course, economists of international finance also understand that reducing the value of the dollar will benefit exports of the US, but lag demand are such that export growth will come to a year or two after the fall in consumer and investment spending.
Eight to ten million people will have to change jobs and to move of services and construction in the export of goods and goods competing imports, which means that increase structural unemployment.
Moreover, may occur financial panic: large financial institutions with short-run liabilities and long-term assets for most difficult time to will have to deal with large increase in the dollar long-term interest rates.
This inappropriate connections may cause financial tension and bankroty as easily as during the Mexican and East Asian crisis in the 1990s and during Argentina's crisis in the current decade caused assets banks in local currency and liabilities in dollars.
When economists of international finance načrtnou this scenario, macroeconomists focus on domestic economy react that it is as an incompetent monetary policy.
Why should the Federal Reserve afford to long-term interest rates soaring, because other Central Bank ended their programs buying $?
Should the Fed act and replace it is their own purchases of long-term government bonds, the US, thereby long-term interest rates remained at the level of allowing full employment?
The economists of international finance correspond to that is in the power of the Fed will make it.
If the Fed forced to choose between full employment and price stability, economists of international finance say that decided to price stability, because its institutional memory of the 1970's, when inflation escaped control, it is still very live.
Therefore, whereas the decline in the value of the dollar increases import prices and works, as negative shock for the supply side of the economy, the Fed will have to increase interest rates, not reduce, and sell bonds, not buy.
On opposite pólech this debate is found a special views serious economists, of which the extremely respect.
Not so wise to able to say, who is right, but certainly know who hope is wrong.
Black people inside Europe
In the United States, individual states that follow unsound fiscal policy to pay a price.
Compared to better spravovaným States their bonds are sold discount.
Higher debt service, already must meet, serve -- to some extent -- as a form of kázeňského action against the temptation to spend now and pay the next time.
Of course, the market discipline is not perfect: the bond market too well "see" default future liabilities (should be committed as of pensions).
However, these forced fiscal discipline, together with internal budgetary procedures of individual nations, from the US has since the Great Depression of large fiscal crisis at the level of state.
Now look at Europe.
Before the advent of the euro in each of the national states in southern Europe incidence many fiscal crises that incited waves of high inflation.
After the introduction of the single currency, however, the possibility of solve fiscal crisis through inflation closed, because of monetary policy now holds patrol the European Central Bank (ECB).
But, while already national states cannot for solutions to their nevyvážených finance rely on inflation, the single currency allows them to the extension of spending dýchánků and to odsouvání political responsibility for the period of forest bons temps roulés use debt capacity, which properly to other members of the European Union.
To prevent this option, the EU created the Stability and Growth Pact: government deficits should be less than 3% of GDP.
Last week government in Germany -- once fiskálně nejrozvážnější and most disciplined EU countries -- violate the pact rules on fiscal discipline has five years, behind, and did so without (many) excuse.
Finance Minister peer steinbrück suggested that expected that the European Commission apply to Germany some sanctions: if made no action, said the credibility of the Pact is at stake.
Germany, therefore, this time is sanctions to block, as did before two and a half years.
Steinbrück but he also clear that the expected to sanctions reacting to the fiscal deficit Germany in the 3, 4% of GDP will mainly symbolic, that it is going on the penalty, for which, the government or the economy has paid a major price.
The Stability and Growth Pact does not work -- at least for now, as suggested.
And what about a market disciplinou?
The German government is the willingness to create more debt and was with more deficits limited, because market comprehends and pokutuje national states, which allowed to their fiscal position fell?
Not a word, no.
Interest rates on sovereign debt in the euro twelve the governments of the euro area are all very similar.
So it seems that markets are not care that individual countries have different potenciály produce exports and cover so financial flows needed to repaying debt or different normal and estimated debt / GDP ratio.
Willem buiter at the University of Amsterdam and Anne sibertová University of London believe that it was a willingness to take the ECB practically all debt of the euro area as secure as undercut the willingness of markets act as vymahač fiscal prudence.
If the maržová part of the German debt used as a guarantee for short-term loans or as the main point of the Treaty of "in order to obtain liquidity its value is more likely determine under the conditions under which it the ECB to guarantee take than under the crucial indicators.
The ECB access to any such debt as an equally solid resources reserve liquidity today wins over each analysis differences in the long sovereign risk.
This is a dangerous.
To create a reasonable chance of a long-term price stability is needed both the market discipline, so contemplative fiscal management.
Vynechte either market penalty for the behavior of, which may prostoupit what makes or institutional lever that they give voice to future generations, and might seriously risk -- though perhaps not today and tomorrow, but only once and for the rest of his life.
As the time, the emergence of the single currency, and the manner in which the Euro was introduced, is increasingly unrest.
Overall, is the politics of the euro area too deflation.
There is no need to transfer, which would have made a common currency tolerable for regions, which prodělávají and are already in recession when the ECB upgrading its policy.
The institutional foundations stable long-term fiscal policies are rozleptávány.
And into the buiter and sibertová compelling argue that the ECB gives market to pay hospodárných and punish extravagant less room than should.
This does not mean a landslide such and even some time.
But if they do not change, the bedrock under euro may have to move.
Milosevic and Hussein: the trial as democratic
Processes with war criminals were once serious undertaking.
Only remember photographs Herman göringa and rudolfa Hesse as gruffly sitting in the dock at Nuremberg.
Some Nazi brass were even after a short, but fair processes oběšeni.
Today, the proceedings against nejničemnějším world leaders turned into a farce.
The court with Saddam and his baasistickými posluhovači brings the sequence of trapností.
Defendants trying one taškařici for the second and Hussein for all possible forms of contempt, except vystrkování bare butt to judge.
It is the result can be expected to be in the eyes of Iraqis and the world seen as legitimate.
The process with Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, after four years after the dull testimony, and nothing more than $200 million to expenditure transformed into a funeral.
In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government has almost ten years dohadují, both before the Court to get the survival of the Khmer Rouge.
Mass murder, who came to power in the twentieth century condemned to be either killed in people's revolt, or tried for their crimes -- if die in power.
Those who can be proud that the Communist leader Romania nikolae ceauşescu and his wife were shot without the slightest appearance of fair process?
Formal dangers actual court seem always better than immediate justice, even if the final result was also death.
Today, there are two ways viable course of action against svrženému tyrant.
His former leader could before the Court pohnat himself nation, as in the 1980s made Argentines with generals responsible for the disappearance of more than five thousand fellow citizens.
On the international level remains for initiating further processes at hand norimberský model, although a dubious conditions, when the powers sometimes introducing responsibility for crimes, for example, "crimes against humanity," that were not at the time of their commit properly defined.
There was a time when we could see the benefits of both national and international trials.
Domestic processes allow local communities to close participation vypořádalo with its hořem.
As the judges and the jury could krajané's show greater feeling for assessing blame, because they were aware of the hard the conditions under which sesazený dictator doing its decisions.
Argentina's process with generals was successful ritual with a painful transition from military junta to democracy, experience, however, ended plačtivým lack of confidence.
Even after conviction were generals so powerful that a the processes and then mercy from nastoupivšího President.
Argentina's policy is to the consequences of processes of the 20 years ago still zapletena.
On the international level was the UN Security Council's decision establish international criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also přivítáno with great confidence.
The ICTY actually under the tutelage Antonio casseseho made several major decision.
But then to judge the unlucky that they do their greatest dream -- tries to their yard arcilumpa Slobodan Milosevic.
It is not clear how in local process with Milosevic loaded Serbs.
Many would depend on how to political party, the tribunal dominate.
On the international level, there is the fear of přemíry policies, but from přemíry rights.
Milosevic's trial had to be more than just, had to be emblémem Justice of the UN.
Therefore Milosevic was allowed to defend itself -- was given to the effectiveness of the court and a huge mistake.
Not limited was neither a number of witnesses, which prosecutor předvolával the testimony of one and the same terrible history of the Serbian aggression and brutality.
It would take many months than it is established what went wrong and why process lasted shocking four years.
My idea is that the officials with good intentions too impact on the South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission model, vychvalovaný legal fakultách desirable as an alternative to retaliation justice.
In the South African negotiations been the most important question of the future of the prisoner, but past victims.
All the victims are kept to summing its history and the accused listened.
In the case of the slaughters vytrpěných in the twentieth century, such narrative stories might take decades.
Encourage victims to talk, and then to the accused the right to obstruct negotiations plug their merit in a position of political leader is a recipe for endless delay.
One lesson that we of the processes with Milosevic and Hussein took is that it is not well build men and women before the Court therefore to settle with their charismatickou přitažlivostí.
Defendants process překroutí -- especially if the ability to defend themselves -- and the courtroom used to defending his career.
Tyrants should be tried to when they are clearly defeated.
It is ironic that advantage of the Nuremberg judicial tribunals have just their fill the leaders of the victorious powers.
They were göringovi, hessovi and their pomahačům constant reminder that control have in the hands of allies and that the Nazis were beaten..
A clear to process was always punishment culprit, not shaping the manner in which will be written in history.
The tragedy of Milosevic's and husajnova process is that the details of history still neusadily and before the Court stood history.
The resulting hesitation responsible persons to create procedures -- as international and national -- which nahrávaly fantaziím for waiver of guilt and return.
In the case of Hussein, this imagination may yet zhmotnit.
Economic division of Iraq
Anyone who looks on Iraq, see State divided into a Community Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds.
As the fundamental dělítkem -- which the ongoing insurgency will make the same level as sectarian půtky and opposition to the US-led military occupation -- is, however, the deepening gap between rich and poor Iraqis.
After emancipation Iraq began to most people, especially those of the poor, hoping for charismatic leader who would be uchránil before the bitter reality of everyday life.
These people were raised in fear, and should therefore idea about how they gave to their society apply democracy or how could Group on the protection of human rights and civil society organizations help shape the future.
Iraq so soon faced a new social fragmentation.
On one side stood people who understand how work in democracy, gain power and implement their ambitions.
They have talk about the language of democracy, made the money they influence and to ensure that their rights and privileges defended independent organization.
On the other hand, however, remains a huge population powerless Iraqis including widows and rozvedených or abandoned women who have anyone who would care for them and their children.
For these people democracy and human rights mean nothing.
Are neinformovaní, poor and sick.
Became the victims of educational system, which is more than a decade ago collapse, and are few qualified to in the desolate Iraq's economy found employment.
In Saddam's government has made no effort to increase vital level of the poor.
I visited huge Iraqi slumy and found there family living in a, which are hardly roof are zamořeny ubiquitous insects and the doors them prosakují undiluted means domestic waste.
In the day and night living in the dark.
Although the need for nothing more than food, a decent home and the possibility of jobs for these families to death and horrifies the tears of their hunger children.
When I met women who in these dwellings live covered me questions: we have democracy food and homes?
To avoid democracy that men, his wife?
Can our children citizenship?
Give us the right to divorce, my husband, which leaves us?
My answer to all these questions was "yes".
Yes, democracy will have the right to live in slušném house, the right to learn and work, give your children citizenship and you will build on a par with your men.
However, must work hard and make all possible efforts at the need for their rights.
Women responded: "Saddam us 35 years taught as be unemployed silent and ustrašené.
What can do? "
In such a areas where the lives of Iraqis, most people become prey bitter temptation.
Many of whom live outside of political, or government leaders.
Easy to leave drive to violence, theft and sabotážím.
Poverty and some of them to accept the money for acts of violence, ponoukáni vábničkou false heroism, which in Saddam's long rule could give way.
Poverty also galled by his own trauma of Iraq's violent pasts wars and atrocities, which make people less sensitive to kill.
Although the conditions in today's Iraq attract many young men to violence, I am convinced that they can provide a decent job and housing, to be saved.
In particular employment help young people based new lives by serious work.
Jobs, not create artificially only to zamaskovali army unemployed.
We need to give people the such work, which would allow them to contribute to rebuild the country.
Every individual, wants to by its nature prove useful member of society.
Culture created Saddam, however, Iraqis convinced that the only way to get authority, power and the knowledge, are political connections.
To overcome such sentiment will be needed time and prosperous economy, which means that the new Iraqi government must be limited power to allow the growth of the private sector and nourish general understanding of democracy and human rights.
Religious groups are prepared to contribute to this process.
We can also rehabilitovat technocrats, who served under Saddam that they have an opportunity to serve their country.
And last, but we must provide loans poor families to help them set of obstojný life.
Most importantly, however, government must from all forces try to persuade poor Iraqis on the value of democracy and freedom and on how to advance their desire for a better life important constitution.
In a country where many people regarded misconduct for the weakness of heroism, will not be easy.
We Iraqis but we also taught that power should concentrate in a few hands, and that a justice requires the battle against all forms of corruption.
If the Constitution function as a guarantee of freedom, democracy and security, it must be poor Iraqis to learn to take this struggle for its.
Islámistická identity
Wherever today podíváte, Islam is used (and not abused) as a political force.
Some Muslims him used as a call to action; many people in the West (and elsewhere) him again see as something else '' and require its restrictions and refusal.
I turek as I could directly vcítit to both parties this debate.
The reason why Islam in Western eyes appears as a religion, other "is the fact that the West is now a systematic deinstitucionalizace religion.
From the West of modern life, of course, nevymizelo itself religion, but rather claims that may religious institutions put on the life of the individual.
Religion in the modern world is much more than any other time personal and spiritual prožitkem.
The process of deinstitucionalizace religious experience, but also takes place in the context of Islam.
Politicization of Islam is weakening the authority of Islamic religious classes, the so-called ulema.
As in the case of the West, and Islamic religious experience becomes osobnějším.
One of the results of the interpretation of religious texts individual Muslims including political radicals, intellectuals and women.
The second is then vulgarizace religious knowledge, the abuse of learning the Koran and during lifting certain the part of the context in order to support the political objectives.
Who now determine what is Islam as a legitimate, and what unlawful?
Who has the authority to religious texts?
Those who can issue, fatvu "or declare,, Jihad"?
Activism and terrorism now provide - or rather vnucují - new source of legitimacy.
What Islam means and does not mean, so they decide laikové without religious authority schools and specialized training.
Islam is now interpreted as a political agents and cultural hnutími, not religious institutions.
This deinstitucionalizace allowed to Islam ceased to be only the local and national social binder and began to participate in the formation of imaginary ties between all Muslims who everywhere feel oppressed or expelled.
Islámismus now can unite followers between which previously existed deep divisions: spirituální sufie and vysvěcené advocates of šaríi, Shia, Sunnis, a Conservative Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran.
At the same time, it is the Islam in movement, because his religious leave the rural areas and bound to cities, including cities in the West.
Many people think this movement for something negative and stress the fact that these Muslims are socially vykořeněni, leading to the estrangement and in some cases, to terrorism.
The social mobility, however, is also provided the creation of a modern worldview.
Muslims through migration, of course, are experiencing a sense of separation, if not directly secession from its social of origin.
Their religious experience so picks up new character, freed from theological, social or state institutions.
It has become a form of social imagination within which the Muslims again building a sense of belonging to Islam in a new and foreign environment.
A return to religious identity is not podněcován odloučeností from the modern life, but its presence.
Most radicalism appears within the groups that through experience with mobility and movement into a new environment zakusily secular political thinking and urban life of the West.
In the new environment neorientují, and their anchor are becoming Islam.
If, however, this at work, must be Islam in the face of modernity exempt from its traditionally ponížených, passive and poslušných positions.
Nošením masks or plnovousu, pushing the right to their pews in employment or in schools and requiring special meals, Muslims outwardly identified as Muslims.
To each round, that they are in their religious obyčejích zanícenější and anxious than those who his religiozitu limited to the private life.
Non-Muslims, for example, they see in wearing Veils of speech humiliation and podřazenosti Muslim women.
For Muslims, however, from the former stigmatu became a positive confirmation of Islamic identity.
This transformation perfectly illustrate the young muslimky.
Girls, which in the French and German schools wear a have in many ways (particularly in culture youth, the perception of fashion or language) closer to its spolužačkám than to their domáckým nevzdělaným mothers.
Nošením scarf in the public sphere these girls unconsciously amended symbol and role of Muslim women.
This tendency but runs deeper than only to šátkům.
All Western Muslims today feel double nationality, double cultural capital.
Define themselves through its religiozity, but also to embrace universal, secular knowledge.
And because they have double cultural capital, may be relatively free to move between different activities and environments - home, school, mládežnickými associations or urban centers for leisure.
Be Muslim and be islámistou is not the same.
Now we see a shift away from Muslim identity to identity islámistické.
Religious I for each Muslims přesunuje of private sphere into the public sphere.
For all the question is whether this can be search for identity satisfy scarves and adopting islámistických religious practice wide public, or whether positive confirmation of Islam requires fundamentálnější surrender of modernity.
New Era of Islamic science?
When natural science and mathematics enjoyed několikasetletému period great inventions čněla one area of the world above all others.
These masters appreciated disciplines here were uctíváni, medicine recording rapid development and the average citizen is about how nature works.
It is no surprise that this area clearing around the world respect.
In the second half of yet poznané planet were not scientists punished, even killed.
Math was built outside the law as Godless and cizorodá discipline and later serve religious purposes.
The level of was low.
The prosperous regions was Islamic Middle East, while ignorantská Europe remained poor.
Both regions were religiously controlled (historians in this context divided in view of the role of religion and nature) but science flourished only in one of them.
Today, the role of Islamic Middle East and West turned.
After WWII, undisputed tip the field of science became the United States.
During this period left the smartest students of their countries, because it attracted better university research and opportunities.
Until recently accounted for more than half graduate students mathematics, science and engineering in the US people birth abroad.
Many of these talent after the completion of the study in the United States remain, of which těžil industry and public administration.
Islamic culture, meanwhile, joined the historical phase in which it was positioned to equate science and Western influence and society is therefore science avoided.
Even in countries where oil revenues to promote a huge amount of research Arab rulers similar investment nestimulovali, resulting their societies neprosperují as might.
The desire for greater political recognition recently encourages Islamic States to invest in technology, which is nejviditelněji reflected in Pakistan and Iran's nuclear ambitions.
Nuclear weapons while bear a political clout, but their scientific basis is uninspiring and old.
Important is the recognition of stemming from culture pronikavých ideas rather than from products earlier discovery.
Imagine what impact would receive Pakistan's Institute, which would be placed in the global research cancer.
And the would political rhetoric of a shift if ománští researchers have the key to the suppression of AIDS?
This is one used the opportunity.
But there is also another, and not only for Islamic societies.
The US, recently committed deep přehmatů.
At the level of the government, from the President of the, replace science "questions of faith."
Political činovníci amended report to the top scientists, if the facts get into conflict with official faith.
Also school, encouraged by religiously affected administration, shift the center of gravity of their activities from science to "values."
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 are entry visa issued less and more difficult to the search, which reduces the tide of young talent to American universities.
Relevant scientific organization unsuccessfully protest against it.
At the same time were tax legislation adapted to investors consumer goods have become rich in the short run, which is discouraged from long-term investments in research.
On the war in Iraq was to half a trillion, which is the amount which is roughly equal to support the basic research in the last thousands of years.
Even if the US to avoid the fundamentalist shade, we risk loss of global domination in research.
Japan to understand the link between the political influence and science in the 1980 's.
The main Japanese průmyslník and chairman Sony's Morita then, together with the political right politician šintarem išiharou gave a series of speeches, which in 1986 book entitled The publishing in Japan, which may say no.
Nastínili basic features of national strategy that understood that global influence stems from leadership in the field of science.
A key insight, was that military power may zastarat if "food chain" military technology control the other States.
The book is reference to Japan's plan say "no" America's military clout, as Japan will gain control of the key military technology.
Knowledge-based economy may be clearly build also using oil wealth.
For example, Texas once was like most Southern states of the US economically poor and declining.
Although he had only oil revenues, the flow of $into the economy by itself increase prosperity as much as they may seem.
So the Texas decided to invest money from oil production in educational Foundation.
Today, the foundation of roughly equal to the foundation of Harvard University, and includes 15 universities.
The result is amazing: production aircraft nearly disappeared from California, but in Texas experiencing boom.
Also research centers telecommunications companies and consortia moved into Texas, which is the case, even the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel.
Although industrial production in the US is in crisis, Texas has one of the strongest economies in the world.
There is no reason why they are the result could achieve in the Middle East.
First, however, must Islamic world znovuobjevit their proud heritage and subscribe to it.
Iran's debate over Iraq
None of the countries of the Middle East picked up the postwar what happens in Iraq bedlivěji than Iran.
Geographical proximity, sharply perceived history bloody confrontation with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, religious and emotional ties to the Shia Iraq and fears of the United States and its political approaches to the region is the ties that Iran to the West neighbor make.
Given the přetrvávajícímu tensions in relations with America worries about Iran primarily the likelihood of the presence of the US for humny country, and America's dominant role in shaping the future postsaddámovském in Iraq.
To foreigners may be difficult to monitor vnitroíránské debate. But this exist and are alive, although from the perspective of greater international public is not always seen.
In developing the discussion about postsaddámovském Iraq recognizable three general approaches.
Iran's pragmatists argue that Iran cooperation with the US in postsaddámovském Iraq is inevitable, even if only to ensure the rights of Iraqi Shiite population.
For this reason should Iran to ensure that the new leadership Iraq would against him hostile, and will seek reciprocal friendly relations.
Further major considerations pragmatiků include the preservation of territorial integrity of Iraq and repatriation tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.
The moderates of this type of thinks that Iran's government to press for America because of the members of the organization modžáhedíne chalk established in Iraq and due to its total elimination of.
Iran's government should return to offer support bringing peace, stability and security in Iraq.
In short, pragmatikové would an Iran - America's negotiations scaled back in order to focus on the agenda, which is largely reflects Iran's domestic concerns.
In summary, conservative forces in Iran this approach support.
The vision of further approach is more active role and active cooperation Iran in reconstructing Iraq.
Advocates of this position argue that Iran's well functioning network of personal and institutional ties to Iraq in advantageous position from which may facilitate the reconstruction.
They say, the US and the international community, the value of Iran's cooperation eventually appreciated.
Gratitude for Iranian cooperation should give the removal of infrastructure modžáhedíne chalk in Iraq, perhaps in connection with Iran's commitment to act against activities of an al-Qaeda and out of its members from Iran.
Most importantly, to Iran from the US demanded assurances that his cooperation will be opětována American guarantees to Iran in the future will happen to the American military action.
Advocates of cooperation in short, calling for an open and clear agreement: reject Iranian assistance with maintaining stability during the current transition period in Iraq and obligation to maintain relations in a spirit of cooperation with any permanent government, which in Iraq is to improve the regional and international positions Iran.
This view is widespread between Iranian reformers - both government within and outside - and between internacionálněji naladěnou technocratic and business class.
Finally, in the Iranian radicals is the possibility of relations based on cooperation with the US sheer fantasy.
Are convinced that America is only was trying to undermine the safety of Iran and betray their national interests.
In the view of the radicals will the US at least to dictate fundamental change in Iran's foreign policy.
When it comes to the worst, says the radicals, America will be actively promote change the Iranian regime.
Will actively to act against that Iran has learned to use nuclear fuel and a atomic energy, and may even try to weaken Iran's military capabilities at all.
These radicals perceive the American invasion of Iraq as a reflection of the desire to the US obklíčit Iran.
In response to this are convinced that Iran must hard defend their interests, create a strategic alliance with Russia and other regional powers and use of Iran's influence in Iraq to prevent the emergence of in Baghdad's pro-American, protiíránské government.
This approach support hardliners of all factions.
The overthrow of Saddam's regime was easy part of the Iraq crisis.
Now it is difficult to part: the introduction of peace and security, victory in the war against terrorism and beliefs free of Muslim people that America to occupy Iraq, SIPHON its oil and shape the Middle East to own image.
Meanwhile, the very probably will escalate the resistance against the US expressed pumovými suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism.
Iran is předurčen to fulfils the role of a regional players because his political dynamic and Muslim identity widely resonance Muslim world.
What happens in Iraq will have profound effects on Iran and the United States cannot be than to recommend to find their way to understand this fact.
American threats or talk of other war přilévají in Iran's oil into the fire resentment and frustration and supply the power of radical forces.
If it is in the interest of the US, the consequences of such avoid must consider how restrict the influence of their own radicals and realize that American interests in Iraq will benefit most greater degree of cooperation with Iran.
Way out of Iraq
In Iraq was finally achieved phase in which all seemingly want the same thing: the removal of the coalition forces of the country.
Recent publication of internal document British Defense Ministry of recall units this desire only dotvrzuje.
The only question is how it satisfy.
If the coalition forces remain in Iraq, violence will probably eskalovat.
However, if leave, will be violence eskalovat also only faster.
So the real question is how to achieve phase in which will be Iraq police and the army, which will be possible to believe that in the country will maintain law and order.
This is still need to offend notný way.
Notwithstanding the courage to many Iraqis who enter the army or to the police, no one should not surprise that the some do not fully net motives.
In northern Iraq to deal with the old accounts, and in traditionally ethnically diverse regions, such as irbíl, there is a virtual ethnic segregation.
In other areas was forcibly introduces Islamic law Sharia.
So how can Iraq to create a credible uniformované components, which will be to enforce laws effectively, fair and regardless of nationality, ethnic religion and sex?
Traditional answer is carried out recruitment, trained and with the "right" values.
To do this, however, is not enough time.
It is necessary to find other ways.
Given the lack of deep-rooted value system needs Iraq active organization of civil society, which will be called the police and military held accountable.
These organizations may have many guises, but it is important to their activities actually zapojovaly citizens at local level and that they get aid rural, regional and national power structures, whenever reveal the abuse of power.
If there is a check on local level, and support and recognition of the value of this control at the level of national, then, most of uniformovaných ingredients is likely to be appropriately behave -- and otherwise, can be easier to identify and punish.
Perhaps that appears overly optimistic, but in Afghanistan -- the country in many ways to Iraq -- there are groups that on this goal work.
MODEL example of how this can be achieved by a Partnership for Peace and unity (cpau).
In Afghanistan as well as in Iraq is the highest priority of ordinary people restrictions violence.
Cpau in the last three years nationwide and based there peace committees at the county levels, which have in individual villages support satellite peace councils.
Initiative is moving in culture, where violence so deeply entrenched that here children once learning aritmetiku so that factored dead Soviet troops.
Committees is to unite all the ingredients society -- including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, police, soldiers judges and entrepreneurs -- and find ways to deal with conflicts non-violent means.
Although monitoring hitherto nepředstavovalo formal part of the role of such committees (in the future, however, plans to) that the fact that in them represented a army police and judicial Church is brings into contact with the rest of the company, provides feedback and begins to build trust.
Some results are noteworthy.
One of the workshops visited of civility local military commander for two hours, and refrain from a week.
In conclusion was said for his violent pasts and commitment to disarm its dvoutisícihlavé private army.
Today, regularly attends offices Committee.
In Iraq are beginning to projects as humanitarian liaison Center in Kirkuk fulfil monitoring function that offer ethnically varied population opportunity to his troubles and use the assistance in their solutions.
Too often, however, is that even if it is a court decision, in the wake of intimidation is subsequently vymáháno.
Many good work already in strengthening civil society have paid by American and British troops.
Do not get the workshopech for better position of women nor a successful organizing small local elections across the country.
Mobilization of civil society, however, is extremely difficult task, especially when they are as in the case of Iraq needed up fast and in a large scale.
Military force is still necessary, but it is necessary and incentives to disarm, including the prospect of economic opportunities, which are more productive than crime, and blackmail.
Fortunately, the building of civil society not only important, but also cheap.
Humanitarian liaison center is in its Kirkuk in annual cost just 75,000 dollars.
Ten million could be number of these centers zestonásobit -- and still be a lot of money was.
The task is to the such access to improve scope and support to nadoraz brave people who took commitment to lead the power to book.
Otherwise, it is unlikely that the Iraqis receive safety, which many years after the suffering so desperately need.
Democracy in Nile?
Surprising Decision Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's proposed Constitutional change, which would allow direct and competitive presidential elections, could become a giant step to democracy in Egypt, and in the Arab world.
For Westerners, for which is obvious pluralistic democracy may be difficult to understand how the potentially great shift is in the country uvyklé for more than fifty years on military rule.
Under the current system Egyptian citizens may leave the only one for the six years in the day of the presidential referendum and their say yes or no single person referred to the presidential kandidátce.
This explains why someone like Mubarak's regularly over 90% of votes, though in poor electoral participation.
The Syrian and Iraqi samovládcům with the animosities even better, and no doubt because requested that vespodu each vote ticket stated Name and address hlasujícího.
Many observers long claimed that democratization in the Middle East is far get until the in the process fully engage Egypt.
Egypt could for a true path democratization issue, without first change its constitution -- should be cut faraonské powers of the President and establish restrictions of his tenure.
Indeed, President Mubarak is already 24 years.
A statement that wants to rival presidential election is so important the first step.
The regime may believe that can process used in its own advantage, but what is not so easy to control, when people feel their power.
Democratic genie has been let out of the bottle.
In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this region uneasy issued a democracy.
Successfully already proceed on one side of the Middle East Turkey and on the other Morocco.
This time, it seems that the real impetus comes from the vicinity of time and positive results of recent elections in Iraq, Palestine and less extent also in Saudi Arabia.
The unprecedented demonstrations against Syria's occupation of Lebanon after the assassination of former Prime Minister rafíka Al Hariri apparently not neopadají.
Egypt's opposition groups also in the last few weeks a increasingly bolder marches and other forms of civil disobedience.
The catalyst for their anger at the end of January happened arrest and imprisonment churavého opposition leader ajmána núra.
Hard procedure governments revived domestic "Kifaya Movement" (enough) required by the end of Mubarak's regime.
Suddenly became clear that his opodstatněnost loses popular view that Egyptians are passive and fear act.
On the banks Nile against zažité tyranny forms alliance local, regional and international forces.
The current wave of general pressure, it seems, regime shaken.
Before a month Mubarak requirement for a constitutional reform refused to as "unnecessary."
But whatever change his views stems from any sequence of events electoral initiative should be welcomed.
It is a necessary -- if insufficient -- step towards reconstruction stagnant political system in Egypt.
Egyptians are now wary of symbolickými reforms since the model Tunisia, where longtime President zín Al ábidín Ben Ali created a caricature constitutional Appendix, apparently opening doors rival presidential elections, but then made deception out with a few selected "rivals."
In Tunisia earlier presidential plebiscitech Ben Ali regularly picking 99% of the vote; now won 96%.
Let us hope that Mubarak think electoral reform more seriously.
Is needed to his candor expressed his command to immediate release ajmána núra and that took steps to an end to 24 years of exceptional state, which effectively prevents the political campaigns.
Mubarak should also approved limit of two consecutive five-year period functional President.
Equally important are measures budující confidence, inter alia, open and equitable access to the media, which now dominates the state.
I announced its intention to participate in the forthcoming presidential race to the debate on these dramatic reforms.
With pleasure were but back to private life of a citizen, if I this autumn, to ensure free and open elections.
If these steps duly introduced in a the Mubarak legacy.
Together with the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine may be the first Arab the dawn of freedom, has long been delayed.
Historical elections in Egypt?
On September Egyptians issue to the polls to elect a new president, select the will of the ten candidates, between which one or the former President Mubarak husní that this function is already 24 years.
While there is little doubt that the result of elections will be his re-election, many people this process intensively watching.
The elections to prepare the approximately 6000 domestic constituencies observers and this week, to the country sjíždějí hundreds of foreign reporters.
But while the entire process nepostrádá all formal signs of real parliamentary vote, some important elements autenticity here it is lacking.
Despite promises not for all far from the same rules.
Mubarak still hold in the hands of disproportionate advantages: is known name, effective monopoly on the state-controlled electronic media and approximately 85% of the media printed.
Week before voting was some opposition candidates odvysílán in Egypt TV never one election spot.
All members of the presidential election Commission appointed Mubarak and the new electoral rules by the participation of any independent candidates.
In 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the elections must be supervised by and verify is 8,000 Egyptian judges.
It was an important step towards a more just elections since soudcovská Union during the last half-century grab executive power to keep a independence.
The Mubarak regime therefore to use all kinds of tricks to soudcovskou Union neutralizoval.
One of them were enlargement definition of "judge state" so as to include even thousands of loyal civil servants, who are legal education, but zero experience for the court stolcem. It are real judges zahnáni into the impasse, because expressed if protest bojkotem their dohlížitelských obligations, passed on this task, this time police under notoriously Ministry of Internal Affairs.
And so should soudcovská Union in the past tend to abide by -- with foreseeable results.
In the parliamentary elections in 2000 to Mubarak's ruling party in districts, where the elections oversaw real judges, approximately 38% of the vote, but in the parishes overseen by kvazisoudců this percentage some enigma leaped to 86%.
This year promises of overwhelming change.
In the spring in the National Assembly and concluded that if they regime not give a full independence and exclusive control over the voting process, not for the coming presidential (or parliamentary election) race oversee.
The second September then came with end requirements: to allow monitoring vote process groups from among civil society, end interventions in the definition of actual judge for the purpose of the election and agree that was for all of the electoral uren ever present legitimate judge until the přepočítán, verified and registered their contents.
Yet it is likely to look on patovou situation as chairman of the presidential election commission in Egypt TV publicly stated that reject any monitoring of the electoral process citizens.
Another intriguing development of events in on the eve of the election is also a passionate public debate whether to voters in the presidential election vote, or is boycott.
Several opposition parties called on its members to the election nezúčastnili to protest svazujícím electoral rules to strongly favorizují Mubarak.
By contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood party, which is deemed strongest opposition groups in Egypt, pushing on his followers that vhodili into uren electoral leaves and voted in his conscience, but that supported no "despotic, corrupt ruler."
The obvious, even if unspoken rejection of Mubarak, a single ruler in the country for the last 24 years.
Despite repeated government prepares to reservations about 34 groups from among civil society thousands of young egypťanů to monitor elections.
These groups argue that if the does not plan to manipulate elections, then it domestic or foreign monitoring vote process should not constitute a problem.
Reactions regime is a statement that any monitoring is outside intervention in Egypt's sovereignty and that the domestic observers urážejí integrity of judges.
This argument, however, was soon undermined when soudcovská Union announced that observers from among civil society supports.
Whatever is the Mubarak regime fear because of the growing pressures from inside and outside to hold a free and fair elections, or simply is unable to get rid of party cheating as a way of life, the current indications way before Wednesday vote no good.
Egyptians had for the first time ever enjoy exciting sense of resistance against tyranny and vychutnávají their newly acquired area of freedom.
Dollar complex Europe
Currency become the focus of not only transactions, but also diplomatic and political půtek.
When that happens, the trade transactions are complex and surrounds is greater uncertainty.
Politicization of money during the meziválečné depression was economically devastating.
But there is much more recent cases nevraživých monetary wars.
In the 1960's, the centerpiece of political chaos has become the international monetary system.
Each of the parties should other theory and otherwise, clarifies the affairs.
Europeans - particularly the French - complained about the what General Charles de Gaulle called, blatant privilegium "American dollar.
General and its monetary guru Jacques rueff argued that the US dollar abuse status as a major reserve currency architects of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates to using deficits meet their foreign military adventure (this time in Vietnam).
France's calls to currency reform, which would do away with that a role of the dollar, and tried to revive deeply discredited the gold standard.
Europeans began a long debate about the benefits of monetary union, whose achieving them to enable face the dollar's face.
From the US, but the international role of the dollar was traps.
Other countries could change their exchange rates and to maintain the greater export competitiveness.
The US government was helpless against podhodnocenému yen, which utvrzovalo belief that the outside world abusing the dollar to attack on America's manufacturing base.
Nixon's administration has concluded that the only way to help the economy is practice monetary unilateralism - monetary expansion so dramatic to other countries forced to adjust exchange rates.
These long zapomenuté battle suddenly appear to be again to reach.
The world has used the fixed exchange rates, but the dollar remains major reserve currency - regards a mobile brettonwoodský system.
According to the Americans represents a reserve role of the dollar potential threats, while for neameričany regards another example of America's Neo-Imperial the struggle for hegemony.
China in this decade took the role of Japan 60 years, and holds. Its exchange rate to low level, to promote export growth.
It is therefore the target of complaints the US on unfair competition and efforts to impose such a system of the exchange rate, which would Americans odradila from buying Chinese toys appliances and clothing.
Producers in the US, that was BRASSIERES Chinese production constitute a threat to the American way of life.
Europeans (particularly French), by contrast, the large complain about America's deficits and into vogue again came de gaullův argument that the world borne by the American war.
Some Europeans propose that Asian central banks kept larger part of their reserves in the euro -- the one resonance generálova abortive attempt to diminish America sales of $gold.
The end of the 1960s, the "and massive financial turbulence, accompanied by the inflationary growth commodity prices.
To the detriment of came all and America's role in world affairs was shaken.
Similar collapse now has probably different consequences.
Today's system of floating rates is stronger, and the cost of his arrangements are allocated differently.
Most Americans plunge dollar much harm, as foreign sellers are forced to regulate their prices for the American market.
Asia's economies grow forcefully and their central banks gradually increasing claims for the US.
In this policy probably persist, for the alternative would be a drop in the competitiveness of their export sectors veledůležitém on the American market.
This gives us more time to address the trade deficit, which is long-term unsustainable.
Economically dynamic regions of the world - North America and Asia - a combination of a pact, which is watch the continuing pivotal role of the American dollar.
Americans will continue to increase its debt, because it after them Asian want.
The pact would be against the interest of both interested parties.
They are not American unilateralism, because it is a cooperation with Asia.
But Europeans who are excluded from the pact, in the monetary and economic unilateralism view.
The growth of the euro against the dollar is also standing in the European toe an exporting producers.
But Europe cannot do many for their relief.
Indeed, in the new currency conflicts, Europe will be the most losers.
Solutions that was vychvalována in the 1960s - a revival of the gold standard or the creation of a common European currency -, he would not appear to be too useful.
The single currency has proved measures that does not provide important protection.
The old form of European reaction - which would psychologists could call, dolarovým complex "- only increase in urgency.
A call for the European Central Bank to extend its monetary base, as if imitation of the dollar was the answer to all industrial, structural and demographic problems sužující Europe.
But a short reflection we should be recalled that European problems cannot be removed monetary handling.
Protests against the new form of nehorázného monetary privileges of the US should be viewed nezkresleně: the way compensation real European helplessness.
Dollar complex is therefore nevytratí, even will deepen, because International Banknote value of the dollar will fall, without would visible negative effects on those who are printed and used.
The epidemic policy
Americans, as well as citizens of other countries around the world, they used to that, in the selection of certain public actors plays an important role policy.
Málokoho surprised (though it is perhaps some disappointed), if the federal judge office or to the high diplomatic post appointed candidate who through a test of loyalty some principle, which is essential for the or premiérovu side.
But science differ coincide with all - and it is here that the United States are beginning to project as a warning example for the rest of the world.
The appointment of in scientific positions should rely on objective criteria education, skills and success.
Is naturally legitimate question the future minister of health and social services to his views about abortion.
But it is absolutely nemístné when they are testing political loyalty subject to candidates nominovaní in Scientific Advisory Committees.
Similarly, membership in the institutions that make kolegiální assessment (peer review) scientific proposals -- the process of crucial for scientific progress - would undoubtedly should not restricted obstacles to appreciate the professional qualifications.
Scientists in the US on such obstacles Unfortunately encounter increasingly.
The magazine Science on this issue last autumn, several contributions.
One concerned complete exchange members of the Advisory Committee National Center for hygiene, parts Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) without it who with the Director of the center opinions.
Similar cases in the framework of the CDC also affected Advisory Committee for the lead poisoning and its prevention, Advisory Committee for national protection of human resources in research and Advisory Committee for genetic testing.
The current epidemic ideology, during which underwrite Advisory Committees and then will be drawn up with the new members, when the candidates to tests of loyalty to some observers seems some old song.
Officials of the Ministry of Health and social services it called "total normal practice."
In America, but it did not practices is - or at least nebývala.
Nejznepokojivější report in any case, it is that the Bush administration review relationship candidates for its "values".
Most fearsome is how deep the ideological lustrace affects. Affects the field, which on this type of handling were not.
Perhaps nejvýmluvnějším case spreading political disease was when membership research section of the National Institute of health and safety at work, which derives grants in the course of accidents at the workplace.
Advisory Committees perhaps in the past to the occasional dosazování related soul susceptible were.
Finally, they recommend political approaches, which is then politicians want to, or do not want to consider.
But research section?
In October 2002 magazine Science published an editorial David michaelse group and his colleagues.
Some of them were former prominent civil servants who působívali in several of the committees, and brought on this issue valuable preview based on personal experience.
Their contribution was itself a revelations, but what followed have been more attractive.
A flood of letters, in which the scientists let with similar experience.
Kandidátka proposed in Coordinating Committee for research muscle dystrofie national institutes health said that was prověřována employee White House.
First was dotazována on their views on different policies of the Bush administration, all of which are subject to the work of the Committee, and then her were asked the question of whether is advocate of the President's stance on the subject of embryonic stem cells.
Another writer, have a professor of psychiatry psychology, handed evidence that him from the White House telephoned on his nomination to the National Council for illegal drug use.
Calling claimed that is obliged to it, "to determine whether you some views, which could be President difficult."
According to profesorových words followed many issues, while the White House aloud odpočítával score.
One example: "So it is two to three; president is against exchange needles (in the case of intravenous drug users) of the moral reasons, regardless of the consequences."
The conversation zvrtl in even mrazivější scene.
The official shall candidate asked whether voted Bush, and when he learned that no, asked: "Why did not support President?"
This is the principle of dictatorship, rather than democracy.
The purpose of Scientific Advisory Committees is to deliver exported and well coherent Council in the process of policies.
If the advance protěžuje some outcome, profit is a zero - and loss of great.
Decisions that research projects given support, because they have never been a matter of politicians, but kolegiálního assessment.
After all, the law, which issues treatment, a federal law on the advisory committees, specifically requires that committees were exported and to "were unduly influenced by jmenujícím authority."
US Secretary of health and social services Tommy Thompson and staff of the White House should go world example.
It can make very easy: the rule of law.
Murder in Moscow
It is time to break with iluzorní the idea that "dictatorship of law" Vladimir Putin even an inch of lowered lawlessness in postcommunist Russia.
Murder Anny politkovské, one of nejstatečnějších and best novinářek Russia, women, which had the courage to identify the brutal murder perpetrated by Russian troops in Chechnya, is the ultimate proof that President Putin with did nothing more than tuctovou dictatorship with the usual contempt law.
This recognition comes to the world and in particular for Europe in handy time.
German Foreign Ministry prepares policy Russia - German relations, which zapouzdří indifference to Putin's lawlessness, because it is said in the national interest nejsilnějšího Member of the European Union.
Indifference, however, amended in ústupnost, fueling if Putin to their illegal methods have pushed even on the international scene, as evidenced by its current efforts to economic suffocation of Georgia.
Murder politkovské caused přízračný sense déjà vu: in Putin's Russia, as well as in gold times the KGB, are simply losing people.
Murder novinářky is the third politically zabarvenou murder for the last three weeks.
30th September was in irkutsku shot enver ziganšin, the main engineer Russian branch BP.
And September 14, has been committed the assassination of Andrei kozlova, viceguvernéra Russia's central bank, who fought against financial fraud.
The fact that investigation murder politkovské, as in the case of the assassination of kozlova into Russia's attorney general Yuri čajka, does not inspire hope that the involvement of so senior posts in real democracy which.
Engagement highest places of Russia's government is on the contrary, almost guarantee that killers will never vypátráni.
Murder politkovské is an extremely grim sign, taking into account that this woman a strong kritičkou Russia's president.
In their articles for one of the few of the remaining independent of Moscow newspaper novaja gazeta, as well as in their books "Putin's Russia: life in declining democracy" and "Dirty War: Russia's reportérka in Chechnya," wrote politkovská on vanishing freedom, which are the hallmark of Putin's presidential action.
As evidenced by exile former media magnates Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky, and imprisonment of oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Putin's enemies waiting three possible fortunes: exile, prison or grave.
Neobviňuji Putin's government, that the murder politkovské ordered.
As committed investigative journalist, after all, in addition to Putin znepřátelila also many other people, the least and present Chechen Prime Minister ramzana kadyrova, whose accused of policy abduction motivated desire for výkupném.
But even if the members of Vladimir Putin had the zastřelením politkovské the her house in the center of Moscow nothing, his contempt for law in any case, a atmosphere in which the murder committed.
Like the assassination of appointing Archbishop Thomas becketta in canterburské cathedral before many centuries was also the crime committed in clear faith that King cheer.
Whereas what politkovská ztělesňovala -- responsibility democratic press questioning the Kremlin and his policy -- a government to ensure that it is nothing wrong happened.
In Putin's Russia was in the past six years murdered already 12 leading journalists.
None of these crimes not solved, which would certainly happened, if Putin's "dictatorship of law" something more than just PR strategy.
The period from the arrival of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin was a strong, odporujících signals.
On one side of the world sees young and a leader who committed himself to modernize Russia -- especially that to his pořádkové components and judicial practice international standards.
On the other side of the President quietly taken into account, as its former colleagues Russian security services FSB (a former KGB) provide later murdered people any safety and unleashing a series of most notorious espionage affairs against journalists, scientists and environmental activists.
Between these "neošpehy" include journalist gregorij Pasko, weapons expert Igor suťjagin, diplomat Valentin mojsejev, physicist Valentin Danilov and other.
It seems that Putin's Kremlin cabal squandered alleged kultivující influence resulting from the partnership with the West -- for example, in the form of the countries of the G-8 summit in St. Petersburg.
Confrontation with the Western values brought again, just another potěmkinovu village; Russia maintain fa??ade law abiding and democratic institutions, but for these lepenkovými kulisami rule still tíž svévolní's.
The danger in the world it is now underway exports of Putin's lawlessness.
After its "near abroad" Russia's time taking root some form of kriminalizované diplomacy.
Just look at Putin's efforts to manipulate the previous presidential elections in Ukraine and constantly vznášená and again stahovaná criminal charges against the opposition vůdkyni juliji her.
Just look at the odtrženecké regions in moldávii and in Georgia, which there are only through the support of the Kremlin.
And just look how the Kremlin to extort neighbors that threatens their energy supplies.
Each policeman knows that when criminal behavior remain go unnoticed are still smělejší criminals.
It is high time that the world began in Vladimir Putin see it, who is: man who drives Russia back into the shadows.
The world is therefore must now consider the old saying in Roman qui tacet consentere videtur -- silence is consent -- and ask the question of whether the wisdom of Putin's silent approve of building the illegal energy superpower.
Russian gas pipeline to empire
Gerhard Schroeder, who was less a month before the German Chancellor, nodded that will become chairman of the company building a pipeline from Russia over the Baltic Sea in Germany, and to Western Europe.
In many countries, Schr??der was accused of illegal conflicts of interest.
The obvious moral failures are compounded by the fact that it is now in Russia to that to Ukraine's gas supplies, if Ukraine docile price requirements Kremlin State plynařského behemota Gazprom.
The strategic intention of Russia is obvious: odstřihnout Ukraine's gas supplies means also odstřihnout most of the European gas, because some of the European gas pipelines lead across Ukraine.
That new pipeline needed Ukraine, Poland and, of course, the Baltic countries, the promise of the Kremlin more power in an effort to again regionally promote.
President Vladimir Putin and his administration composed of clones former KGB already will have to ohlížet at Western Europe in deciding how much squeeze postcommunist neighbors Russia.
Europe should Putin actually arm this new imperial weapons?
What is worse, could Russia this weapon turn against the EU that is dependent on energy?
The fact that the company, which could Russia to ensure the means to handling EU economy, to lead a former German Chancellor is a testament dangerous indifference happy Europe in the face of Putin's neoimperiálním ambitions.
Russia's media are clearly aware of the growing Europe's dependence on Russian energy.
Indeed, libují in her: to integrujeme and to strengthen our mutual trade with gas write authors of Russian editorialů, Europe will be silent about human rights.
Putin this position expressed skrytěji in their determination to promote what he calls "independent policy."
This meant that Russia is to be "independent" on moral and human rights issues of Western democracies.
Perhaps that are some European leaders actually believe that maintain comfortable prosperity union justifies that the issue of human rights and other issues that the Kremlin popuzují, přinutíme to silence.
Of course, speaking aloud might even just about "trade" matters like expropriation Yukos, but as soon as the Kremlin inexpensive responds to our values, or to criticism of Russia's crimes -- for example, in the blood zbroceném Chechnya -- Europeans seem willing to sklapnout rather than to confront the possibility of higher energy prices, or even blockade like that facing today a Ukraine.
Whereas as Putin mixed by his party that their will underwent Duma, the EU should forget about its hopes for a "poevropštění" Russia.
Russia that Putin is building, zmutovalo from postsovětských hope to freedom in the oil and plynařský protective bulwark for its new vzornou elite former members of the KGB.
Indeed, Matthias warnig, managing director of the consortium budujícího pipeline that leads Schroeder is Putin's longtime friend.
Note the Wall Street Journal this year brought report that warnig, who is leading Russian branch Dresdner Bank, he was officer East Germany's secret police Stasi and that of the late 1980s met with Putin when he was the Russian President in East Germany operates as a KGB spy.
The fact that Russians condone the government of the former members of the KGB, for which the nemilosrdnost and intolerance vis-??-vis opposition standard, reflects their fatigue turmoil of the past 20 years.
Now it seems that, the Kremlin thinks that what is good for ordinary Russians, it is also good for the independent states: once Russia has the tools to intimidation, containment and threatened the prospect of energy blockade will with small and weak countries managed without compassion.
As a former head of state newly independent Lithuania, I was repeatedly forced to such a threat to.
The EU with Russia signed the many agreements, including the Treaty of "common space" for freedom and justice.
The Kremlin very well can such idealism pretending.
Its dominance of Eastern Europe is not always vynucoval on the basis of "Conventions of friendship," and the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 were "fraternal" misemi.
And look as Putin this "common" space abuses: with the Chechens is treated barbarsky, entrepreneur Mikhail Khodorkovsky is jailed, foreign NGO pursued and one of vůdkyň last year's Orange Revolution juliji Tymoshenko, indicted Russian military prosecutors from phony crimes.
Think if Europeans common space for human rights and freedom seriously, must recognize that vypočítaví Kremlin dosazenci these values nesdílejí.
The same is true for consultation on Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.
May be truly represent that domovina "red terror" with bezpočtem nepotrestaných crimes of the Soviet era potřísněná blood from Lithuania to the Caucasus, provide reliable assistance in an effort to prevent Iran and North Korea in endangering the world?
As likely it appears that the minds of the Kremlin only each crisis use as an opportunity to strengthen their malignant power and influence.
The area of Europe, from which come, was decades issued at the mercy of every evil.
Can therefore just sit quietly and watch as Europe blindly stumbling for a new appeasement.
We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, we from his legacy taught that for every diplomatic act of Russia's conceals imperial ambitions.
West Europeans, who were this reference spared should our warnings attention.
Dependence on Russia -- though its today's face is supposedly "charismatic" Gerhard Schr??der -- will only into the abyss.
Iraq's bullets and elections
When in 2003, the war in Iraq, should the Bush administration very ambitious plans, as in the case of Germany and Japan after 1945 is supposed to be long and peaceful occupation, during which ensure prosperity rising oil production and it will be in a series of budovány democratic structures.
The should be liberal, directly and post-modern Constitution containing guarantee 25% of the seats in parliament for women.
In today's Iraq is peace and prosperity.
The constitution, which will vote 15 October, while zakotvuje it pětadvacetiprocentní rule, but otherwise is far from liberal.
The key provisions (Article 2), under which no law should not contradict "the undisputed rules of Islam," violates basic principle Parliamentary sovereignty and to defend the legislation to comply with international standards.
For example, the sexual majority for girls cannot be determined to more than nine years, because he was Mohammed nine-year-old wife.
This implies that nine-year girls are zletilé even in terms of criminal law, and can be against them to the death penalty -- say, for that přestoupí to other religions.
In a wider scale can then Shia this provision used to nadřadili their ayatollahs over elected Parliament, as it is in Iran, only because they are entitled to establish the "rules of" Islam.
People from outside, and few Iraqi liberals fret mainly for the sake of the Islamic provisions, but widespread the Sunni resistance to the Constitution is directed against other articles: against the exclusion of "saddámistické Ba 'ath Party" from the political life, and government and against federalistickým provisions which admit autonomy eighteen Iraqi provinciím and allow them to integrate into regional governments.
The rule of exclusion is for elite Sunnis -- including thousands of entrepreneurs, experts, and even artists -- personal matters because only a few exceptions, all members of the Ba 'ath Party.
In theory this can be constitutional prohibition interpreted, so that the apply only in the future.
In practice, now administrative rules applied so as to prevent the so-called "befall senior" Baathists from any form of government employment, which affects thousands of people.
Federalistická provision would likely to accept the Sunnis should apply only to the Kurds.
They know that the alternative is not a return to centralismu, but secession three provinces with kurdskou majority -- dahúk, irbíl and sulajmaníja -- and the creation of an independent Kurdistan, with its own financial management, military (peš merga) and the production of oil in the vicinity of Kirkuk, where are the second largest reserves in Iraq.
For the Shia, Sunnis, the same federal arrangement reject, because it is deemed Arab brothers in the past always accept Sunni government and do so again -- if they have their own government.
That would enable the new constitution, since the province with the Shiite majority in the south -- which is larger part of the Iraqi oil deposits -- could create their own regional government.
The disappointed Sunni leaders who are unhappy with the Constitution, now in the Middle East threatened style of violence.
Federalism, however, is one reason why hlasatelé Sunni superiority and Islamists be murderous attacks.
Their opposition is fundamentally: accept the principle of democratic governments of the majority.
Instead, trying to restore government Sunni minority.
According to the Islamists all Shia as apostates as deserve death.
Also one Shiite leader muktada al-Sadr, the team opposed to federalism.
His supporters are mostly negramotní, the poorest and violent Shia from bagdádských and other slumů whose "mahdíovské militia" sváděly in 2004 struggle with US forces, though Americans guarded Shi 'a Sunni bombers.
As a very young priest who his authority derives from late father -- Ayatollah and also populists -- is al-Sadr in opposition to the Iraqi living ajatolláhům, which is abhorrent his ignorance and reported violence.
Al-Sadr with them could well compete in the issue of religious authorities, and so to them - an Arab nationalist position, and often suggests that the Shiite clerical, Ayatollah sistání is Arab, but peršan.
In a similar vein his followers suggests that hakímové who is leading the highest Council for Islamic revolution in Iraq (sciri), and their "badrovské" militia were paid exulanty in Iran -- and many of them fought in the long and bitter Iran-Iraq war on the side of Iran -- until the Americans "nepřivedli back."
Al-Sadr oppose federalism because Shi 'ite regional government would listened to its enemies, Sistani and sciri, and by his words, fell into the Iranian influence.
To their opinion stressed sent al-Sadr its men to attack against badrovským militias -- in Baghdad, where many mahdíovců, succeeds, but were nadžáfu where nenáviděn because of the cap, which there in the last year napáchal than his men zmasakrovali Americans.
Access sadrovi as Bandit was bad enough; free political aritmetika now shows that he is likely to happen key figure to decide on the outcome of the vote on the Constitution.
To institute rejected and to the new elections to the constitutional convention first need its opponents of the two-thirds majority in at least three provinces.
The Sunnis appears to win only in two provinces, but by if al-Sadr his followers in bagdádských slums that, together with local Sunni "no" votes, probably it fluctuates dish instruments to the party's opponents of the Constitution and ensure that its refusal.
As a political Bandit al-Sadr, of course, is to be willing to buy.
Last year to it was vypsána remuneration for murder.
Now wishes to recognition as státník, money, and at least indirect humiliation Sistani and sciri.
It could get a supply and it is possible that the negotiation already began.
Some Shia, to which al-Sadr attack words and bullets, however, have thousands of ozbrojenců and consider that the only bid for it should be again bullets.
The fall of the secret cop
As he found the Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc GYURCS??NY when recording with its recognition that the government lying, street caused riots openness governance in the new democracies of Eastern Europe nezavádí easily.
Also postcommunist Romania is like Hungary struggling to increase transparency and honesty in a society that once belonged to nejuzavřenějším in the world.
Continuing tajnůstkářství, despite our fight to explosion of corruption and abuse of official powers.
At the same time, however, finally happened even to the actual shift toward openness -- this progress recognize and the European Union, when gave Romania green into the early in 2007.
In addition to achieve what the EU now considered "functioning market economy" arise and key political and legal changes on which I as Secretary of Justice should be able to monitor: from greater transparency and better control of the financing of political parties to the revolutionary changes in the judiciary.
Reform of the judiciary again to eradicate corruption.
Charges has already been raised against former and current ministers government & boptx; judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police and customs officers and other public officials, as well as managers, private firms.
In addition, the introduction of new forms a standardized for a property relationships and financial interests of all those who hold official function in government, Parliament, public and local administration and in the judiciary.
New Economic returns are detailed in Europe and -- it is even more important -- were also released.
The progress of Romania confirms and report published in early October, according to which is now access citizens Eastern European countries to governmental information at the same level as in established democracies.
The report transparency and silence that developed initiative for Justice Foundation open society (it can be found at Web. Justiceinitiative game), even suggests that, in some ways may old democracy from the new teaching: some government authorities in Romania are applications of citizens of information more empathic than comparable authorities in France and Spain.
Specifically, was in Romania positively terminated 60% submitted applications, while in France that was 31% and in Spain 24%.
Other countries that have good outcome include Peru, and Mexico, which adopted its laws on the freedom of information consistently in 2002, shortly after Romania.
To gain access to sensitive information in emerging markets, however, is not always easy, as I was persuaded during his former action in the role of obhájkyně of human rights to the Romanian helsinský Committee.
Often we turn to the court that, on the basis of the law on freedom of the information from 2001 to publication of certain information.
Although we, for example, won the controversy regarding access to records eavesdropping approved by the Procurator, prosecutor court order simply ignored.
So we gave him to civil suit and judge him to a fine for each day containment information.
Yet the information -- including the information about the number of eavesdropping approved during the previous 10 years, against whom and for how long -- published only after the case of our get the attention of the media.
Their publishing the Romania began oprošťovat from the past, which has dominated Securitate.
Today, I am in government and I realize that the share information with the public is sometimes difficult.
When they are necessary, however, painful reforms is no alternative.
Economic and political reforms that US today justify the EU membership, we would not have had to political decisions public scrutiny and nesmířili with more public participation in the decision-making process, which such openness inevitably followed.
Today, from openness became an integral part of the democratic government everywhere.
When in 1966 have their own laws on the freedom of information, the United States, the added to the exclusive companies formed by only a Sweden and Finland.
Today is such a law about 65 countries.
Those who for law on the freedom of information fought in Romania, it now fully use.
The authors of studies initiative for justice who in the demand for Romanian government information were willing to even such data, whose publication would before a few years ago was impossible.
The Defense Ministry, for example, made the number of members of the armed forces who died in 2003, including the causes of their deaths (inter alia, was about 13 suicide, shooting two and two deaths in fighting in Afghanistan).
Bucharest's Court he was asked to data on the number of Judges pokáraných from the beginning of the year 2000, including the reasons for these forms of punitive measures.
The court to the top of judicial the Council, which said in full panoply: čtyřstránkovým list of all potrestaných judges, including detailed reasons and the amount of punishment.
Such information are the result, as well as the engine of continuing reforms.
For people in government that is always a pleasant and because of sensitive documents always arise tug-of-war.
In the former communist bloc are, however, the benefits of transparency undeniable.
At the same time, Romania's experience shows that official secrecy remains a threat to the basic values of democratic governance and that only constant vigilance in established and young democracies can prevent the spread of.
Saving trees life
None of us neprožije one day, without use originating in the forest.
The paper to write, water, we see from the tap, drug that we get well, wood, from which we houses, and furniture, all of this has its origins in the forest, and far higher rate than most people realize.
Forests are as fresh air, which breathing, so home for endangered species.
Give us recreational opportunities, which are in our complex world increasingly important.
About 1.5 billion of poor people living in the country worldwide depends on the forest about their basic needs, as food and fuel wood.
Deforestation yet continue.
Year after year, we lose 14, 6 million acres forests -- the size of four times greater than Switzerland.
Its deleterious impact spájí irresponsible forest management, stupňované bad government regulation, and feeble law enforcement, and markets, which reward the illegal mining wood and simultaneously ejaculated planýrují valuable and nejohroženější forests of the world.
When they disappear forests, usually follows a number of environmental, social and economic problems that US somehow afflict all.
A good example is Indonesian island Sumatra.
Undertakings producing pulp and paper encourage bezuzdné and illegal forest destruction, where lies the richest diversity plants in the world.
It is likely that so vyhynou still neobjevené plants and endangered species, such as sumaterský nosorožec, pretty and ape.
To Sumatra lost their forests, the entire communities people they without appropriate space for life and without the possibility of duly to make a living.
Perversion of global markets caused by the deal with nelegálními cheaply získávanými products in addition, leads to znevýhodňování those undertakings which behave like responsible citizens of the world.
Developing countries for illegal mining wood comes a year of $15 billion dollars of income tax.
To make matters worse, unsustainable claims for cell-based sumaterské forests still aggravated by the demand for the wood to reconstruction after last tsunami.
Similar threats are clear and in the Amazon and in the Congo.
A recent report Millennium ecosystem assessment (MEA) shows that in these and other key areas occurs because of poor management to decline forests, which will lose if they do not take sound measures.
The information published the Brazilian government suggest that deforestation nenahraditelných amazonských forests, caused by factors, such as the transformation of forests in farmland, struck over the last year 2.6 million acres, thereby odlesněná area amazonie swelled to 17%.
The battle against deforestation but we still neprohráli.
Diverse organizations, environmentalists and associations that the world's forests worries about share its forces to deforestation reverse and improve the management of forests.
For example, the Global Fund conservation (WWF) and the World Bank helped Brazil's government to initiate initiative, in which the is more than 17 million acres of new protected forest areas, such as national parks.
The alliance, and World Bank also motivating their partners to establishing a trust fund, which these protected areas will be permanently manage.
The summit leaders countries haemorrhagic pelvis also resulted in the extraordinary cross-border cooperation in the protection of forests and responsible management with them.
This led to the initiative subsidized 53 millions of dollars of the State Department of the United States to support the protection of forests around the Congo.
From the first meeting leaders in 1999 has been in the Congo pan based newly protected by the territory of 3.5 million acres.
Nevertheless, given the impact of Asian tsunami from last December, pádnosti evidence presented MEA and statistics zachycujícím deforestation in key pralesních regions must our efforts to continue.
The World Bank and the WWF recently undertaken to common effort will help reduce the global deforestation about 10% by 2010 and to cooperate with other institutions of public and private sector to pursue ambitious goals aimed at the protection of forests.
Studies show that, if the world forests divided into a mixture of different types of use and -- including protected territory responsibly administered commercial forests and renewed forest landscape -- could be as to meet the demand for forest products, and also in the foreseeable future to protect environmental and social values.
Its role in pursuit of this vision must play leaders trade governments and organization of civil society.
The al-Saud are zealots?
The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia led many not only to challenge the prospects of the world's survival, but also to the question of whether Kingdom is deeply inefficient, and destructive.
It seems, the Saudi Company produced a violent fanaticism, drawing inspiration from extreme religious orthodoxy.
The fact that 15 of 19 hijackers aircraft, who September 11, 2001 attacked the United States, we Saudis, gave loose long view of the Kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.
In some ways, this view is correct, it cannot, however, apply to a wide Saudi public.
On the contrary, it would be a grave mistake to believe that the Saudi attitude towards religion is fully in fanatickém islámismu.
The years between 2001 and 2003, I was a member of the team that undertake large-scale survey values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and Jordan.
Our results are surprisingly gently stínovaný figure Saudi positions.
Unlike respondentům from other countries of the Middle East are Saudis overall less religious and their attitudes toward democracy and parents agreed marriages also point to moderate tendencies.
Of course, in all four countries is religious widespread - more than 90% of respondents together claim to believe in God, an afterlife and heaven and hell.
The al-Saud but appear to be less than their Muslim religious companions.
For zbožné is using a 62% Saudis, but 82% of Iranians 85% of jordánců and 98% egypťanů.
As zbožnější than the al-Saud appears and Americans, who are so alone call from 81%.
To some extent can be explained by the differences in how the different nations explain what it means to be religious.
For example, Americans may religious to define otherwise than those in the Middle East, with their definition will probably be lnout to religious beliefs, less than in Muslim countries.
This may explain from a part of the differences between Muslim countries.
But the gap between domestic definition of religion between the Saudis on the one hand, and Iranians, Jordanians Egyptians and on the other side is so powerful that challenges the prevailing perspective on Saudi Arabia as a highly conservative and zbožnou society.
After all, actions speaks more clearly than words: from 27% Iranians, 44% jordánců, 42% egypťanů and 45% of Americans, just 28% of Saudi said that each week participate in the service.
These findings, though contrary to generally enlarged views on Saudi culture, are less surprising than it seems.
Sociologists religion long claimed that in the rigid religious environment or in an environment where religious institutions are closely associated with reduced levels of the State, the general public religious to sink.
It is justified to be convinced that when the state authorities be recovered compliance with high standards negotiations, people tend to the revolt and diverted from officially approved religious institutions.
Then there is no surprise that Egyptians and Jordanians, who live in countries where State faith force enforcing are zbožnější than the Iranians and Saudis, already must face with local "mravnostní" police zaštítěnou state.
Even in relation to marriages expressed Saudis unexpectedly liberal ideas.
Respondents were in the matter entered into marriages almost evenly divided, because half held view that marriage should rely on the consent of parents, while 48% surveyed it as a basis married harness priority of love.
Given the entrenched segregation of women and men and male dominance is this finding seems the discovery of strong desire for greater individual choice in a matter of which has traditionally were decided by the family.
Finally, the al-Sauds to show a strong advocates of democracy, which also belies enhanced the idea of the Saudi conservatism.
Democracy in the form of government using a 58% of all surveyed Saudis, with 23% disapproved and 18% of its views nevyjádřilo.
Majority support for democracy in the country without previous secular and national history seemingly contradicts logic.
In fact, support for democracy corresponds to the number of other liberal positions, that we were in Saudi Arabia out.
Supporters of democracy are less religious, sekulárnější, reduce the political costs against other, more critical to behavior public sector and more interested in cultural invasion of the West.
In addition to the data from the survey also history shows that liberal ideas take on the popularity, if people ruling despotic finance-prince in conjunction with the religious establishment.
In response to religious despotism Sultan abdülhamida at the end of the nineteenth century, a strong current liberalism in Ottoman Syria.
In the same period, in Iran has shown protiklerikální, secular movements for government under the Constitution - in response to absolutist an alliance between kádžárovskými šáhy and religious institutions.
Conscious similarities between these historical precedents and current conditions in Saudi Arabia is the possibility of reform should not exclude.
The results of the survey now also suggests that the al-Saud could demand transparent policies and less interventionist religion.
The museum
At the end of the nineteenth century Europe as Asia mainly as a source of inspiration for their artists, or the objective of imperial ambitions.
Asian again see Europe either as a model of modernity, like in Japan during the period meidži, or for the barometer decline, for example, in China.
A hundred years later, Japan's economic miracle made in the eyes of Europeans look at least part of Asia to a sharp technical and industrial progress.
Today, in the early years of the twenty-first century, the perception of Europe in Asia and Asia in Europe dramatically changes, as Asia's economies are boom, while the European Union is sink into crisis identity and self-confidence.
Prominent Asian, such as former Prime Minister Singaporean Lee Kuan Yew now Europeans warn that if will continue to current direction, Europe has quickly become irrelevant in all but tourism and luxury real estate.
Prominent Chinese businessman that their time are divided between Hong Kong and London, was a solid.
A few weeks ago on private summit meeting commercial and political leaders in Paris said: "You Europeans begin to become the countries of the Third World, if you spend time for the wrong issues -- the Constitution, the social state, pension crisis -- and systematically badly odpovídáte on issues that you pose."
The views of Europeans to Asia in general and on China primarily are complex and can fluctuate from střízlivé adapting to the new and respected competitor to purely ideological denial.
In May 1968 in France students -- or at least part of the -- who went to the streets to vynalezli New World, dreamed of Maoist China, the country in the middle of the brutal and senseless Cultural Revolution.
Their absurd and eccentric poblouznění was as the ignorance maových crimes, so the result of znuděnosti youth in a prosperous societies, where was practically non-existent unemployment.
Their heirs today, by contrast, openly criticize Asian capitalist model.
Yesterday, China was protikapitalistickou zářnou star utopických revolucionářů; today it is a ultraliberální testing the cane in the eyes of a new generation of utopických reakcionářů -- defenders of the status quo in Europe.
Studentští demonstrators in the streets of Paris, recently do not want to like Chinese or Indians; spurn logic of globalization and refuse to give up heavily vydobytých social security.
The European economic elites view on China and India very differently.
Now is fully aware that their somewhat nostalgický postkoloniální view of these countries as a major export markets and huge bunkers cheap labor will survive.
China and India have become real competitors, who deserve respect, if not directly amazed.
Quality, costs and the supply in auto production, for example, at the European level.
Europe retains advantage in the field of genuine science, for example, in the pharmaceutical industry, but the company's emerging world level, particularly in India, are increasingly able to hire graduates MIT and Harvard and at the same time to maintain lower labor costs, and thus global competitiveness.
Sadly, though, European leaders Asian challenge recognise, they failed to apply it as the fire reality in inevitable process of globalization or as a profession to weapons in social and economic issues.
Indeed, can be fairly say that Europe's politicians, to a few exceptions, such as Tony Blair, are too slow and to this view of the world aligned with revolutionary pace of change in Asia.
Jailed between the lack of long-term strategic vision and obsession with short-run interests, European politicians are so far from much of nevydobyli respect its Asian counterparts, unlike European companies, which is in the Asian eyes are much better.
Of course, Asian on the continent, which largely failed to bury its history and zabouchnout the door for nationalist guys, often EU are also a model of reconciliation, peace and prosperity.
If, however, European performance continue to fall, lasts this view?
Perhaps that would then Asian began to the European model considered political similar benátek -- instead of that it is worth visit with nostalgic for his former glory and with admiration for its muzejní nature.
The Khmer and blue
Exchange Colin Powell for condoleezzu rice at position foreign minister, the US shows that America's recent presidential elections are still powerful repercussions.
To understand what US elections say about America, but it is important not only for Americans, but for the world.
This year's presidential race shows that America's democracy is a healthy, but that some things might be better.
From the elections in 2000, when President Bush has won most popular and barely won in the electoral college, this time Bush won the 3.5 million votes.
Although some Democrats are still zatrpklí, serious questioning the legitimacy of Bush's victory appears rarely.
America remains just allocated for the States (Republican) and blue States (democratic).
If 100,000 votes in the red Ohio otherwise would have happened, President John Kerry (although it was a minority všelidové aid).
An electoral college in the US Constitution introduced to protect the small states in federal system, but nowadays means that political campaign is largely focused on the battle in some dozen States, where public opinion just divided.
Even more important is that the victory of President without všelidové aid is something improper.
Nazrál so time to serious debate about change the constitution, which would an electoral college canceled.
Some observers also complain about štvavou negativistickou rhetoric and advertising, which characterise campaign.
But it must be assessed in the historical perspective.
In an era of fathers founders were newspapers extremely party and George Washington terrified hrubost language policy.
After a large part of its early history -- a civil war and the postwar reconstruction not to mention -- was divided country so close as now, and closeness soubojů is reflected in lítých rétorikách campaigns.
But, despite štvavé advertising on both sides, three broadcast nationally televised debates seriously nadnesly important issues and obtained attention to a wide audience.
In general, that the incumbent president with the growing economy has great hope for re-election.
In this sense, in Bush's re-election surprising that, on how a majority of it.
Largely that incited nepopulárnost of the Iraq war.
Kerry tried to impose a central issue campaign war, low level of jobs, lack of health care, and the Bush tax cuts for the group with higher incomes, but some observers felt that it never failed to in a clear message.
Bush kontroval concerns about the safety in the face of terrorism and cultural populism on issues such as marriages gay couples and the right to abortion.
Finally, security and cultural populism trumfovaly over economic populism.
The interpretation of the results of the election affect ankety for exits of polling stations, in which were voters interviewed (after vhození voice in the ballot box), what matters are the most important for them.
Most respondents (22%) replied that a "moral values", by contrast, 20% ranked appointed a economy and 19% zmínilo terrorism.
Social conservatives to it so that they Bush assure victory and that their agenda to dominate another the President's electoral term.
Poll conducted pewovým centre a week later, however, suggested that category "moral values" involves a wide range of issues, not just the right to abortion and a gay marriage.
In fact, polls show that the 25% of the public support marriages a gay and 35% favors legal civil unions gay couples (i.e., the position obhajovaným kerrym).
However, in the case of 37% of those who are against marriages homosexuals, particularly in the red of the center of the country topic helped to mobilize the Bush voters and leading them to go to elections.
Serious question is whether the US is hopelessly riven by.
Electoral map red and blue States put on the Internet arise anekdotám and kresleným vtipům that blue coast, odtrhávají from red of the country.
Some call it "coastopia" (coastal utopia).
A dividing line is not as sharp.
Each of the camps in some States won to little margin, and if the map nevybarvíme at the national level, but counties, much of the country looks quite violet.
A better than descriptions coast versus within state is greater city versus suburb and the country.
Public opinion polls show that, for they show that the majority of Americans do not belong to the extrémům political spectrum, but that is natěsnána in his umírněném center.
The political elite, such as the party activists and members of the Congress, we are more likely to excesses than the public.
That is initially appears to be a mystery, because they should have handled the incentive to center, which is the rich to voters.
Many members of Congress but representing circuits that are safe for their part, so their re-election is at stake in the party primary dominated by aktivistická and radical wing parties.
This tendency to strengthen the rise of cable networks, which attract viewers through vixenish "infozábavních" programs, and Internet bloggerů, already entered into urputných triggered arguments without any redakčního filter.
Reforms aimed at any border changes congressional districts that would have to introduce more competition, would help reduce this problem, but few sitting office holders kongresmanů will vote for change, which could boost risk that will be won.
The outcome of the soundness suggests that Bush won mandate weaker than seems to be sure.
Whereas the faces difficult issues in foreign, fiscal and social policy preserved would be wise to neusmiřoval with his conservative membership base, but turned to political center. Yet, however, remains unclear whether will prevail policy ideological or a pragmatic.
The oil zlozvyku zbavme
For the priority agenda Germany for his presidency of the EU and the G-8, beginning in January, established Chancellor Angela Merkel solutions to climate change.
Here is a proposal, which is sufficiently general that it world leaders consider and accepted, and sufficiently clear that it other governments and businesses recognized: simply at the next the G-8 summit determine term, in which cease to be in industrial countries approved vehicle dedicated oil products.
Such a decision should strongly positive economic and geopolitical consequences.
The real cause of today's fears about energy is not the loss of world oil reserves, but rather that domestic oil production at its largest consumers -- Europe, the United States and China -- falls just when the rising Asian demand namáhá market.
Available resources are increasingly concentrated in the Middle East simply because supplies in other regions are exhausted before.
Moreover, are not willing to abide by the major oil exporters their investment policy market requirements.
Saudi Arabia is trying to carry out of oil independently, while Iran potential investors deters bureaucratic impediments and corruption.
Iraq suffers from bad security situation and Russia soon fall foreign investors sticks's feet.
These four countries own half proven world oil reserves and two-thirds of what you could potentially export.
It is these circumstances, rather than the cost of production, lies at the core of high oil prices and fight to oil contracts in central Asia and Africa.
Opinion that high oil prices are good for the environment, because it ignores basic facts of international politics.
First, in many poor African and Asian countries represent oil imports much larger share of national expenditure than in industrial countries, which means that is in danger of economic growth and social development, while on the horizon from new crisis of indebtedness.
Rents from oil production in major exporting countries prevents reforms.
Because of their financial power in great shape the regimes, for example, in Venezuela and Iran feel increasingly less bound by international rules.
Opozdilci between consumer states like China, the former habits industrial West, with long histories ignoring the intervention in human rights in order to ensure a lucrative deals with authoritarian, oil obdařenými regimes.
Initiate the change in a global scale may only world political and economic difficult balance, a leading industrial countries that remain far from the largest consumer hydrocarbons.
Change must begin in the transport, who is responsible for more than half of the current oil consumption -- and this percentage is likely to increase in the future.
States the G-8 should therefore be agree that since 2025 will allow any new cars driven by petroleum products.
This Decision would be directed against individual mobility, but against wasting precious source of which is naléhavěji needed to produce synthetic materials.
Political leaders should not designed to favour any particular technology.
Rather, it should give Automotive industry incentives to the development of alternative technologies to rely on the drive from biomass, etylén, hydrogen, indeed, during a transition period and natural gas.
Countries that will be razit way forward politically, like collateral benefit to ensure their domestic industry front place in energy technologies that we insure future markets.
The expected significant reduction in CO2 emissions would eventually may lead to a breakthrough, which is needed in international climate policies.
The change would, however, I expressed in economic development: if vyléčili of its "dependency" on oil remained had more to poorer, less developed and newly industrialized countries and at the same time, it stlačovalo prices and uvolňovalo geopolitical energy competition.
Geopoliticky would benefits are similarly obvious, as would greatly reduce the ability of the main exporters of oil extort industrial countries.
This would increase bargaining power of the international community in the Middle East, and strengthen those social forces in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Russia, which genuinely want from within a political and economic reform.
As a technologically advanced countries and significant manufacturer cars is Germany in advantageous position to such Initiative launched.
Merkel, which has doctorate of physics and his political career began as Secretary of the environment -- in 1995 předsedala first Conference of the UN Framework Convention on climate change -- is perhaps to address this issue credible than any of its colleagues in the EU and the G8.
It is time for adventuresome vůdcovský crime.
Myth of trade and aid
Trade and assistance have become International módními passwords.
It seems, increasing aid (including debt forgiveness) and ensure better approach products from poor countries to the markets of rich countries are at the heart of the world's agenda.
Debate is now doing what to do, but how much do, and how quickly.
In this climate, we are clear the lessons of the last five decades of economic development.
To čelném place between them is the fact that the development of is largely in the hands of the poor countries.
Countries that, in the recent past led well do so because of their own efforts.
Assistance and access to markets in the rarely played a key role.
Consider developing country that has a free and preferential access to the market of his biggest neighbor, who is coincidence also strongest the world economy.
Suppose further that this country can send millions of its citizens to work across the border, is the huge of internal investment and is fully integrated into the international production chain.
Moreover, the banking system supports declared willingness to rich neighbor act as lender of last resort.
Globalization even cannot be better if liž true?
And now consider the country.
The from access to the world's biggest market trade embargo, from the West, she starved of foreign aid or any other forms of aid is excluded from international organizations, such as the WTO, and not to borrow from the IMF and World Bank.
And that these external disadvantage was not enough, imposes this economy also own high barriers to international trade (in the form of a State dirigismu, import duties and quantitative restrictions).
As already Reader perhaps suspected, this is the real country: Mexico, and Vietnam.
Mexico has more than 3 500 kilometers long border with the United States, which it is not only privileged access to the market of goods and work, but also entitled to the sources of US Treasury (as it emerged during the peso crisis in 1995).
Vietnam to maintain on the contrary, America until 1994 trade embargo diplomatic relations with this country has forged only in 1995 and clause maximum benefits neudělila vietnamskému imports many years later.
Moreover, Vietnam still stands aside the WTO.
And now compare economic performance of the two countries.
From the signing of the Treaty NAFTA in December 1992 Mexico's economy has grown at an average annual rate of only 1%.
This is not only well below the Asian economic superhvězd, moreover, but it is only a fraction of its own Mexican growth during the previous decade debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).
Vietnam's economy on the contrary, before the start of the economic reforms in 1988, and when he established a diplomatic engagement with the US in 1995 at an annual rate of 6% and even since continues in the rapid growth in an 4.5%.
The country has experienced a dramatic decline in poverty, while in Mexico fell real wages.
Both countries have a sharp increase in international trade and foreign investment, but still offer vastly different figure in indicators, on which it is most: in raising living standards, in particular poor people.
These examples show that, in terms of economic the fate of the country exceeds domestic efforts everything else.
Not all opportunities that Mexico offered the market, the United States have failed to offset the consequences of policy mistakes at home, especially the inability to reverse the real exchange-rate appreciation peso and expand productivity growth achieved in the export activities close to the rest of the economy.
Most of all, depends on whether a country adopts good pro-growth strategy.
Vietnam without any Mexican benefits choose strategy that has focused on the diversification of the economy, and increasing capacity domestic suppliers.
The wider post-War experience support concluded that is the key to domestic policies.
South Korea, in early 1960s neodlepila from DNA when foreign aid the pace, but, when it was on the wane.
Taiwan receive foreign assistance and has not preferential access to markets.
China and India, the two today's economic superhvězdy prosper, largely because of his one reform efforts.
It is tempting to rare African achievements -- and Botswana Mauritania -- foreign demand for their exports (diamantech or oděvech), but this explanation works only to some extent.
Obviously, the two countries would have been without access to foreign markets considerably poorer.
As in other cases of successful development, however, is from other distinguished external benefits to enjoy, but the ability to these benefits re-utilize.
Document is svízelná situation in which bogged down other rich countries on the incidence of natural resources.
In Sierra Leone the word "composed of" hardly raises the idea of peace and prosperity.
And so little export processing zones, which is spreading around the world, achieve results recorded in Mauritius.
None of this does not deprive the rich countries help responsibility.
Can make the world less pohostinným for corrupt dictators -- for example, wider exchange financial information and neuznáváním international agreements, which these dictators sign.
As well as an increase in the number of workers from poor countries, which will be allowed to work in rich countries, and the wider framework for růstově oriented strategy the release of the WTO rules and podmíněnosti from the US should on the development of higher long-term impact.
Is far from clear that the extension of access to markets and increase aid is nejplodnější uses precious political capital to the north.
Development should focus on trade or to help, but to improve the political environment in poor countries.
Who is dependent now?
If it were now alive late great economist Ra??l Argentina's prebisch, they would certainly wondered whether the world its side upside down.
Its extremely influential theory "dependency" claimed that if poor countries too rely on exports of commodities, never have reached industrial depth, which is needed to maintain svižného growth.
Instead, get stuck in koloběhu decreasing global commodities prices and an tenčících income shares.
Prebischova preferred for policy response protectionism, has proved catastrophic for many Latin American and African States, which gave to the Council.
But it is the fact that the many years, seemed to prebisch correctly pojmenovává long-term trends commodity prices.
Sustained efficiency gains in agriculture and extraction of natural resources stlačovaly commodities prices, especially during the 1980s and 1990s.
With only a few exceptions, the countries that are soustředily to exports of commodities, managed lousy, while natural resources neoplývající Asian countries had forward.
But now, when the global economy employs Asian giants, India and China, oil prices, gold, wheat and virtually all other commodities rise sharply.
Even though it is always be in cycles -- oil prices, for example, is likely to fall than start to rise again -- the long-term trend in many commodities undoubtedly will remain for some time increasing.
One thing that trade negotiators and other lawmakers still realize, although prebisch perceived it immediately, is that this dramatic turn of events poses huge consequences for global balance of power.
No other aspect of economic globalization will probably not be in the coming decades for the world leaders represent greater challenge.
Questions are many.
Today's rich countries are prepared to era of mutual dependence when they will after commodities prahnout as strong as developing countries after industrial imports and technology?
Are ready to inevitable transfer of power and influence producers of commodities, no longer be significantly being rich?
As the two world superpower, China and the United States, to the fact that important regions commodity exporting from Africa across the Middle East to the Central Asia are with bad utvořenými national states?
Some samozvaní jasnovidci recount matter as a problem konečnosti natural resources, and the world supposedly necessary commodities at an alarming rate running out.
Many supporters now has theory hubbertova "high" in the production of oil considers that we have the upper limits production capacity, drilling cash are drying up and from now it is only a decline.
But as the says historian history oil Dan yergin, proroci destruction declared that the world is oil, for at least four times.
Each time the threat of zaplašilo radical improved technologies.
At the end of the first decade of the 19th century oil production include collection matter by mules.
Today, no one is surprised drilling in depth 3,000 feet below the bottom of the sea.
The comparable advances occurred plošně in mining ore and in agriculture.
No, the world commodities anytime soon nedojdou.
Instead, however, is that the inclusion of 2.5 billion people (only China and India) into the global economy translates into a shift demand, which is likely to bring much more pressure to increasing commodity prices than what can offset technological advances.
Natural resource prices will thus face up at least in the next 50 to 75 years, and perhaps until people in the next centuries begin to benefit Mars.
Rozkolísá world politics change in the balance of global economic power, which will result?
The first world war, of course, partly caused the fear of Germany, whereas other colonial powers, reserve too large share of world oil reserves and commodities.
In the Second World War II Japan similarly strachovalo on the stability of its foreign oil supplies and other natural resources.
The apparent similar tensions between China, whose natural resources are limited (problem is that even a lack of water), and the West?
It had not appear likely in the meantime, particularly given the střízlivému and pragmatickému approach the Chinese leadership to difficulties in natural resources.
The Chinese are rozhlížejí after regions, such as Africa and hope to find a permanent trading partners.
Nesdílejí political evangelism Americans who do not want to countries with only commodities trading, but he is also recourse to his beliefs.
There are, however, I tací American leaders who with regard to supplies of energy talk about the transformation of the US in soběstačnou country.
But this is virtually a joke: nestřídmost perhaps, but never self-sufficiency.
Much of the Arab world understandably, as the invasion of Iraq in cornerstone real strategy of the US in the field of ensuring a stable energy supply.
If they are right, can only hope that America has in advance plan B.
In the meantime, continue to grow commodity prices, the oil exporters currently represent the largest subscribers to zejícímu US trade deficit.
Perhaps the real strategies of the US is dlužit exporting countries oil money that will feel dependent on line America!
This is a turn, which would prebisch never anticipated.
Iran's yes hard line
The next president, who his choice Iran, am hard-line and mayor Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad seems to make matters worse as relations with the West and international isolation of the country.
From the domestic view, but probably Islamist regime will do better than it would he managed to with more moderate result.
Obviously, Ahmadinejad has real base podporovatelů.
But these circumstances, that ran as populist, spoke of to help the poor condemned inefficiency of the government and a almost as the opposition candidate, all irrelevant: was vyvolencem regime and he received assistance and against a competitive candidates hard-line.
The great advantage of their opportunities.
A little pragmatičtějšího hášimího rafsandžáního that disagreed with some existing policies, has become a "establishment" and its own man in rebela.
Therefore, the government has used the emotions directed against the establishment of a to strengthen the personal power.
The fact that last President Mohammed chátamí was přívržencem reform movement -- though přívržencem neprůbojným which eventually nothing has -- underscores just how thoroughly rulers political situation turned.
Ahmadinejad is representative of the young activists protišáhovské revolution a quarter of a century earlier.
Directly participated in possession of American hostage in Iran, though how far it on part, remains the dispute.
Nejznepokojivější is that it is close to the two main groups that are part of the most extreme Iran: Islamic Revolutionary Guard and organization basidž.
The first is parallel prorežimní army; the second is the organization for intimidation opponents and all who seek a more open society.
Fears that Iran pervaded even more radical leadership, however, alleviate two circumstances.
First, Ahmadinejad will focus more on national affairs, because they will try to to improve the quality of the poorest Iranians -- though it is clear to what extent succeeds.
Second, the ideological and foreign policy will continue to result in principle, the same group that is in power since revolution.
President has less powers than it seems, zastíněn primarily Supreme Leader Ayatollah alím chameneím.
However, ahmadínedžádovo electoral victory inexorably demonstrates challenge, already Iran represents for Western policy and the stability of the Middle East.
Primarily a signal the most extreme elementům in Iran and terrorist clients countries -- Lebanese Hezbollah Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad and less different groups vystupujícím against Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other Arab countries -- that have the green light to start attacks.
They seem to conclude that Iran is will support, whether anything be carried out.
It was Iran often relatively cautious, but in hiding is a major world sponsor of terror.
Individual Iranian leaders sometimes could act for themselves and order and control certain operations; now, when such actions feel freely.
Moreover, Ahmadinejad openly advocates Iran's urgent program to obtain nuclear weapons.
Most of Iran's politicians -- at least those that government allowed publicly act -- promotes program, but they prefer tiššímu and obezřetnějšímu approach.
Rafsandžání, for example, to building a better economic relations with the West over procedure to nuclear front.
If President Ahmadinejad nuclear Iran, for it is likely that the guns use dobrodružněji.
This does not mean that they were out, but rather that would be used for the diplomatic blackmail and zesilování threats to the crisis levels.
Whereas Iran's leaders every day declare their desire to wipe Israel off the map and to fight with the US (Ahmadinejad on the road to the voting urně pošlapal figure American flag), the risk of confrontation increased.
Finally, for Ahmadinejad is likely to be bold at subversion stability in Iraq and that its victory to encourage both radical Iranian agents, so the extremists inside the Iraq.
Iran now continues to Iraq quantity agents and promote clients whose purpose is to turn the country in the clone.
Iraqis, including the Shiite Muslims -- have already profess Islam strain the same as the Iranians -- such meddling by widespread rejection.
Militantnější Iran's position to intensify friction with Iraq and give rise to the other anti-US violence.
In short, Iran's electoral outcome is dangerous, though how much destabilizing eventually reveals will depend on ahmadínedžádově negotiations and to the extent of the powers, who had granted Khamenei.
To deal with such openly extreme Iran -- radical and to the standards of hard regime -- a line will not only for the US, but also for Europe.
Europe's States to pretend that ahmadínedžádova militant rhetoric and its provokace mind and that over Iran's nuclear ambitions can be found a diplomatic solution?
With rafsandžáním would be easy to preserve either real domluvu or simulation cooperation.
With ahmadínedžádem will be needed but vrchovaté rates appeasement to survived at least completely minimum diplomatic development.
Some Iranian reformers and exulanti represent ahmadínedžádovo election in jasnějších colors and argue that in the case of his administration is likely to show the true face regime and to eliminate the West of all the false promise of a compromise.
But the option may also be a success of the regime in kooptování discontent with čtvrtstoletím radical Islamist government.
Whatever the consequences of any, for the West ahmadínedžádovo victory means that everything concerns Iran, will be even more ardent.
Take the rich to poor and
It seems that President Bush is ready to turn in the coming years, America's budget in ruins.
When Bush took office, the prospect of budget surpluses zaplňovaly all horizons.
Given the combination of irresponsible tax cuts to enforce the Republicans now fiscal horizon dominates slowing of the economy, bursting bubble of the stock market and massive increase in defense spending.
And it will be worse, because the Bush administration and the Republican-controlled Congress are gearing up to this fiscal mess intensify.
Skody, which will probably will weaken the United States and increase instability of the world economy.
America's Republican Party traditionally supported balanced budgets.
That changed with the advent of the Reagan administration, when the conservative Republicans prefer to tax cuts and at the cost of large fiscal deficits.
President Reagan told the American people that they may also even when you the tax cuts, growth army and continuation of their own programs state spending.
Not surprisingly, the result was a series of huge budget deficits that urovnávaly for years.
Both George Bush senior and Bill Clinton had to raise taxes to the mess of the Reagan era remedy.
Tax hikes probably contributed to the victory of Bill Clinton over Bush seniorem 1992.
Yet the Clinton courage to complete the process of reconstruction fiscal stability, in part because that pojistil long-term financing pension program social security.
When in 2000, Clinton left office, budgetary situation was best for several decades.
Then came President George Bush Jr. and mimic the Reagan: large tax cuts, significant increase in defense spending, and the continuation of the or even enlargement of the popular programs state spending.
The result was predictable.
In January 2001 was the cumulative result of the financial naplánován for the period 2002 to 2011 with přebytkovou the amount of 5, 6 trillion.
In the middle of 2002, the surplus dispelled.
When we consider this change economic conditions and the threat of the war in Iraq, one would expect that the Bush administration and the Republican-controlled Congress when defending new tax cuts careful, it would but was a mistake.
Their highest priority is to approve further reducing taxes, which most benefit the rich.
At the same time, government calls for a significant increase in defense spending.
Given a presidential election looming naplánovaným in November 2004, we can be sure, or outside the army to any significant reduction government spending will not.
So, it seems that large budget deficits are in the US zabydlují.
Change if the domestic spending in relation to the national income, financial cumulative result reaches for the next ten years of aggregate deficit 1.5 trillion.
This number but may still be optimistic, because they may be due account expenditure for possible war in Iraq, another round of tax cuts or the risk of higher interest rates in the coming years.
As it is possible that are Republicans for these problems indifferent?
Some are more interest in the tax cuts for the rich than on anything that another.
Others believe that the deficit will chase extensive control of domestic state spending, and thus reducing state, and that is the desire to their hearts.
Difficulties this view is that most taxpayers has programs domestic spending in vogue and will not be willing to support cuts in expenditure.
The question that strikes more, this is why Americans give voice in the election that political approaches, when they should be clear that problems are obvious.
Response is that many voters perceive the budgetary problems.
Better answer is that the majority of Americans do such a policy.
Turnout was 2002, only about 40%, and the Republicans have only about half of the votes - so voices around 20% of voters.
Of course, the prospects of may not be as dark.
The war in Iraq may be avoided.
The proposed tax cuts is lessened or refrain from them.
But I předvídám in the years large budget deficits and growing sense of unrest in both the US and abroad, which will be based on the American macroeconomic situation.
Foreign investors may decide to limit the financing of America's budget deficit and existing for fair conditions.
The dollar may weaken and may begin to a greater extent in fear of inflation.
It will that American policymakers loses security and flexibility that should be in dealing with economic shocks.
The poor, both the US and abroad, could have suffered the most, when President Bush and the US Congress to tell the American people and the world that because of large budget deficits is not enough money for poverty, disease, and the problems of education.
If the ordinary Americans so informed this fiscal danger rich may vyváznou with another mnohamilionovým gift, while the United States and the world might after years of their painful consequences.
The lessons of fiscal volatility America
George W. Bush has done economic policy us more harm than any other President in history and surpassed and their teacher Ronald Reagan.
In just three years in office destroyed fragile political consensus, whose building took a decade and whose the creating may require the next ten years.
But Bush did not long-term economic health and social stability America.
Because long-term budgetary questions that the US so badly zvládají, not specific, they may of fiscal přehmatů America take important lesson also other countries.
The main problem fiscal policy is that politicians can easily temporarily boost popularity by reducing taxes and increase in public expenditure, with a large public debt and its repaying discard in the future.
This approach can be applied for several years, but budget deficits and growing public debt, sooner or later, forcing the painful turnover policy.
Cynical policies still can buy reelection, and before the times of crisis may now be výslužbě.
One would have thought that after hundreds of similar demonstrations fiscal irresponsibility around the world over the past decade will be no longer voters to similar tricks allergic.
Bush him, however, has flaunted again and buy the popularity of nadělováním massive tax cuts at the current growth military spending, and even expenditure on education and health care.
The result is the budget deficit to more than 5% of GDP.
Worse, the long-term budget prospects of the United States are worrying already before Bush embarked on its lehkomyslnou policy.
The people of the US, of course, so that it brings the rapid increase in public expenditure financed on health and pension systems.
Careful calculations show that future earnings for fiscal policy will take Bush will probably a desetibiliony $lower than the expenditure on public pensions, health care, and other fiscal money, which the public is expected.
In the future so in a moment emerge need a sharp increase in collecting taxes, sharp cuts in public expenditure, or both, if he is to be corrected Bush's actions.
Why the public his policies supports?
Because the public the long-term consequences of the few understands or them little interest in, although eventually adversely affect them a majority of Americans.
The richest taxpayers, of course, are satisfied, because much of the tax cuts will affect just them.
It is astonishing that the richest five percent of American taxpayers' was given to almost half of the tax cuts, and these taxpayers clearly expect that the majority of future expenditure cuts and tax increases will bear on his shoulders the remaining 95% of the population, and lower middle class.
Bush did so persuaded many voters from poor and middle classes that they should be happy, without them, however, said that if policy his administration's long-term will prevail, will have a small tax cuts to pay a much wider restrictions government services in the future.
If Americans political memory, would understood that this fiscal, toboganu "in the past twenty years have one svezli.
Also, Ronald Reagan came to office with the promise of massive tax cuts and a large increase in military spending.
In the 1980s, was the result of a huge budget deficit.
The tax cuts were Reagan vast popularity and help him for re-election in 1984.
The return of the budget surplus to back then took more than ten years - from Reagan's second term after term George Bush older and Bill Clinton.
Of course, this would approval of new tax cuts, which get George Bush older for re-election and led to polarization policy in the 1990s.
History will almost certainly be repeated.
Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush Administration believes that today's budget deficits will chase sharp reduction in government social spending.
Hope to eliminate programs as social security and Medicare.
The American public, however, these programs strongly supports.
The right strategy tax cuts for the subsequent enforcement cuts in social programmes therefore fails, and eventually will have to be to increase tax rates.
Other officials of the Bush Administration argue that the tax cuts are important for vyvedení the United States of recession.
Also this argument is wrong.
America's economy might of recession vybřednout even without tax cuts, and perhaps even more wisely.
In any case, it is a big mistake based long-term fiscal policy on short-term economic cycle.
For other countries that follow from two vital lesson.
The first is the realization that the looming US budget deficits, sooner or later, reducing the power of the United States in the world.
Americans supported the war in Iraq only because they have to pay in the form of tax increases.
If you have to choose between foreign adventure and higher taxes, with much less likely will promote costly military operations abroad.
When the public begins to face the fiscal mess that he has left behind Bush, the US is inherently deeply divided.
The second lesson is that States should in planning budgets take into account the growing fiscal cost of ageing population.
Taxpayers or parliaments have rarely in mind the long-term budgetary conditions.
From the governments should therefore be require that, together with annual budget proposals to establish a also long-term budget forecasts, which would reduce the tendency to short-term political manipulation of the budget.
The US can other countries serve as a kind of early warning.
The White House should for other represent the same warning that Wizards on TV adresují viewers: try it at home. "
Securities markets and policy
Many economic and financial analysts complain that securities markets emerging countries are often significantly handled by their governments, and that the markets more political than economic.
The unspoken premise seems to be that securities markets industrialized countries on the contrary, by a genuine force economic in nature and therefore predict that their performance is the same as predict growth of trees.
This description of securities markets emerging countries is wrong, only with, because the same description applies to securities markets in advanced countries.
The best know analysts predict that performance of the stock market any country practically means predict how well is, as the view of the government is in the current political atmosphere investors in the stock market, to perform.
Consider the stock market of the United States, by far the largest in the world.
General view is such that the government between companies nevměšuje and that investment income in the American stock market reflect fundamental forces strong capitalist economy.
This is one reason why the US is a magnet for portfoliové investors from around the world.
Income that make us securities markets so attractive, reflects but fragile political balances.
With the passage of time and changes political pressures are jumped around a lot in tax rates affecting securities.
For example, during World War II decreased political support for great wealth and government sharply higher taxes capital gains dividend and high income at all.
When the Second World War provoked a revival of economic crisis 30 years, President Roosevelt and Congress sales added tax excessive profits to guarantee that shareholders are benefiting too much.
By contrast, 1980, when it was not neválčilo, but the stock market was weak, the American voters decided to Ronald Reagan, on which the many thought is for President too far-right.
Asked for cuts in taxes on capital gains dividend and income - and he was accepted.
Political meddling in the stock market is not only taxes capital gains dividend and revenue.
Property taxes, consumer tax, import duties and turnover tax - that paid, directly or indirectly, corporations - may have multiple impact on profits enterprises, and so on the stock market.
It is not accidental that when securities markets thrive, governments will provide important to these taxes neničily net enterprises.
Policy securities markets did not end in taxes.
On the contrary, in profits enterprises, and in the consequences, and the stock market has implications of almost all of government actions.
After the collapse of the stock market 1929 American government suspended most antitrust activities, thereby firms to obtain monopoly position that reinforced by their value.
This policy zpozdila recovery from high unemployment, but even that could přibrzdit political forces sešikované under the banner of support of the stock market.
Similarly, one of the most important affairs, on which made a great President Reagan was breaking substantial part of the power of America's trade unions, which compete for its share of corporate profits pie.
Reaganovo victory over strike aircraft dispečerů in 1981 was fault events as for the American labor movement, and for the stock market that 1982 began its dramatic bull market.
The US government supported the stock market aggressively particularly since kulminace bubble prices common shares in 2000, most notably by cutting interest rates.
Of course, it is publicly obhajovalo in relation to encouraging the economy, not support the stock market.
But telling mark the importance of the American stock market is that it is falling prices of equity were considered as one of the most important factors tížících economy.
Reaction offices, the actually neomezila to monetary stimulus.
Statements of national income and produce the US shows that effective the taxation profit enterprises (percentage gains actually odvedených government through taxes) in the first quarter of 2000, when kulminoval stock market economy and generally - mobilize $33 7%, while in the third quarter of 2003, when the market in a downturn, fell to 20% 2.
Much of this fall reflects the direct tax breaks odhlasované Congress and a sense of widespread between firms that in the current economic and political situation can be to circumvent the taxes průbojnější.
After the collapse of the stock market was moreover, sharply reduced maximum tax dividends paid out of shares, from 35% to 15%, which brought a major advantage long-term investors and strengthen multiple effect reinvestic dividends after taxation.
Even in this case were tax cuts obhajovány with regard to stimulate the economy, which, however, may be, of course, say of any measures targeting the support of the stock market.
Whether the justification credible, however, depends on a balance political forces.
We can say in the US is no longer 200 years apply the same variables, inter alia, opposition to the high taxes and weak the labor movement, and -, then, can be expected to be applied in the future and that ensure high returns on the stock market, and massive inflows of foreign investment.
Those who believe that investments in the American stock market to maintain the trend strong growth for decades, may be quite right.
But it should be clear in what really predicts.
In principle predicts not only the economy, but also policy, and even cultural values which shape economic policy, and economic performance.
Global home
Houses are nejlokálnější from investments rooted in a place as tree, and therefore flourish or wasting away in response to local economic conditions.
On television we mihotá the whole world, but the market with our dwelling, which is almost exclusively of local amatéry remains ukotvený directly in the US in its backyard.
This would, however, may soon change.
Within months Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in cooperation with my companies macromarkets and further fiserv and Standard & Poor ', with a options and futures contracts on home prices in the ten cities of the United States.
The Treaty will be based on indices of home prices of the S & P / case - Shiller that evolved from the academic work, which we before almost 20 years průkopnicky made me and my colleague Karl case.
For many years propagujeme futures contract to housing, but none of the stock market until now want to these indices to create a futures market to use.
The futures markets aimed at prices condominiums will allow investors around the world indirectly to invest in the home in the US, when through these markets buy shares.
Investor in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo will be able to invest in the home inhabited by their owners in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
The fundamental principle of financial theory -- "diversification of" or "distribution of risks" -- suggests that interest in the new contracts will be big.
People and businesses in New York, for example, are too much to their local real estate risks, and should therefore these risks should reduce selling futures contracts on the price of New York home.
People in Tokyo accept part of their risks purchasing futures on home prices in New York, if correctly set price.
People in New York will continue to live at home, but the investment risk to spread throughout the world.
On the creation of a real futures market with a family houses there is no attempt to since 1991, when the effort to run such market in Britain failed the London stock market with the futures and options liffe (now after the merger to euronext. Liffe).
Their attempt never create greater trade turnover.
The stock market zorganizovala party, and no one was.
British markets sázkami on the margin in prices condominiums nor maloprodejní online markets will never significantly failed.
This time it would be otherwise?
Of course, start a new market is always uncertain thing: people want to come to a party only if there is a lot of people; if there nobody, no one wants to come.
Similarly, in markets where many investors, cannot be made enough business that would be postaraly on income, which would attract investors.
Just as it is often the case for great parties, may be while some enigma as important new markets are to move, but we do know that here and there this occurs.
The first signs show a growing interest in trade with futures on home prices, in particular, how much importance diversification risk underscore the debate about "real-estate bubble."
After the CME one of its competitors, Chicago Board Options Exchange, said that plans to create and repurchase agreements for the main regions of the US, that is to be based on the median home prices published the National Association of housing agents.
But in a strong public interest on investment in housing and ensure the risks associated with, should be dealt with another major matter, if the futures markets succeed: it should be reveal prices and investors must understand what these prices mean.
Consider a fairly likely that many of these futures markets will soon be predict substantial price declines in some cities the US during the next year.
In the situation, already traders call a "backwardation": the futures price is now on the market lower than the current price house.
Perhaps the need is that first day with real-estate futures trading, but it is not likely that the within a few months occurs.
At some of these markets can backwardation need if fulfill its function.
Everyone knows that in recent years, many of these cities (as well as other parts of the world) through a real estate boom.
International investors are not likely to invest in these towns, if the expectations of falling prices on the futures markets into account, as the Tokyo because of their own bitter experience well understood.
But if the backwardation sufficient, even investors, who thinks that the US market housing aims to decline, will be able to from futures on home prices expect a profit, because they reduced prices are already on the termínovém market.
This, however, require that people in New York, seeking to ensure their investments in real estate adapt to the fact that will sell futures contracts are zapracovaným price down.
They will have to adapt to the idea that the market was expected to decline, and that they can protect just before the range of possible future decrease prices, which is over this expectations.
The korekcím our thinking probably will happen to actually see future market prices.
Yet the future direction of real estate prices only things different views.
Markets to establish international consensus about the future of home prices in cities around the world, will be able to better run the risk that this city faces, and thus stabilize the economy -- and our lives.
That reports stir up markets?
Stock markets in most of the world show from approximately 10 may a growing declines; the principal portion of the collapse of occurred during two-week period roughly in May 23, but prices continue to fall in diameter.
Mean difficulties in world stock markets the problem for the world economy?
Consider the strongest mobility.
From a significant countries has been the biggest collapse in India, where from 10 May to 22 May fell stock prices of 16, 9%.
Havoc on the other side of the planet was almost as large and upper and lower maxima from levels in India by the day or two: in Argentina stock prices fell 16 1%, Brazil by 14, 7%, and in Mexico 13.8%.
European markets also suffered a major losses.
In Sweden from 9 May to 22 May stock prices fell 15.2%; during the almost totožného period prices dropped on 9.7% in Germany, the 9, 4% in France and Britain and the 9, 3% in Italy.
Similarly, stock prices in Asia during the almost the same period fell from the highest in the lowest value of 11 5% in Korea on 9, 3% in Hong Kong and of 8% in Japan.
Many commentators tries to combine these events with events in the United States.
The prices of US stocks declined, however, between 9 May and 24 may only by 5.2%.
For the decline of global does not appear to be nor China, because their stock prices, in fact during this period increased.
The usual explanations economists revolve around monetary policy.
In the wake of the great deflation shy of 2003, central banks around the world to cut interest rates, inciting speculative boom as on the stock market, and real estate market.
Now, according to this view, begin to hlodat rising interest rates, which does further declines in asset prices.
This argument certainly contains a point.
America's Federal Reserve really 10 may increased rates and its Chairman Ben Bernanke then suggested that in the future may occur another increases.
Furthermore, 17 May published data on inflation in the US, indicating that there is another monetary tightening.
Economists like to see the world as a logical and zvladatelný, which implies that means what is happening.
The following its approach, however, often zveličují role of central banks.
Indeed, the American rate hike was only one in a series of -- that is already on the 16th.
Since in may declines in stock markets began, no additional significant central bank rates increased, and it until 7 - 8 June when so made several banks (the European Central Bank and the Bank in India, Korea, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey).
Another factor is the price of oil from 22 March to 2 may rose 24% and recorded in the absolute records.
Admittedly, it was a major event, which should credibly affect stock markets around the world.
Increases in oil prices were viníkem virtually all economic recession since World War II.
Yet booms oil prices in the interval, when the mid-May indices stock market fell most.
If we are to argue that the increase in oil prices fueling market declines, we would have to assume několikatýdenní a delay.
Stock markets, however, are too logical and the late response to shocks oil prices would occur.
As for all other prices on financial markets are that increase breeds attention.
When oil prices rise sharply, people are news on oil prices and on these prices together speaks, causing greater sensitivity to these reports.
The oil prices is tied crisis in the Middle East, and that in may news dominated.
Increases in oil prices in thinking investors probably still umocnily ominous indications and strong words certain political personalities.
Israel's vice-premier Shimon Peres 8 may in response to hostile statements Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that "the president of Iran should remember that Iran may also be wiped off the map."
At the beginning of the stock market crash may again Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia, the largest světově Muslim-majority nation and 13 may newspapers she that he on two major universities in the country had received from students ovací standing.
This report can be regarded as proof that the Ahmadinejad politically paid his game with fire in the nuclear question, which would reinforced by the impression that the situation in the Middle East could result in even higher oil prices.
These reports may seem far more distant stock market than monetary policy.
But the response to the them, together with the recent zvýšeními oil prices may largely explain change market psychology.
Approaches to risk is with time amended and events as ahmadínedžádovy and peresovy remarks may such changes in advance.
So while these matters set in ways that can be difficult to quantify, analysts might in order to understand the direction of world stock markets have ahmadínedžádovým words attention as well as carefully words bernankeovým.
Economists may not be enthusiastic about that should focus on public opinion on how the changes in prices, on the world of coverage and to the speculative dynamism.
After all, of such an approach is that economic events are less predictable (and economists less vševědoucí) than we like to represent.
Such a focus but gives intuitivně sense.
What really have a more ideas investors?
Ahmadinejad is charismatic person; Bernanke not.
Ahmadinejad is starting to riskantního undertaking; Bernanke not.
And what is perhaps the most important, Ahmadinejad has destabilizing influence; Bernanke not.
Indeed, whatever is the primary cause of the world's downturns stock prices of half may any for unstable market psychology are significant.
May be hard to believe that the apply only to view of the probability of monetary policy and not to the bigger and deeper matters, inter alia power and political tensions, which is based on the performance of the world economy.
Why do připlácet for férovost?
Marks & Spencer, chain supermarkets and outlets garments, 400 shops across Britain, recently announced that all their range of coffee and tea, total 38 Species move on fairtrade, marketingovému symbol "ethical production."
In their 200 caf??s caf?? revive already chain sells only tea and coffee with the fairtrade.
They are also move its sales shirt and other goods from fairtrade cotton.
The came during the campaign "fairtrade fortnight" two-week promotion products férového trade, whose part of the besední tour farmers from developing countries who Britons vylíčili as fairtrade helps their Community.
A shift to ethical consumption recorded significant increases in and the United States, as consumers is increasingly turns to organic, locally produced food and the eggs from hens, which are held in cages.
In Britain was survey found that half of those who was presented symbol fairtrade, this mark recognized, and knew that designates products, which provide decent conditions for farmers third world.
Similar poll in the US exists, but relevant information and discussions with my students suggest that number would be a much lower.
Traders seeking certification fairtrade must pay producers of to cover the costs of sustainable production and ensure wage to live on.
For example, a minimum price for coffee is $1.26 pound, regardless of how deep may fall market price.
If the market price vystoupá above that amount, the price fairtrade increase, so that held five cents per pound higher.
From small farmers, again, sought to organize into cooperatives or other groups, enabling democratic participation.
Farmers and manufacturing firms may the fairtrade use if their workers paid a decent salaries, with the public security and environmental standards, allow unions or other forms of association dělnictva, ensuring good accommodation if workers live at home, and do not child or forced labor.
Not everyone fairtrade approved.
Brink Lindsey, chairman of the fat protržního centre for research trade policy of katonově Institute, believes that coffee fairtrade is "well míněná blind alley."
To some extent rightly claim that the real cause of falling prices of coffee was ziskuchtivost multinational corporations, but the big increases in production of coffee in Brazil, and Vietnam, together with the new techniques that enable coffee growing using less labor, and therefore less.
According to lindseyova view, if we want to growers coffee assistance, we should be persuaded to switch from coffee to výnosnějším crops -- and here for obstacles to be eliminated correctly described trade barriers and subsidies rich countries -- or that turned to products of higher value, for example, a species coffee, which brings higher prices.
But what makes a special lindseyově argument is that the campaign for fairtrade coffee can be considered not just for the achievement of what it recommends -- persuasion farmers to a special nature of coffee, which provide them higher prices.
The pro-market economists nothing nenamítají when corporations to promote their products bezostyšně used snobskou attraction.
If they want people pay 48 dollars per pound coffee from jamajských blue mountains, because there is more James Bond, economists nenamítají that pokřivuje market.
So why be critical when consumers decide to pay $12 per pound coffee, of which they know that was vypěstována without toxic chemicals under stinnými trees, which help survive birds, and farmers, have now can afford to feed their children and send them into schools?
Economists may reply that if you want to help someone with nutrition and educate their children, you can for $10 buy coffee without the fairtrade that taste of just, and ušetřené $2 to development agency that ensures food and education for poor children.
This is not possible procedure, but fairtrade has its benefits.
To know that must deliver product that consumers have love, both for his taste, and for the way the growing.
If their product sold well, may be proud of that was something about what is around the world interest.
From the perspective of producers is better to reward for sale of products fairtrade than charitable assignment, which would give even without work and regardless of what makes.
Připlatit for the fairtrade is no more "protitržní" than pay more for the Gucci and this reflects better ethical priorities.
Fair trade is state subsidies.
His success depends on political lobbingu, but to market demand.
In Europe, this market demand is soaring.
One hopes that similar levels of soon achieve its in the developed world, and where people can decide on their freely zvažovaných expenditure.
Pigs calves and America's democracy
In an headlines that control over the United States Congress won in November elections Democrats remain largely gone unheeded one great electoral outcome.
It was on one side obnažil weaknesses of America's political system, but also to restore my faith in soucitnost Ordinary Americans.
If citizens Arizona nashromáždí sufficient number of signatures can on a proposed law to vote in direct všelidovém voting.
One of this year's referenda covered bill that would prohibited mooring or closing pregnant sows or calves kept on meat such a way that animals resists in turn, lie down and completely, he limbs.
People who about the modern industrial agriculture many do not know may ask why is not such legislation necessary.
Agricultural methods that are still 50 years ago generally apply and in some countries are common today, yet indulgence all animals enough space to revolution and stretching their limbs.
In the US today, however, roughly 90% of breeding sows -- mothers pigs kept and zabíjených on pigmeat bacon and ham -- and most of life locked in cages the size of about 0.6 times 2.2 feet.
They can turn lie with held out feet or do more than one step forward or backward.
Other sows are kept on short provazech, they also prevents in rotation.
Also calves, life concluded in individual kójích which allow them to turn lie down, or out limbs.
The purpose of these methods is new jobs -- facilitate handling of animals and allow operation kennels čítajících thousands of or tens of thousands of animals at the lower the number of workers and lower claims for their skills.
In addition, prevents animals squander energy in movement or reciprocal potyčkách.
After protests organisations for the protection of animals, the European Commission several years ago, ordered to their scientific the Commission report on these methods.
The Commission found that animals suffer from the inability to move freely and a full-scale the absence of any charges during the day.
To the same conclusion, of course, I had to achieve common sense.
The EU after a report set a date for which the will stěsnané conditions for these animals prohibited.
Date set for calves, 1 January 2007, is already almost here.
Individual bunkers for female, which are already in Great Britain and Sweden illegal will by 2013 prohibited in the EU.
Gradually are implemented also steps to improve the conditions laying hens, which is normally mačkají in naked wire cages, where they are not enough space to roztáhly wings.
In the US are similar measures at the national level in sight.
When I my European friends in the past asked why the United States in the well-being of the animals so heavily lag behind for Europe, I had to that no answer.
After another, I had to accept and possible explanations that Americans on animals is less important than Europeans.
And then in 2002 to safeguard animals in Florida to všelidovému voting proposal, who would prohibit breeding sows in kójích.
To the surprise of many for this proposal vyslovilo 55% hlasujících.
Also in listopadovém referendum in Arizona voted despite well-paid opposition from agrobyznysu 62% of voters to ban the small cage for sows and calves.
Florida nor Arizona not progressive states -- both gave in 2004 that George W. Bush before John kerrym.
The results so strongly suggests that if we have an opportunity to vote on the farming of banks female and calves in such a tiny cramped conditions all Americans, most they pronounced against.
It seems that Americans depends on the welfare of animals as well as Europeans.
If so, explain the gap between Europe and the US in the conditions for the farm animals, we should focus on the political system.
Europe in charge of voters on the well-being of animals effectively affect deputies of national parliaments, but also members of the European Parliament, the result of which have been national laws and EU Directive to respond to this concern.
By contrast, in the US should similar concern on the members of Congress no apparent effect.
Housing conditions farm animals not regulate at no federal legislation -- and very little legislation state.
According to me, it is given by agrobyznys can nastrkat tens of millions of dollars into the pockets of congressional representatives of trying to re-election.
Movement for animal rights, despite the general public support not yet fail to stand in the political arena lobbismu and subsidies on the campaign.
In America's electoral politics have money worth more than the views of the electorate.
Party discipline is weak and congressmen must most money needed to collect re-election themselves -- and that is, moreover, in the case of the members of the House of Representatives happening every two years.
In Europe, with a strong party discipline and the election campaign nefinancují individual candidates, but parties less money play a role.
In the US, a country which boasts their democratic traditions, pigs are and calves hardly the only who on the line.
What is happening in new the Afghan army?
The assassination of Afghanistan's minister air transport an enraged by the crowd (perhaps members of the Afghan interim administration) shows that the Afghan society continues to be deeply ambivalent.
The first reform of the Afghan army this division of even increase.
Secretary of Defense temporary Hamid Karzai's government has appointed a new Army officers.
Secretary, General Mohammed Fahim, tádžik from northern panjsirského County, won three months ago command of the forces of the Northern Alliance that dobyly Kabul by using America bombers.
This appointment but Karzai's efforts to unification country overall questioned.
Afghanistan is multinational State in which nejpočetnějsí pastuni constitute two-fifths of the total population.
Hazárové and tádžikové constitute another two-fifths of.
Of 30 eight officers, which Minister Fahim povýsil rank in general, is Thirty seven tádžiků and one of the remaining is Uzbek.
If the army was summoned any from 15 to 17 million pastunů found under the command sestávajícím almost exclusively from tádžiků.
Pastunstina being from tádžičtiny lisí as well as to be spanělstina from English and millions of pastunů have přinejlepsím only basic knowledge tádžičtiny.
Geographical profile new Army officers is as close as his ethnic composition.
Thirty-five of eight 30 senior officers comes from the smaller the north of Kabul, from province parwan (in which is bagramské letistě) and from the nearby panjsirského valley, which was for a long time the root of the Northern Alliance.
In other words, from new Army elites country was omitted twenty seven of the total 20 nine Afghan provinces.
As closely orientated group might prevent them concluded handles, if it is composed of representatives of at least 12 political parties of the country.
But this is not the case.
Eighteen from 30 eight generals are members of a single party jamiat - E - Islami, Islamic factions that for a long time led Mullah Burhanuddin and former professor theology rabbání.
It is the party ruled shortly in Kabul in the middle of the 1990s, causing a bloodbath and chaos, which result in most Afghans welcomed the emergence of the Taliban.
Virtually in the same number of as members of the party jamiat are in military command represented the Communists.
Sestnáct from 30 eight generals, after a long time řadilo to side, whose activities in the late 1970s, led to the Soviet invasion between 1979 - 89, who was life two and a half million Afghans.
Most Afghans now on the Communists nahlíží with the same dose of sympathy as have, for example, česi or poles to hitlerovým national socialistům.
It is true that Afghans, as well as other reckoning for entry into the Communist Party nejrůznějsí reasons, and in any case, cannot be said that each of them was hard based ideologem.
But between fahimovými generals is six former party professionals who side served even after the invasion of the Red Army.
All of these six men, and three other Communists, who served as the Afghan army officers, actively cooperated in the 10-year the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
We can imagine how might react, for example, the French, if a quarter of the French army officer's Church after World War II of the person cooperating with the occupation of their country with wehrmachtem.
After Afghanistan, new quickly they promote orally.
If it has been made, afghánstí nationalists (which virtually all Afghans are) soon political background circle around general fahima reveal.
But also the zarážející evidence by the military high command and bias might could be partially vyvrácen if new generals přináseli into national armed forces real enhance the professionalism and commitment to vlasteneckým values.
Unfortunately, only ten of 30 eight povýsených masters of the experience of a professional military officers.
11th serve as a pilot.
By contrast, twenty four of the total number of (professional experience remaining four generals are not known) comes from civil life in which worked in different profesích, for example, as the Communist Party, one of them, has a career mullaha.
What these data for the daily practice mean?
Mean that the masters of international peacekeeping force in Afghanistan, as well as US military and diplomatic officials will meet with Afghanistan's Deputy Secretary of Defense Abdul rásídem dostumem, a notorious savage and corrupt commander, communist who maintain contacts with the old friends of the Red Army continues to serving in Moscow.
This means that the master of Afghanistan's armed forces, as well as a strategic commander and the military intelligence services are also the Communists, people, their orientation is uncertain, persons, which most Afghans confidence in.
This is actually a group that war is divided Afghanistan join together again?
Will these dubious generals gain confidence three-quarters of Afghanistan's population, which was to a armádnímu command made available access?
Or is it rather result bezuzdného approach to government, which (sometimes in the future) to another bloody ethnic reaction those whose legitimate interests were now cynically poslapány?
The United Nations evropstí and American political leaders should consider these questions earlier than with bezohledným recognition of the power of a small and unpopular mensinou come to terms.
Celebrations iracionálna
Three cheers for new Nobel Prize winners in economics, Daniel kahnemanovi Princeton University and vernonu Smith from George Mason University in Virginia.
As was the nobelových prices is, this has not only are recognition of the original work kahnemana and Smith, but also myšlenkových schools, between whose main representative both scientists belongs.
Psychologist Kahneman showed that individuals systematically behave less reasoned than it thinks orthodox economists.
His research not only demonstrates that people often act otherwise than how predict standard economic theory, but also that do so regularly systematically and methods that one can understand and interpret through alternative hypothesis, which compete with assumptions with which they operate orthodox economists.
Most of the market participants -- but also the normal observers - it will not be like nothing převratného.
Brokers of Wall Street, who sell shares of which they knew that for nothing is not this iracionalitu that Kahneman and Smith discover normally exploited and zneužívali.
Mania, which culminated in the "bublinovou" economy was largely was based on the use of investor psychology.
This iracionalita is nothing new, nor for economists.
John Maynard Keynes not long ago on stock markets, he wrote that are not based on racionálních individuals running the disclosure of the fundamental principles of markets, but it is more competition of beauty, in which wins who can best guess what he jury.
This year's Nobel Prize price is like last year's (which I was one of the three laureátů) celebration criticism simplistic market economy.
Loňští laureáti putting emphasis on the fact that different market participants have different (and imperfect) information and that these asymmetries of information is a profound impact on the functioning of the economy.
Loňští rightholders Nobel laureate hinted that markets are effective in general and that in them to play an important role for government.
Invisible hand founder political economics Adam Smith - the idea that free markets are kept the effectiveness as an invisible hand - is invisible at least partly because, there is nothing.
For those who each day work on the markets (and earn of money that use and obcházejí information asymmetry) is neither this no news.
For more than twenty years, economists pay the so-called "patterns racionálních expectations," which implies that all market participants have the same (if not perfect) information and act perfectly reasoned that markets are perfectly effective that there is no unemployment (except when it will cause chtivé unions or government minimum wage) or credit přídělové systems.
That such models prevailed, especially at American universities, despite the evidence on their zkreslenosti is the triumph of ideology of science.
Many of these university graduates today, however, unfortunately, have to worry about politics and the economy in many countries of the world and carried out programs based on the mind, over time called market fundamentalism.
To the right to: models rational expectations are a significant contribution to economic science; the vibrancy of with which to their supporters pouštěli in economic thinking, contributed to reveal weaknesses of starting hypothesis.
Good science is aware of its restrictions, but proroci racionálních expectations skromností usually nepřekypovali.
Vernon Smith is leading figures experimental development economics, so ideas that in the laboratory environment can be tested numerous economic ideas.
One reason is the economy so difficult discipline and why among economists there are so many issues is that economists cannot conduct controlled experiments.
Nature while abound natural experiments, but in most cases as much changing so fast that is often very difficult to determine what incited what.
In principle is that in the laboratory may be conduct controlled experiments and to draw more reliable conclusions.
Critics experimental economics warn that bodies comes into experimental situations ways of thinking, which are affected by the environment outside the experiment, and that trials thus are not clean and conclusions important as in science.
Economic experiments, however, may get into the nature of important processes and phenomena, for example, and help to improve the rules sales.
Importantly, iracionalita market participants, which was subject kahnemanova research, was in the laboratory contexts repeatedly demonstrated.
The zábavnějším results, to which has experimental economy are findings on altruismu and self-interest.
It seems (at least in experimental environment) that experimental bodies are not so selfish as Economists expected - with the exception of a single group, and that the economists.
This is because of economics as scientific discipline more attracted to people who are constitutionally sobečtější, or because it is economics is being formed and makes them sobečtější individuals?
The truth is almost certainly somewhere in the middle.
The question of relative importance of these two hypothesis would likely to further experimental research.
The Nobel laureate both scientists is evidence that it is important to study humans and economy such as, and not what we are to be.
Let's hope to better understanding itself human behavior, will be able to come up with such policies, under which will be better work and economy.
The Bush nečestná energy policy
At one of the surreálnějších meeting this year's World Economic Forum in davosu to experts on oil industry that melting polar ledovcového camp -- which occurs faster than expected -- is not only problem, but also an opportunity: that may lead to make huge reserves of oil.
As these experts to recognize the fact that the United States signed the Convention on the law -- international Convention setting, who have access to oil under the day and the right to further raw materials from the sea -- is the risk of international conflict.
But the same experts point to the upside: oil industry need for never-ending search for other stocks ask Congress for the right zplundrovat Alaska.
President George W. Bush has a mysterious ability to ignore the matter in the broader picture.
With the years is still made it clear that with its energy policy is much wrong.
It is so strong handwriting oil industry that even Bush leaders of one previous Bill said that "forgot any lobbistu."
Bush was touted priority free market, but also too readily gives huge charity power sector, although the country faces the surge of deficits.
In the energy market fails, but government intervention should go exactly the opposite direction than what the Bush administration is proposing.
Given the fact that Americans are full price for air pollution -- in the form of its enormous share the formation of greenhouse gases -- that is the result of their profligate energy consumption, the price of energy podhodnocena, which in maintains excessive consumption.
It is vital that government stimulating conservation, and interventions in the price system -- through taxes on energy -- an effective means to achieve this end.
Instead, Bush supported conservation, a policy of "first vysát America," thereby deepening future America's dependence on foreign oil.
Never mind that he high demand drives oil prices up, which is a godsend for many people in the Middle East, who do not belong between friends America.
Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it seems that the Bush finally waking to the reality of a deepening of American addiction, owing to a sharp rising oil prices are hardly could nevšimnout consequences.
Klopýtavé steps his administration, however, in this case, almost certainly situation in the immediate future only make matters worse.
In the field of conservation Bush refuses to do anything still and its continuing prayers that the US's technology supported the very little money.
What, then, we think of the Bush recently vyhlášeném commitment to reduce to 25 years dependence of the United States in the Middle East oil by 75%?
For investors message is clear: invest more in the development of stocks in the Middle East, which are far from nejlevnějším source of oil in the world.
Without new investments in the development of the Middle East stocks and the bezuzdnému growth energy consumption in the US, China, and elsewhere, however, the demand předběhne offer.
And as if it was not enough, the Bush menace sanctions against Iran to bear the risk of interruption supplies from one of the world's largest producer.
At a time when the world oil production closer to the maximum capacity and prices are already more than double the level of from before the war in Iraq, it herald further hikes prices and further hikes profits oil industry -- a clear winner of the Middle East politics.
Of course, Bush cannot be undoubtedly saved that the existence of the problem finally realized.
A closer look at his proposals, however, as always reveals further eskamotérský trick his administration.
In addition to the refusal to recognize the severity of global warming, encouraging conservation and address enough resources on research that something really changed means Bush's grandiose promise of a reduction of dependence on Middle East oil less than it seems.
From the Middle East, comes only 20% of oil consumed in the US, and so may be his goal only a small shifting demand elsewhere.
Humans also mean that the Bush administration must recognize the mechanisms of global trade with oil.
Even if, America was on the Middle East oil absolutely independent, a reduction in the Middle East oil could have devastating effects on the world prices -- and thus on the American economy.
How the Bush administration has more often than not, for official strategy, there is no gratifying explanation.
Does Bush only policy and trying to pandering to antiarabskému and antiíránskému sentiment in America?
Or is it only another example of incompetence and tumult?
According to what we in the past five years saw contains the right answer probably more than a small amount of nečestnosti and sheer folly.
China's Road Map
China is poised to take their 11 pětiletku and the groundwork for the continuation of the most probably economic transformation in history and also improve the well-being of almost three-quarters of the world's population.
The world has not yet such persistent experienced growth; never occurs so large reduction of poverty.
Part of a recipe for long-term success China is almost a unique combination of pragmatism and vision.
While much of the rest of the developing world, which is governed by the Washington Consensus, was made to donkichotskému efforts to higher GDP, China once again made it clear that it regards sustainable and a fairer increase in real life level.
China recognizes that entered phase of economic growth, which entails environmental huge -- and unsustainable -- claims.
If a change of course, will eventually to the detriment of living standards.
This is why New pětiletka puts much emphasis on the environment.
I many benighted part of China's growing pace that would probouzelo astonishment, if not for the fact that the other part of the country are even more sharply.
Although the process of reduces poverty, inequality is on the rise, given the growing differences between urban and rural areas, and between coastal regions and the mainland.
This year's report on the development of the world issued by the World Bank explains why the US should not only zneklidňovat poverty and inequality and 11 five-year plan to China, the problem in advance.
The government has several years talk about harmoničtější society and just pětiletka describes ambitious programs to achieve this goal.
China also recognizes that what less developed countries away from developed countries, is not only the gap in resources, but also a space of knowledge.
Poor planning is therefore a bold plans not only on the narrowing of this gap, but also to create a base for separate innovation.
China's role in the world and in the world economy is changing, and it also reflects the plan.
Its next growth will have more rely on domestic demand than on exports, which will require an increase in consumption.
Indeed, China has an unusual problem: too much saving.
People set aside in part because of the shortcomings of government programs social security. Strengthen social security (pensions) and public health and education reduced social inequality, strengthens among citizens of the sense of prosperity and also support current consumption.
If these measures successful -- and not yet China almost always over and their own high expectations -- could develop an enormous pressure on the global economic system, whose balance now disrupt the vast America's fiscal and trade imbalances.
If China less saving -- and when, as officials announced implemented diverse policy investment reserves -- who would be financed US trade deficit of two billion dollars a day?
This is subject to another time, but not go a distant again.
With such a vision of the future will challenge its implementation.
China is a large country and without large decentralization could succeed as she had accomplished.
But decentralization has its own problems.
Greenhouse gases, for example, are global problem.
While America says that cannot afford to do anything in this respect, senior Chinese officials, zodpovědněji.
Within months after the adoption of pětiletky were introduced a new ecological taxes on cars, gasoline and timber products: China to deal with their own and global environmental problems to market mechanisms.
The pressures on a local governments, in order to ensure the economic growth and employment, however, is immense.
They will find themselves in worse the temptation to argue that when produced in ways that protects the planet, can neither America, as we it can afford to us?
To his vision of translated in actions, the Chinese government will need strong political programs, such as already established ecological taxes.
As China is closer to the market economy, there are some of the maladies that beset advanced countries: interest groups that for the veils of a market ideology halí calculating arguments.
Some argue economy against the theory of "as of wealth": for the poor are nestarejte, growth will eventually benefit all.
Other will oppose competition policy and stringent laws in relation to the administration firms: whether US its miracles presents Darwinian survival of the strongest.
Will be produced growth arguments in order to kontrovat strong social and environmental policies: higher taxes on gasoline kill our fledgling auto industry.
Such a supposedly growth promotion policy it would not only failed to ensure growth, but would jeopardize the vision of China's future.
There is the only way to avoid: open discussion of economic policies, which is intended to detect deceptive conclusions and open space for creative solutions many fundamental issues that China today faces.
George W. Bush has demonstrated the risk of excessive secrecy and control decision-making on the narrow circle patolízalů.
Most people outside of China not fully doceňuje to what extent, its leaders, in contrast to the Bush, engaged in large considerations and broad consultations (and even with foreigners), in order to deal with special problems that lie ahead.
Market economies are samoregulační.
It is simply cannot be left to autopilotovi, particularly if we want to their benefits widely shared.
The Administration of the market economy, however, is no easy task.
The art maintain balance and should be kept to respond to economic change.
China's 11 pětiletka represents a road map such responses.
The world to monitor with astonishment and hope, because the lives of 1.3 billion people remain transformují.
Democratic lessons from the tocquevilla
It seems to be entirely on the spot because of the Iraq War world 200 years after the birth of alexise de tocquevilla being debated nature of democracy.
Tocqueville law famous for that rejected reaction and nostalgia for our fate as a victory for democracy, but also warned against the hazards which democracy means for freedom.
Should we his fears still share?
Tocqueville democracy was not only for political system, but especially for intellectual regime that generally forms habits of society, making it gives sociologický and psychological dimension.
Democratic regimes, he argued Tocqueville, determine our ideas, desires, and passions.
As there was a Renaissance man, and in the twentieth century Homo sovieticus, "man democratic" is a form of human beings.
According to tocquevilla would systemic effects of democracy citizens can lead to a loss of zdůvodněného thinking.
They could only to pretend that events and values on separately; in fact, only kopírovali gross and simplified views of the many.
What Tocqueville keeping called the "social" power over sentiment is actually in democratic regimes probably the most powerful -- its preview predicts increase in the current demagogie and media handling.
Tocqueville believed that this tendency has no effective long-term limits.
The decline of the critical thinking, which seems to democracy causes, will prevent even local democracy or small companies, or government checks and balances or civil rights.
Schools have the ability to be only a little more than enclaves protected from leptavou power of social pressures affecting the mind.
Similarly, while the Tocqueville assumed that efforts to virtue after the model antických nations or příklon to religious faith may sometimes soul ennoble, both enjoy into conflict with the Democratic hero, if it is in public life officially prescribed.
In this sense, between tocquevillovi ideas heir neomarxističtí theorists include the school and Hannah arendtová, which consistently feared degradation sense in modern societies.
The French philosopher Marcel gauchet even his recent book called democracy alone against him.
Democratic way of life, says the authors, tend to destroy authentic thinking and suppress "high" culture, so the poddává tuctovosti, in which a result of citizens are vulnerable to the enemies of democracy.
But, while are history full bloody regimes opěvovaných zastrašenými and podvedenými masses, greater risk to democratic states is that their citizens to pull the apathy and short-term thinking aimed at gratification momentálních needs.
The past -- despite rituálům, which is trying to moments in history -- remind zahlazována návykem to what is now and what is new.
This okouzlení lapse and allegedly well educated ruling class.
The fundamental problem democratic sentiment is a lack of historical consciousness.
Indeed, blemishes democracy, as Tocqueville claimed mean that the only -- a realistic, but unsustainable -- the way in which we can go, is rezignovaný pessimism?
I do not think so.
There are ways to combat what might be called a "democratic hloupostí" today.
The first defense is to promote educational system, actually forms critical thinking, in particular through (nowadays) zanedbávaných objects: literature, history and philosophy.
If a informed and critical civil base, already democracy requires, our schools are must stop podbízet last fashionable waves and start bystřit analysis of the ability to students.
The greatest obstacle such education are mass media, with their tend to foster plytkost and fun.
Many people now spend more of their lives before television than in school benches.
Passivity, already mass media under is fully the opposite of active involvement, already democratic citizens need.
But it is hard to imagine the mass media (except the good news) of its own volition became a tool of education, which improve critical faculties citizens.
Concern over masmédii is not merely elitářským disdain popular culture.
The question is popularity by itself, after all Mozart was in their time popular and shakespearovy game is loved poor and rich -- but in unwillingness to mass culture question and not provoke.
The result of this failure is universal indifference and passivity its audience.
Globalizovaná media culture, incapable of how inspire the art of critical thinking and waking up the lofty city, it has long been on the rise.
It is a culture that its neglect democratic endangers freedom, because it cannot create the sense of the obligation -- to the company, to history of the Community.
It is too late to do something to do with culture, which umrtvuje soul?
Tocqueville despised elites of their time for their sebeuspokojení in the face of vykořeňující power of grassroots democracy.
Myopia our leaders also serve as a force for his zneklidňujícího prophecy?
Europe for all
Dlouholetí members of the European Union now, it seems, the future of the Union, but we in Ukraine to the European Union look again with hope and admiration.
Join the development of the EU is the main Meta our foreign policy, because Ukraine found that státnost is the ultimate goal, but the start.
European unity is indeed indivisible: if one nation ostracized, not all free.
We Europeans we obepnuti inevitable networks, dressed in the common roucha fate.
The shows every aspect of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering.
Whatever the touches one Europeans directly affect other indirectly.
Never we cannot afford to live with narrow the idea of two evrop, half of the wealthy and half of the poor, those inside and outside those.
No one who live on the European continent, cannot -- indeed -- must be regarded as foreigners in the Union.
Was it depends today's most astonishing Pax Europa and today's pan-European prosperity.
Of course, some people grunt that Ukraine is Europe.
Let arrive in Kiev and speaks with people, young and old, with the factory workers, wives farmers, with lawyers, doctors and teachers, who in the winter perpetually stood for weeks in frost and can not keep it up for to defend their freedom.
Perhaps are committed to those who stood alongside General de Gaulle's in the French Resistance?
Not agree with those who in the 1930s died in battles for Spanish Republic, who in 1956 liberated budapešť and in the 1970s settle with fascism in Spain and Portugal?
It does not provide, the vibrancy of the same spirit as Polish solidarity and peaceful masses, which caused Prague's Velvet Revolution in 1989?
This is true of the European spirit and no doubt it nerozdrtí.
Those who say that Ukraine is for EU membership too zaostalá, say: also come to my country, whether you see mothers, which remain in the work of long into the night, to their children have learned used computer, which have in employment.
Come into the language schools in each village and in any city where young people are bracing for Europe and learns French, German, English.
Those who question European inheritance Ukraine should understand that Europe is the question of technical equipment and superdálnic; it is neuhasitelnou desire for freedom and prosperity and solidarity.
I believe that our future is as graduation, as past Europe's great, and that our fate is not be zapomenutou border troubled region, but the originator and budovatelem European peace and European unity.
Self-determination has not isolation, as a national independence currently does not mean more than a return to the world scene with new Statute.
New States may with their former occupiers create productive relations, as well as to build France and Germany -- the relationship based on equality and oboustranných interests.
This is a relationship of what my government sought with Russia, and its successful creating is what can contribute to the extension of the zone of European peace.
Of course, it is too early to do more than just to express great respect, with which we view the prospect of EU membership.
We know that our share of the great building a overnight.
We know that the great results of European unification they do not rest in the documents and deklaracích, but in the planned novátorském doing so that zlepšovalo lives and ensure the safety of all Europeans.
Build Ukraine value of EU membership will not be easy, cheap or rapid.
Created, however, will and succeeds, as the Union.
We realize that it is a huge task, but the resulting pay for this effort is and Europe should know that this is the our goal.
Part of efforts to revive the Ukraine is creative battle for the end of the scary century, in which the for dominance tore fascism and communism, the ideology zrozené at the heart of Europe.
A few months ago our children and their parents in towns across Ukraine faced Armed soldiers vrčícím dogs, and even death.
Before only a few years ago was nájemnými murderers former regime torture and sťat young žurnalista heorhij Gongadze, who tried to the public information on corruption regime.
Our Orange Revolution of this winter shows that Ukraine's people won.
So, despite today's doubts and difficulties in Europe keeping permanent confidence.
Do not take much as the ultimate response to uncertainties and terror of Ukraine's history.
Do not accept the notion that Ukraine is so tragic tied to bezhvězdnou midnight Communist heritage that can never see the dawn of peace and a European unity.
When the EU citizens intend to above the Ukraine in Europe, should they took a closer look at face, already sees, while look deeper for this face.
Should look beyond only on vypleněnou wasteland inherited after communism and on poverty and social divisions, through which the overthrow of former leaders to extend their devastating governance.
Instead, they should face to face our president Viktor Yushchenko, broken one during the last year's presidential election campaign action, and recall the words of the French brilliant andrého malrauxe for that "best faces are those that have been poraněny."
Muslim civil war
Is today a schism between Sunnis and Shia in the Middle East deeper than hostility between Israel and the Arabs?
Given the reaction of some Arab governments to Hezbollah's decision to attack Israel would do you might think.
Although Israeli bombs spread to the city Beirut and tyre, Saudi Arabia, perhaps nejkonzervativnější Arab Muslim state, openly doomed the Shiite Hezbollah, which he launched a conflict with Israel.
Never in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict was that the state, which is regarded as leader of Arab Muslim nations, so openly boosted Israel.
Saúdskoarabská split with Hezbollah is often a one-time affair.
Also Egypt and Jordan directly doomed Hezbollah and its leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah's boasts for avanturismus.
What lies behind this stunning developments events?
We see fundamentálního shift in relations between the Arab nationalism, and Islamic sektářstvím?
The government of Saudi Arabia znepokojenější Sunni and Shiite zděšenější Islam in more than in what is genuinely committed to encouraging Arab unity, and the Palestinian cause?
Odsuzování Hezbollah Arabs suggests that sectarian schism Muslims who are already felt on a daily violence in Iraq is in the Middle East widening and magnifies the.
The desire to US President George W. Bush's break stalled society of the Arab world was meant, so that the modernizing forces oppose the traditional elements in the Arab and Islamic society.
Instead, it seems that Bush out of the chain atavistic forces in the region.
The opening of this pandořiny cabinets began with a new and perhaps even a nastier era zevšeobecňujícího violence, which probably not even qualify, other than as a "Muslim civil war."
The conflict between the Shia, Sunnis, there is no longer from the dawn of Islam, but I ethnic geographical isolation nearabského Shiite Iran, together with the rule of Sunni Arabs over Shiite minorities in other countries majority maintain this rivalry at reasonable limits.
This tensions further ochabla in influx of "islamizace" by Iranian revolution, because sectarian identity Sunni Arab was immediately after zatlačena further into the background, instead, with a general "Islamic" asertivita.
All of this changed in September 2001, when al-Qaeda, Sunni terrorist force that strongly draws from Saudi wahhábistické ideology, taken attacks on the United States.
On the march suddenly gave specifically Sunni militantního form of Islam.
When the United States triggered a war as the Sunni the Taliban in Afghanistan, so the Sunni Iraqi regime, gave it this new radical Sunni odnoži even greater steady.
Sunni Arabs in the region, who found new self-confidence perceive Israel and the West as a mere one threat, while the second is the so-called "Shiite sinking" -- srpkovitý belt mainland ran from Lebanon across Syria and Iraq to Iran and obývaný allegedly kacířskými Shi 'a.
Saudi rulers as opatrovníci nejsvětějších places Muslim faith in Mecca and medině feel this threat perhaps nejostřeji.
Viewed sunnitskýma eyes Shia not only control on oil rich areas of Iran, Iraq and Eastern Saudi Arabia, but attempting to -- through actions Hezbollah -- uzurpovat the role of "protector of" the dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cause.
Saudi Arabia's Kingdom has turned its back to Hezbollah because the Saudi royal family derives its legitimacy from strict forms of Islam's Sunni and Shiite doubts loajalitě its population.
Ironically it is the United States, longtime protector of Saudi Arabia, which enabled the strengthening of the Shi 'ites that toppled Saddam Hussein and brought Shiite parties in Iraq to power.
It seems that the Bush administration recognizes what she had; while Shiite arc to the East Arab Muslim world recorded the rise, the US tries to strengthen their protection of the Sunni arc -- Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia in the western part of the region.
Israel, this druhdy nesmiřitelný enemy Arab things as would now in this defense structure engaged.
Such a defensive status, however, must be given panarabskému sentiment inevitably unstable.
Today are ordinary Saudis přilepeni to television obrazovkám with broadcasts station Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite network and watch events in Gaza and southern Lebanon.
They see as prolévána Arab (not Shi 'ite) blood and armed resistance puts only Hezbollah.
In their eyes so became Hezbollah hrdinným example of resistance.
In the Saudi state as a result, deepening schism between Sunni and Shi 'a.
After official conviction Hezbollah invited Saudi Arabia's Kingdom its official wahhábistické spiritual that went fatwu condemning members of Hezbollah as the Shi 'ite devianty and kacíře.
Similar conviction, however, may only vyostřit sectarian schism in Saudi Arabia and throughout the region.
Can the Sunni regimes as this antagonism to believe that need their own Hezbollah, which would fought in their corner ring?
If such conclusion do, it may look for a long time, because many similar fighters has already been vycvičeno -- Al káidou.
Georgia at the heart of Europe
Era, when Europe can rely on America with the wars in assuring peace and creating democracy in its own outside, is behind us.
Given the enlargement of the European Union this outside, as has shown a recent crisis around of Russian gas, currently includes not only Ukraine, but Georgia.
Georgia, like Ukraine, through examination of democracy, have Europe cannot afford to ignore.
Georgia was the first postsovětskou countries, which took place its "color revolutions" and it demonstrated by its, with dignity and superiority that its people his choice of democracy and European values.
The flag of the European Union, which since třepotají on all Georgian public buildings, indicate natural sympathy, as old as the history of the country that was for the ancient Greeks an integral part of the then known of the world.
Prométheus, médeia Amazon, and in neighboring Armenia noemova Ark -- the beginnings of a Europe of our myths are there.
For its history, culture, and tradition -- including critical, an independent, indeed, defiant spirit within the former Soviet Union -- would seemed Georgia is an ideal candidate for democratization.
So it is the worrying that democratization troskotá.
Everything seemed to start with a fairly promising.
With encountered resistance, the political reforms, privatization, anti-corruption norms, efforts to find new leaders immaculate concessions to a system or its pro-European foreign policy.
Between leaders who, arguing that represent the will of the majority, appropriate more and more power, but again a totalitarian approaches.
Georgia's political elite, like starořecké hydře constantly dying and again is born.
These same people and methods of governance, whose potření "Rose Revolution" of November 2003 usilovala, again found in the outbreak of power, through their personal connections that extend beyond the Georgian boundaries, and its obrovitého wealth and gently vycizelovaného art political plots and handling.
It does not much in common with the nature of democracy, which is based not only on the voting urnách, but also in the distribution of power.
Government interfered with a matter of Parliament, which was to intervene in deciding government -- in my case, for example, to nominations velvyslanců and their daily working obligations.
Finally, the most serious is that the judiciary is not yet independent, which undermines the rule of law, and therefore scare desperately needed private investment.
The Georgian democracy now dominate head, but not yet body: people continue to spurn policy as immoral dirt, so field přenechávají those who have long should go into retirement.
But doufání in democracy remains strong entrenched in Georgia's people, civil organizations, even in the media.
It is time for Europe is taken care that this hope nevyhasne.
The US is already in Georgia since independence did for the support of political stability, what can only.
Of course, during governance eduarda ševarnadzeho, former foreign minister of the Soviet Union, which we as its president expelled, the stability not always appealed with democracy.
But the Americans generous invested in the survival of the democratic ideas and leaders.
Although the Foundation supported financier George sorosem pink revolution nevykonstruovala, they claim Russian nationalists, not the conditions that democracy requires kept, stimulating is and help them.
If, however, help consolidate Georgian democracy, the country now needs the support of different nature, to which the is better equipped with Europe.
Models balance of power, the functioning of the judiciary and local democracy must be inspire a European model, which are Georgian reality closer Anglo Saxon models of American type.
The rejection of the challenge by Europe would be treachery all its elementary obligations in place -- a small, středozemském, flexibilním, with long Historical traditions -- where democracy much greater chance of success than in Ukraine, which is how much and still sovětsky smýšlející of Central Asia not to mention.
Indeed, the failure to support the Georgian democracy that struggle with nepřízní would most likely to odročilo democratic progress in Ukraine, Belarus, and in the Russia.
This raises the stakes clearly.
Russia, while never nevzdalo its imperial dreams and instruments dominance is, however, began to smiřovat with the inevitability of democracy, at least for its.
Váhavé acceptance of some normality in relations with its neighbors, however, it was always vulnerable to a sudden explosion, irrational Russian "děržavy" -- aggressive ethos that glorifies the state and pursue his strength vrháním to weakness.
Here is the key to understanding of the recent Russian gas crisis.
Equally clear is that each mark diversion from democracy in Georgia and other postsovětských States will only on power neo-imperial ambitions Russia.
It is a European responsibility to convince Russia that return to the past is hopelessly impossible.
Europe must take their jobs, not only to the future to ensure the independence of energy supply, but also to show that European values freedom, democracy and justice between nations have real power.
To succeed, Europe must be equipped with the tools needed: a big poloveřejnou foundations for the promotion of Europe, and to promote the political reform, University, where the vyškolí future leaders of the emerging democracy, the police and military judges and judicial officials, already breathe life into models that we want to follow.
Europe needs in particular beliefs.
If today, Europe cannot convince itself that has a fundamental interest in the future of their neighbors, who will in Europe believe tomorrow?
