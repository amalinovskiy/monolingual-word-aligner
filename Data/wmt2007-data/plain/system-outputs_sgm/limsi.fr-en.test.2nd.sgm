<seg id=1> Our Charter of Fundamental Rights is the first that path this millennium.</seg>
<seg id=2> We must organise ourselves in fifteen Member States, to be able to welcome in the countries which are knocking at our door.</seg>
<seg id=3> The area of services of general interest, social, cultural and charitable must be included in Article 87, so that these important institutions can enjoy a sustainable protection.</seg>
<seg id=4> Some are of the opinion that we can create an internal market in Europe without agreeing on common values and fundamental principles.</seg>
<seg id=5> I would like to pay tribute to the substantial and strong intervention of President Prodi.</seg>
<seg id=6> You know that this is a deliberate choice that has been made in Amsterdam, to make a clear distinction between the two functions. The High Representative, unlike the Commission, is not independent, but it has to coordinate the common foreign and security policies which are the responsibility of the Member States and perhaps we should leave room to the intergovernmental approach.</seg>
<seg id=7> It was hoped that the presidency outlines in Nice the way for the future.</seg>
<seg id=8> We can in fact want more and better, but I believe that this is a good start.</seg>
<seg id=9> I therefore hope that the Nice European Council will adopt it this project and decide to start specifically as a project and not as a fait accompli, after having clearly adopted the necessary reforms.</seg>
<seg id=10> However, I have also made it clear that in the current situation, we could achieve the objectives of great importance for the Community approach, such as, for example, more effective action in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg id=11> It is only by linking Russia to the West and the European Union that we can have an influence on its policy and maintain contact and dialogue with it.</seg>
<seg id=12> Motion for a resolution (B5-0767 / 2000) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=13> At the moment, it is continuing this genocide and attempts to destroy the freedom of the press and the rule of law that exist only in that country.</seg>
<seg id=14> To try to meet the expectations of the pensioner, who is Giuseppe Italia, lives in Cremona, and seeks to surf the river Po, I voted in favour of the Piecyk report on the development of seaports, inland ports and intermodal nodes.</seg>
<seg id=15> The outcome of the vote in this House not to achieve the objective of the directive, which is accepted and approved by all the speakers and the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=16> Mr President, I voted in favour of the Skinner report, as I said during the debate, before the vote, because I believe that the capital is important.</seg>
<seg id=17> My party colleague Armonie Bordes pointed out yesterday in the harsh words that only a minority is taking advantage of the commitment of Community funds and of contributions to the pension fund for the entrepreneurial risk.</seg>
<seg id=18> Consequently, the Charter will be more to use the existing practices, including backward-looking, the Member States and represent progress.</seg>
<seg id=19> Mr President, we finally have a Charter of Fundamental Rights of European citizens an article, Article 25, is dedicated to the elderly.</seg>
<seg id=20> This text may be painless as a first step, since it takes up the existing rights, but if it was incorporated in the Treaty with binding force, as the European Parliament demands, it would, in time, harmonisation of national laws in Europe; it would be disproportionate to the Court of Justice; it would promote a centralisation around the European institutions; this would limit the scope for independent decision-making of each nation.</seg>
<seg id=21> · must not be overloading the Charter with detailed rules and leave them to the secondary legislation.</seg>
<seg id=22> I shall vote for another charter in Biarritz, participating in the demonstrations on 13 and 14 October, and in Nice on 7 December 2000.</seg>
<seg id=23> Progress of the 12 candidate countries</seg>
<seg id=24> I believe that a number of Member States have not yet grasped the existence of this link to date and have not understood that a hesitant progress of the Intergovernmental Conference could put enormous difficulties in order to impose enlargement within the time limits necessary.</seg>
<seg id=25> We will not be implemented, in the long term, everything I have mentioned so far that if the political world and the elite of the candidate countries and of the European Union - and, in this respect, I agree with you, Commissioner, are finally aware that the enlargement of the European Union will benefit to it.</seg>
<seg id=26> That is the formula adopted.</seg>
<seg id=27> Let me turn to the second direction that the presidency wishes to move during this term of the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=28> What I would therefore propose is to work in this direction with the idea that we will have to examine, in the context of 2003, what are the candidates who are ready to join us on that date.</seg>
<seg id=29> I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his clear and comprehensive report.</seg>
<seg id=30> The purpose of the negotiations is not "whether": it is a question of 'how' and 'when'.</seg>
<seg id=31> But they have also made since the prospect of accession to the European Union they expect the solidarity of the European peoples and it offers them a solid political and economic support.</seg>
<seg id=32> A number of countries have so far advanced in relation to the second economic criterion - competitiveness on the internal market - that they are looming.</seg>
<seg id=33> We are therefore seeking closer coordination with the programmes of national governments, Parliament and the other institutions.</seg>
<seg id=34> Every year, and we will soon again - on 8 November - all the candidate countries are waiting impatiently for the judgment that calls the Commission on their progress.</seg>
<seg id=35> We have opted with reason for the principle of differentiation, according to which each candidate country is assessed on its own merits.</seg>
<seg id=36> This debate is a further opportunity for my group to confirm that the accession of the Central and Eastern European States, but also of Cyprus and Malta – is the best guarantee of the future for all of us in Europe, in the East and in the West.</seg>
<seg id=37> The task, which is essential, has not yet been huge interest on the part of the public.</seg>
<seg id=38> People plaisantent on enlargement which, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, must always intervene in five years.</seg>
<seg id=39> The next opportunity any natural, it will be the European elections in 2009, but we want to make efforts to more countries to join in 2004.</seg>
<seg id=40> In addition, six other fundamental issues which concern us because of the methodology.</seg>
<seg id=41> In fact, it is the very model of European integration in which we have engouffrés, I would like to say the simultaneous integration of all sectors of activity regardless of the traditions and the specific characteristics of each other, which has become a trap again.</seg>
<seg id=42> The expression of this feeling virtually widespread in Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the 1980s we are all bound up till now.</seg>
<seg id=43> But let us be clear: there cannot be membership of the rebate.</seg>
<seg id=44> There is a powerful idea which is also a good idea: that we will not do the enlargements against the opinions and that the best way to make enlargement with the opinions through their participation in elections, since the elections are an expression of democracy and the method of support to the political system.</seg>
<seg id=45> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like briefly to speak about the conditions which makes it possible for the scenario that several speakers have wished.</seg>
<seg id=46> You should not forget that these people are of interest.</seg>
<seg id=47> However, I have already pointed out that all countries approchaient relatively quickly from this point.</seg>
<seg id=48> This means that we have already decided the liberalisation of trade in the field of agricultural products without the Poles fear that they result in the collapse of their agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=49> There is tension, but overall, peace and trade have established between the citizens closer relations, which are further reinforced by monetary union.</seg>
<seg id=50> This must be the outcome of the negotiations that are important.</seg>
<seg id=51> The only amendment which has been tabled for the moment is already covered by this report, but I am delighted that the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance wishes to stress the need for equal treatment of all citizens.</seg>
<seg id=52> This does not simply involve a law in the area of public service but also to open up the possibility of appropriate remuneration for young officials.</seg>
<seg id=53> The same applies to Latvia as the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=54> The return of litas to the euro is expected during the second half of 2001.</seg>
<seg id=55> Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am the rapporteur, is the greatest and most important, but, as we know, also the most problematic of the countries who are preparing to join the European Union. To tell the truth, there are so many problems that it intends to raise the effect its exclusion from the first group of countries which will be joining us.</seg>
<seg id=56> We have too many unkept promises to Poland, to the east, the formerly Communist countries.</seg>
<seg id=57> It is a point which is regularly when it comes to the Czech Republic, which is the Roma problem.</seg>
<seg id=58> Slovakia is not condemned to remain in the second group and it is logical that it wants to join the Union at the same time as the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id=59> Finally, I would like to allow me a final comment on internal policy.</seg>
<seg id=60> Thirdly, with regard to agriculture, whose level of productivity is lower than that of the European Union, we must open up completely the agricultural market to finance the privatisation of land, the modernisation of farms and structures for the approval and an improvement in return.</seg>
<seg id=61> Bulgaria is pressured to join the European Union and NATO.</seg>
<seg id=62> As for the extreme poverty, a problem which affects Romania since 1990, finally, there are real signs of economic progress under the present government.</seg>
<seg id=63> I hope that these issues become a priority for the new parliament which will enter into office by 15 days and the new government.</seg>
<seg id=64> But we also stress that the final solution, fair and sustainable must fully respect both the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, which is nothing more than the current international law, and the principles governing the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=65> Malta has also stable democratic institutions and functional.</seg>
<seg id=66> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we want to make our contribution to this debate.</seg>
<seg id=67> We need to apply them. The European Community law is not just a list of laws: it must also be a law applied in the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=68> This change poses difficult challenges to the citizens of the candidate countries but also provides, at the same time, their future and that of their children.</seg>
<seg id=69> I agree with the previous speaker: we must pay particular attention to the border regions.</seg>
<seg id=70> In this respect, the Commission must not be left to account!</seg>
<seg id=71> The candidate countries want to start quickly on the path of economic growth, even if it should be at the expense of the protection of nature defined.</seg>
<seg id=72> On the one hand and the other, we have bad habits, most linked to health.</seg>
<seg id=73> - (ES) Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and unified European continent.</seg>
<seg id=74> The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, also competent in the field of transport and trans-European networks, are aware that it is necessary to coordinate the various sectorial Community policies in favour of an overall regional planning policy.</seg>
<seg id=75> I would, however, once again on the fact that the transport infrastructure are of the utmost importance to the success of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=76> Mr President, I agree with you when you say that the forthcoming enlargement is the main task of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=77> The traditional social values the former planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe have been severely shaken.</seg>
<seg id=78> The PPE Group do not wish to absolve the candidate countries the responsibility of the pace of progress of the accession process: we cannot say no date.</seg>
<seg id=79> The second point is the designation of dates.</seg>
<seg id=80> There is another reason.</seg>
<seg id=81> Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the various countries and for the whole of the EU depend - the example of Denmark is for us to show this - the elimination of social and democratic deficits of European policy.</seg>
<seg id=82> Populism is the term shameful that the technocrats give to the popular will when it is in a way that does not suit them.</seg>
<seg id=83> Ladies and gentlemen, it is now the pause and the dinner, we shall resume at 9 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=84> We will, even if this happens in the longer term, a single currency for the whole of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=85> These issues cause internal battles in each of the countries.</seg>
<seg id=86> We call them to fight for a different Europe, that of all peoples, free from all of these inhumane characteristics, where the people will be masters of their fate, develop relations amongst themselves of peace, freedom and fraternity, mutually beneficial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=87> I am publicly the praise for their work and, in particular, the work carried out by Romanian Challenge Appeal, the headquarters of which lies in Birmingham, as well as the work of other organizations in Ireland supported by a number of people whose Daniel O Donnel Irish, the artist, which has promised 1 million pounds he has gathered in Ireland and other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id=88> The Nizza Summit must establish whether and how the EU can, for its part, be ready in time for this enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=89> The Poles are wondering whether they will benefit even when they have joined or whether they will become a country of second class.</seg>
<seg id=90> However, I am convinced that with the good will and with the help of the European Union, will be found a solution that will enable the two communities to live harmoniously and prosper, as they have done for centuries.</seg>
<seg id=91> We are also concerned about the problem of minorities because the issue of the integration of these minorities, including their linguistic integration, is also important in these countries.</seg>
<seg id=92> The condition for membership of the Union is basically to fulfil the basic criteria, the so-called Copenhagen criteria.</seg>
<seg id=93> The benefits of enlargement have been mentioned, and this is one of the subjects on which Lithuania can teach us something.</seg>
<seg id=94> Imagine that they are all like this.</seg>
<seg id=95> Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs, but I would particularly like to limit my remarks to Slovakia, and especially to the policy towards minorities.</seg>
<seg id=96> I therefore invite you at the forthcoming meeting in Nizza to set a target date to which you are planning to conclude the negotiations with the most successful candidate countries on the path to accession, not to mention my name.</seg>
<seg id=97> The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its efforts to join the European Union and, of course, ensure that the planning of this aid is even more decentralised.</seg>
<seg id=98> The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of civil society, the government and Parliament plays an important part of this and - as we note - positive.</seg>
<seg id=99> We are currently bringing an end to the division of Europe into two blocs and not to create a new division.</seg>
<seg id=100> All these elements contained in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne whom I warmly thank on behalf of our group.</seg>
<seg id=101> In this respect, I believe that the issue of Cyprus is par excellence, that on which will be judged the ability of Europe to do its political face.</seg>
<seg id=102> I myself live near the Baltic Sea, a sea which is an ecological problem.</seg>
<seg id=103> The political vision remains.</seg>
<seg id=104> For example, it was very good to hear that Mr Hänsch, who spoke on behalf of the PSE Group, hoped that the Commission should undertake a real evaluation of the consequences of enlargement, as well as an economic impact in the event that enlargement would never happen.</seg>
<seg id=105> However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, that the establishment of transitional periods is essential in the interests of both parties and, as a Member of a border region and, as Mrs Schierhuber, the owner of a firm is situated close to the Czech border, I would like to ensure that the creation of common economic areas close to be controlled without major problems and provide positive results on both sides.</seg>
<seg id=106> As a Social Democrat, I would like to emphasise three points.</seg>
<seg id=107> The EEA which includes the first pillar gives businesses the applicant countries access to the internal market and young people and scientists the right to participate in the exchange programmes, but on the other hand, does not oblige the EU to extend its system of agricultural aid to these countries.</seg>
<seg id=108> Secondly, we must say 'no' big bang, but the concept that we recognise, at the same time, a large group of countries, because it would be in contradiction with the principle of the admission of each country according to its merits.</seg>
<seg id=109> Thirdly, we must ensure, by 2003, to prepare the European Union for the enlargement process in the direction of the wonderful speech by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.</seg>
<seg id=110> In this respect, I should like to address the relationship between Parliament and the Council in highlighting the fact that there are huge delays as regards the answers to written questions.</seg>
<seg id=111> It is worrying that occurs in a country which is going to join the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=112> I therefore request that the matter be referred back to the Committee on Legal Affairs so that it can prepare for this.</seg>
<seg id=113> Mr President, we are debating today, and perhaps vote on three reports in total dealing with this subject, two of my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=114> All the players in the food production chain should benefit.</seg>
<seg id=115> Safety will cost money to all those involved in the food production chain.</seg>
<seg id=116> We must therefore follow Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and adopt the principle of not dilution in order to secure animal feed and genuinely protect European consumers.</seg>
<seg id=117> The 1999 directive has been thought and it can already boast a success because taxes have been reduced in a sensitive manner.</seg>
<seg id=118> However, allow purely and simply the dilution is not a solution.</seg>
<seg id=119> Very quickly, we must insist on Amendment No 37 on dioxin.</seg>
<seg id=120> On this point we agree.</seg>
<seg id=121> For example, it would mean that we, European consumers, we shall continue to buy on the world market meat and milk and derivatives of these products from animal feed which has no link with the minimum and maximum limits set by the European Union and by a system of production of feedingstuffs who buy raw materials on the international markets, free to mix up any principle and, before introducing their products on the territory of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=122> We have, for the second reading, the Commission 's views on how to proceed with the assessment of the risk.</seg>
<seg id=123> On the other hand, it would be wrong, for example, to adopt Amendments Nos 39 and 40, because it would be to remove the possibility for Member States to intervene promptly against the dangers that we would come to recognise.</seg>
<seg id=124> Consumer protection is already on the basis of the animal feed ingredients of feedingstuffs, Declaration, and lastly, the official controls.</seg>
<seg id=125> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our colleague Mrs Paulsen on undesirable substances in animal nutrition is an important issue and, like all the important issues, it is highly controversial.</seg>
<seg id=126> Mr President, the debate on this excellent report by Mrs Paulsen has been, on certain points, emotionally very busy, and now that this debate is closed, I believe that we must assume that the requirements laid down in the animal feed sector are strict, but we can then ensure that the quality is changing by mixtures.</seg>
<seg id=127> Taken in isolation, together, these three proposals are designed to fill the considerable gaps which have been highlighted by the dioxin crisis.</seg>
<seg id=128> Amendment No 33 removes the possibility of re-exporting batches of which do not conform to the country of origin.</seg>
<seg id=129> Nor can I accept Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which seek to reinstate the possibility of watering down, under certain conditions, raw materials intended for the manufacture of feedingstuffs which are contaminated.</seg>
<seg id=130> They should be sufficient, given the commitment we have made to establish, within the framework of the new proposal on the food authority, an early warning system covering all products and the food chain.</seg>
<seg id=131> Commissioner Byrne, behind this directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs, is basically a problem we have for a long time, namely the question of the open declaration.</seg>
<seg id=132> And for this reason alone, I have already learnt something.</seg>
<seg id=133> Because if we put this measure quickly and if we were quickly the codecision procedure, it would certainly be an appreciable gain, and I am convinced that, with the Council, we shall be strong and united.</seg>
<seg id=134> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it may be that, in the future, of contaminated raw materials can also play a part in the composition of feedingstuffs - in any case, this is not ruled out.</seg>
<seg id=135> The BSE scandal is the worst example known.</seg>
<seg id=136> The common sense - our rapporteur says - and this is, of course, to have a label to open declaration, which gives the list of ingredients.</seg>
<seg id=137> I believe that the technical expertise, as well as the judgment of the members of the Committee on Agriculture there is no doubt in the field of agriculture and feed, in order to find a solution geared to the practical and enforceable which must be applied and understood by farmers and consumers.</seg>
<seg id=138> So much for the good points.</seg>
<seg id=139> It is, in my opinion, a legitimate right to information that we need to fulfil.</seg>
<seg id=140> Madam President, I would ask you, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, to send a message of condolence from Parliament to the families of the victims and the local authorities of both Brittany and Marín – a town in Galicia, which the majority of victims.</seg>
<seg id=141> (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=142> Are any Members opposed the tabling of this oral amendment?</seg>
<seg id=143> It is good that the rapporteur has explained to us.</seg>
<seg id=144> Most of the technical proposals deserve to be supported with vehemence, for example, on food safety, the dismantling of nuclear power stations in the first generation, the protection of the environment, the fight against social dumping, the necessary code of conduct for companies in the West when they work towards the east, etc. It is a huge task, and also a top priority.</seg>
<seg id=145> At the same time, the difficulties to be overcome are still considerable, especially in budgetary terms.</seg>
<seg id=146> The enlargement to 13 countries change not only the geopolitical framework of the European Union, but it is also changing the structure, since at the time the total population will increase (+ 28%), but also the number of disadvantaged regions ".</seg>
<seg id=147> In this respect, it must take account of the fact that in the candidate countries, a competitive agriculture and food sector, will be of decisive importance to the success of the process of transformation and restructuring, because of its high social and economic weight.</seg>
<seg id=148> In this respect, I would like to see the outermost regions, including 6 on 7 still remain amongst the 10 poorest of the EU, have the Structural Funds, on the sole criterion of GDP, but also on the geographical, demographic and mainly social indicators.</seg>
<seg id=149> Because we reject in the interests of French people, we cannot in all conscience approve its extension to countries and peoples of Eastern Europe, barely freed from the communist dictatorship and who cannot know in what they want to get totalitarian technocratic and trap.</seg>
<seg id=150> We would have had to limit ourselves at most a resolution short but intense as regards the reports on the countries.</seg>
<seg id=151> The current system, consisting of aid, subsidies and quotas must be replaced by free trade and adapting to the market.</seg>
<seg id=152> The importance and scale of the problems that enlargement raises are not compatible with the double language of them within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=153> In my view, enlargement does not mean penalising membership or not of some countries to Europe.</seg>
<seg id=154> Our neighbour has tried resolutely during the past decade to fulfil the criteria of accession.</seg>
<seg id=155> Latvia has its place in this House, not only because, overall, give it right to this' pledge of confidence 'necessary in order to complete such negotiations, but above all, and above all, because it is at home in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=156> I believe that the countries which have applied for membership, Poland is the State that deserves our support, our commitment, because, without the very important initiatives for Poland, the fall of communism would not have taken place, and we will not be here today discussing this problem.</seg>
<seg id=157> This may not be too obvious to the Polish people who is still largely euro-sceptique.</seg>
<seg id=158> I would urge Prague to take this, this invitation, this request for dialogue, to follow them up, and to ensure that, together with this House, these relics of a nationalist age can be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=159> I welcome the Wiersma report on the request for Slovakia to join the European Union and I agree with most of the conclusions the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=160> On this occasion, I have great pleasure to send a special salvation for the elderly and pensioners of the Republic of Bulgaria.</seg>
<seg id=161> I therefore see no reason why Romania will not be admitted to the European Union, if it continues to make progress at the same pace and again that the Union will the necessary adjustments to its institutional structure and its policies to cope with enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=162> Whatever solution is on the settlers, and God knows that the problem is difficult, such as the return of land on both sides, the report is too hard not to earn a reserve.</seg>
<seg id=163> Unfortunately, some of the comments of the draft report on the request for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, drawn up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, are not helpful in this regard.</seg>
<seg id=164> This task will not be easy, given the lack of goodwill on the part of the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=165> Stenzel report (A5-0243 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=166> It is, I was indeed a victim of food poisoning, even though it was, in the European Parliament, unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id=167> For these reasons, I voted in favour of the ban on dilution which is proposed by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=168> We must, in this resolution, urge the ASEM countries to put pressure on the Burmese military regime to restore democracy in the country.</seg>
<seg id=169> We are bias in our approach and our way of doing things.</seg>
<seg id=170> This is not the time to be hesitant.</seg>
<seg id=171> I would like to mention a number of important points of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=172> The equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=173> That is why we need legislation against discrimination.</seg>
<seg id=174> We are thus now with a large number of technical amendments designed to guarantee legal equally protected against discrimination on the basis of race, on the one hand, and discrimination on the grounds of religion, disability, age and sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id=175> It was necessary to make an effort to balance, moderation and good legal technique and his report reflects - in my opinion - all of these qualities.</seg>
<seg id=176> In addition, they are of the opinion that the cases of discrimination are not enough of them to justify a directive.</seg>
<seg id=177> The action programme before us does not provide sufficient resources to replace the relevant work of the fifth framework programme - which, I hope, will be guaranteed in the other framework programmes - and we must therefore ensure complementarity.</seg>
<seg id=178> Everyone agrees that we must fight against discrimination, but there is a difference of opinion when it comes to how, to what extent and with what resources.</seg>
<seg id=179> I have had the opportunity, in committee, to protest against the fact that the experts can be also outside NGOs and, however, have something to say.</seg>
<seg id=180> We are also very satisfied with the provisions of the directive stipulates that equality of treatment for people with disabilities also means that companies are supposed to make adjustments in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=181> Only in this way can we succeed in effectively combating discrimination in all areas of social life in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=182> After all, as we teach the major democracies anglo-saxonnes, racism and discrimination are fighting for liberal democracy, and not by the restriction and the gradual erosion of economic freedoms, freedom of opinion, expression and association.</seg>
<seg id=183> For example, we have a proposal which homosexuality sacrement as a marriage.</seg>
<seg id=184> We are thus strengthening the position of the European Union on specific situations experienced by its nationals in connection with discrimination and equal treatment.</seg>
<seg id=185> I should also like to come back to the question of the derogation.</seg>
<seg id=186> My attention has been drawn to the interpretation of the explanatory statement in relation to Article 1, which once again may seem a little obscure, except that it makes the distinction between sexual orientation and behaviour.</seg>
<seg id=187> As what discrimination is hiérarchisent.</seg>
<seg id=188> In Nouvelle-Calédonie we give a preference on the basis of chromatique skin.</seg>
<seg id=189> These guidelines of the directive, added to the fact that recently adopted Directive 2000, demonstrate the obvious desire of the European Union to guarantee an open society, free from categories predetermined and, above all, the scourge of racism which has deep roots in the history of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=190> Those who come here and say that Europe must not adopt a directive setting out the values that we all want to defend is mistaken.</seg>
<seg id=191> Do not touch the acquis hard-won.</seg>
<seg id=192> Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the media should also play an important role in this task.</seg>
<seg id=193> Experience has shown that the promotion of legislative measures to combat discrimination is essential, but it is not enough.</seg>
<seg id=194> We must avoid confusion paperassières, which will reduce Europe to a purely materialistic entity, politically correct, but useless.</seg>
<seg id=195> I think that this Parliament has given too much legislation, after all 'reluctant', that the European Commission had wanted to propose.</seg>
<seg id=196> I should like to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, for their reports quite remarkable.</seg>
<seg id=197> I also accept the amendments you have tabled in order to highlight the importance of the prevention of discrimination and to combat them.</seg>
<seg id=198> The second category is designed to clarify the text of the Commission's proposal and the third is a large number of amendments whose aim is to try to put this proposal into line with the directive on discrimination based on race adopted last June.</seg>
<seg id=199> In particular, Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 propose deleting the reference to the discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id=200> I cannot accept the references that you made, in Amendments Nos 21 and 45, persons and companies and the unofficial groupings, because this proposal on employment applies only to individuals.</seg>
<seg id=201> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.</seg>
<seg id=202> You cannot expect the public support for peacekeeping operations if your troops are threatened with death by weapons which we ourselves have provided.</seg>
<seg id=203> For example, in my country, I should like a licence to own a shotgun, but not to settle as broker at the back of my garden.</seg>
<seg id=204> Another important point: the export ban, to promote and marketing of equipment and knowledge used for torture.</seg>
<seg id=205> Having said that, I would naturally like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Titley, for his excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=206> We must extend our considerations, on the one hand, the questions of constraint, but also the means other than those designed for military purposes itself: disarmament and conversion, the strengthening of the action of the police and customs authorities and, secondly, to the candidate countries, as Mr Wiersma has just mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=207> The control of the financial system makes it increasingly difficult circumvention of the rules governing arms trade.</seg>
<seg id=208> The annual report aims to identify such potential improvements.</seg>
<seg id=209> The European Union is to complete the project beyond its expiry date, which will take place in November of this year.</seg>
<seg id=210> A methodology and indicators have been defined and will be presented at the forthcoming Research Council.</seg>
<seg id=211> Thank you, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=212> With regard to the problems of SMEs, of course, we have ensured that, in the framework programme, small and medium-sized businesses, as provided for in the budget decision.</seg>
<seg id=213> That is what the budget discussions in Greece, and it must also say that those who put forward the views of the European Union are many. Is that true?</seg>
<seg id=214> As regards multidisciplinarity, I share your feelings.</seg>
<seg id=215> The first is the EU's participation in the national programmes, he mentioned specifically in his statement.</seg>
<seg id=216> We can therefore talk of a European Research Area, if we are, we, as responsible only 5% of this research.</seg>
<seg id=217> Thank you, Mr Busquin.</seg>
<seg id=218> On the one hand, following the efforts made to fully commit appropriations at the end of 1999, the applications pending at the beginning of this financial year for the financing of new projects were necessarily very low.</seg>
<seg id=219> But I would repeat that things have been well made by Portugal for the previous period.</seg>
<seg id=220> Question No 2 by (H-0730 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=221> Finally, the excise duties on mineral oils at a high level does not lead to a breach of Community regulations in the field of competition.</seg>
<seg id=222> Secondly, as Mr MacCormick knows, when the Member States promote an industrial sector by means of fiscal measures, we break the rules on state aid, tax state aid equivalent to subsidies.</seg>
<seg id=223> Nuclear energy, for example, is a very clear example.</seg>
<seg id=224> Subject: Specific minority languages budgetary appropriations of the European Union budget for minority languages which exist since 1983, has gradually increased until 1995, the year in which they have been the highest (4 million).</seg>
<seg id=225> Mr President, our colleagues in the House will know that very important resources are available in the Structural Funds - and this is new - for cultural activities, because with my colleague, Michel Barnier, we have given the importance of the fact that the Structural Funds invest not only in roads or airports but also in human beings.</seg>
<seg id=226> The Commission will therefore not new financial commitments next year.</seg>
<seg id=227> As regards the concrete proposals for funding, it is impossible for me to comment, because we must respect the normal procedure.</seg>
<seg id=228> I thought to a number of possibilities.</seg>
<seg id=229> It is therefore necessary that something should be done in this area, as it is of millions of small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=230> Its regulation couvre-t-elle the requirements of hunting, for example the impetus, as well as the processing of meat destined for personal consumption?</seg>
<seg id=231> If we were to apply this regulation to the meat that consumes oneself, it would be a disaster for the hunters initiatives bureaucratic.</seg>
<seg id=232> I intend, after the conclusion of this report, to put forward proposals to improve the transport of animals and to tackle the problem of the unsatisfactory application of the restrictions of travel times.</seg>
<seg id=233> We have already discussed this issue during my meeting with the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance.</seg>
<seg id=234> Our question was clear: what are the measures taken by the Commission?</seg>
<seg id=235> The general product safety also obliges producers to inform consumers of the risks.</seg>
<seg id=236> The case of Maryam Ayubi is extremely worrying.</seg>
<seg id=237> Question No 14 by (H-0745 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=238> The attitude of the EU with regard to this ministerial meeting in Vientiane, and even the question of its presence or the level at which the EU should be represented, will depend on developments in Burma by December.</seg>
<seg id=239> One last point.</seg>
<seg id=240> Elections are an important step in the participation of the Kosovars to the management of their own communities.</seg>
<seg id=241> I can even tell you that the outcome of these elections was more democratic, more organised than some of our countries, which I found myself, as a participant, is an observer.</seg>
<seg id=242> However, we consider that it was a beginning and not on the outcome of the process.</seg>
<seg id=243> It calls for a more effective control of the arms trade and for greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id=244> I now see that the number of contracts on armaments and their components is increasing every year.</seg>
<seg id=245> We cannot take concrete decisions on the basis of information fictitious, fictitious realities.</seg>
<seg id=246> The arrangement, which was to keep them together within the same DG should be reconsidered.</seg>
<seg id=247> If these institutions must be able to appoint an internal auditor, it will be enough to impose minimum requirements in terms of auditing the Financial Controller.</seg>
<seg id=248> The Commissioner is aware, this proposal does not unanimity in this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=249> We therefore have no objection to an independent internal audit service, which we are currently giving the green light through the report by our colleague Mr van Hulten.</seg>
<seg id=250> Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by expressing my congratulations to the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=251> We are of the opinion that the modernisation of the administration is necessary and urgent.</seg>
<seg id=252> An independent contre-vérification is vital in order to avoid mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=253> Money must be spent in a way better targeted and effective in the future, of course, we must be better able to ensure that the funds are actually spent for the purposes for which they have been affected by the competent authorities in budgetary matters.</seg>
<seg id=254> With regard to the amendments, I would like to briefly make the following comment: the Commission welcomes this additional recital.</seg>
<seg id=255> I therefore thank you for your proposals and your deliberations.</seg>
<seg id=256> I would like to summarise the proposals of this report, which seem to me to be the most important and operational, more specifically: firstly, the creation of a group of experts, comprising leading figures appointed by the Member States, which must help to define minimum standards of protection of minors in the media; secondly, the creation of a code of self-regulation by all operators in the sector; thirdly, the opportunity to encourage and to make available the filtering systems by both the television that via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id=257> I cannot, unfortunately, support the demands of the Liberals.</seg>
<seg id=258> This is largely a matter for the legislative competence of the Member States and must remain so, but not, however, an agreement to seek a consensus on some reference values by way of dialogue with all the parties involved at European level.</seg>
<seg id=259> The fact remains that it is, in my view, parents to ensure that their children disregard this kind of programme.</seg>
<seg id=260> Parents have a particular need to provide assistance in this area, which must include: the specific parameters for the protection of minors in the field of media that can be applied in the area of the European Union as a whole, the establishment and availability at an affordable price of filters, legal provisions relating to the protection of minors and the commitment of the responsibility of the media, i.e. broadcasting companies and companies producing programmes be they public or private.</seg>
<seg id=261> So when I hear in the debates in committee, some people say that there is no evidence of the detrimental effects of violence in all its forms, to the TV, on children, I am surprised and I use a euphemism.</seg>
<seg id=262> With regard to the introduction of a code of self-regulation, it is to say, particularly in technical terms, that in some Member States broadcasters have already introduced codes of regulation for the television, which must enable parents to switch off the lights.</seg>
<seg id=263> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=264> In particular, my report replaces the international norm valid giving the decisions to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=265> It would be a minimum to make this area of freedom which is a fundamental right of every European citizen.</seg>
<seg id=266> Some payments due in 1996, Mr President, have still not been made.</seg>
<seg id=267> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani for their work.</seg>
<seg id=268> I commend this report to the House and the amendments tabled by Mr Evans.</seg>
<seg id=269> Our human resources are our only future in a world where knowledge is the most valuable.</seg>
<seg id=270> It is not with the green papers, white, black or red solve the problems that we, but with concrete actions.</seg>
<seg id=271> But the European Parliament, and it is in its role, Parliament has exerted pressure to ensure that researchers are nonetheless included in the text.</seg>
<seg id=272> Today, you are paying a visit to a crucial moment for the future of European integration.</seg>
<seg id=273> But we know that the process is incomplete and that this incomplétude threatens its vitality.</seg>
<seg id=274> The debate, which each country helps with its own sensitivity, its traditions, culture is the instrument to be defined, and clarified.</seg>
<seg id=275> Long live the European Parliament, long live the European Union!</seg>
<seg id=276> We must ensure that women benefit jobs indirectly, while avoiding a repetition of the same inequalities in the more traditional sectors: less skilled jobs, part-time sometimes not chosen, on fixed-term contracts and the difficulties of access to decision-making positions.</seg>
<seg id=277> The Council will discuss a proposal of indicators for measuring progress in the area.</seg>
<seg id=278> Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar dedicated to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality by gender mainstreaming and specific guidelines.</seg>
<seg id=279> I am thinking especially of the violence suffered by them, one of the priorities of my government action, and I know that this subject you also particularly mobilises.</seg>
<seg id=280> We know that the measures of the reconciliation of professional and family life are particularly women, although we still need to carry out studies on the current situation of the family and the role that women plays, which is no longer the traditional role given that society has changed significantly, just as the family structure.</seg>
<seg id=281> Some people, including Members of this House, sometimes seem convinced that the opposite is true, but it is a mistake.</seg>
<seg id=282> I would like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that equality begins at home.</seg>
<seg id=283> I find this embarrassing position and ambiguous, and it seems to me that discussion in the projects that you are proposing to us, because it is not sure that we will be able to achieve in practice through all this.</seg>
<seg id=284> In this area, there is no equality.</seg>
<seg id=285> The image of the European women, as we discovered over the pages of our report, our problems with framework directives, Danish women in their majority not in the euro.</seg>
<seg id=286> I think it is significant that the report is the establishment of a digital balance between men and women in all sectors of society, on the labour market, for example.</seg>
<seg id=287> It is precisely for this reason that the report has missed a major opportunity disguising completely marriage and the family.</seg>
<seg id=288> That is something which the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities should also take into account.</seg>
<seg id=289> We have heard that the previous presidency was first restructured then dismantled the Ministry of Equal Opportunities.</seg>
<seg id=290> The average salaries of women continue to be lower on average 28%, compared to those of men, which contributes to the fact that women represent the majority of the poor people and which makes it difficult their participation in social and political life.</seg>
<seg id=291> This is a result quite remarkable.</seg>
<seg id=292> We are witnessing a impoverishment of female women everywhere in Europe, in France, where 15% of them live when even with less 3.650 per month.</seg>
<seg id=293> All countries have not followed this example, I hope that the example of France will be followed by other countries.</seg>
<seg id=294> The history of women is, of course, very long.</seg>
<seg id=295> We must help the candidate countries to reach the level of the acquis communautaire.</seg>
<seg id=296> But, on this point, I would like your support.</seg>
<seg id=297> This is not the case, even if it is a good text. After be reflection, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has chosen, after a long debate, not to present any amendments.</seg>
<seg id=298> The Committee on Legal Affairs, after a long debate, felt that it was not reasonable that legal uncertainty is six years and that three years ago, the deadline, was a more appropriate in that it is possible to determine, with adequate resources and an average speed, whether or not there have been irregularities in a statement.</seg>
<seg id=299> This is Amendment No 15 relating to fraud.</seg>
<seg id=300> The aim of achieving a communication simplified but also qualitatively, as well as sufficient flexibility of the basic regulation by improving the recovery procedure and adapting the provisions in the field of customs, responds to one of the many demands of the single market, and this objective is achieved here, as many countries have advised to be able to participate in international trade.</seg>
<seg id=301> It would like to thank Parliament and in particular the committee chaired by Mrs de Palacio for the efforts and the interest made - by Parliament and the committee - within the framework of this dossier.</seg>
<seg id=302> Welcome</seg>
<seg id=303> I hope that this does not change the meaning of the vote which will be expressed, but we really must check the translation of the French version.</seg>
<seg id=304> Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report.</seg>
<seg id=305> It is recognised that knowledge of foreign languages is a prerequisite for mobility.</seg>
<seg id=306> We also believe that the Member States must be able to decide for themselves, to a large extent, taxes that they wish to impose.</seg>
<seg id=307> I am a little sorry that we have no chance of a majority in relation to the need to formulate an expiry date for the storage of documents.</seg>
<seg id=308> During the negotiations of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we were pleased with the inclusion of Article 13 concerning discrimination based on sex, race or ethnic origin, religion or belief not sectarian, disability, age and sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id=309> My final point concerns the budget for this programme, or 98,4 million, which is obviously insufficient in terms of the actions envisaged.</seg>
<seg id=310> It is explicitly for reasons of Amendment No provided for in the directive to intervene in the field of regulations relating to the age applied in the Member States, regulations, which are quite justified, for reasons of genetic psychology and have no impact on working life.</seg>
<seg id=311> I also think that we could dispense with everything that has been written in the new Article 12 has).</seg>
<seg id=312> With regard to the personal convictions, religion / EPLP welcomes the principle of protection proposed in this area.</seg>
<seg id=313> The Christian Democrats believe, on the whole, I welcome the proposal for a directive on the establishment of a general framework on non-discrimination in working life.</seg>
<seg id=314> This, however, is revealing that occupation in staff of an internal audit service and not of the importance and, therefore, of the usefulness of such a service.</seg>
<seg id=315> The EU has decided to develop joint military powers in order to achieve the objectives of the so-called Petersberg tasks (combating crises and search for solutions to conflicts outside the territory of the EU), but it has no common defence policy.</seg>
<seg id=316> - (NL) Without weapons, the world would be much safer.</seg>
<seg id=317> The resolution does not reduce the arms sales to promote a policy of disarmament, but only to regulate them in order to guarantee the profits of industrial groups.</seg>
<seg id=318> The Commission's communication recognises the problem but does not propose concrete measures, because it is in the logic of the liberalisation of the market and competition, and the proposals that it can do not concern the substance of a harsh reality - especially for children - the unaccountability enjoyed by the multinationals, which, in their quest for profit, nor any of the impact of their programmes and their products and transfer full responsibility for parents, inviting them to apply to new products to protect their children.</seg>
<seg id=319> Like the rapporteur, I believe that the measures to protect young people from violent and harmful programmes should not be limited to traditional television, but apply to the whole of the media.</seg>
<seg id=320> With an average of three hours per day, it is the most important human activity after the sleep, and for adults, work.</seg>
<seg id=321> Furthermore, women are often 'flexible' posts; temporary contracts or low wages are typical of the sectors in the majority of women.</seg>
<seg id=322> To be the first victims of the reduction of public spending, privatisations in the health sector - for the right of access to care and treatment, not to mention the right to programmes of prevention and information.</seg>
<seg id=323> B5-0792 / 2000, by Mr Marset Campos and Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, on the crisis situation in Peru.</seg>
<seg id=324> Mr President, I would have liked to have a debate on Latin America is not only on the basis of one or other topical problem, but rather in the context of a discussion well prepared in the committees.</seg>
<seg id=325> We must ensure that Peru reach the objective it has set itself with candidates which are equal to the challenge and who are able to accept the view of the Peruvian people, namely a renewal and substantial democracy.</seg>
<seg id=326> The joint debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=327> However, we know that Afghanistan is not far away, that Afghanistan is the largest producer of opiacées, and therefore we know, and we can imagine the role that these mafias policies, not just policies, in the expansion of the drugs trade.</seg>
<seg id=328> It calls on the Commission to take stock of humanitarian aid to the Afghan people, so that no one is forgotten in the territory.</seg>
<seg id=329> The suffering caused in this conflict is terrible.</seg>
<seg id=330> A budget line has programmes for mine clearance and prevention for years.</seg>
<seg id=331> Let me respond to the warnings of Mrs Paciotti by saying that I shall of course ask the Commission today to know what happened and what will happen with the resources allocated to demining.</seg>
<seg id=332> (B5-0794 / 2000 by Mr Medina Ortega, Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the abduction in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit in the negotiations with the guerrilla movement.</seg>
<seg id=333> We would all like to do not have to talk about Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=334> The Commission has already proposed to coordinate the measures of such a package. The Commission is already in the next few days to find considerable resources to this end.</seg>
<seg id=335> So, again, double standards, and I believe that it is to be regretted.</seg>
<seg id=336> This attitude on the part of the Albanian opposition party deliberately to reject a solution needed to solve a problem of Albania in Macedonia is totally incomprehensible to me.</seg>
<seg id=337> I think the Macedonians have done a magnificent achievement in managing to resolve them the internal questions.</seg>
<seg id=338> That is why I also believe that this reconciliation. However, the government, which has very courageously found a solution to the question of universities and many other problems, needs visible signs of success and a strong support, otherwise the peace threatened in the region as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=339> The PHARE funds available for the year 2000 within the framework of the national programme can also be used to support at university in the next academic year 2001-2002.</seg>
<seg id=340> I should like to point out that all of us today, Greek MEPs, we now have reacted to this situation.</seg>
<seg id=341> And all this, for Greece, which is the first rank in the European Union for the sector of the Merchant Navy, is in fact about the safety of shipping in all its aspects in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=342> In recent years, many other people have died at sea, not just as a result of the sinking of ferries, but, so far too frequently in our fishing communities.</seg>
<seg id=343> On the contrary, the innocent victims are used to promote broader objectives of shipowners.</seg>
<seg id=344> We must realise that this is also about the credibility of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=345> To conclude, I would like to stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the issue of the European legislation on safety of ships used for the carriage of passengers must be given the highest priority within the European Union and that the important thing is to ensure that these legal provisions are applied throughout the Community in a strict and uniform.</seg>
<seg id=346> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have arrived a little late for reasons that you are familiar, in order to make a brief statement on the two subjects which are on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade and in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=347> Commissioner Verheugen is going to speak, as did Mr Solana, on the two issues that we meet this afternoon, namely the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg id=348> We must be prepared to keep this promise, as soon as the will of the people has been respected.</seg>
<seg id=349> Madam President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, is that I am taking part in this debate, because I did not wish to that our Parliament is just as a judge to apportion blame on this or that, at a time when, after the hopes raised so strong here just a month ago, we are faced with the tragic consequences of this new outburst of violence in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=350> Madam President, my speech today is based not only on various analyses of developments, but also on the experience that I have personally experienced last week, as I was incidentally in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip when the unrest broke out.</seg>
<seg id=351> Even if we are opposed to any violence, it is not possible to equate Israeli violence and Palestinian violence.</seg>
<seg id=352> I would ask the House at this critical moment to make a statement of support for the courageous people who have, today, the defence of freedom in the streets of Belgrade, reiterating the support that we have given, we, as Europeans, it is not so long ago, to those who fought for their freedom in other cities.</seg>
<seg id=353> The Europeans, Madam President, would no doubt be well advised to seize the ball which has been made here by the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council.</seg>
<seg id=354> The status of Jerusalem is a difficult point in the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=355> For years, thanks to his propaganda machine and the pressure that he was exercising on the media, he has managed to mislead the inhabitants of his country, but unfortunately also a large number of people in the West, to present them a false picture of the reality.</seg>
<seg id=356> While this tragedy is coming to an end, this Parliament has a duty, as a symbol of a free and united Europe, to support the crowd outside the Yugoslav parliament and to help Mr Kosturica to fulfil its mandate.</seg>
<seg id=357> It is precisely this attitude as the basis on which we fear the worst – and illustrates the words that I have entered a few hours ago.</seg>
<seg id=358> I wonder if the Commissioner already provides for steps to show that we regard Kostunica as the representative of the Serbian people and legally elected as a partner with which the European Union must now address.</seg>
<seg id=359> The European Parliament wishes to express its full solidarity at this historic moment when the tyranny is upset and triumph democracy.</seg>
<seg id=360> The next item is the report (A5-0237 / 2000) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2000 / 24 / EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to cover loans for projects in Croatia (COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000 / 0122 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=361> We must welcome the new political path which is open in this country after the presidential and legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id=362> Between the Union and Croatia, there is an advisory working party whose objective is to make available to Croatia its competence and its technical assistance in the negotiations agreements governing mutual relations.</seg>
<seg id=363> Let us not forget that Croatia symbolised recently the failure of a privatisation programme which only a few have benefited.</seg>
<seg id=364> The contribution which we are debating, in the form of a loan of EUR 250 Millions of the EIB for the period 2000 to 2007 cannot therefore be a milestone but must be a help stimulating.</seg>
<seg id=365> It is not entirely true to talk about democratisation in this report.</seg>
<seg id=366> When, a century ago, Croatia and Slovakia have become independent for the first time, they were satellites of the Hitler regime.</seg>
<seg id=367> We cannot, of course, separate the question of guarantees and that of Croatia, nor of the debate yesterday evening, or the developments that have taken place in Belgrade.</seg>
<seg id=368> At a time when it appears that Milosevic has fled and that the will of the Serbian people has prevailed, and we hope that the establishment of normal relations and partnership between Serbia and our Union of democracies will be shortly.</seg>
<seg id=369> I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 6 October 2000.</seg>
<seg id=370> (The House rose and observed a minute's silence)</seg>
<seg id=371> My question is as follows: speaking on behalf of the European Parliament on this Statute?</seg>
<seg id=372> I would ask you, Madam President, to do everything in your power to speed up the process underway in the Committee on Petitions on a document presented by more than thirty collective social and NGOs in order to protest against this flagrant violation of Community legislation on radiation protection.</seg>
<seg id=373> The post-mortem carried out in Georgia has shown that it is clearly a murder after probable torture.</seg>
<seg id=374> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the opportunity to take a major step towards your dream - which is not, moreover, my own.</seg>
<seg id=375> This is the basic regulation on the basis of all the other regulations on GM crops.</seg>
<seg id=376> It is clearly in the main, one after the other.</seg>
<seg id=377> (The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.50 p.m. and)</seg>
<seg id=378> The next item is the report (A5-0291 / 2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council [COM (2000) 379 - C5-0508 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 (COS)], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the new social agenda.</seg>
<seg id=379> The right to underline the importance of this open coordination method does not mean that this method should replace social legislation, because we need to establish, in Europe too, social rights, we must have the courage to define the minimum social and social legislation which is necessary in the context of a European internal market.</seg>
<seg id=380> In our opinion, we also support dialogue and cooperation with civil society, especially women's organisations in the countries who are preparing their integration into the European family, because we need to achieve a uniform development that will follow the stages and the motives of the rest of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=381> The areas of action referred to in the communication of the Commission have also been the subject of a general agreement.</seg>
<seg id=382> I would remind you, at this stage of my speech, the holding of a European seminar in Biarritz on this subject on 4 and 5 December, seminar which I will chair.</seg>
<seg id=383> With regard to the fight against exclusion, we have made great progress in defining, on 17 October, Employment and Social Policy Council, the right goals of the fight against poverty and social exclusion, which will serve as the basis of national plans of action.</seg>
<seg id=384> I have heard some people who have read the report say that they agree with the diagnosis but not with the solution proposed.</seg>
<seg id=385> Technological development and new methods of organisation legitimise a flexible, placing more emphasis on the objectives and achieving results, and attaching less importance to the rigid regulations.</seg>
<seg id=386> It is on this side that we should seek, in our opinion, the obsoleteness reproached those who do not wait for the brave new world of a market without hindrance.</seg>
<seg id=387> This has certainly contributed to reducing the social unrest in our country and to encourage investment programmes of foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id=388> However, the method used seems more questionable.</seg>
<seg id=389> If we are talking about a charter of rights and if we are in favour of the drafting of a European constitution, we cannot be achieved one-sided view, and we must say that we must take all the necessary steps in this direction, even if it calls for more detailed legislation.</seg>
<seg id=390> I would like to point out critically the lack of initiatives on the new requirements relating to the protection of labour, consultation of workers and the reports of work.</seg>
<seg id=391> Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Minister, Mrs Péry, for the presentation of the social agenda.</seg>
<seg id=392> These points, we know, are opposed by the Conservatives in Europe. We are, with our group, especially attached.</seg>
<seg id=393> The third question of content is enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=394> The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=395> We should complement the measures of the Commission by a review of the individual possibilities of access to health care, social security and the pension system, the shortcomings of the organisation of work, and perhaps also by a general reduction of working hours.</seg>
<seg id=396> For example, women will feel Europe close to them, and Europe will benefit the interesting and innovative ideas which will take shape through the report with this programme.</seg>
<seg id=397> We therefore await an annual report of the President of the Commission in the context of an annual report to the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=398> I am very glad that we envisage a better organisation of childminders in order to facilitate the balance between work and family life.</seg>
<seg id=399> My group will take this into account in the final vote.</seg>
<seg id=400> (The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=401> I find the new approach of the Commission very positive, and the proposal for a decision on the programme for the period 2001-2005, very well thought-out.</seg>
<seg id=402> I believe that the large number of amendments which are accepted testifies to the community spirit which exists between the Commission and the Committee on Women's Rights.</seg>
<seg id=403> Firstly, because I have received, during the past year, many requests on the part of companies, who feel a little powerless in relation to the decisions of merger they must take, particularly in cases where they have had to appeal against the decision of the Commission before the Court of First Instance.</seg>
<seg id=404> I would also like to ask Commissioner Monti when we can expect the publication of a public register effective and valid on state aid as well as the picture, long-awaited and results.</seg>
<seg id=405> I should also like to point out to Commissioner Monti that it is important that, in the next report, a section more important is being devoted to the financial services sector.</seg>
<seg id=406> What I have just said is not valid only for the energy sector, but in other areas in general.</seg>
<seg id=407> Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the good work done in the two reports, which make a judgment flattering on your work and that of the Directorate-General for Competition.</seg>
<seg id=408> I stress this because the market cannot regulate everything and that, in this sense, there is and cannot be competition without limits.</seg>
<seg id=409> Mr President, today, nobody is questioning, and I am not going to do so, the fact that state aid to distort the conditions of competition and constitute a harmful element which companies to be more efficient.</seg>
<seg id=410> The hearing and deny the fact that the State aid has decreased over the period 1994-1998, while the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction, was already very strange.</seg>
<seg id=411> Today, we must not, of course, Mr President, to ignore the past, although in my opinion refers to the XXIXe Commission report on competition policy, and we must learn the lessons for the future.</seg>
<seg id=412> During the speaking time available to me, I would like to mention, Mr President, the following three points: the modernisation of Community competition law, the activities carried out in 1999 in the application of the rules of competition and the subject of state aid.</seg>
<seg id=413> The Commission has continued to intervene decisively in particular with the cartels and the abuse of a dominant position, as in the field of conciliations.</seg>
<seg id=414> Mr Rapkay, it has been extremely important for the Commission to have the support of the European Parliament for the continuation of its competition policy, and I do not have the impression that this support can be watered down.</seg>
<seg id=415> This mechanism can be activated at the request of a Member State or under the terms of Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which remains in force during the third phase of economic and monetary union for the Member States which are the subject of a derogation, currently Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.</seg>
<seg id=416> Using the capital market should remain the only option in the future.</seg>
<seg id=417> I am therefore expressing the hope that this report will receive the approval of this House in its present version, and the internal market also applies to the sector from the vine to.</seg>
<seg id=418> Today, revision is necessary in view of the changes in the regulation of plant protection products and the scientific and technical progress, spoken in the increase in vitro.</seg>
<seg id=419> I also believe that the reference to the precautionary principle, the possibility of genetic modification means, for example, the reduction of the intensive use of plant protection treatments.</seg>
<seg id=420> To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, in order to comply with the precautionary principle, in its spirit as in his letter, if, by accident, the articles and amendments that I have just mentioned were not withdrawn, we should, as demanded in the wine growers, that we were to follow the opinion of Mrs Isler Béguin, and therefore of the Committee on the Environment, and vote.</seg>
<seg id=421> Mr President, if you will allow me, Commissioner, can you give your opinion on the amendment of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is Amendment No 1.</seg>
<seg id=422> The only point on which we can discuss, is whether or not I would have to take note as soon as the French Government has sent me the decree ending the mandate of Mr Le Pen.</seg>
<seg id=423> I would remind you that the vote took place at 12 p.m earlier.</seg>
<seg id=424> In the area of Justice and Home Affairs, I am optimistic on a solution for the civil judicial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=425> The preparatory group will play its full part until 19 November, the date of the next meeting at ministerial level.</seg>
<seg id=426> We needed this climate tonique, as has been said by Mr Moscovici, and I too felt, at the level of Heads of State and Government, a feeling very serious historic and collective responsibility at an historic moment for European integration.</seg>
<seg id=427> We must simply, ladies and gentlemen, from now on, in these matters of qualified majority, we do not find it below the spirit or the climate in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg id=428> The smaller countries of the European Union are not the subject of the greatest!</seg>
<seg id=429> I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify this point.</seg>
<seg id=430> On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica is an historic event.</seg>
<seg id=431> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, if progress has been made on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting, the disagreements remain on the composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, you pointed out.</seg>
<seg id=432> It seems to me that we are going in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id=433> Those who refuse closer cooperation enjoy the same freedom of movement that passengers of the back seat of a car.</seg>
<seg id=434> I am not here, more than you, to interfere in the internal affairs in Germany, but I believe that this position is deeply coherent and is also in accordance with the wishes of the Commission, if I am not mistaken.</seg>
<seg id=435> We have started to exchange on this issue, making it clear that all Member States want to keep this ceiling after enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=436> I believe that this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id=437> The first: sometimes we have had the impression that in Biarritz, there was an obsession of the debate between small and large states.</seg>
<seg id=438> From this point of view, I believe that it is not enough to say that the Community method must be safeguarded.</seg>
<seg id=439> Even if the applicant countries accede to the Union, each Member State must retain a Commissioner 'junior' or 'Senior'.</seg>
<seg id=440> The wording of Article 93 is all the more tragic that once the first wave of enlargement, we will be even more successful in the impossibility of moving towards a qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=441> This is, in fact, to convince the citizens of these countries of the obvious merits of any new European Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=442> That would have been unaware of the importance of such a crisis to imagine that the fears maintained for generations could be established without new upsets in the run-up to the final peace, reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id=443> I am also concerned about the response weakened Parliament's request for democratisation.</seg>
<seg id=444> However, the blame lies with those who wish to involve large-scale reforms before enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=445> On the one hand, the decision by the Head of the Israeli Government to freeze the peace negotiations because of the violence which prevails in the region and to focus its efforts on the creation of a government of concentration with the opposition leader, Mr Sharon.</seg>
<seg id=446> It is with great satisfaction that we have learned the victory by the people of Yugoslavia and the election of its chairman, Mr Kostuníca.</seg>
<seg id=447> I would like to ask Mr Barón Crespo to ask Italian colleagues to explain why they are in government in Italy with a party which is Communist and are preparing to face the parliamentary elections with another party openly partito per the communist rifondazione Comunista.</seg>
<seg id=448> Progress is necessary in this field within the codecision procedure.</seg>
<seg id=449> The Commission is better able to provide the necessary impetus in the future by the possibility that it has to vote by simple majority.</seg>
<seg id=450> The European Union does not need today to visionaries who watch until 2030, but people can identify the problems that will make enlargement within three to eight years to come and which can find solutions to these problems.</seg>
<seg id=451> It is therefore an open work which has not fallen from above and which has not been imposed.</seg>
<seg id=452> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=453> Without this fundamental reference is, at best, the worst is entre-tue.</seg>
<seg id=454> Democracy is better in Europe, but the European democracy, it is ill.</seg>
<seg id=455> Today, 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, the European Parliament said something very simple and says: the European Constitution, yes, you can, yes, we want.</seg>
<seg id=456> This is why the idea that the island is in itself a sufficient criterion.</seg>
<seg id=457> I would like to go to the essential, concentrating on the salient points of the report by Mr Gil-Robles, which I will simply say that I find it very good.</seg>
<seg id=458> First of all, the simplification and clarification of the Treaties.</seg>
<seg id=459> I do not want to go further, because we are not here - in any case I am not here - to discuss the report by the Institute in Florence.</seg>
<seg id=460> According to the information - I shall be technical, pardonnez-le-moi - which have been given to the Presidency, it seems that a clear majority of the language versions, unlike the Italian version, is referring, for the implementation of the cohesion policy, the least favoured islands and not the islands in general.</seg>
<seg id=461> Mr Duhamel, you will doubtless agree with me that if there is no success in Nice, there will be no place, at least no credibility, for a debate on the future of European integration, at least in the current framework.</seg>
<seg id=462> It is also vital that this European constitution should be clearly defined in the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union. The dynamics of European integration should be included to cover the areas in which it is imperative that we act jointly, for example in relation to foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=463> They could also be needed to overcome the persistent blockages.</seg>
<seg id=464> We need more transparency in the distribution of competences and the affirmation of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=465> Everyone knows that there are extremely different views on this subject in the various Member States and within the various social groups.</seg>
<seg id=466> Unfortunately, the final objective of a European Constitution would be exactly the opposite and, of course, we cannot approve it.</seg>
<seg id=467> In the European house, in fact, there are people sitting on the table, possibly military monetary, fiscal and then the other people who will be in hand.</seg>
<seg id=468> It is clear that the second version is not the correct and that, firstly, because the regions are economically delayed in any case covered by the Structural Funds and, secondly, if this interpretation was valid, there would have had no reason to adopt the Declaration No. 30</seg>
<seg id=469> Mr President, I am going to focus my poor small sixty seconds on the report of Mr Olivier Duhamel, who is a good report, because it would make it clear, and the compliments of our rapporteur has definitely convinced earlier.</seg>
<seg id=470> In my opinion, the unity of Europe can only be political.</seg>
<seg id=471> It seems to us that the new Constitution should be ready to enter into force for the next European elections.</seg>
<seg id=472> Consequently, the word 'least developed' applies both to the island regions, regions and, if we follow the proposal by Mr Barnier, it is here to amend the Italian version of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention.</seg>
<seg id=473> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=474> As the honourable Member has said that it would vote against, the amendment is therefore rejected.</seg>
<seg id=475> Mr President, the amendment which is requested would lead us straight into chaos.</seg>
<seg id=476> I welcome the adoption of the Trakatellis report by this House because it provides for the setting of standards of high quality and safety for blood and blood derivatives.</seg>
<seg id=477> If European parliamentary immunity is autonomous, the French authorities should take hold of the waiver of Mr Le Pen.</seg>
<seg id=478> I am particularly disappointed at the vote of the European Parliament on the report on the proliferation of vine plants.</seg>
<seg id=479> Some consider that alcohol, tobacco and drugs, is a product which can cause great damage to those who consume and others, on the contrary, consider this to be a source of employment and enrichment.</seg>
<seg id=480> The rapporteur reserve in all welcome the proposals in the Commission White Paper on this subject, but it has, however, fears about the possible implications of the reform, whose main aim and to decentralise the application of the competition rules.</seg>
<seg id=481> In the debate yesterday evening, if I have been able to welcome Mr Jonathan Evans for his work, I have had to say from the outset my profound disagreement with the imprégnation too liberal, if not ultra-liberal, of his report.</seg>
<seg id=482> AID Ireland has restructured its activities in order to draw in the Objective 1 region half of all the jobs of Projects Greenfield over the next three years.</seg>
<seg id=483> Faced with the outcry that cause the consequences of this policy, the interventions, financing and other economic and fiscal incentives of the state are offset partly the situation.</seg>
<seg id=484> (The sitting was suspended at 14h06 and resumed at 3 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=485> And we are therefore, in October 2000, on the eve of taking a decision on the numbers of the 2001 budget.</seg>
<seg id=486> However, this has not prevented the Council to reduce agricultural expenditure to a total of EUR 555 million.</seg>
<seg id=487> Furthermore, we believe, of course, that it is not enough simply to create 400 additional posts.</seg>
<seg id=488> I can only invite the Council to follow us.</seg>
<seg id=489> That is why the administration of this House is for Members and not the opposite.</seg>
<seg id=490> At present, that is the Court of Auditors which we less concern.</seg>
<seg id=491> Finally, we must deal with the budget of the Ombudsman.</seg>
<seg id=492> On the contrary, we are of the opinion that this area should be strengthened with regard to the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=493> We also propose that Parliament continues to be regularly informed.</seg>
<seg id=494> When the establishment of a legislative dialogue on social, cultural or environmental - the Commissioner will agree that I am right - we are meeting with the Commissioner for Budgets, the Finance Ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets to ask for that no financial error must be committed.</seg>
<seg id=495> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your warm welcome.</seg>
<seg id=496> The Council has voted at first reading the appropriations it seem justified for 2001, without taking account of the concerns of tactical serving the objective of good allocation of appropriations that the Community institutions must continue.</seg>
<seg id=497> Before you declared your opinion on the draft budget for 2001, I would like to stress a number of objectives that the Council and Parliament have in common and which can result in an agreement between the two branches of the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=498> We find ourselves in a similar situation in terms of structural policy.</seg>
<seg id=499> Mr Colom i Naval has indicated, that the consultation of this summer has also led to a good result: in the future, Parliament will have better information on the legal bases which have an impact on the expenditure side.</seg>
<seg id=500> I would like to remind you that the financial perspective provided for last year for the Balkans only envisaged EUR 1.85 billion for the whole period until 2006.</seg>
<seg id=501> I would ask you once again to examine without prejudice this proposal that the Commission maintains and bear in mind this possibility.</seg>
<seg id=502> That material has of course been useful for both the preparation of the 2001 budget and for the 1999 discharge.</seg>
<seg id=503> Although I very much appreciate the work of this body as a member of the Committee on Budgets, although I believe all the work of the rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgets, I do not want to miss, as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to point out two amendments that the Commission has submitted once again to the plenary and the importance of which is not negligible, despite the modest amounts.</seg>
<seg id=504> With these measures, we want to make the legal control once again fully operational, restoring confidence in the legal security within the EU and consolidate the rule of law that is the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=505> Looking towards the abolition of this initiative without providing any replacement measure, the Commission was clearly against the political will expressed in Lisbon and the priority given by this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=506> This decision was quite astonishing and it has given the impression to many of us that the whole of this programme, very important, was simply become a hot air that is the Committee on Budgets and the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=507> The third point concerns the common agricultural policy, as defined in the draft budget.</seg>
<seg id=508> If employment is the political priority of the Union, fisheries, as the economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.</seg>
<seg id=509> I welcome in particular that the funding of Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000, whose pursuit was agreed at the end of last year, has been assured.</seg>
<seg id=510> As far as assistance to the Mediterranean countries, for example, the backlog relates to the budgets for several years.</seg>
<seg id=511> Mr President, during the debates of previous years, I used to travel on the floor on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, for which we have heard here this afternoon Mrs Iivari.</seg>
<seg id=512> However, I would like to say to the House this afternoon that we must not lose sight of the fact that the European Union spends only 1% of GDP of the Member States and that most of this money is managed in the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=513> I now turn to the overall strategy.</seg>
<seg id=514> This brings me to the strategy of my group, because the basis our conviction is the desire to give the European citizen for money.</seg>
<seg id=515> On the contrary, we must do everything to ensure that this House is an example of transparency, efficiency, and good democratic control of the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=516> We need to reflect on how to solve this problem.</seg>
<seg id=517> We want to promote the process of democratisation and we want to achieve a balance between the traditional areas of foreign policy that we have to deal with.</seg>
<seg id=518> The most difficult problems in the new budget relate to external actions.</seg>
<seg id=519> It goes without saying that a rigorous management is necessary, it has our support, and we should not delude ourselves on this point.</seg>
<seg id=520> This is an exceptional initiative, particularly at first reading, and this is a thankless initiative, because it cannot, in the current context, received a majority of votes in favour.</seg>
<seg id=521> Having said that, the importance of funding for Kosovo is not without its problems.</seg>
<seg id=522> The budgetary policy must inspire the confidence among the citizens in European politics.</seg>
<seg id=523> We must therefore support all the measures aimed at strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id=524> the level of budgetary implementation;</seg>
<seg id=525> With this strategic line in the approach of the budgets of this year and the coming years, the European Parliament has its full place in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg id=526> Indeed, with the transfer of 175 million, we have made an estimate of EUR 25 million more than what was expected.</seg>
<seg id=527> As regards the MEDA programme, the Council has said that the commitments pose no problem since the eight years of late payments.</seg>
<seg id=528> I believe that Mr Duff was here this morning, when we discussed the European Council in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg id=529> My reply will be very simple.</seg>
<seg id=530> Ramiro Zapata was the last of the 25 defenders of human rights to be murdered and the Colombian press recently has denounced the 'Plan 100' of the paramilitary groups to assassinate up to one hundred defenders of human rights.</seg>
<seg id=531> The attitude of the Council gives me a little more today than in July because, as often in crisis situations, the European Union seems to be the last to appear on the international stage and to make its voice heard.</seg>
<seg id=532> The question, Mr President, and I would like to end, is whether it is not a means of exerting pressure, stronger than that proposed by the President in his information and whether the aid that we are going to grant will be completely different from that of the United States, in other words, directed not to the fumigation of crops, but to their alternatives, and also to the social aspects rather than military.</seg>
<seg id=533> The questions that several Members and I have raised relate specifically to the situation in Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=534> As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos No 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.</seg>
<seg id=535> Subject: Tax on financial transactions The demand for a tax on speculative capital is increasingly gaining ground in recent months, with the proliferation of committees ATTAC (Association for the Taxation Transactions on the financial and for the Aid to Citizens) in France and in Europe, and the amendments tabled to the French National Assembly and the Senate.</seg>
<seg id=536> I would also like an answer to the question of its influence on the volatility of the currency markets, and in particular the effect of a tax of 0.1 per thousand on the speculators who are waiting for devaluations of the order of 20 to 50%.</seg>
<seg id=537> It would, moreover, in paragraph 26 the establishment of an international organisation back-up for the debt of the countries of the South.</seg>
<seg id=538> That is what has happened to the euro on the scale of a year, either for the regret or wish.</seg>
<seg id=539> I would like to add to what has been said by Danielle Auroi, in relation to the countries of the South, which have been made by experts, some interesting figures: for example, a range from 50 to 250 billion dollars, which could be recovered from a Tobin-type tax, while at the same time, the UNDP, a figure to a sum of USD 40 billion per year, the amount that could be enough to provide basic living conditions for the hundreds of millions of people who are all in the countries of the third world.</seg>
<seg id=540> In recent months, cases have been discovered, in particular, in various parts of France.</seg>
<seg id=541> I therefore ask the question, as a representative of the French Presidency is here, whether the slaughter of these cows will be paid on the Community budget, or whether you will pay on the national budget and if you feel that it would be a good thing that it pays on the Community budget.</seg>
<seg id=542> I would ask your indulgence and ask you to hear the answer?</seg>
<seg id=543> So the action of the two governments involved is limited by this international law.</seg>
<seg id=544> I do not understand how the Commission can already say in February it needs and the Council in July.</seg>
<seg id=545> In doing so in the name of subsidiarity, the Union is, in reality, one of its duties, as has happened in recent weeks, both in the north of Italy and Spain.</seg>
<seg id=546> As a Member of this majority, how can I endorse the disbursement of GBP 11.5 billion paid by British taxpayers - it is our current annual contribution - if we do not enjoy a broad approval of the public?</seg>
<seg id=547> A flexible attitude of the Council to reach an agreement at second reading to complete the budget.</seg>
<seg id=548> If anyone needs to be convinced, it is simply proof.</seg>
<seg id=549> This strategy has already been introduced by Joan Colom i Naval, Vice-President in charge of buildings.</seg>
<seg id=550> The political messages in the budget of this exercise – and Commissioner Schreyer mentioned – are many: the adaptation of the agricultural policy, new structural programmes, better implementation of structural policies, the monitoring of the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit with a view to creating a European Union stronger and more competitive and the fight against social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=551> The war waged by NATO has too destroyed and left too great suffering.</seg>
<seg id=552> Despite what has been agreed, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to achieve this objective within the existing budget without prejudice to the agricultural budget for a sustainable rural sector in the current Member States.</seg>
<seg id=553> And I would say to you very clearly: it must be given a chance to Kostunica, and I therefore hope that it will apply in the coming weeks or months to come, but in the meantime, I hope, however, that, politically, and in budgetary terms, the political conditions are linked to the introduction of these two new budgetary lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=554> The elections in Yugoslavia have shown two things: people have finally had enough of the dictator Milosevic and they have placed their trust in Professor Kostunica.</seg>
<seg id=555> I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners will also be released shortly.</seg>
<seg id=556> Otherwise, we would be inevitable in the "financial engineering ', in the redistribution and cuts, both in the social and environmental costs in cooperation, without being sure, provided that the sums allocated to the Balkans are adequate.</seg>
<seg id=557> In this context, it is time to solve major social problems such as unemployment, for example.</seg>
<seg id=558> There is, of course, a very important point is the fact that we have begun category four, with his approach, but we do not yet know very well if we have managed to resolve the problem, not least because the Council does not wish to participate in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id=559> The priorities are an important part of all budget work.</seg>
<seg id=560> This is not a consequence on the eve of the expiry of the Treaty, but it would be worrying if the post-ECSC legal framework to maintain such practices.</seg>
<seg id=561> This brings me to a third remark on the task which is now before us.</seg>
<seg id=562> The mistrust of the political leaders of the EU continues to grow, as I have experienced.</seg>
<seg id=563> I pay tribute to them for that.</seg>
<seg id=564> The provision in the discussion of all the institutions concerned has led to an exemplary collaboration with which we can - I very much hope - to reach an agreement at first reading.</seg>
<seg id=565> We who are in favour of European values in a country that is eurosceptic, we have now a further argument for the EU, namely a more effective protection of persons, which is important for the citizens in modern society.</seg>
<seg id=566> I have noted that my own country was going to make a change in the law on the personal data, which, in the current state, deprives the elected representatives of any influence on the decisions taken by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=567> There are many other points also cause problems and deserve the judgment of the practice to be protected.</seg>
<seg id=568> The Commission would first like to remind you of the commitment that we have all made towards the citizens to guarantee the protection of personal data processed by the institutions.</seg>
<seg id=569> With this statement, the Commission will accept that the scope of the regulation should be limited to the activities of the first pillar exclusively.</seg>
<seg id=570> In order to honour the political agreement she has reached with the Council and the rapporteur for the approval at first reading, the Commission rejects any other amendment that would not the Paciotti report approved by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, with the exception of Amendment No 69, which corrects Amendment No 41.</seg>
<seg id=571> For example, it is urgent that the number of inter-service group are very quickly strengthened at the heart of the General Secretariat of the Commission, so that all the proposed act of a general scope can be accompanied, in their discussion by the college on the basis of Article 299 (2) of a fiche d'impact.</seg>
<seg id=572> The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market we believe that it is important to emphasise that we cannot compare that what is comparable.</seg>
<seg id=573> Given the importance of fisheries for the outermost regions, I can only be saddened by this.</seg>
<seg id=574> Since the creation of an inter-service group for the outermost regions under the chairmanship of Mr Delors, a long and fruitful progress has been made so far and I should like to express the heartfelt thanks of the Europeans of the outermost regions to the person who chaired this group.</seg>
<seg id=575> Indeed, if the Treaty of Rome, reference was made to the French overseas departments, we had to wait until 1989 and the specific programmes of options due to their remoteness and insularity, the famous POSEI programmes, so that the European Union has finally conceded that the permanence and combination of the structural disadvantages of the outermost regions for special treatment in relation to other regions of the Community.</seg>
<seg id=576> I have no doubt that the proposals that the Commission will the Council will bear the name of these qualities.</seg>
<seg id=577> This question is all the more relevant that we are approaching a eastward enlargement of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=578> This right to difference is nothing more, what is more, that a product of the principle of equality, which requires also to deal with in a different way which is different.</seg>
<seg id=579> It is a document that we see, my team and myself, as rich in ideas, proposals, which is at the heart of the problems and who is evading no issues of concern to the outermost regions of the Community.</seg>
<seg id=580> Your report, Mrs Sudre, puts the right to focus on the need for action in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=581> With regard to the relaunch of the diversification of the economy, we have made progress in several key areas.</seg>
<seg id=582> It is now important that a large number of projects to be presented within the framework of the DOCUPs, but, in parallel with this action on the ground, we need to think more deeply about the needs, access, specific to each of these outermost regions to this information society.</seg>
<seg id=583> Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg id=584> Of course I will communicate your speech to the President.</seg>
<seg id=585> I am also concerned about the risk of a general breakdown of a large number of machines and rules which would then into question the decisions of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=586> This food authority and the legislative proposals presented to us, aimed at guaranteeing food safety, will have the support of this Parliament, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=587> The main task of this Authority will be a task of scientific consultation, because the debate on food safety must be 'pure' too.</seg>
<seg id=588> Mr President, I would like once again to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and for his openness to the opinions of the other committees.</seg>
<seg id=589> When we are confronted with a potential risk, it is important to implement the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg id=590> On the issue always controversial to what extent we need to allow it to look into the food, we really want advice and to be consulted by those who concern themselves mainly from risk management, we have also said that, when it comes to security, these issues should at least be included in the task of consultation of this Food Safety Authority.</seg>
<seg id=591> A central element of this last point is to ensure that the rich heritage of our traditions which is allowed to continue.</seg>
<seg id=592> The elements which will enable this respectability to see the light of day does not require laws or legislation, but rather integrity, academic quality, independence, accountability, transparency and comprehensibility.</seg>
<seg id=593> A good scientific knowledge is certainly needed to assess the risks associated with the food chain, from the farm to the fork.</seg>
<seg id=594> Mr President, the enthusiasm for the establishment of a European Food Safety Agency, as our rapporteur would prefer to call it, is obviously considerable.</seg>
<seg id=595> As long as the WHO programme is properly funded and supported, it does not seem to be necessary to create a body, especially not an agency whose scope is limited to the 15 Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=596> Food safety is an essential condition for the consumer; in fact, they want to eat healthily and it is up to us to do so.</seg>
<seg id=597> If we do not have any new framework directive, we can only smile about many things in the field of food safety.</seg>
<seg id=598> We must therefore amend the Treaty on European Union so that the Commission has the possibility of applying sanctions in the field of food, exactly as it can do so today in the field of competition.</seg>
<seg id=599> I support all the actors involved, whether political, administrative or other, who work within the framework of the Lisbon strategy 'Nourriture for all'.</seg>
<seg id=600> I do not agree with these words, because we can discover that a man is more than a body.</seg>
<seg id=601> It must be the true brain coordination of the network of national agencies, which, in turn, must activate and coordinate a network of centres of excellence, food safety at regional level.</seg>
<seg id=602> Therefore, I am of the opinion that your Amendment No 11 and my Amendment No 17 are perfectly compatible.</seg>
<seg id=603> The reform of food law in the European Union must be at the level of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=604> His report does not propose both changes that it focuses on a number of elements.</seg>
<seg id=605> We have made clear in the report, and I welcome it unreservedly.</seg>
<seg id=606> However, the creation of a European agency on food safety is very positive.</seg>
<seg id=607> It is to be hoped that, in the interests of European consumers, they will be respected.</seg>
<seg id=608> It is necessary, I believe, to define precise deadlines in which we shall notify the European Commission all cases justified concern.</seg>
<seg id=609> The EU must have the highest standards of food safety to its citizens.</seg>
<seg id=610> The Commission is now proposing the creation of a European Food Safety Authority.</seg>
<seg id=611> I fear that Europe has once again at the risk of creating a huge administrative apparatus, unable to act.</seg>
<seg id=612> Indeed, the efficiency is inversely proportional to the levels of bureaucracy and the level of expenditure incurred.</seg>
<seg id=613> Prevent parallel duplication and work in several institutions.</seg>
<seg id=614> However, we must avoid that, in the shadow of the debate on the White Paper, strengthens the public in the fear of a bureaucratic Europe which affects the quality of products without deal effectively to fraud which threaten the health of consumers.</seg>
<seg id=615> As you know, the Commission attaches the greatest importance to its strategy in the field of food safety.</seg>
<seg id=616> The Commission intends to adopt a proposal for a regulation establishing the principles and objectives which will form the cornerstone of food legislation and will provide the framework of future health protection measures on nutrition.</seg>
<seg id=617> Thank you very much, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=618> Turning to my report, I think the proposal of the Commission and I must add that the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Development have done much to improve it, in particular on certain points.</seg>
<seg id=619> As Mrs Bonino has clearly said, we have taken a step forward by the Commission's proposal for a regulation.</seg>
<seg id=620> The Commission proposal for a regulation we consider to be extremely vague.</seg>
<seg id=621> It is necessary to organise properly funding for de-mining operations and fund research for the work of detection and mines, and for the instruments that can be used simply in order to help the developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=622> During the last eight years, the European Union has spent more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget to the fight against anti-personnel landmines.</seg>
<seg id=623> But we must not penalise the people whose government is committing of violence.</seg>
<seg id=624> Firstly, I have already spoken, I think it would be a mistake, therefore a good feeling, but nonetheless counterproductive, to make the accession to the Ottawa Convention an absolute condition of granting a Community aid for the fight against anti-personnel landmines.</seg>
<seg id=625> I cannot accept Amendment No 19.</seg>
<seg id=626> Secondly, the international community suffers from a lack of coordination of its efforts at global level and particularly in the countries affected.</seg>
<seg id=627> Mr President, the Socialist Group shares the pride that has just been expressed by Mr van Orden on the subject of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=628> Remember the Soviet bombes-jouets in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=629> I thank you for the quality of your report.</seg>
<seg id=630> Mr President, the Cambodians call sentinelles mines for ever.</seg>
<seg id=631> The population has justified suspicion with regard to the forces in uniform, whatever they may be, which is explained by many years of war.</seg>
<seg id=632> Mr President, I welcome the fact that there are finally European legislation, in the form of regulation, on landmines and that we now have a good report by Mrs Bonino on this subject.</seg>
<seg id=633> - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are today discussing an issue which is very sad.</seg>
<seg id=634> It is no coincidence that the mines are, in the first place, in crisis areas, i.e. in regions which could take initiatives of a different nature to overcome these crises.</seg>
<seg id=635> In two kilometres away from a hamlet of Bosnia, in 1999, a sign the presence of mines in an area, which does not prevent the presence on the scene of a small boy.</seg>
<seg id=636> It is a tragedy that this is the civilian population which is suffering from the inability of its leaders.</seg>
<seg id=637> On the eve of the Fourth Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference, which will take place on 15 and 16 November in Marseilles, I am convinced that your work with our delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries, chaired by Mr Obiols i Germà, will enable us to move forward with our project of dialogue and peace.</seg>
<seg id=638> All the mines are stored in deposits.</seg>
<seg id=639> - (DE) Mr President, since I agree with almost everything that my colleagues have said, it seems to me necessary to repeat it, and I will therefore use my speaking time.</seg>
<seg id=640> The concept of open coordination is to revert to the institutional structure dominated by the officials of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=641> We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are taken at the closest possible level to the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id=642> Since, however, the main amendment proposed by the Group of the European People's Party have to find a large majority, I have voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg id=643> Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the resolution on the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz, for two reasons: firstly because I voted separately, by roll-call, for paragraphs 2 and 5, which has enabled me to express my opposition frank in relation to these two paragraphs.</seg>
<seg id=644> In other words, around the table of the common European house, some mangeraient and others on the menu.</seg>
<seg id=645> Of course, we can always do better, and democratic control must not be watered down, but in our opinion, the list of these rights and their inclusion in the Treaties are not the absolute priority of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=646> There have been debates on the subject of referendums and amendments that have been tabled on this subject.</seg>
<seg id=647> In the 1999 elections to the European Parliament, turnout has achieved that 40%, if we exclude the countries in which the vote is compulsory, and those in which the European elections was combined with national elections.</seg>
<seg id=648> In order to achieve the objective of a European constitution - what we want - we must avoid imposing standards and rigid methodologies, which would lead to the failure of the desired objective.</seg>
<seg id=649> A real social constitution should bring with the best in the world of work, women, immigrants and the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=650> Without denying the laudable intention to strengthen, clarify and deepen the European Union, as well as to simplify the texts to bring them closer to the citizens, I did not vote for this resolution.</seg>
<seg id=651> the allocation of powers and responsibilities</seg>
<seg id=652> I consider it absolutely crucial that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights leads to accession of the Union to the Council of Europe Convention on human rights.</seg>
<seg id=653> But the report by Mr Gil-Robles comes to help me, because it proposes that in some areas, sectors and areas, some Member States of the European Union to agree on a joint action.</seg>
<seg id=654> The desire to allow a growing number of decisions on important areas are taken by qualified majority is contrary to the basic democratic standards.</seg>
<seg id=655> Today, it is trying to prevent the relaxation of closer cooperation, and it will ultimately lose part, too.</seg>
<seg id=656> This report seeks to make the position taken in this direction of our Parliament (resolution of 13 April 2000).</seg>
<seg id=657> - (SV) Our view of the so-called flexible integration is generally positive.</seg>
<seg id=658> - The British Labour Members of the PSE Group welcomes the support given to the contribution they have made to the work of the IGC on closer cooperation, without adhering fully to all the details.</seg>
<seg id=659> These islands must feel an integral part of the European Union which, I hope, will make a haven for tourists and for their people themselves.</seg>
<seg id=660> In the Middle Ages, these regions and their peoples did not belong to Europe and, even today, they are not actually regarded as European.</seg>
<seg id=661> Indeed, the special features of these regions, which are based in general insularity and remoteness from the European continent, but also of their chronic dependence on a limited number of products or even a single production, require specific measures adapted to overcoming these constraints.</seg>
<seg id=662> Mr President, I apologize if I still forces the presidency and the interpreters to listen to my last explanation of vote and would particularly like to express my solidarity with the translators of our explanations of vote, as far as I am concerned the Italian Ornella Buson.</seg>
<seg id=663> It is in fact clear that the agency is intended to capture the powers of national defence, or paralysed, for the purposes of the objectives of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=664> That does not prevent the Commission and Parliament: this agency 'Authority', which is totally contrary to the philosophy which is supposed to the inspiration.</seg>
<seg id=665> It is not quite what we proposed in the Bowis report, where one has the feeling that food safety is essentially regarded as a new pretext for the well-known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission to the detriment of national bodies and the security of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=666> Therefore, I think that, by this statement, condemn these indescribable actions on behalf of the European Parliament, which has always advocated the respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all the communities.</seg>
<seg id=667> Madam President, I understand the criticisms of the rapporteur. However, by voting in favour of the amendments of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we vote not only of the appropriations but also for or against a certain direction of policy.</seg>
<seg id=668> I would ask you to support the amendment of the line A-206, 'purchase property', according to the amendments which will be adopted, so that we do not exceed our own ceiling limited to 20% of all administrative expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=669> Before the vote on the proposed amendment 929</seg>
<seg id=670> Section VI, Economic and Social Committee</seg>
<seg id=671> Report (A5-0276 / 2000) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of the stock of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES Division VIIa) (COM (2000) 0190 - C5-0219 / 2000 - 2000 / 0071 (CNS))</seg>
<seg id=672> (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=673> The export subsidies to sales at low prices on the world market, the surpluses of food products, which creates a serious disadvantage in terms of competition for the agri-food industries many countries, for example in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=674> In order to obtain the necessary financial resources to an increase in aid for the Balkans, the Member States must carry out a redistribution of appropriations available in the framework of the budget.</seg>
<seg id=675> However, Parliament was able to adopt a number of important priorities – including a greater effort in the fight against unemployment and poverty, on a number of important issues relating to the environment and equal opportunities, etc., and we have voted against the attack by the right to the Life programme and the European Women's Lobby.</seg>
<seg id=676> - (SV) We maintain our views on the travel allowances for Members of the European Parliament, namely that only actual travel costs incurred on journeys which fall within the scope of their mission must be reimbursed.</seg>
<seg id=677> I assume – and I hope that the Commission is seeking constructive solutions to this effect - that we are going to have to cover the period between 2002 and 2005 by means of a transitional regulation.</seg>
<seg id=678> - (DE) In its desire obsession to regulate and liberalise, but above all in order to muzzle the national parliaments, the European Commission has submitted a proposal for a regulation for immediate application and compulsory, instead of a proposal for a directive, which has to be dealt with in the cravache to Parliament and the Council to enter into force on 31 December this year.</seg>
<seg id=679> We therefore support the efforts undertaken by the Commission in order to reform this sector and we shall oppose all new measures to encourage it.</seg>
<seg id=680> A development which has made highly dependent on capital loans.</seg>
<seg id=681> Nicholson report (A-0276 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=682> It is important to ensure that the sums allocated on the basis of aid is not used for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id=683> Our firm opinion is that the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases must be obtained at the cost that will have to pay the real polluters (i.e. the major industries), to the detriment of their excessive profits.</seg>
<seg id=684> Report Moreira da Silva (A5-0271 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=685> We should spend that money, harmonising and coordinating expenditure on research policy in all 15 States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=686> Only by caution, we need to learn more about these substances.</seg>
<seg id=687> Voting time is over.</seg>
<seg id=688> This European format replacing the national format which is already being used everywhere at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=689> The loss of data used to the statistics of the balance of payments which would result from this change would be minimal.</seg>
<seg id=690> We must be aware that it is mainly small and medium-sized enterprises, which are affected by this problem.</seg>
<seg id=691> For years now, we are pleading with a harmonisation of the efforts made in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=692> I believe that this report is of crucial importance for a genuine integration of citizens, of small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro zone and to increase the acceptance of economic and monetary union.</seg>
<seg id=693> The free movement of capital in the single currency, cannot be reconciled with obstacles or disparities.</seg>
<seg id=694> However, the European Parliament and the Commission attach a great deal of importance.</seg>
<seg id=695> I support the two-track policy that wants to follow the rapporteur in order to get the banks too incapable to act.</seg>
<seg id=696> We cannot compel banks to exercise an activity unprofitable, but as politicians, what we can do is support the amendment tabled on behalf of the PPE-DE Group by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs calling for measures to be taken before the end of the year, and preferably that these standards are become reality when we are going to use euro notes and coins.</seg>
<seg id=697> Hence the proposal that I have introduced with Mrs Peijs: to get the banks around a table, not to impose constraints, but because we can no longer strengthen political pressure.</seg>
<seg id=698> It goes without saying that if the cross-border payment systems remain as expensive that today, the credibility of these new coins and notes will be directly called into question.</seg>
<seg id=699> We believe that this accumulation of statistical data on domestic payments of the Union are a relic of the past, which is no longer justified in an integrated area, unified, and that it is an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the market.</seg>
<seg id=700> In view of the speeches of some of my colleagues in the committee, those attending this House for longer than me, I had the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, which this Parliament is submitting for the fourth time, belonged to this category.</seg>
<seg id=701> Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you in advance for supporting my report.</seg>
<seg id=702> If we are back at European level, we must strengthen the opportunities for the regions.</seg>
<seg id=703> Principale source of job creation, both in terms of quality and quantity, SMEs play a crucial role in social cohesion and land-use planning.</seg>
<seg id=704> The care she has given to the study of the proposals and consultation she has had the desire to hold with many interested parties have been an asset to better define and optimise the implementation of this programme.</seg>
<seg id=705> Thirdly, we must look into the European added value.</seg>
<seg id=706> It follows that small and medium-sized enterprises can only live if unemployment is low and public budgets are free of debt and sufficiently supplied to make such investments.</seg>
<seg id=707> Businesses need clarity.</seg>
<seg id=708> Above all, when a company unipersonnelle or a company with fewer than 250 employees has a project, it must be possible to receive financing not only with a guarantee to 120%, but also on the basis of a good idea.</seg>
<seg id=709> The Member States and even the regional or local authorities are already huge financial pumps, designed to bring the taxpayers' money, that is to say the amounts levied on the majority of the population, including the most disadvantaged, to large companies and consequently to their owners and their shareholders.</seg>
<seg id=710> The breeding ground for small and medium-sized enterprises includes thousands of fragile tests which big business in staff and ideas.</seg>
<seg id=711> What I expect the Commissioner, in particular amongst all the measures we have proposed here is that it facilitates and speed up access to aid and information, so that the heads of SMEs to be able to use the information efficiently.</seg>
<seg id=712> All these occupy a special place in the multiannual programme.</seg>
<seg id=713> Finally, I welcome the idea to give us an annual meeting to make an assessment of the implementation of the programme.</seg>
<seg id=714> The recent incidents against the Greek minority in Himara make it more imperative the need to promote measures for democratisation, the strengthening of the institutions and respect for human rights in Albania.</seg>
<seg id=715> Vast numbers of Albanians leave their countries as a result of the insecurity there, social problems, social and family structures prémodernes.</seg>
<seg id=716> We need preventive measures tailored to Albania and assist in the construction and reconstruction of the country in order to make it possible to live with dignity in this region.</seg>
<seg id=717> That is how the documents are travelling to a body to another and that the European Commission, for example, refuses to publish the report concerning, among other things, also the Customs Assistance Mission (CAM), drawn up by the Albanians.</seg>
<seg id=718> Let us try to look the truth in the face.</seg>
<seg id=719> Mrs Karamanou, congratulations on the point of view extended embodied in the concept of your report.</seg>
<seg id=720> This is a very important subject, which is shaped by historical factors, social, political and economic.</seg>
<seg id=721> We will never know the exact number of victims.</seg>
<seg id=722> The common economic activities, create peaceful links between the people.</seg>
<seg id=723> What I find rather unacceptable in this report, and I say this frankly, is that we are confusing cause and effect, i.e. confuses a procedure for granting visas, balanced and therefore the possibility of migration, with the question of illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id=724> The major institutional changes that are the consequence of the Treaty of Amsterdam has had an impact on the management of asylum and immigration.</seg>
<seg id=725> Thirdly and lastly, the action plan and its method of implementation must be considered at regional level.</seg>
<seg id=726> Of course, this requirement also invites us to show restraint in terms of European regulations.</seg>
<seg id=727> It is time or never to place particular emphasis on the strength of Community action.</seg>
<seg id=728> I would also argue in favour of that are introduced proposals codified to change current European legislation in order to incorporate the amendments in the existing directives or regulations.</seg>
<seg id=729> The principle of subsidiarity, if it is understood correctly, we committed in two directions: take decisions at the lowest possible level, but that the lowest possible level can be a very high level, when the general interests are at stake and threatened if they are not protected everywhere in a uniform manner.</seg>
<seg id=730> This report is a model of conciseness and clarity and I hope that my colleagues will take this into account seriously.</seg>
<seg id=731> The report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not given rise to the enthusiasm of its members.</seg>
<seg id=732> That is what I referred in the report on the SLIM project, because Community legislation, and Mr Medina has just prove with the reading of one of the articles of the Treaty, is difficult to understand, even by experts.</seg>
<seg id=733> Therefore, certain aspects of the report to enthuse because I would have preferred a more 'communitarising' with regard to the internal market, and, above all, because the report does not go in this direction on this point.</seg>
<seg id=734> What is important for the institutions of the Union, is that we are going to improve the quality of legislation, in particular by taking account of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=735> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=736> The persistence of this situation could have a negative impact on the citizens with regard to the euro.</seg>
<seg id=737> Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has prepared internal very carefully the Karamanou report.</seg>
<seg id=738> Having said that, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to take our oral question and of this debate to address the two parties - as our motion for a resolution are addressed to both parties - and I would like to make calmly a few points.</seg>
<seg id=739> The peoples of the Union that we represent here have been demanding.</seg>
<seg id=740> Of water has passed under the bridge, the agreement has come to an end and has not been renewed.</seg>
<seg id=741> I can understand the reasons for the Commissioner, but not those of the Director-General.</seg>
<seg id=742> We could say that, eleven least after the withdrawal, we continue to pay the previous agreement and prior to the past.</seg>
<seg id=743> Mr President, we had a similar debate a year ago and the fact that it took a year to start negotiations shows how difficult it is to find fish resources for the extensive fleets of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=744> In the second agreement, things were very clear.</seg>
<seg id=745> But we must also realise that nothing is eternal, not even the fish stocks!</seg>
<seg id=746> That is why I would particularly like to make it clear that if the PPE-DE Group is distinguished from other, this is not only for having supported, defended and encouraged the fisheries agreements, but also for pushing their extension significantly.</seg>
<seg id=747> Thirdly, since the fisheries agreement is suspended, the exploitation of the place of the Western Sahara by Community fleets and outside the Community or which are not subject to the control of the Commission nor the Member States is continuing, especially of a large fleet in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id=748> I well understand, because fishing is a source of income and jobs in this poor area - in relation to European standards.</seg>
<seg id=749> The other point I would like to stress is that the temporary aid paid to fishermen and shipowners in compensation for this year without work end at the end of the month. It is an untenable situation for them, they prefer all work instead of receiving aid.</seg>
<seg id=750> A year ago, as a Member from the Partido Andalucista, I am negotiating, and I propose initiatives in the corridors, in the offices of the Committee on Fisheries and during the hearings with the Commissioner to take account of the uniqueness of the very special Andalusian fishing fleet which fishes in Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=751> Spain has developed a remarkably positive the difficult neighbourhood which has always existed between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=752> As a Spanish Member Andalusians, and I am claiming the right of thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families to maintain and defend, and that this Parliament also defend their jobs, which are in danger for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id=753> We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=754> The history of almost twelve years, with good words spoken by the authorities, delaying tactics, hope, also needs employees, placebos for those involved, the persistent defence of old rights of citizens, who wanted nothing more than their own common law.</seg>
<seg id=755> As you know, the matter is very complex and concerns approximately seven hundred people working in more than 25 Italian universities.</seg>
<seg id=756> If the Italian legal system is reformed and amended, as has been the case for the staff, we do not believe that the Commission can intervene, therefore, that every European citizen enjoys equal access to all categories of occupations.</seg>
<seg id=757> The injustice lies in the fact that two people doing the same job and working side-by-side receive a salary different and are subject to different conditions.</seg>
<seg id=758> In my view, there is nothing worse than having to warn people that a ruling for them could only be a number of words pleasing and have no practical effect on their existence.</seg>
<seg id=759> I would remind you, I would remind the Commission that I hope a reaction to the fact that, in the case of Allué, the ruling by the Court states that it is contrary to Article 48 (2) of the EC Treaty that the legislation of a Member State to limit the duration of contracts of employment of foreign language assistants in a year with the possibility of renewal, in principle, there is no limit of this kind to the other teachers.</seg>
<seg id=760> I believe, however, that these matters go to the heart of the fundamental principles of freedom associated with European law, particularly the freedom of movement, and no exception cannot be tolerated in relation to these principles.</seg>
<seg id=761> As demonstrated by the current debate, we still encounter many obstacles, many obstacles in the way of this internal market, and not only in this case.</seg>
<seg id=762> We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=763> (The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=764> On behalf of our Parliament, I immediately sent to the President, Mr Thomas Klestil, as well as the Chancellor, Mr Wolfgang Schüssel, the messages of condolence and solidarity in the tragedy that such a tragedy calls for the victims, their families and the whole of the Austrian people.</seg>
<seg id=765> Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg id=766> I support Mr Ceyhun's proposal and I would be very grateful to the Council whether it could inform us whether it intends to submit a new proposal on this matter.</seg>
<seg id=767> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group considers this incident in so important that we believe that it would not be dealt with in the context of the topical and urgent debate.</seg>
<seg id=768> I have the feeling that you join the motivation, Mr Barón Crespo, if I have understood you correctly.</seg>
<seg id=769> Madam President, some time ago, we discussed in this House the issue of sanctions against Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=770> It is urgent that we have a debate on this subject before the entry into force of the modifications proposed by the British authorities; the Commission must also say quite clearly that this is the right in this respect.</seg>
<seg id=771> (A5-0314 / 2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, particularly in the field of the fight against organised crime, the laundering of proceeds of crime and crime in the financial field (10213 / 2000 - C5-0394 / 2000 - 2000 / 0815 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=772> The statements must be matched by action to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.</seg>
<seg id=773> The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot remain in the hands of a specialist agency, under the sole control of national governments.</seg>
<seg id=774> On the other hand, Article 8 of the draft convention restricted solely to essential interests grounds for refusal of mutual assistance that could invoke the requested state.</seg>
<seg id=775> First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Marinho for his work and say that the fight against economic crimes deserves not only our support, but also our vigilance.</seg>
<seg id=776> Repérer, continue to condemn the laundering of dirty money terrorists and arms traffickers and drugs: yes, of course!</seg>
<seg id=777> Our task is to detect, trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of organised crime.</seg>
<seg id=778> These elements are in the amendments and, judging by the debates in committee, I hope that they will be approved by Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=779> It seems to me that this set of initiatives is developing in a way which is likely to destroy the protection offered by Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</seg>
<seg id=780> But the reality is not as simple as that.</seg>
<seg id=781> Finally, Mr President, the PPE Group supports the compromise amendment reached with Mrs Roure about the activities of lawyers.</seg>
<seg id=782> The second measure, the second instrument, is harmonisation.</seg>
<seg id=783> Other speakers have already welcomed this Portuguese initiative.</seg>
<seg id=784> That was the aim of the joint meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the ECOFIN Council of 17 October.</seg>
<seg id=785> The best way to strengthen parliamentary control and judicial control over Europol, is to include quite the Europol Convention in the legal framework of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=786> The creation of a provisional unit of judicial cooperation is a step in the right direction, not to which the European Parliament has been seeking for a long time.</seg>
<seg id=787> That is the purpose of the guarantees, namely to move this aspect of freedoms.</seg>
<seg id=788> The European Parliament is the supranational body of Community the establishment of this report, and I therefore ask you to support the wisdom by supporting our rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=789> Only when the institutional model and the rules which will govern the European area of justice will be specified that the citizens and Parliament can decide on the measures that the Council is proposing.</seg>
<seg id=790> Eurojust is therefore a logical step of this work, which seeks to give the citizens a high level of safety within an area of justice, security and freedom, stepping up the fight against serious crime.</seg>
<seg id=791> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on the excellent report she has presented to us, in the wake of the decisions taken at the Tampere Council.</seg>
<seg id=792> But as, with Eurojust, we are talking about the coordination of national public prosecutors and magistrates to combat all forms of serious crime - and here I agree with the approach of the rapporteur - we extend the concept: we no longer talk only the purely transnational crime, we are also talking about cooperation for the suppression of criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id=793> We will have the opportunity to engage ourselves in this provisional unit, from 1 January 2001, but the Commission is willing to support the debate on what must be the permanent unit of Eurojust.</seg>
<seg id=794> On all sides, have been taken on a courageous position - it seems to me - which, however, have not led to opposition inflexible.</seg>
<seg id=795> The problems at the level of expenditure have not too concerned; other areas were much more worrying.</seg>
<seg id=796> It is unacceptable that we have not clear objectives and we cannot measure the results; this would in any other institution.</seg>
<seg id=797> A second point, Commissioner, as regards the hierarchy of the organisation, overlapping unacceptable really have been established.</seg>
<seg id=798> I would like to emphasise that it has played a positive role in a number of problems.</seg>
<seg id=799> It is clear that this work does not consortium in a dual financial liability.</seg>
<seg id=800> Therefore, we have really worked on the recovery of EUR 3.4 million, and we can say that we have achieved more than 90%.</seg>
<seg id=801> Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg id=802> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of nine months of work and a long search for compromise, i.e. the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=803> Even if it does now say 'yes' to this Charter, I hope that this House will leave no doubt over the next few weeks, on the fact that it requires of the Council that this Charter legally binding and that it must guarantee citizens' access to the European Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id=804> This position is, as you know, the position taken by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Biarritz who have themselves approved, unanimously and without reservation, and I can therefore only urge you, on behalf of the Council, to follow this position, perhaps you by saying a few reasons.</seg>
<seg id=805> But it is above all by the strength of its content that the Charter, I am sure, will mark a milestone.</seg>
<seg id=806> For its part, the European Trade Union Confederation has been able to complain about what she believes to be shortcomings, such as the lack of reference to the right to a minimum wage, for example.</seg>
<seg id=807> The fact remains that personalities, and in particular the Members of the European Parliament have proposed that an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be included in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which already reference to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=808> Our group has approved the Charter unanimously, with the exception of the British delegation.</seg>
<seg id=809> As the European People ’ s Party, we are unanimously in favour of the inclusion as quickly as possible of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties, so that it has the force of law immediately to the citizens of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=810> They have shown that we could work on European issues on a new and exemplary, more than the Intergovernmental Conference, because it gives this work a open, democratic nature, by enabling citizens to fully exercise their right of scrutiny and to participate in it.</seg>
<seg id=811> The right to health, social security, housing or the minimum income is non-existent or simply the order of solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=812> Fourthly, and this is particularly significant for me, the Charter is based on the principle of the indivisibility of civil and political rights, on the one hand, and social rights.</seg>
<seg id=813> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this Charter is simply the umpteenth demonstration of the capacity of the Union and our Member States to increase the number of empty texts, declarations of intent.</seg>
<seg id=814> The Commission's representative to the Convention in Turin has added to the document a legal significance.</seg>
<seg id=815> After the market, the Europe of rights is perhaps finally come. The concept of citizenship in the European Union is a fairly new concept.</seg>
<seg id=816> The Charter is in fact drafted as a text that can be legally binding.</seg>
<seg id=817> I also note with pride that a representative of the group to which I belong to the Finnish Parliament, Mr Gunnar Jansson, has played a very important role in the drafting of the Charter.</seg>
<seg id=818> As I said yesterday evening - I repeat today - there are too many shortcomings in this area, throughout this Union and, sometimes, overwhelmed by our desire to develop judicial and police cooperation, we are overlooking the importance of ensuring that the innocent people do not become the passive victims of the collateral damage of the war against crime.</seg>
<seg id=819> Madam President, the draft resolution of the European Parliament on the Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the same ambiguity that the work of the House.</seg>
<seg id=820> The Italian Constitution provides for example the good customs; the Convention provides for the rights of others, public order.</seg>
<seg id=821> Mr President, today, in the vote that will take place at 12 noon, we will put an end to a process which began in 1984, when the European Parliament has approved the draft Treaty on European Union, which was the request for a declaration of rights, a process that we have pursued in 1989 with the resolution of Mr De Gucht.</seg>
<seg id=822> The Charter will produce effects. It will set out in the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=823> That is to be welcomed and not to be feared, as seems to believe Mr Bonde.</seg>
<seg id=824> It seems that all the struggles for the emancipation of disadvantaged social classes the century which ends have been ineffective and we have learned nothing.</seg>
<seg id=825> The Charter fills a gap in the right of the EC, it reinforces the protection of individuals against the attacks which they could be the subject of the part of the European police force, the authorities fighting fraud and those responsible for monitoring competition.</seg>
<seg id=826> I do not understand those who oppose the Charter on the pretext that it does not contain everything they want to see.</seg>
<seg id=827> Mr President, I shall continue in the same vein as Mr Gahrton.</seg>
<seg id=828> I would like to make a third remark about the rights of third-country nationals.</seg>
<seg id=829> Just as the European Court of Human Rights, the Council of Europe has also considerable experience with regard to such forms of control, and we can take as a basis.</seg>
<seg id=830> In view of the text of the Charter that we are going to approve - by a large majority, I hope - and today, it is clear that we can achieve a greater protection of fundamental rights and greater than would have enabled accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=831> That is why it is necessary to make further progress.</seg>
<seg id=832> This is vital if we are to win the support of the European population with regard to the Charter.</seg>
<seg id=833> After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be my type of analysis for this report and, as far as my own resources, intellectuals and resources in staff who will be given me, I will allow me a law by law, country by country adherence to the Charter in the fifteen countries of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=834> Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would first like to join in the words of the President, Mr Moscovici, and I welcome the essential contribution that the members of the European Parliament have given to the debate, to the Convention, in particular the role that Mr Méndez de Vigo has played in the Praesidium of the Convention for the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=835> Let me pick up on some of the main points of this debate.</seg>
<seg id=836> The Convention has chosen to include fundamental rights inspired the various instruments of the Council of Europe, of the Treaties and the constitutions of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=837> The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:</seg>
<seg id=838> In the current state of affairs, it is also up to our Parliament to tell the Turkish people that there are now three conditions for its accession.</seg>
<seg id=839> In addition, it would not have been possible to establish conditions only by a decision of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=840> That is why I have taken note of the suggestions made by Mr Morillon on the preconditions for the accession of Turkey and they deserve the greatest interest.</seg>
<seg id=841> I am pleased to say that, in the meantime, the Turkish Government has accepted this partnership as a basis for future cooperation, which gives us hope to achieve our goals, namely to help, by our policy, the forces of reform in Turkey give new impetus to the reform process and to move towards accession sought to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=842> For me, the most important point is that Helsinki has triggered in Turkey, in the Turkish public opinion, a debate on the conditions for the accession of Turkey to the EU and that this debate supports and encourages the forces of reform of the country.</seg>
<seg id=843> The text before you for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id=844> What is meant to do now is to provide a necessary impetus within the framework of future accession.</seg>
<seg id=845> I do not know how to proceed the vote, but I would urge Turkey to deal with this issue seriously.</seg>
<seg id=846> The European Parliament will play its role in the promotion of relations with the political parties, NGOs and the press, as well as in the development of its difficult and sometimes tense relationship with the Grand National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id=847> Mr Morillon, your report is, in my view, quite realistic and responsible.</seg>
<seg id=848> On the occasion of your visit to Turkey in March, as now, you have at least mentioned specifically the problem of the Kurdish population.</seg>
<seg id=849> There are both very naïve and great enough to consider that Europeans will bring the Turks, and I quote: 'to a radical change in their habits and mentality.</seg>
<seg id=850> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us causes me grave concern.</seg>
<seg id=851> Recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the approval of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487 / 1 / 00 C5-0570 / 2000 - 2000 / 2233 (AVC))</seg>
<seg id=852> In any event, we will, the next time we will be discussing the power technology, we realise that there is a need for a broader control and therefore more able to respect human dignity.</seg>
<seg id=853> Recommendation Duff / Voggenhuber (A5-0325 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=854> By way of illustration, such as:</seg>
<seg id=855> The rights contained in the Charter are already enshrined in national constitutions and defended by the national parliaments closer to the peoples and their cultures.</seg>
<seg id=856> For example, Article 19-1, which states that: 'collective expulsions are prohibited', does not specify that this ban can be suspended in the event of war or serious unrest in public order.</seg>
<seg id=857> We are giving a brief explanation of these three objections in order.</seg>
<seg id=858> The right to a government to remove arbitrarily its constitution is the definition characteristic of a tyranny.</seg>
<seg id=859> But, I repeat today, we have every reason to be proud of the conditions in which we have taken this important step for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=860> A society with that rights, but no duties, becomes a selfish society.</seg>
<seg id=861> That is our fight a priority for the affirmation of fundamental rights is enshrined in political choices.</seg>
<seg id=862> While the Convention method is interesting and fruitful to establish a basic text, seeking a broad compromise, there is no justification for denying the European Parliament, of the representation of the European peoples, of the opportunity to amend, enhance the text.</seg>
<seg id=863> This Charter must be improved, and our Parliament must propose a strategy for its updating and its enrichment.</seg>
<seg id=864> Therefore, it should not be adopted and proclaimed at the meeting of the Council in Nice: this summit should initiate a European debate on this Charter.</seg>
<seg id=865> Fortunately, the leading tendency of national governments appears in the good sense, i.e. that of a Charter for purely political and binding.</seg>
<seg id=866> Founded as "that forum" by the Cologne Summit, it has auto-proclamée 'Convention', a name that terrorist tendencies and 1793 worryingly reminiscent of the French Revolution, implemented by another Convention.</seg>
<seg id=867> On the other hand, the method which has been used, the distortions that have been made and the ambiguity surrounding the nature of this text cast a harsh light enough on the new agents which are at the heart of the process of European integration.</seg>
<seg id=868> Fortunately, the European Parliament has in this area a consultative role, pending the complete application of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but it is the way to do this play in the wrong direction, in slowing down the right decisions.</seg>
<seg id=869> As to how to proceed, the opinions.</seg>
<seg id=870> In fact, it was a century ago, here and, after it has been somewhat limited, this right is now a revival.</seg>
<seg id=871> The last thing we want is that the single market to allow criminals to introduce by the back door.</seg>
<seg id=872> We also support the future creation of a convention facilitating the fight against organised crime and money laundering, as well as the different measures proposed for these purposes.</seg>
<seg id=873> Indeed, it creates a provisional unit consisting of representatives of judges or policemen who carry out an activity of a judge in our fifteen Member States.</seg>
<seg id=874> Mr President, as a member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I am dealing with a great deal of the question of the prospect of accession of Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=875> The attitude to Turkey on the issue of Cyprus is also unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=876> We support the criticism of the rapporteur, who believes that there is currently an effective evaluation of the results of the EIB ’ s lending activity, and that there are also lacking from the point of view of the public right of access to documents and the democratic control of the activities of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id=877> Turkey, despite all its differences, has always belonged and is still of the European reality.</seg>
<seg id=878> The accession of Turkey to the European Union has become a matter more than ever on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=879> Mr Morillon says that Turkey should endeavour not to see the European Union as a 'exclusive Christian club', which would exclude Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=880> Turkey will genuinely to democracy, when it learn to live with its past, such as Germany has learned to live with democratic, and it, too, we have asked him to do so.</seg>
<seg id=881> As soon as the Turkish authorities have understood that the status quo is unacceptable for Europe and for the rest of the world, significant progress can be made: the island can be reunified and a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement in accordance with international law will be made tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id=882> In fact, why all this remains absent from the report of the European Commission?</seg>
<seg id=883> It is in this balance that we must press on with our action to promote the rapprochement between the Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=884> If you treat the Armenian issue in connection with the accession to the EU - I would ask you to take into consideration: the Armenian issue in connection with the accession to the EU - the project which we have discussed today will begin. It is as simple as that.</seg>
<seg id=885> This is also the reason for our insistence that a balance sheet should be drawn up of the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, so that in Marseilles, precisely, we are able to set the necessary guidelines.</seg>
<seg id=886> However, we have managed to maintain dialogue and on issues sometimes sensitive: stability, terrorism, emigration, human rights, for example.</seg>
<seg id=887> The fact remains that the Council endeavoured, in particular since 1995, to give the Mediterranean more money, commensurate with the challenges of the partnership.</seg>
<seg id=888> It is in fact - and I would also like to say this as someone who comes from Central Europe - a very important dossier.</seg>
<seg id=889> Mr President, as you know, there is a saying in English which said that if a high profile does not appear in a spectacle, it seems to be a representation of Hamlet without the first produce.</seg>
<seg id=890> We want to see in place the policies on the issues of the single market and to reach an agreement in order to introduce the cumulative origin, alongside the free-trade sub-regional agreements for all the partners choosing this path and adopting the harmonised protocol on rules of origin.</seg>
<seg id=891> We have learned with great satisfaction that the Commission intends to give new impetus to the Barcelona process.</seg>
<seg id=892> I have stressed these aspects because it is the key to the relaunch of the process and that it is necessary to add to this the enrichment of the political agenda of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id=893> Therefore, our priority must be to guarantee peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we must make every possible effort on behalf of this cooperation and that funds committed is effectively implemented, in accordance with the selfish generosity - let us say - of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=894> That is the important and practical questions I would like to ask, and I would like to thank Mr Brok for having enabled this debate, just before the Presidency and the Commission can discuss these issues.</seg>
<seg id=895> The world is moving in the direction of globalisation now inevitable. In this context, it is necessary to organize a major bloc acting as actors in the context of global competition.</seg>
<seg id=896> It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries have requested that a quarter of the appropriations of the programme MEDA-I expired in 1999 and which was 4.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id=897> In this respect, the proposal for a new impetus on the part of the Commission is positive and we agree entirely with the two priorities that Mr Patten has outlined in his speeches and repeated in this House this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id=898> This is a warning for the European Union to play a much more active role in the Mediterranean region which, historically and culturally, has contributed to the wealth and the grandeur our European continent.</seg>
<seg id=899> But more importantly, at a time when in this Chamber calmly our exchange of views sometimes very different, more and more Palestinians are being massacred.</seg>
<seg id=900> Aid for reconstruction</seg>
<seg id=901> If we do not, however, find the means, in December, to implement this regulation, this means that the debate we are having today is an empty shell.</seg>
<seg id=902> This is often too bureaucratic and is often too complex procedures. But we must not and do not want to turn a blind eye, and I hope that the Member States do not, on the role that they have played in this respect.</seg>
<seg id=903> The media in this region have often been responsible for the tragedy that she has suffered; they must be free to work in accordance with the rules in force in our democracies.</seg>
<seg id=904> But I am also pleased because I believe that Parliament has succeeded, thanks to continuous pressure, to bring a successful conclusion to a situation which was not particularly welcome at the outset.</seg>
<seg id=905> I repeat: there is a real need to avoid unnecessarily spending money in meetings superfluous.</seg>
<seg id=906> We must not, however, concentrate only on Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id=907> I also regret that a number of programmes have been put in the performance reserve, the reserve of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id=908> In Feira, it has acknowledged the quality of potential candidates for accession to the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process.</seg>
<seg id=909> I would remind you of the main priorities assigned to the CARDS programme: the strengthening of institutions in the sense of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction, regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=910> The European Union was right to react positively to the accession of President Kostunica in power.</seg>
<seg id=911> An initial examination took place on 6 November.</seg>
<seg id=912> As the European Parliament called for in its resolution of 16 March 2000, they initiatives the European Council Presidency intend to take to play a more active role in order to ensure the full implementation of the UN Peace Plan?</seg>
<seg id=913> How are we to achieve this without settlement of this conflict?</seg>
<seg id=914> I can only say that France and Germany - and here I speak not as President of the Council - have raised these issues during a bilateral summit in Vittel, last week, and that it was decided to set up a working group in order to remedy the problem.</seg>
<seg id=915> At the same time, the Union continues to provide material support to these two countries, through its various programmes, namely TACIS.</seg>
<seg id=916> The honourable Member's question gives to the Presidency the opportunity to dispel some confusion.</seg>
<seg id=917> And I would add additional clarification: in these two texts, to strengthen the penal framework to combat organised criminal networks of smugglers.</seg>
<seg id=918> In the report that the Council of Ministers has adopted on 21 September Turkish reform programme, as part of the legislative changes in the number of projects: the measures to strengthen civil code real equality of men and women in the areas over-exerting: better combating violence; better family condemn these acts of violence, through the creation of specialised family judges and ban the possibility of a penalty reduction for crime of honour.</seg>
<seg id=919> Therefore, the Presidency has no answer on this point.</seg>
<seg id=920> Next week, there will be a meeting of the European Conference, to my invitation, in France, in other words with the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=921> Do you believe that the Austrian 'model', namely the bilateral majority decisions in the future, will be an instrument to take decisions by ignoring the European institutions and to establish a new institution, or a new group, in order to circumvent the unanimity rule in the Council?</seg>
<seg id=922> The Council has not received this letter but the Presidency has, of course, replied to Mr Cem. The terms of this response has been communicated to all the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=923> What it does the President-in-Office see the position of Mr Cem, Mr Moscovici has not responded to this - which claims that it is not possible to take account of the Cyprus issue, if we want to promote the partnership between Turkey and the European Union?</seg>
<seg id=924> We must be aware that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than just a fisheries agreement and, as he knows, if we were able to such an agreement, and all that implies, it could hide a deterioration in relations between the European Union and Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=925> And it is for this reason that I wish to express my scepticism on the outcome.</seg>
<seg id=926> With regard to the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that this principle must allow the strengthening of the cooperation of the Member States, but also on the protection of the rights of people.</seg>
<seg id=927> The supplementary questions should be raised by other Members.</seg>
<seg id=928> Furthermore, the Commission, in the communication that it has adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union's oil supply, indicates that it intends to submit to the European Council in Gothenburg, a plan of energy savings and diversification of energy sources, which should help to enhance energy efficiency, particularly in buildings and transport.</seg>
<seg id=929> In this spirit, we have launched, during the vote on the resolution on the embargo, within the framework of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on 9 November, an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with the international bodies which defend human rights.</seg>
<seg id=930> It is therefore up to NATO to take the measures it deems necessary to ensure that cannot happen again.</seg>
<seg id=931> (The sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=932> When we speak of money, those who give this money have the privilege to clearly define the political objectives, and this is what the Commissioner has always done.</seg>
<seg id=933> That presence, in principle, can open a new perspective for the whole of the policy we are pursuing.</seg>
<seg id=934> If we look at the region as a region of political power, we will be on the wrong track.</seg>
<seg id=935> Parliament must be consulted and informed regularly; this is the second request of the rapporteurs, request that we should all support.</seg>
<seg id=936> The Heads of Government have also confirmed the determination of the Union to support this process by means of a technical and financial assistance.</seg>
<seg id=937> It is Parliament that has supported the Commission's proposal to create the European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=938> As the House knows, we do not think it is necessary to establish an explicit reference to this in the Rules of Procedure.</seg>
<seg id=939> The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=940> The leaders have agreed to extend and update the framework of cooperation, which is the Euro-Asian 2000 work programme for the next ten years.</seg>
<seg id=941> I believe that this reminds us, in Europe, the important role that we play in Asia, and not only in the area of the economy and trade, but we should point out that one of the reasons for the restoration of Asia is the fact that we have kept our promises to keep our markets open to Asian exports over the last two years.</seg>
<seg id=942> I believe that this was a very good political statement, but we still have a few problems to solve.</seg>
<seg id=943> We know that the Commission sees the ASEM seriously, and we strongly support in this attitude.</seg>
<seg id=944> It is necessary to improve the existing mechanisms at the level of the transposition of Community law in order to increase legal certainty and overcome the current delays.</seg>
<seg id=945> It should, therefore, encourage the creation of new regional organisations, starting where there is already a Community presence, as is the case in the Western Pacific and the Southern Pacific.</seg>
<seg id=946> This will be vital for the sustainability of fisheries.</seg>
<seg id=947> I believe that the future of fishing in international waters depends on these organisations and all the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, amount to little. To defend the position of the United Nations, both in the Convention of 1982 and the New York, which has been mentioned here, our presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing must be very active.</seg>
<seg id=948> That is why I believe that the Commission can play a leading role in going on the ground and encouraging fishermen to cooperate with it and to propose a solution to which we can all agree.</seg>
<seg id=949> Furthermore, the Commission must accept a number of tasks in the field of the negotiations which must be conducted within the framework of the RFOs.</seg>
<seg id=950> Mr President, I meet the same problem that Mr Nicholson, but in a form still more acute.</seg>
<seg id=951> Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the solutions advocated by the Committee on Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=952> Sometimes we come to ask ourselves whether the cyclical crisis in the market is not, in a certain extent, the outcome of the speculative action of corporate structures, thus ensuring the control of the sector according to their interests.</seg>
<seg id=953> The EU's supplementary aid proposed by Mr Garot in his report is, in my view, contrary to the good sense in the years of Agenda 2000, of enlargement to the Central and Eastern Europe and the reform of agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=954> I think it is quite remarkable that the rapporteur has shown here what we can do with a little when administration is a project, which is clearly stated in the report.</seg>
<seg id=955> On the one hand, the biggest producers or those who are integrated with the approval to take away from this system, but the systems they have already: individual savings bank lending, equalisation fund.</seg>
<seg id=956> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me say first of all that, in the end, and taking account of the Austrian agriculture, I welcome the Commission's proposal to set up a fund regulation.</seg>
<seg id=957> I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.</seg>
<seg id=958> I understand that we want a common organisation of the markets in the sector of intensive farming and a dismantling of agricultural policy, since it is part of the territory, where production is part of the territory.</seg>
<seg id=959> There is already a COM in beef and pork, and we must not make the mistake of the question then that, basically, it works well.</seg>
<seg id=960> According to the Commission, it is right not to submit to a discipline that farmers participating in the funds regulation, because they receive in exchange some guarantee of income, while those who are not part of the funds do not receive this guarantee.</seg>
<seg id=961> (The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=962> The resources from the value-added tax represent 36% and the traditional own resources to 15%.</seg>
<seg id=963> Another element of the reform is also closely linked to a priority identified by the Court; it is more important to give the assessment of results and performance in the context of a distribution of resources reflecting predetermined priorities and clearly defined targets and measurable.</seg>
<seg id=964> This is a good thing, and I would like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, and the members of the Court of Auditors and the Court of Auditors, to support the reform of the Commission with this report.</seg>
<seg id=965> In this connection, it is also, I would like to inform you that, for the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we have proposed to amend the Treaty so that we can create a European Public Prosecutor to combat fraud affecting the financial interests of the Community and I very much hope that this proposal will not simply be adopted at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice or crept under the carpet, but that we will debate it seriously.</seg>
<seg id=966> The reality described in the annual report is rather disappointing.</seg>
<seg id=967> The number of errors is too high for such a guarantee.</seg>
<seg id=968> The amount used for equipment of 240 million is too low.</seg>
<seg id=969> I would also have liked to see the report of the Court of Auditors was a little more user-friendly and that it had tabled a number of clear recommendations - for example, a chapter or two recommendations.</seg>
<seg id=970> A convention on the protection of the financial interests of the EU was adopted in 1995.</seg>
<seg id=971> The Commission and the Member States should look in this direction and exploit its conclusions in order to strengthen the effectiveness of their methods of management of EU finances.</seg>
<seg id=972> I know that this report and the work that Parliament is about to begin in the context of the discharge procedure will contribute to greater vigilance in respect of Community expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=973> At the moment, I would like to silence, Madam President, and expect that a member of the Council to come here.</seg>
<seg id=974> As in the previous years, the Court has not arrived to identify exactly the shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id=975> Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union approach and the Court of Auditors' report clearly shows that there is still a lot of work to be done, even in the accession countries.</seg>
<seg id=976> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have recently concluded an agreement with the Court of Auditors, who was to be able to obtain in advance information on the report of the Court and to remain silent about this.</seg>
<seg id=977> I would also like to 'harassing' the Council and ask him why the situation does not move forward on Article 24 of the Financial Regulation.</seg>
<seg id=978> Perhaps a European common sense will solve the problem and give George Bush the place he deserves in history - the dustbin!</seg>
<seg id=979> We do not have to look for scapegoats, in our institutions and in our Member States.</seg>
<seg id=980> First of all, on the procedure for presentation of the annual report to Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am pleased to hear that Members consider that the situation this year is more than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id=981> In any event, we shall have the opportunity to examine.</seg>
<seg id=982> When the audit justification, we mention everything that should be done.</seg>
<seg id=983> Ladies and gentlemen, as you have noticed, the last part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors has been the victim of an unfortunate virus, which has meetings between his speech and this House.</seg>
<seg id=984> Some amendments, such as Amendments Nos 1 and 18, relate to issues of concern to fundamentally the United Kingdom and it must be said that all the groups in the United Kingdom, that they are socialist, popular or green, have defended with great vehemence and they have been approved by the Committee on the Environment.</seg>
<seg id=985> Mr President, in March of this year, we voted in favour of the directive on the funicular railways for passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id=986> We believe that, in this case, the manufacturer's obligations arising from the law on the safety of products must not overstretch trade.</seg>
<seg id=987> We have heard the justification for them and for the resumption of industrial arguments raised in committee.</seg>
<seg id=988> Given that the vendor is able to inform each time the buyer of the nature of the goods and reservations about the information that should be enough.</seg>
<seg id=989> Finally, I have a final brief point to ask the European Commission on Article 4 relating to European standards and to the question of whether these standards must be published.</seg>
<seg id=990> I am satisfied with the exceptions that are made for charity shops and non-profit organisations as well as for second-hand goods sold in markets and in the context of sale.</seg>
<seg id=991> The reliability of the safety of products and after-sales assistance represent an added value for the European label at a particularly difficult time and crucial.</seg>
<seg id=992> If we call on the Commission to submit a proposal in the near future on the safety of services, we do not see why we should and would like to regulate here and now the aspects relating to services, rather than wait for the Commission proposal, because we can already foresee that the difficulties of division of different regulations arise and that the legal uncertainty will increase with time.</seg>
<seg id=993> A few words on the main aspects of this proposal.</seg>
<seg id=994> We are now being offered to open the system to third countries, in particular to the applicant countries: simplification of procedures for the emergency measures at Community level in order to be able to provide a rapid response on the advice of a regulatory committee.</seg>
<seg id=995> This new demand does not entail any additional important responsibility in the case of this kind of shop assistants.</seg>
<seg id=996> Replacing the word "producer" with the word "supplier ', as proposed in Amendment No 11, provide more confusion than clarity, given that the directive offers no definition of the word' supplier '.</seg>
<seg id=997> Although the Commission is in favour of a rapid establishment of the network, the procedures must be discussed between Member States.</seg>
<seg id=998> Such designations can always be used as evidence but cannot be regarded as intrinsically reliable.</seg>
<seg id=999> Having explained why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 to 30, 32, 33, 36, 34 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31, 35 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, since these amendments represent an improvement and clarification of the Commission's proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1000> Of course, for Mr Barón Crespo, an Italian Socialists cannot be part of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.</seg>
<seg id=1001> In my opinion, there is no contradiction between Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37.</seg>
<seg id=1002> With regard to the agenda, I leave it to the President to decide, and I would remind you that I am against, in any case, on each of the three amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1003> The Mediterranean countries outside the European Union are facing, it is true, particularly acute problems of economic development. There is a constant tension due to the inequalities between the regions.</seg>
<seg id=1004> With regard to respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, in the spirit of a harmonised European policy on immigration, in addition to the legal instruments designed to guarantee them equal treatment, we need to create the instruments of financial aid for all those young people who, having completed a degree, higher or university in the European countries would like to return to their country of origin to start a professional activity.</seg>
<seg id=1005> I would like to highlight an important factor, quite frankly, that I consider crucial to tackle this problem: I refer to inequality in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=1006> Although belatedly, the Commission has presented a programme on Community strategy in the field of equality between men and women (2001-2005), which has many of the previous programmes, particularly of the fourth action programme, which ends at the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id=1007> Despite these reservations, I voted for this report, firstly because it has been taken on board several amendments of my group and, secondly, because the report calls for studies on the situation of women in the national labour markets and the insufficient access to social security systems, there are two issues where we need relevant statistics, sorted by gender.</seg>
<seg id=1008> My party has serious reservations about the regulation of the sale of consumer goods by means of Community legislation, just as it expresses reservations about the concept of mutual recognition of standards.</seg>
<seg id=1009> This misunderstanding is now cleared, Labour and the amendments can offer a guarantee not to touch of charity shops and see them excluded from the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1010> Finally, Amendment No 15 gives the Commission a free hand to the language regime of the agency, what we consider to be very worrying.</seg>
<seg id=1011> The simplification of the decision-making procedure, the creation of decentralised operational centres (and not only in Pristina, which is equivalent to the separate of Yugoslavia) and the management of the dual structure between the Management Board and the Commission can be positive measures to combat the important bureaucratic shortcomings of the European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=1012> We are therefore voting against the Commission proposal and against Parliament's report.</seg>
<seg id=1013> A adaptation of existing Community regulations in this area can therefore be regarded as justified.</seg>
<seg id=1014> In addition, the funds are co-financed by the Member States make it possible to grant state aid more or less concealed.</seg>
<seg id=1015> In spite of its serious shortcomings, the Morillon report is clearly further than the Commission proposal on the partnership between the European Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1016> We have voted against it.</seg>
<seg id=1017> Like the rapporteur, we must admit that Turkey has made progress on certain plans and that positive signals exist.</seg>
<seg id=1018> Since 1987, Parliament itself was committed to the path of recognition, and the adoption of this amendment demonstrates the consistency of Parliament on this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1019> The Union must make more proposals and develop the accession of Turkey as an essential geopolitical strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1020> Such ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1021> For several years, as a member of the Delegation for relations with Canada, I have seen the functioning of these regional organisations, the NAFO Fisheries Organisation (the North-West Atlantic), which involves the Member States of the region, including Canada, and all those who use in traditional fishing areas, including France, Spain and other European countries.</seg>
<seg id=1022> It will only be pleased that when gunboats of its own fleet, under European flags, will enforce its policy on fishing.</seg>
<seg id=1023> The important thing is not to satisfy the desire for hegemony of the Commission in weakening the position of Europe, which would be entirely contrary to the correct implementation of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=1024> Finally, after difficult negotiations, we have reached a final result that it is worth defending.</seg>
<seg id=1025> For example, this proposal, which aims to replace three directives on the incineration of waste, is designed to improve the quality of the air, water, soil, the health of people, by reducing the emissions of pollutants related to the activities of incineration and co-incineration, including dioxins and furanes and heavy metals.</seg>
<seg id=1026> But I think that it should also be pointed out - and this is something new - that it is not only the emission of these substances in the air; it also concerns the release into the land and water.</seg>
<seg id=1027> The proposal has been improved during the various tests.</seg>
<seg id=1028> The introduction of stricter limits for oxides of nitrogen for new installations such as the co-incineration in cement kilns is both a step and an incentive to reduce emissions, even if the proposed standards do not reflect the best available techniques.</seg>
<seg id=1029> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, forgive me - in particular Mr Blokland - for a few minutes late.</seg>
<seg id=1030> In conclusion, this directive is a major contribution to reducing the negative effects on the environment and the risks they pose to human health.</seg>
<seg id=1031> The European Parliament will do itself credit, on behalf of the rejection of discrimination and the fight against exclusion, and in respect of the responsibilities of all, to give strong impetus to the establishment of a mechanism that will exist in practice the essential principle of solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=1032> There are, however, major differences from one country to another; we lack, however, detailed statistics and comparable data which would make it possible to draw up a reliable state of the situation, to determine in which countries the systems are more efficient, and how, what are its weaknesses, etc. It is precisely the reason why my opinion, which was drawn up at the request of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, stresses that it is necessary, before we introduce some rules to general value, supplementary sickness insurance, the Commission to publish a Green Paper with all these data dispersed, who will have been dealt with, as well as the relevant information.</seg>
<seg id=1033> Until now, they were the subject of a certain taboos.</seg>
<seg id=1034> The risk of citizens in less good health and the elderly do not have full access to private insurance because of the high risk that they represent is unacceptable for the development of our society.</seg>
<seg id=1035> The other point of view, illustrated by the initial aim of the rapporteur and shared by many colleagues, is to promote regulations and codes of conduct needed to establish, between insurers, forms of mutual costs guaranteeing all the provision of good quality of care and to counter the risks of discriminatory practices and a selection of risks and customers.</seg>
<seg id=1036> It does not seem to me at all normal money that determines the round of transition in a queue.</seg>
<seg id=1037> The new proposal of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is to draw up a list in the form of a Green Paper and then to decide whether we need a directive or a recommendation, we believe it is fair.</seg>
<seg id=1038> A discussion is currently underway in the Netherlands about structural changes in the system.</seg>
<seg id=1039> On this basis, it is up to the Commission to take the initiative and to implement the specific key points which will serve the guidelines for the health systems of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1040> It is therefore unacceptable to consider a 'one size fits all' solution to the problem of health insurance.</seg>
<seg id=1041> That is why I think that we need to focus on the content of the report by Mr Rocard, whom we congratulate - which calls on the Commission the provision of a service, the drafting of a Green Paper which will enable us to know what the current state of insurance in the Member States and also look to the future.</seg>
<seg id=1042> The two systems are based on a model with three legs, the company and the private sector.</seg>
<seg id=1043> The European Union has already drawn up some regulation in the field of supplementary pensions.</seg>
<seg id=1044> Mr President, I would like to thank and congratulate Mr Rocard for his report and congratulate Mr Marinho on his committee 's opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1045> This study will form the basis of a communication from the Commission to the Council and Parliament containing initiatives or measures.</seg>
<seg id=1046> As regards the amendments of the Committee on Budgets, I am pleased to say that they have all been accepted.</seg>
<seg id=1047> We have lent our support to the characteristics of the programme, as the multi-faceted approach of the phenomenon, the measures in the field of health, education, housing, cohesion and complementarity with other policies, and the participation of non-governmental organisations, but also to people who are suffering social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1048> This means that we must use the bottom-up phases of the round to return to a situation of balance or surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1049> I would remind you that the last Ecofin Council has asked the Commission that the evaluation of the stability programmes next year to include precisely this aspect of the long term of public finances relating to the ageing of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1050> One of the positive characteristics of the programme of the Netherlands is the special attention paid - as I said earlier - to the impact of the ageing of the population on the public purse in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id=1051> Therefore, in the case of Germany, the consequence of the budget for the year 2000 will lead to a surplus of 1.5% of gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg id=1052> If we add to this the evolution of the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, we have a huge negative impact in terms of inflation.</seg>
<seg id=1053> On the other hand, they are intended to make compatible the public system of distribution with private capitalisation and, of course, they are also compatible with support for the creation of investment funds which could provide specific tax benefits in the long term and help to deal with the problem of ageing.</seg>
<seg id=1054> This is the third principle which guides us: the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg id=1055> It should be remembered that several regulatory proposals are currently under discussion, which will help to strengthen the effectiveness and relevance of the Community mechanism and, therefore, I hope, consumer confidence.</seg>
<seg id=1056> However, this does not justify any relatively low incidence.</seg>
<seg id=1057> Frankly, I was disappointed that Prime Minister Jospin makes no mention of the very positive role played by the Community in recent years in his speech yesterday.</seg>
<seg id=1058> We must clearly state the reasons for the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1059> The Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission is already giving the highest priority to supervision by the Member States in connection with the protection measures against BSE.</seg>
<seg id=1060> With regard to the safety of animal meal, let me remind you that there is already a wide range of controls to ensure that animal meal do not pose a risk of transmission of BSE.</seg>
<seg id=1061> Yes, difficult to believe that it may be, it took four years to get a measure that I regard as fundamental to the protection of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1062> Mr President of the Council, I would urge the Council finally to make known its position on the TSE regulation.</seg>
<seg id=1063> In the current situation, the only way to stop the cycle of transmission of BSE is a total ban on the use of animal meal.</seg>
<seg id=1064> In this connection, I would like to point out that the Liberal Group which I belong has tabled an amendment which I hope will be adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1065> The policies must be changed so that the real culprits of this crisis are penalised and that the specific decisions provide a first step towards the end of this tragic crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1066> We therefore need to be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id=1067> The labelling of beef which has been decided, which is a minimum labelling and which has only been in force for two and a half months ago, it will not be possible to trace the origin of animals properly and we have banned very late in the specified risk material.</seg>
<seg id=1068> It is important that the public should be fully informed on the characteristics of the test which I am talking about.</seg>
<seg id=1069> At the time, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you did nothing or almost, as your fellow human beings have done nothing about the fallout from Chernobyl, nothing about the AIDS epidemic, nothing about the contaminated blood, with the same reason: not to panic the public.</seg>
<seg id=1070> The French beef ban will lead to a massive increase in demand, but the supply is not unlimited and prices will be extraordinarily heavy pressure.</seg>
<seg id=1071> Consumers have lost confidence, and to combat this phenomenon, we must increase the BSE tests on cattle and sheep.</seg>
<seg id=1072> It seems to me to be more important to move in the direction of the Commission proposal, namely to ensure that animal meal meet the highest safety standards.</seg>
<seg id=1073> For the rest, I entirely agree - for once - with what my fellow Members, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs Grossetête, have said.</seg>
<seg id=1074> Come on, members of the Council and the Commission, you have a broad financial base for a policy.</seg>
<seg id=1075> We have to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id=1076> Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased to hear here in this Chamber, that it is vital to change the CAP.</seg>
<seg id=1077> We have condemned here with Jimmy Goldsmith.</seg>
<seg id=1078> The food must be safe.</seg>
<seg id=1079> I think it is exemplary that France is determined to take this step.</seg>
<seg id=1080> But we do not help them!</seg>
<seg id=1081> I am therefore surprised that the corpses are still used or processed in these conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1082> The inquiry Phillips on BSE has just been published in the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id=1083> I would suggest to the European Commission to apply the precautionary principle to the French beef.</seg>
<seg id=1084> We need to know today, since we are still in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what measures are to be taken.</seg>
<seg id=1085> Furthermore, I have listened carefully to all these proposals, I am not insensitive.</seg>
<seg id=1086> If the European citizens tell me that the legislation has not been properly or fully implemented, then we must perhaps réenvisager the issue, but not for scientific reasons to do so because the legislation has not been respected in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1087> The best way not to hear us, it is not to invite us.</seg>
<seg id=1088> The Commission considers that the first readmission agreements currently being negotiated with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco play an important role in the clarification and coordination of these policies.</seg>
<seg id=1089> What proposals will the Commission making in this area on the basis of Article 31 of the Union?</seg>
<seg id=1090> (The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=1091> During this period, the aim was to reduce the public deficit in order to obtain a more appropriate monetary policy, lower interest rates and greater growth.</seg>
<seg id=1092> I always say that the euro will not be introduced on 1 January 2002, but it is already in our pockets; we have with different fractionnaires currencies, but we already have in our pockets.</seg>
<seg id=1093> The ozone limits laid down in Directive 92 / 72 have not been exceeded in the capital, but it should be noted that no measures have been taken in the middle of the summer.</seg>
<seg id=1094> Subject: State aid in the audiovisual sector at a seminar of the French Presidency devoted to cultural industries, a representative of the Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission felt that the legal obligations were imposed on the investment channels of state aid to the very fact that these investments are made compulsory by the legislator.</seg>
<seg id=1095> It must be respected and protected.</seg>
<seg id=1096> However, this is not automatic, because this new growth is very unequal and can go hand in hand, as we have seen in the United States for the last ten years, persistent phenomena of insecurity, exclusion, poverty, urban ghettos.</seg>
<seg id=1097> The governments of the Member States have refused to accept this definition, which is a little too simple and far too vague.</seg>
<seg id=1098> And in difficult climate as a result, more and more people are no longer, are marginalised and excluded.</seg>
<seg id=1099> Mr President, we are very often in this House, such a tune, the glorification of the European social model, the social market economy, we reject pride - as many believe - the savage model of the United States of America.</seg>
<seg id=1100> (The technical)</seg>
<seg id=1101> This is a huge figure.</seg>
<seg id=1102> Moreover, it is all political levels which must be involved.</seg>
<seg id=1103> I support the need to be better informed about the causes of poverty, I support the preventive action against exclusion as a result of mergers, relocations, industrial change, rural desertification, urban hyperconcentration, with the aid of innovative and practical responses, involving the social partners, local and national administrations, as well as the joint action of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1104> We have witnessed a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and the role of social and structural reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1105> It is a problem form due to the fact that, in the Treaty, it is only referred to social exclusion and not to poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1106> I believe that these proposals are a pragmatic response to your request.</seg>
<seg id=1107> However, an approval of the overall strategy does not necessarily mean approval of the proposal in detail.</seg>
<seg id=1108> If we create a clear framework and binding on the Member States, the various systems to meet these requirements should have a longer period of put to the test.</seg>
<seg id=1109> Renewable energy will not become a panacea for solving this problem, but nobody doubts that they can contribute to a large extent, to the remedy, to diversify the sources of energy and to reduce our dependence on oil, which, furthermore, do not dérangerait at all.</seg>
<seg id=1110> I shall now comment on three of our requirements.</seg>
<seg id=1111> Making realistic targets can therefore only strengthen public confidence in energy policy to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id=1112> I believe that a strong policy in the field of renewable energies is a symbol for the Europe of tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id=1113> Finally, the European countries must prove through these agreements they will contribute to the achievement of the Kyoto objectives.</seg>
<seg id=1114> It is a pity to exclude any category of waste which can contribute to the overall production of energy from waste – whether for smaller-scale projects or within the framework of a more comprehensive calculation.</seg>
<seg id=1115> The formation of the volume of peat by photosynthèse and in the production of wood waste is similar to those other biomassbased energy.</seg>
<seg id=1116> Finally, I would like to inform Mr Chichester that in my region, there is already a draft windmills well advanced and that it looks promising and I invite him to come to realize this itself.</seg>
<seg id=1117> The debate on the abandonment of nuclear energy, Sweden and Germany, for example, has shown that, without a possible alternative energies which are environmentally friendly and competitive, the discussion is short. It is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=1118> That is why the Member States must impose binding targets.</seg>
<seg id=1119> I am therefore optimistic about the future potential of renewable energy, provided that the appropriate incentives are put in place.</seg>
<seg id=1120> I believe that it requires a great deal of courage to give renewable energy the place it deserves.</seg>
<seg id=1121> There is no doubt that a very sharp increase in the price of oil presents us more brutally with the problems linked to our energy dependency on fossil energy sources.</seg>
<seg id=1122> Consequently, we cannot accept Amendment No 28.</seg>
<seg id=1123> However, the Commission does not forget that the terms used does not prejudge its right of initiative and that they should be compatible with the single market in electricity.</seg>
<seg id=1124> On 26 participants, the Committee on national reconciliation Tajikistan has only one woman, while the country has 25 000 widows.</seg>
<seg id=1125> Studies have shown that the presence of women in the ranks of the peacekeeping forces of the United Nations, albeit in a limited way, improves relations with the local people and the general moral.</seg>
<seg id=1126> The report Theorin deals with this topic in detail and contains many repetitions that we are asking, as the Group of the European People ’ s Party and European Democrats, to delete in order to draw up an official document.</seg>
<seg id=1127> From a political point of view, I see in Amendment No 19 failure or a tactical withdrawal rather than a compromise in terms of content, which should, in any case be unworthy of women.</seg>
<seg id=1128> They have been held prisoner.</seg>
<seg id=1129> Then the example of Portugal, where the doors of diplomacy are open to women that after the "Revolution of April in 1974. 'Our ambassador in Indonesia, Mrs Ana Gomes, showed recently in West Timor that the role of a woman and its awareness of the problems and the suffering of a people, who has addressed only a long struggle for 25 years for freedom, can be seen by everyone and especially by the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1130> Very few Member States have done to date. I am told that there are two or three.</seg>
<seg id=1131> That is why we must also, in future, take account of this dimension in the development of policies of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1132> Unfortunately, the report does not define this concept, any more than it establishes distinctions.</seg>
<seg id=1133> Please pass our protest to the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1134> They have different experiences, which are essential to the way in which politics is exercised, especially when it comes to manage crises.</seg>
<seg id=1135> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1136> I will now move on to the second point. If to regulate the sector, we must obviously examine a number of points.</seg>
<seg id=1137> In recent weeks, I have discovered a strong interest on the part of both international trade union circles that a number of trade unions.</seg>
<seg id=1138> My second objection. You are therefore in favour of the payment of a salary for women in the home?</seg>
<seg id=1139> All those who are currently working on the black market to obtain an employment in decent social conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1140> Furthermore, this project has also enabled two to three families to regroup to create a use of domestic aid.</seg>
<seg id=1141> We were put together in plenary in this first part-session of October, when we learned at the time of our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia, the courageous reaction of the Serbian nation and immediately, you will remember, ladies and gentlemen, we have asked for a waiver of international sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=1142> In so doing, Europe has demonstrated the vitality of its civilisation in the history of the world and a forward-looking creative political capacity.</seg>
<seg id=1143> There can be no doubt that the status of Kosovo is a question of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1144> Furthermore, we would have a chance to demonstrate to the Europe that we are in a position to develop the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia, recognising the real democratic principles.</seg>
<seg id=1145> I must say that I was - in listening to you - extremely impressed by your mastery of a very difficult situation, as well as by your determination.</seg>
<seg id=1146> This will be done in the next Minutes, Mr Watson.</seg>
<seg id=1147> Access to documents and information regarding the activities of the institutions enables citizens to the institutions of the European Union to prove their responsibilities and stimulates greater efficiency.</seg>
<seg id=1148> A fifth amendment important, in my view, is that on the annual report which should also deal with the documents to remain secret, or at least that remain secret.</seg>
<seg id=1149> It is not clear on this point, and it is not impossible that can also remain in force of the provisions more restrictive. It is particularly on this point that we have tabled some amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1150> The Committee on Foreign Affairs, for its part, is opposed to the idea that the documents relating to issues of foreign and security policy should be an automatic and comprehensive, an exception to the rule of law in public.</seg>
<seg id=1151> If we want the citizens to defend their rights, these information centres are properly trained staff who are in some way by the citizens in search of information and they serve as a guide to the complex labyrinth of the institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1152> These are essential if we want to ensure that the transparency is more transparency to the initiated.</seg>
<seg id=1153> It is gratifying that Parliament has managed to gather a large majority in favour of greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id=1154> Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1155> Mr President, openness and transparency in the European Union do not appear in a positive light.</seg>
<seg id=1156> If that is the case, this would be a bad calculation, it is the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the people who are at stake here.</seg>
<seg id=1157> The concept of documents takes many forms these days and we will ensure that access is the widest possible for the greatest possible number of documents and for the various types of documents.</seg>
<seg id=1158> Mr President, we can hear the views of the Commission in the field of public access to documents from the internal manual, which was submitted on 11 October, the Commission's officials in order to explain how to deal with the requests made by Members as regards access to documents.</seg>
<seg id=1159> This Regulation must be abolished or at least be supplemented by the obligation to take account of the interests at stake.</seg>
<seg id=1160> The old models of international cooperation with all their old habits and rules of the diplomatic game in which everything is happening behind closed doors are no longer valid in the type of modern cooperation that has become the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1161> We must not be confused with this objective and the role of Parliament, nor to future interinstitutional agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1162> I believe that a step forward has been taken towards the possibility for the citizens to exercise their right to information and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1163> It is not the only one, however, that I would like to thank Mrs Maij-Weggen, of the PPE-DE Group, and through the enhanced Hughes procedure is the second author of the report, also deserves considerable thanks.</seg>
<seg id=1164> Transparency must become the mainstay of all the activities of the European Union, but the right of access to documents is not enough in itself to make transparency a reality.</seg>
<seg id=1165> The European Parliament therefore request that the European security and defence policy is in future integrated into the structures of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1166> In his speech to Parliament, on 3 October, President Prodi referred to the institutional triangle and pointed out that, in a European system based on checks and balances, the flexibility of the operation of each institution contributed to the common interest.</seg>
<seg id=1167> I must admit that the great challenge of this regulation is to give a precise definition of the documents.</seg>
<seg id=1168> I would like to point out that the Commission could, when the time comes, almost all the amendments, such as Amendments Nos 9, 18 and 21 in part, and Amendments Nos 23, 25, 26.1, 28 (f), 35, 38, 40.1, 40.6 41.1, 42, 43.1, 47, 49 and 52.</seg>
<seg id=1169> I should vote sometimes in favour of the proposals made by the Commission, and for that reason it is essential that Members have a list of the amendments which the Commission can support and that of the amendments she does not support.</seg>
<seg id=1170> banks' own funds</seg>
<seg id=1171> Finally, and this is something which is most controversial, the committee has called vehemently to use the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1172> These amendments replace various proposals in the report, which will probably be rejected in the vote and which will therefore be replaced by the new amendments resulting from this consensus.</seg>
<seg id=1173> Mr President, in the light of the excellent vote of support that this report has received, and given the response of the Commission this morning, it is very clear - in view of all the parties on which we voted - on the basis of Article 69 (2), we should postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution, in order to enable us to engage in fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1174> Mr President, I am sorry to have said that the PPE-DE Group had also hoped that the vote evening postponed, but it is you, Mr Coordinateur, who came to tell me that you prefer that the matter be postponed until the second November part-session, rather than voting on this evening.</seg>
<seg id=1175> The reason why I would suggest that we call the vote is - as Mr Goepel said - that this is a very important issue.</seg>
<seg id=1176> I do not know how much it costs the roll-call vote, but it is without doubt hundreds of thousands of francs, or Belgian francs, of our budget.</seg>
<seg id=1177> I know that in France, the principle of slaughter of the whole herd has been applied and that this does not seem to be the best way to combat this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id=1178> to abolish the animal meal of animal feed, not only of cattle and sheep, but also by the pigs, poultry, fish.</seg>
<seg id=1179> This is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1180> It is with regulations such as those that consumers will be reassured and that farmers will hear the message of solidarity that we want to convey to them.</seg>
<seg id=1181> We must go further, as a matter of urgency, we need to change the common agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=1182> The ban on the use of animal meal for animal feed is only the first step in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1183> We very much regret, however, that the amendments tabled by our group were not adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1184> I believe that it would be appropriate for the working hours of those who work in enterprises pollutants to be reduced.</seg>
<seg id=1185> I shall conclude by repeating that the generalised use of hazardous waste must not be allowed to live with the production of such waste.</seg>
<seg id=1186> In fact, if pensions, for example, were less weak, there would be fewer poor.</seg>
<seg id=1187> The report includes a budget of EUR 100 million over five years to reduce poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1188> I fully support the proposal to set up a Luxembourg process bis in the field of social exclusion, with guidelines and national action plans.</seg>
<seg id=1189> Indeed, the report calls for the establishment of qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1190> In submitting its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission is responding to the appeal made by the Council to present 'by June 2000' a 'initiative for cooperation in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1191> Mr President, I abstained on a very specific reason: in my opinion, this report has not done, from the environmental point of view, the progress that I hoped and wanted.</seg>
<seg id=1192> I hope that such a system should be extended to all European cities.</seg>
<seg id=1193> Some of the proposals of the European Parliament are unrealistic and cannot receive my support.</seg>
<seg id=1194> We must also arrive in the future to make a better understanding of the best existing practices.</seg>
<seg id=1195> The high wages concerned about the environment are being given the opportunity, in a liberalized market, to contribute voluntarily to cleaner energy, while on the other, everything still remains as before.</seg>
<seg id=1196> The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1197> These three reasons are as follows: firstly, because it moves in the direction of the process of consolidating democracy and the strengthening of the requirement of respect for human rights, particularly with regard to the indigenous peoples.</seg>
<seg id=1198> Mr President, in this debate, we wish to express, as has rightly said the other Members who have spoken before me, solidarity and the support of this House in the parliament of Central America, at a time when we are fighting for keeping the priority in the framework of the European Union's foreign relations with the countries of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=1199> I am not the reservations that has been able to express our colleague and dear friend, the Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, Mr Seguro, as regards the issue of human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1200> Finally, in its dialogue with the authorities of Central America, the Commission once again stress the importance which must be given to the process of regional integration, as an instrument of consolidation of democracy and the development of the region.</seg>
<seg id=1201> To onto state power he did not hesitate to take the continuing debate on the 'ivoirity ’, causing an outbreak of xenophobia, hatred of the other, from abroad, Burkinabé or Malien, and yet there are many people who live and work on the ground in Côte d'Ivoire for many years.</seg>
<seg id=1202> The establishment of a genuine democracy in Côte d'Ivoire can now be done without the establishment of an independent committee of inquiry into the crimes committed and without the formal undertaking to ensure respect for human rights and civil peace.</seg>
<seg id=1203> Some people believe that the importance of democracy is on when it comes to Africa, that it is complex procedures, it should be left to the time of the time, and I believe that there is no compromise with democracy and the question which arises today for Côte d'Ivoire is the same as that which arises, for example, to Guinea, where we now know that there are people who are imprisoned and that there is no democratic system.</seg>
<seg id=1204> I shall conclude with the following: the dictatorships are being put in place, Mr President, because there are people who are suffering from poverty, which do not have access to knowledge, which do not have access to information.</seg>
<seg id=1205> It would be illogical that the European Union requires today of fresh presidential elections which all the candidates could participate in this time.</seg>
<seg id=1206> In very many parts of Africa, we are faced with very different ethnic and religious brassages.</seg>
<seg id=1207> These elections must enable the national political parties have been excluded during the presidential election and offset, and, if only partially, the imperfections of this first election.</seg>
<seg id=1208> on the situation in Burma.</seg>
<seg id=1209> The authorities are conducting a major offensive against the Karen and Shan peoples, and as the rapporteur pointed out by the United Nations, there is no sign of dialogue between the SDPC and the NLD.</seg>
<seg id=1210> That is why, we reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1211> I hope that by giving urgent priority to this issue, Parliament is sending out a clear message to the Burmese people that the desperate situation is not forgotten, that we are aware that in Burma is getting worse rather than better, and that we are determined to try to change the course of events.</seg>
<seg id=1212> It has taken a long time.</seg>
<seg id=1213> In Asia, the danger that the decoupled economic and political reforms, liberalisation and economic progress are emerging without liberalisation in the political sphere and without strengthening the rule of law, although I am of the opinion that, in the long term, the absence of the rule of law is detrimental to the trade, subsidies and investment.</seg>
<seg id=1214> Mr President, I can join the previous speakers on a number of key points, because many things that are happening in Vietnam today are unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1215> Nevertheless, the publication Human Rights Watch, that Mr Swoboda quoted, states that Vietnam has recently made some efforts to improve the situation from the point of view of human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1216> These documents give extremely confidential a curious on the wings of the policy pursued by the Vietnamese authorities.</seg>
<seg id=1217> The Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation can only be achieved through a dialogue between the military regime, the democratically elected opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg id=1218> The Vietnamese authorities also exert definite pressure on the press in the country for which it adopts a regime of self-censorship.</seg>
<seg id=1219> The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1220> We also call on the EU to give aid and assistance, not only in the south-west of England, but also to all the other affected areas.</seg>
<seg id=1221> I would ask you all to support our resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1222> It is urgent that the Union should not be confined to exceptional measures when the disasters are arrived.</seg>
<seg id=1223> The Commission has taken two initiatives in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1224> Mr President, a purely linguistic error has crept into one of the amendments to the joint resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1225> A postponement of the vote would mean a postponement of the mission entrusted to the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1226> (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1227> The report is based on the fact that a proportion of health insurance in Europe is covered by the supplementary sickness insurance.</seg>
<seg id=1228> I find it a little strange to now forcing the Commission to a motion for a resolution and ask him in the same time to draw up a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and health insurance complementary.</seg>
<seg id=1229> At a time when the ageing of the population is sensitive, it is essential that we seek to improve the health care system in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1230> We cannot, of course, not the sanction.</seg>
<seg id=1231> Mr President, there are undeniable arguments in favour of the accelerated procedure for the implementation of the review of Basel on capital adequacy.</seg>
<seg id=1232> With regard to the sense of urgency that Mrs Villiers has added to the feeling of need of the Commission in calling for an accelerated procedure for the adoption of these measures, it is obliged to note that the rapporteur himself acknowledges that this new regulation will be taken on anti-competition practices which, unfortunately, are rife in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1233> We must also ensure that the decisions taken in Basle do not lead, by an increase in own funds requirements, a second drawback for banks.</seg>
<seg id=1234> Having said that, I believe, and I would like to stress, that economic operators are also satisfied with the approach given to these regulations on capital, which strengthen the issues relating to the risk.</seg>
<seg id=1235> These are a few ideas on how we can achieve a legislative process quickly, verifiable and effective in the framework of the current rules of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1236> Indeed, the time has come to recognise that the institution of 'European Ombudsman' has sufficiently lived and that it has already provided enough proof of its maturity to have its own budget.</seg>
<seg id=1237> The PPE-DE Group supports the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is to say that the competences of the Ombudsman must be extended, and that the sooner the better, particularly in the field of the powers of investigation of the Ombudsman, set out in Article 3 of the 1994 decision.</seg>
<seg id=1238> An Ombudsman is, of course, subject to the rules of confidentiality, but for the citizens, it is good to know that the person who fulfils this role may have access to the documents to which them, as citizens, do not have access.</seg>
<seg id=1239> The report tabled was the recommendation by the Ombudsman to the Commission to allow the candidates and candidates competitions organised by it to consult their corrected papers.</seg>
<seg id=1240> We believe that the Community institutions should carry out their procedures for recruitment of staff, in fact that all the recruitment procedures, with a maximum of openness and transparency, so as to avoid any suspicion of bias, injustice or administrative incompetence.</seg>
<seg id=1241> I am referring to an amendment concerning the requirement of the testimony of an oral test, for example.</seg>
<seg id=1242> Mr Bösch has already explained briefly the amendments to the report.</seg>
<seg id=1243> I asked two questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal competitions, and I have received from it accurate and detailed answers.</seg>
<seg id=1244> This is the beginning of a process of openness and transparency in the form of government.</seg>
<seg id=1245> Firstly, the correction of examinations organised by the Commission are always anonymously.</seg>
<seg id=1246> It is, of course, of July 2000.</seg>
<seg id=1247> VOTE</seg>
<seg id=1248> (Parliament rejected the motion for a postponement of vote)</seg>
<seg id=1249> - (DE) In the assessment of the directive on the capital of credit institutions we need to look closely at various interests that are in conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1250> That is the way that has developed the idea of a European Police College for the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=1251> That is the position taken by the rapporteur and shared by the European People's Party.</seg>
<seg id=1252> The social situation in most Member States of the European Union is currently of this nature that the need for cross-border cooperation between the different police services is indeed important.</seg>
<seg id=1253> The majority of the speakers who have spoken so far seem to think that it is essential that the College has a permanent seat.</seg>
<seg id=1254> The umpteenth decision, but not precarious, the gift that the Council has used to do in this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1255> The rapporteur would like to see more crime prevention, aid and innovative developments and border surveillance and also wants to change internal security to include respect for the law and order.</seg>
<seg id=1256> These were the ideals that they propose and this is the kind of State for which they found.</seg>
<seg id=1257> I would be in favour of a balance of standards in certain Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1258> Since the first thoughts on this issue, which took place at European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission is committed to the Member States to promote action to develop what we could consider as a European police culture, based on the highest standards in the field of ethics, respect for freedoms and rights of citizens, and efficiency in the fight against crime.</seg>
<seg id=1259> It is rather for the development of a Police College mainly with a view to intergovernmental.</seg>
<seg id=1260> For the reasons outlined above, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report.</seg>
<seg id=1261> - (SV) I have voted against the report on the provisional establishment of the European Police College.</seg>
<seg id=1262> It is clear that many of our courts are very slow and cumbersome and that it is very difficult to act quickly to these problems.</seg>
<seg id=1263> Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, the fact that it is still linked to the Brussels II Regulation which excludes children whose parents are in, and children designed out of wedlock.</seg>
<seg id=1264> My mother was such a divorce and abduction there is 85 years and it is always talking about.</seg>
<seg id=1265> I would therefore like to tell Parliament that, in the action programme on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions in civil matters, which we hope it will be adopted before the end of this year, the Commission proposes that the first and the main priority should be given to extending the scope of application of the key regulation and, therefore, in this regulation on the right to visit, to cover without any discrimination children of married couples and the children of unmarried couples.</seg>
<seg id=1266> We shall now proceed to the vote</seg>
<seg id=1267> Nowadays, sport, it must be said - is closely linked to other economic sectors such as that of the audiovisual industry or the promotion and sale of products.</seg>
<seg id=1268> What we need is an intelligent and flexible way to interpret the existing rules.</seg>
<seg id=1269> In other words, an attack on democracy, even if we do not look at things from this point of view.</seg>
<seg id=1270> The Commission expects to receive soon have a response to its request for detailed information regarding the measures provided for by the British Government.</seg>
<seg id=1271> The proposal has been initiated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a statement made before the debate on the budget, six months before the full budget of the spring 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1272> Again, I thought that what was said by Mr Simpson has really served to reassure us as regards the likely intentions of the British Government.</seg>
<seg id=1273> Traffic jams we are not only lose a lot of time, but they are a problem for the whole of the environment and I therefore believe that if the British Government committed the necessary funds to solving these problems, it is for the benefit of everyone and in particular of all European citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1274> We are more or less the only oil producers of the European Union and yet we are facing the price of petrol and diesel the highest in all the countries of Europe - GBP 1,20 per litre of diesel in the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id=1275> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1276> The European Parliament must make them understand that it is on their side, and I propose, once again, to observe the minute's silence expressing our solidarity and our emotions.</seg>
<seg id=1277> Madam President, it is to fully support, since I am one of those who have requested the inclusion of this point.</seg>
<seg id=1278> We have made good progress.</seg>
<seg id=1279> The Union will deepen its relations with all the major groups and, as soon as possible, will contact the new American administration.</seg>
<seg id=1280> In view of the report by Mr Prescott surprisingly brilliant on the way in which he himself had negotiated, how is it that not only Mrs Voynet but also, I believe, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, most of the other European Ministers of the Environment have rejected this?</seg>
<seg id=1281> What we can fear is that the momentum will be lost, that the US negotiators do not change and that everything is to start in May.</seg>
<seg id=1282> This time, it is the forests which have proved to be the main stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id=1283> If this warming continues, part of the territory of the countries of the European Union will at sea or desert.</seg>
<seg id=1284> The standard of living is large and the price of oil products.</seg>
<seg id=1285> I congratulate Commissioner Wallström for the efforts she has made in The Hague and wish him to have more chance.</seg>
<seg id=1286> Without doubt, be better not just agree that have an agreement that is wrong and, in this case, the US proposal was a watered-down proposal, which is totally unacceptable for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1287> Climate change has major consequences in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=1288> I repeat this idea in its English text turns from being carbon sinks: Forest to carbon sources.</seg>
<seg id=1289> Only this credibility will enable the European Union to guide the rhetoric and the action of the COP 6 "B" in Bonn.</seg>
<seg id=1290> We must make our own assessment of what happened and prepare the documents in order to establish contacts with various parties and, of course, with the 'group umbrella'.</seg>
<seg id=1291> Of course, the result of the forthcoming COP 6 and the continuation of the COP 6 will be the ratification of an agreement in the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1292> Before the European Council, we will take even next Sunday, Pierre Moscovici and myself, a ministerial conclave, in which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, as well as a session of the IGC, on Monday on the occasion of the General Affairs Council.</seg>
<seg id=1293> The minimum number of Member States participating should be set at eight while the clause of the European Council, which is currently a real right of veto, would be replaced by a right of reference.</seg>
<seg id=1294> This may be regrettable, but I am obliged to make this observation.</seg>
<seg id=1295> The European Council will also be discussing the state of progress of accession negotiations, and therefore of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1296> The Lisbon European Council approved guidelines aimed at promoting a innovative and competitive European economy.</seg>
<seg id=1297> The protection of the consumer is a growing concern of Europeans, for obvious reasons that I do not need to develop.</seg>
<seg id=1298> We must be ready for this enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1299> That is, in the final analysis, the yardstick by which we will have to judge the Nice Summit.</seg>
<seg id=1300> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1301> The first is that the candidate countries must adopt and implement the acquis communautaire. This is the task that they share with us.</seg>
<seg id=1302> We are deeply attached to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we do not just want to the state.</seg>
<seg id=1303> Of course, the text could have been better, and we will be able to improve and clarify after Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1304> I find it simply unacceptable that several governments have purely and simply brushed aside the issue of the insertion of a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1305> You do not even want to incorporate into the Treaty, which proves that this text should be put to one side.</seg>
<seg id=1306> We will deal with a single voice disgracieuse within the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1307> Given the bleak prospects of the success of the Intergovernmental Conference, I believe that it would not be appropriate to add to the agenda this complex subject and controversial subject.</seg>
<seg id=1308> I appeal urgently to the French Presidency to do everything in its power to bridge this gap particularly destructive.</seg>
<seg id=1309> The Commission, in the field of trade policy, has drawn up a proposal which must be carefully examined.</seg>
<seg id=1310> Although the previous Treaty has made some progress in terms of the extension of the formula, it has also introduced this formula of codecision with unanimity for citizenship, social security, the rights of independent people, and also the cultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=1311> The simple fact that this issue has been raised in itself shows clearly the absence of a policy of strengthening the ties of mutual trust between the countries of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1312> It is precisely in this situation that the Intergovernmental Conference drags on for months, because no one wants to relinquish its hands.</seg>
<seg id=1313> The experience of this year has taught us that developments to make – after Nice, with a view to the future of Europe - the process of constitutionalisation of the Union must not be entrusted to the method now obsolete confidential negotiations between the representatives of the governments.</seg>
<seg id=1314> If the majority does not become the rule, the decision-making process inevitably will get bogged down, as Mr Prodi rightly pointed out.</seg>
<seg id=1315> If this aspect of subsidiarity is very important, we have not heard in today's debate.</seg>
<seg id=1316> That is what we have done, the enlargement of 1995 was adopted, we have moved the reflection group chaired by Carlos wisely Westerdorp, Amsterdam has arrived, we are today on the eve of the Nice Conference and the situation has hardly changed, Mr President: we are returning to institutional matters, without finding a solution that will enable us to complete a truly ambitious task, namely enlargement to 27.</seg>
<seg id=1317> Let us not add to the disappointment that is going to cause Nice, of course, if the Council proves unsuccessful, the great disappointment that our Parliament would cause among the peoples.</seg>
<seg id=1318> In the past, we have shown that it is possible to achieve this goal, and I come from a Member State which has benefited from a planned transition towards membership, I very much hope that we will succeed in an enlarged Europe and peace.</seg>
<seg id=1319> However, we must realise that, if you have the right of veto, all the others have too.</seg>
<seg id=1320> But there will have to be a first transition in view of the 2004 elections, because a number of new Member States will be joining us before or during this legislature, which is to run until 2009.</seg>
<seg id=1321> The President of the Council has discussed the question of closer cooperation and he said that we would move more towards a consensus on this issue.</seg>
<seg id=1322> Mr President, at first sight, Nice concerns the necessary reforms and on the leftovers in the context of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1323> If we were to have only a few features of this mentality, if we insist on the things that go wrong on our continent and a little more on the things that are going well, we would be a bit more pleased that at this time.</seg>
<seg id=1324> We must not only extend qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers in the transport of goods, we must include services, investment, intellectual property and competition associated with it and adapt accordingly Article 133 (1) of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1325> Indeed, the granting of such a right in the European Parliament would also free rein to the arbitrary nature of the party political ultra sensitive regarding this issue.</seg>
<seg id=1326> So we must also, as one of you, referring to the American optimism and the way in which the Americans speak for themselves, we must also be able to develop what works and what advance.</seg>
<seg id=1327> I would also like to say that I do not believe that there is a problem between large and small countries.</seg>
<seg id=1328> We have worked hard, but we have this old problem, and I do not believe that this development can be triggered by the movement of a single country, because we come up against the realities, once again, national, political, democratic, very strong in 12 of the 15 countries.</seg>
<seg id=1329> Finally, Mr President Védrine, you have raised a situation perhaps too tense and talk of a certain pessimism.</seg>
<seg id=1330> In general, could you take measures to improve safety so that such events cannot happen again?</seg>
<seg id=1331> I believe that we must take measures that we have never before taken until now, so that the guests of this Parliament feel here as hosts, and do not have to fear of threats.</seg>
<seg id=1332> Hospitalité here hospitality and respect there.</seg>
<seg id=1333> I would like to thank you for your contribution, Mr Tajani.</seg>
<seg id=1334> The best tribute to Ernest Lluch and his memory is to respect his message - dìaleg in Catalan. Can we all give it its chance in the Basque Country?</seg>
<seg id=1335> Of course, on the other hand, everyone can express their opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1336> B5-0550 / 2000 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Council, on the political situation and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=1337> When I speak of organisation, I am also thinking of the European Union which is making great efforts, and if which, in my opinion, should have to take responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=1338> Secondly, you will see in the resolution the very clear desire of Parliament to be based on security and defence policy on two pillars balanced: civil crisis management and, in the event of failure, the military, the two pillars are complementary.</seg>
<seg id=1339> Mr President, given the delay which has been taken and my duties, I shall try to shorten rather the speech I had prepared.</seg>
<seg id=1340> These relations will take the form of meetings between the Council of the North Atlantic and COPSI, and meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European countries candidates and / or allies.</seg>
<seg id=1341> Take, for example, what has happened in the Balkans, where we can say that everyone has played its full role.</seg>
<seg id=1342> We have also in this period kept very informed of developments in the United States over the title of the European security and defence policy, which is a sine qua non to develop harmoniously, as is currently the case.</seg>
<seg id=1343> The second edition of the annual report of the European Union on human rights has been submitted to the European Parliament. A forum on human rights will be held in Paris on 13 December.</seg>
<seg id=1344> This policy, you say, did not seek to compete with the Atlantic Alliance, which remains today the basis of the collective defence of its members, or to set up a permanent European army.</seg>
<seg id=1345> On the other hand, if I have mentioned the figure of 100 000 soldiers, this does not mean that we are trying to exceed the objective set at Helsinki, but that we have a reserve in qualifications and in different specialities which makes it possible to ensure that the 60 000 men on the objective of the Council would be achieved, whatever the operating conditions of their jobs.</seg>
<seg id=1346> Allow me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to raise in a few words the profound political importance, approved by a large part of public opinion, this new task in which Europe is becoming a tool of political influence it lacked.</seg>
<seg id=1347> The problem we are now facing is to ensure that, when we talk about consolidating the liberal democracy in Europe, we believe the whole of the European continent, as this is the aim of enlargement and the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=1348> We need to incorporate into a coherent whole three distinct elements: Community policies, the CFSP (including the ESDP) and the action of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1349> Despite our working procedures, we do not need a force of 60 000 men to achieve our goals.</seg>
<seg id=1350> We must therefore put in place a solution for the urgent humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id=1351> I do not agree with the cynical who say that Europe is thus a joujou unusable. Of course, it is true that, in many cases, the rapid reaction force cannot be channelled directly.</seg>
<seg id=1352> The EU should not have a permanent staff with own defence.</seg>
<seg id=1353> To conclude, I would express the deep concern that the members of my group and I feel with regard to the constant deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan, and I should like to urge the Commission and the Council to do their utmost to intensify efforts to achieve a peaceful solution and assist the civilian population, particularly at the moment, the approach of winter.</seg>
<seg id=1354> To put it very simply: where, when and under what conditions the European intervention force is going to take action in the future?</seg>
<seg id=1355> It makes it possible to understand the appalling record of these two months to intifada: 270 dead, most Palestinians, and nearly 10 000 injured, often disabled for life.</seg>
<seg id=1356> Hence his relentless efforts to set up an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction can no longer be a depressing one.</seg>
<seg id=1357> Secondly, contrary to what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it is possible or desirable that the European Union is doing more than it has done already in view of the conflict and the escalation of violence in the Middle East, particularly now, in this transitional period that cross the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1358> Mr President, in my speech I shall focus on the report by Mrs Lalumière report, which I think is well thought-out and clearly formulated.</seg>
<seg id=1359> But there is no political concept and there are still no real common foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=1360> The only problem is that so far, it has not managed to obtain the interest of public opinion for this type of action, despite the fact that they are considerably more sustainable and more effective.</seg>
<seg id=1361> Mr President, it remains, of course, to the budget and the question of how the divide.</seg>
<seg id=1362> I say this in spite of the apparent guarantees that have been miraculously made on this subject in recent days.</seg>
<seg id=1363> For the moment, the capacity is sadly lacking, and it will, at the end of the day, that the Member States relate to their defence spending programmes which differ greatly from one country to another.</seg>
<seg id=1364> Even those who are concerned about the usefulness that can result of a decision such as the one aimed at creating the so-called European army must consider the important political aspect of this decision and its influence on the cohesion of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1365> The presence of a Defence Minister for the first time in this House is such a historic event that we have entered the night sitting so that our Members are not too impressed.</seg>
<seg id=1366> For all of these conflicts, a non-military crisis management in terms of prevention is better than a military.</seg>
<seg id=1367> Russia is, in the long term, remain united in an undemocratic regime?</seg>
<seg id=1368> Therefore, Europe will not be a new alliance, as I have heard mentioned, I believe, with a development incomplètement informed.</seg>
<seg id=1369> I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure, to wind up this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1370> Given the scale of the task, four committees were involved and a new procedure has been established, with four parallel reports.</seg>
<seg id=1371> All the measures proposed in the White Paper should be helping to modernise and make effective the functioning of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1372> It would therefore be a good thing that the reform is the opportunity to limit their intervention in the only areas which do not involve expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1373> The differences of opinion that have arisen are not only political, but still reflect the cultural differences between the Fifteen Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1374> The new internal audit service, under your direct responsibility, Mr Kinnock, Vice-President responsible for reform, will take as main task the analysis of the functions and internal control systems which exist within the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1375> Working together has been a pleasure, and I believe that the fact that we were all four involved has deepened and enriched the process of dealing with a crucial reform of the Commission, which is essential for the future of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1376> They can expect to be transferred to other European institutions, to be freed from the national governments or to work in the private sector.</seg>
<seg id=1377> Therefore, our Committee on Constitutional Affairs rappelle-t-elle its attachment to a Commission strong, independent, efficient, transparent and politically responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1378> As the Committee on Budgets, we believe that activity-based budgeting is a problem on account of the lack of visibility of expenditure and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=1379> This will, quite evident, the goodwill of this Parliament in relation to the implementation of this reform with the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1380> Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1381> This is a disgrace when we think that the European Union is a champion of the modernisation of economic life.</seg>
<seg id=1382> Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteurs to support the work of the Commission, we have not yet made a global and coherent response from the Committee of Independent Experts, which is a policy of management and not only of better administration of the institution.</seg>
<seg id=1383> This change of attitude needs to be reflected in the transparency of the administration.</seg>
<seg id=1384> In my opinion, there is no structure whose importance is greatest. It is 15 nations, tomorrow, twenty or an entire continent, the most industrialised parts of the world who live in the Union, and for it, in the Commission and its structures.</seg>
<seg id=1385> The change is never easy.</seg>
<seg id=1386> In so doing, however, the Socialist Group believes that the current functioning of public administration is efficient enough.</seg>
<seg id=1387> The result is known and has to be the dedication and the competence of the majority of the members of the Commission and its administration.</seg>
<seg id=1388> Many thousands of applications of projects are awaiting an assessment for more than a year.</seg>
<seg id=1389> The debate, as we have seen, is not so much on the principles, objectives and desirability of the reform of the procedures, the pace, the timetable, the possible problems or the unwanted consequences of its implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1390> I would like to inform the House, as pointed out by Mr van Hulten earlier - that the meeting of the College this morning has adopted the proposal for an interinstitutional agreement establishing an advisory committee on standards governing public life, as set out in the action 1 of the action plan of the White Paper.</seg>
<seg id=1391> I think that Mr van Hulten has once again stressed this point during the debate.</seg>
<seg id=1392> The main aim of this overhaul is to simplify the procedures and increase transparency and strengthen the budgetary rules, which will result in practical terms by reducing the number of exceptions and special arrangements, incomprehensible and, accordingly, with greater efficiency in terms of the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg id=1393> It is indeed little for the Commission that the texts provide for a payment of 20% for the cost X and 30% for the costs Y and, secondly, that there are regrouping and verification of documentation for small amounts.</seg>
<seg id=1394> The next item is the report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations [2000 / 2051 (INI)].</seg>
<seg id=1395> These aspects are of particular interest to the NGOs.</seg>
<seg id=1396> Of course, this is not enough, but this must get to the heart of those cartoons on the weakness of our development aid.</seg>
<seg id=1397> We will return to this matter, because it is in itself a framework of quality.</seg>
<seg id=1398> Mr President, I returned today of Mozambique, where the European Union has provided humanitarian aid of high quality following the floods, but the reconstruction projects for which the funds have already been allocated are once again delayed pending a signature in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id=1399> Faced with these realities, the need for greater involvement and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is essential.</seg>
<seg id=1400> We now have a harmonised framework for the development of the country strategy papers and the indicative programmes of cooperation in all developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=1401> What is more, the creation of SEM has not brought an end to the disparity that existed between eight administrative resources volumineuses.</seg>
<seg id=1402> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, if I wanted to be with you today for this debate on the maritime first package in the European Parliament, it is because you are going to look at three important texts, which constitute a first essential step on a subject that the recent events have unfortunately put on the agenda of the topical and urgent subjects of major importance.</seg>
<seg id=1403> This could allow, moreover, from the point of view of the Presidency of the Council, to discuss with the Member States to obtain an agreement of the Council on the basis of your proposals and to adopt the text at first reading, if necessary by a qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=1404> This rapid response and targeted embodied by the two Erika packages of measures and the six proposals, has launched important momentum.</seg>
<seg id=1405> The lesson for us within this House in its debate this morning is that we are forced to conclude that the laws at sea are, in the world, in a state of control, and that we must get down to work to bring order.</seg>
<seg id=1406> We must send a clear signal to vessels which do not meet standards of safety and mean that we will do more in European waters or in European ports.</seg>
<seg id=1407> For small form, we adopt a compromise position between the ceiling of 5 000 tonnes that had set the IMO and 600 tonnes is set by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1408> These data should be made available to the European authorities, the Member States and port, and the public interest.</seg>
<seg id=1409> The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can have an impact on a wider region, requires the creation of a Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution.</seg>
<seg id=1410> The environmental organisations are also involved in the cooperation at local level.</seg>
<seg id=1411> Changing the directive in the direction of greater rigour in its application, harmonisation of legislation, particularly as regards the selection of ships under inspection, and the scope of the various types of inspection, is obviously positive.</seg>
<seg id=1412> I would also like to mention that the urgency that you referred to now has no place.</seg>
<seg id=1413> With regard to the ceiling on liability of classification societies, it is important in my view that the Council and Parliament should extend the reflection, regardless of what will be decided today.</seg>
<seg id=1414> A black box, a black list, all the things which we are active. But in spite of everything, I would like to highlight a few points.</seg>
<seg id=1415> Faced with this catastrophic situation and uncontrolled use of maritime transport, Europe has risen to the challenge and eleven months after the Erika, the European Union will be able to say that it never procedure has been worked out so quickly.</seg>
<seg id=1416> It recognises how the liberal logic is opposed to a high level of safety at sea.</seg>
<seg id=1417> Whatever, finally, the technical measures that will be taken, one of the major sources of insecurity will remain as it will not be rebalanced Nord-Atlantique Channel and in the area, the exponential growth of the traffic in the strangulation of North Sea ports.</seg>
<seg id=1418> It would be the honour of the President-in-Office of the Council to put things right, also in his own country.</seg>
<seg id=1419> Madam President, since the sinking of the oil tanker Erika, a package of measures, under political pressure, in order to improve the safety of ships at sea.</seg>
<seg id=1420> The Greek ships have sunk, without any storm in close, Mr Gayssot.</seg>
<seg id=1421> Thirdly, I believe that it is becoming clear, in this kind of area, that there is no relationship between our supply of oil on the one hand and the fact that we always use fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id=1422> Let us therefore have the political courage to our environmental ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1423> That means that, in this area more than any other, our responsibility is great and I believe we should silence all institutional self-esteem.</seg>
<seg id=1424> From Finland's point of view, for example, it is very important that Russia is an integral part of these agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1425> I believe both the strengthening of the requirements concerning the standards of construction of oil, the improvement of rules on the control of ports, and also, therefore, to tighten up the regulations on classification societies of vessels.</seg>
<seg id=1426> Madam President, we are now discussing maritime safety on the basis of three reports which I warmly congratulate the rapporteurs.</seg>
<seg id=1427> With regard to these three new proposals on maritime safety, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs who have, in a relatively short period of time, shown how our Parliament is determined to adopt new measures to improve safety at sea, controls, the standards of construction and shown that it is no longer tolerable that similar accidents occur again.</seg>
<seg id=1428> Madam President, our continent has recently been struck by a series of maritime disasters, involving particularly of oil tankers.</seg>
<seg id=1429> More than 80% of accidents are caused by human error, but there are reasons for human error, which are of social order.</seg>
<seg id=1430> One or a Member has used the term 'traceability'.</seg>
<seg id=1431> The directive on port state control is designed to verify compliance with international requirements and not to introduce new regulations.</seg>
<seg id=1432> Amendment No 18 links the port state control to rest periods of seafarers, even if the application of provisions on working hours of seafarers is fully covered by Directive 99 / 95.</seg>
<seg id=1433> I am pleased to see that the rapporteur has introduced a reference in Amendment No 21, the special system of control, and I gave our agreement with the main thrust of this approach, but insists that the wording must be refined in order to clarify things.</seg>
<seg id=1434> Amendment No 4 and the part of Amendment No 18 on recital K are not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1435> I can assure you that if a shipowner registering a ship to do under these flags, it would do well to think twice in the light of our proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1436> The Commissioner has spoken for 18 minutes, and for all this time, has mentioned dozens and dozens of articles, and it has rejected the Commission's position.</seg>
<seg id=1437> Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision on a series of actions relating to the trans-European network of collection, production and dissemination of statistics on the challenges of goods (EDICOM intra- and extra-Community) (COM (2000) 0458 - C5-0401 / 2000 - 2000 / 0201 (COD)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)</seg>
<seg id=1438> By withdrawing our resolution, I am, however, convinced that our Parliament would have done better by making its voice heard, in view of the Nice Council, a separate and specific resolution on the issues so important and so difficult for the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than treating them within the framework of a single resolution including also all the other items on the agenda of the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1439> (More than twelve Members standing, the oral amendment was not approved) (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1440> Report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI))</seg>
<seg id=1441> I voted against in protest against the fact that the European Union is not yet to intervene as it should be doing in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1442> Although the proposal to amend the existing directive on the control of ships and the Watts report do not meet the real needs, it is a step in the right direction. For these reasons, we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1443> It is therefore regrettable that the Commission proposal did not accept the idea of creating a genuine European supervisory body, along the lines of the coast guards' in the United States'.</seg>
<seg id=1444> The safety of ships, the protection of life at sea and the environment require that it is tackling the unaccountability of shipowners, that we take very tough measures for the control of the state of the ship and imposes harsh penalties ferry companies which violate the rules of safety, which improves the conditions of seafarers, that they are given appropriate training and guarantees in the number that meet the increased needs of vessels.</seg>
<seg id=1445> Unfortunately, the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, quite the opposite.</seg>
<seg id=1446> The sinking of the Erika accident in December 1999 has been the cause of the emergence of the issue of maritime safety in the Community policy agenda and that is under pressure from the European Parliament that the European Commission has proposed the texts we adopted today, almost a year after this sinister shipwreck.</seg>
<seg id=1447> The existing compensation fund has been badly serviced, and this became only too clearly in the case of the Braer disaster and the fishing industry in the Shetland Islands has been too little compensated in comparison with the damage.</seg>
<seg id=1448> I have already said, Madam President, that in the past I have had the opportunity to launch.</seg>
<seg id=1449> The rapporteur's proposals on the harmonisation at European level can only be positive.</seg>
<seg id=1450> It is an important aspect since it relates to the classification societies of vessels.</seg>
<seg id=1451> This would be a great success, because Europe we need, on the eve of enlargement, is not a supranational Europe rigid, disciplined, remote, but a Europe that is flexible and close to the people, based on respect for national democracies.</seg>
<seg id=1452> The struggle for power between more and more openly number of Member States cloud the prospect of possible compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1453> The Nice Summit will be primarily the task of guaranteeing the effectiveness of the EU institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1454> In a week of the summit, I personally hope!</seg>
<seg id=1455> I am not in favour of an automatic link between QMV and codecision, and, here too, I believe that any decision to extend the powers of codecision should be examined on a case-by-case basis.</seg>
<seg id=1456> By amending Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extend qualified majority voting, currently in force in the Council for the trade in products, in other areas such as public services, intellectual property, health or education.</seg>
<seg id=1457> For example, Parliament is forbidden to exert an influence, it falls to the voice and be silent on behalf of the party allegiance, national and government, and forgetting its obligations to its citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1458> I have also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty which will be adopted at Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1459> The fact that we share the Union A and B teams is a mistake, and I therefore reject the idea of allowing a third of the Member States to pre-empt the other.</seg>
<seg id=1460> Its fledgling role has put an end to the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.</seg>
<seg id=1461> There are many elements which the British Conservative Group can support in this report, in particular the insistence on the enlargement of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1462> The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have decided to support the report on the establishment of a common European policy in the field of security and defence.</seg>
<seg id=1463> But also against the peoples of the European Union which will, in any case, to fund new expenditure of arms which is the report and which will not even have the guarantee that these military forces are not a day used against them, in the name of "maintaining order".</seg>
<seg id=1464> It is also of that a Member State does not wish to participate in a mission should be forced to pay a financial contribution which will be distributed between the Member States participating in this war.</seg>
<seg id=1465> The external military means provide no solution, because it does not remove the causes of conflict and does not change the public.</seg>
<seg id=1466> · the fact that the military operations would be financed by a budget line of the Community and that the Member States have to contribute financially to the operations even if they do not wish to participate (paragraphs 49 and 50)</seg>
<seg id=1467> The EU should, on the contrary, to change the priorities set out in the framework of the Petersberg tasks, and it should concentrate its efforts on achieving civil and humanitarian tasks.</seg>
<seg id=1468> I support the report by my colleague Mrs Theorin 's.</seg>
<seg id=1469> But we do not refer to the needs of this category to move the request of a tax deductibility of domestic services' and 'adaptation of prices and costs to the financial possibilities individuals'.</seg>
<seg id=1470> It is quite incredible that we still have to recommend to the 21st century that the Member States can guarantee domestic employees the right to social security and pensions.</seg>
<seg id=1471> For many young people, the first contact with the labour market is likely to take the form of employment in the black economy.</seg>
<seg id=1472> The situation is worsening, when it comes to women distant countries who have accepted this work in need and which have no alternative to continue to meet their basic needs.</seg>
<seg id=1473> The reform of the Commission will be judged on coins, hence the need for regular monitoring reports that the European Commission will present throughout the duration of the programme and the importance of the full balance sheet expected in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id=1474> In the recent past, various scandals and mismanagement have led, in March 1999, to the resignation of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1475> Finally, I think it is vital to remember that, through this reform, which is essential for the future, we expect to be the more rigour and transparency of the Commission in its day-to-day management, but also a greater sense of responsibility for its part, within the strict framework of its powers.</seg>
<seg id=1476> The Conservatives should also support the statement in paragraph 7 of the report that we must ensure democratic control and operation of the system in three pillars.</seg>
<seg id=1477> (The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=1478> We have learned, and I would like to add that I cannot believe this - that the President of the Council and of the French Republic will be here tomorrow for thirty minutes, to take the floor.</seg>
<seg id=1479> Therefore, it seems possible that we have a thorough and detailed position.</seg>
<seg id=1480> Be that as it itself, let us vote, and I am in favour of a resolution as has been suggested by Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others.</seg>
<seg id=1481> We have worked on these texts in the night, as on the figures relating to the weighting of votes in the Council and the distribution of seats in this House.</seg>
<seg id=1482> Madam President, I would very much like to speak in favour of maintaining the report by Mr de Roo on the agenda because it has been very well prepared and must be the subject of a common position at the last Council of Environment Ministers of the French Presidency, which will be held on Monday and Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id=1483> Thank you, Mr Parish.</seg>
<seg id=1484> In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy - that Mr Brok chair - he smokes in sitting.</seg>
<seg id=1485> The political basis is clear: to harmonise the market, taking account of a high level of protection of public health and consumers, are based on the existing regulations and promoting the scientific point of view.</seg>
<seg id=1486> It is their conditions and design of life, in which the protection of health becomes increasingly important.</seg>
<seg id=1487> This rule can also apply to all drugs récréationnelles but dangerous as far as the consumer of drugs is the only to run risks.</seg>
<seg id=1488> Yesterday, in the United States, of the trial have been earned against the tobacco multinationals for poisoning and lie on the non-toxicité of products.</seg>
<seg id=1489> With regard to the export of the EU cigarettes banned, for health reasons, within the Union, we believe that the only sensible and logical solution is to put an end to it.</seg>
<seg id=1490> Rather than draw lessons from the collapse in Luxembourg, on 9 October, we are persevering in a legally indefensible.</seg>
<seg id=1491> I have carefully examined the statements made by the Commissioner addressed to my colleague, Mr Hume: 'massive loss of jobs in this sector.</seg>
<seg id=1492> It is up to Parliament and the Council to approve this proposal for a directive and to examine, among other things, its proper legal basis.</seg>
<seg id=1493> I do not think that we can move towards a too restricted, meaning that, regardless of the content, and of the substantive content that have highlighted Mr Maaten and others - there is a risk that, if this Parliament and the Council to accept the restrictive interpretation proposed by the leader of the European People's Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and all the Community institutions are tied at the level of the legislative development of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law.</seg>
<seg id=1494> The weak point in the proposal is that it places great emphasis on the promotion of free competition.</seg>
<seg id=1495> I say in conclusion that, since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has the power of coordination in the field of the environment and consumer protection, and that it will work, of course, in close cooperation with the Council and the Commission on these matters.</seg>
<seg id=1496> In fact, it has nothing to do with tobacco, but the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities could also have lead to a ban on alcohol advertising or for chocolate, since it is known that sugar can also be dangerous to health.</seg>
<seg id=1497> I do not really understand that a majority of Members might wish to be a relaxation of the rules on export in relation to the wishes expressed by the governments of the Member States - the governments which is also the many industrial circles concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1498> It is a fact that 80% of smokers want to stop, but the tobacco industry does little policies in place to help these smokers to stop.</seg>
<seg id=1499> If we are beginning to dictate to other countries the public health standards that they should apply in extending our proposals quite sensible for the internal market for exports, we shall endanger the excellent work done by Mr Maaten.</seg>
<seg id=1500> We are in favour of the application of a uniform test method recognised by all the countries of the EU, which must be implemented by a laboratory of authorised tests in a country.</seg>
<seg id=1501> The effects of tobacco consumption on health are today widely recognised, and the legislators and public opinion to share the same feeling that it is now time to adopt stringent rules and regulations for this product.</seg>
<seg id=1502> Consequently, the Community rules would be in harmony with the future international agreements, which we would avoid the danger of trade barriers and would strengthen the protection of consumers, whilst ensuring a high level of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1503> It would be better to wait until the question of additives is being dealt with in the context of the first report of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1504> As regards laboratory tests, Amendment No dealing with the approval of the tests is unnecessary since the other article, which guarantees the movement of goods which are in accordance with the provisions of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1505> Madam President, this report is all that is more simple: the directives on summer-time have only a period of validity of five years, after which they have to come back to this Parliament to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id=1506> of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on summer-time arrangements, which we are considering today, is a good proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1507> I therefore believe that we should not spend too much time on this subject, given that the Member States and the people have already widely accepted the regulation on summertime, and that it has been recognised as an integral part of our annual rate.</seg>
<seg id=1508> In my view, it is good that the issues of time zones and application of the directive on summer-time remain the competence of the Member States, as suggested in the proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1509> It would be more reasonable to put an end to the time of the end of September, around six months after its beginning.</seg>
<seg id=1510> It can nevertheless agree with the idea of making appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report by 2007 mentioned in Article 5.</seg>
<seg id=1511> It has been said that no trial leading to the changes to the genetic identity of the participating cannot be accepted.</seg>
<seg id=1512> If we approve it, we have a regulation which guarantees the therapeutic progress and not leave the protection of patients in the current state, but improves it. That is why I am in favour of this compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1513> These groups should be maintained within the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1514> I am also pleased that we have managed to provide safeguards against genetic and cell therapy.</seg>
<seg id=1515> I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his work, and thank him for the efforts he has made to reconcile opposing views.</seg>
<seg id=1516> These concern the fight against cancer, the prevention of AIDS, the prevention of drug addiction and health promotion, and their interruption would mean the end of the actions concerned and the work of the networks that have been put in place.</seg>
<seg id=1517> It is very advantageous to be able to advance the ground, so as to make as much progress as possible, to bring us greatly and, in cases where a second reading would be necessary, to ensure that we are almost at the point to decide.</seg>
<seg id=1518> In addition, we must not lose sight of the fact that both the prevention and the promotion that vigilance will be increasingly important and that it will therefore be necessary to provide them with bigger budgets and give them greater importance.</seg>
<seg id=1519> Madam President, following the Trakatellis report on the extension of certain existing European programmes in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about the direction in which European policy of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1520> According to my information, the Council has also given its agreement in principle.</seg>
<seg id=1521> In the European Union, paradoxically, the abolition of internal borders in order to promote the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is accompanied by the maintenance of 15 borders in the fields of police and criminal justice, which the Member States have difficulty in freeing themselves.</seg>
<seg id=1522> Finally, the initiative represents significant progress towards the creation of a European criminal judicial area, even though partial and limited, but it is a response to the real needs of a considerable mass of European citizens who, when they are victims of an offence outside the territory of their country of residence, has virtually no use.</seg>
<seg id=1523> What have we asked for these groups of people?</seg>
<seg id=1524> We must at the same time ensure special training of professionals in direct contact with the victims.</seg>
<seg id=1525> The victims must not become doubly victims, victims of crime suffered and victims of the system.</seg>
<seg id=1526> In this context, it is also important that parents, the victim's family, to be informed of the facts so discreet and professional if they have the desire and can also count on the necessary support, avoiding and all the details in the press.</seg>
<seg id=1527> This applies irrespective of the type of crime.</seg>
<seg id=1528> Whether it be at the level of the Member States, or that of the European Union, we must never deviate from the fundamental principle that every individual must always take responsibility for its actions.</seg>
<seg id=1529> In other cases, it may be possible to obtain the relevant information in a language of the Union which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id=1530> I am very satisfied with the response of Parliament to this first text on a subject which is so crucial, which allows the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building gradually to offer our citizens assistance in situations which are often difficult to live.</seg>
<seg id=1531> Vote on request for urgent procedure</seg>
<seg id=1532> (Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)</seg>
<seg id=1533> For example, in the night of 23 to 24 November, we have reached an agreement with the Council on the essential points of a budget, which is certainly not brilliant, but that is, however, reasonable.</seg>
<seg id=1534> The Commission had proposed a revision to the tune of EUR 300 million.</seg>
<seg id=1535> But I have also learned of the discussions that it is far more difficult to reach a negotiated position of the Council, to receive a mandate and purely national self-interest result in a common European decision remotely reasonable and justifiable.</seg>
<seg id=1536> I hope that the work for a common recruitment office, as we say in modern German, i.e. a European authority of recruitment, real progress, so that we can respond to the problems that occur in all the institutions - the Council and the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions, in the coming years, namely the need for staff.</seg>
<seg id=1537> The Council refuses to carry out this revision - and it seems that we should already have the data - and I should like to prevent: to use the flexibility instrument two consecutive years - indeed, in less than fifteen months and the first to less than six less than the approval of the financial perspectives – vacuum the flexibility instrument because it prevents it from its possible renewal and accumulation, which is provided for up to EUR 600 million.</seg>
<seg id=1538> This amount is very important, which responds to the existence of very high needs in 2001, can be funded thanks to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to the tune of EUR 200 million.</seg>
<seg id=1539> It is taking account of this new element that the Council has voted in second reading a budget increase of 2.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1540> Finally, before you proceeded to the final adoption of this budget, I would like to stress the Council 's commitment to respect certain basic budgetary rules, in terms of appropriations, the legal basis and classification of expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1541> And, contrary to Nice, the three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission - are all, I believe, satisfied with the end result.</seg>
<seg id=1542> Ladies and gentlemen, the reappearance of cattle BSE-free makes it necessary for immediate action in the budgetary context, and precisely for the protection of health, for consumer protection, but also for aid to the farmers affected by this situation.</seg>
<seg id=1543> Furthermore, the Council has defined, for the framework programme for reconstruction aid in the Western Balkans, a multiannual indicative amount, which is compatible with these financial perspectives.</seg>
<seg id=1544> In struggle, we have managed to achieve a few million.</seg>
<seg id=1545> I am very grateful to Mrs Haug.</seg>
<seg id=1546> We therefore believe that 1% of the European Union budget is put to good use.</seg>
<seg id=1547> If I understand correctly what you have said, we should not use the reserve because it is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id=1548> I therefore believe that we have seen very good things, in addition to many others, that I cannot mention now because of the short speaking time.</seg>
<seg id=1549> Although the agricultural appropriations, which represent almost half of the total budget increase of more than 5% even taking account of the letter of amendment, the total increase of the budget is 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1550> We already see now the great danger that the opposition is increasing in the coming years between MEDA, the projects for the countries of the Mediterranean and the Balkans, as we all know that there is an urgent need for funds in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1551> Satisfaits for having overcome the difficulties which made so closely the way towards the objective of fulfilling the commitments made in Helsinki with the applicant countries without undo the Union, to enable the Europe of tomorrow to continue to operate efficiently.</seg>
<seg id=1552> They are real, even if they do not go as far as the Presidency, which has shown, I note, at national level, with great openness - wanted.</seg>
<seg id=1553> A new legal basis is planned for the status of European political parties and Parliament is given the status of institutional applicants provided for in Article 230 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1554> In recent weeks, three important progress has been made.</seg>
<seg id=1555> That is the essence of the declaration adopted in Nice and the deliberations to coordinate at European level the fight against doping.</seg>
<seg id=1556> Among the threats, there is, as everyone knows, global warming.</seg>
<seg id=1557> In addition, in Nice, the European Union has put in place the necessary permanent bodies in defining and the conduct of a common foreign and security policy: a Political and Security Committee, a Military Committee and a European Staff.</seg>
<seg id=1558> For this cooperation, for your support and also for your reception, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency thank you.</seg>
<seg id=1559> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1560> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1561> We must now look carefully at the text in Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1562> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1563> I see this as a failure not only in relation to the declared ambition of the European Union to change the institutions to be able to welcome the new Member States in improving the efficiency of the European Union and I see this as a failure to another important aim, that we perhaps have too little mentioned, the approach of the European Union and the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1564> Good questions, it is in our view that has been raised the impressive human tide which, throughout Europe, has travelled to Nice on the eve of the summit.</seg>
<seg id=1565> First, the Member States have signed hastily and teargas the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=1566> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1567> My group is disappointed by this Treaty and concerned for the future that we prepare, as we would we with all our strength.</seg>
<seg id=1568> Mr President, you have the floor.</seg>
<seg id=1569> I have already replied on this point, and I entirely agree with what he said on the need to improve considerably the public debate, and I will not repeat what I said, but it is true that, all too often, citizens feel alienated to the decisions that are taken in bodies such as they do not know.</seg>
<seg id=1570> Mr President, I would like to know whether the power of the European Parliament in time were a new achievement of the Nice Summit.</seg>
<seg id=1571> Découragés until then by the complexity of clinical trials, laboratories may find, in the determination shown by the Member States and by our Parliament, the courage to develop the paediatric medicinal products market, even if it is not large enough to enable a return on investment.</seg>
<seg id=1572> Should we renew the change of an hour of which was set up at the time of the oil shocks, with a view to saving energy, which had been extended until 2001?</seg>
<seg id=1573> The victims are not always properly protected in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id=1574> Many travellers and tourists will therefore benefit from this European initiative.</seg>
<seg id=1575> Mr President, the time for me to welcome Mr President of the Commission, which is and the Presidency of the Council, and to emphasise that, probably never in this Parliament, has expressed such unanimity on the results of a summit.</seg>
<seg id=1576> In that way, is that, under the leadership of the French Presidency, in six months, has, I believe, done all his work on six main areas.</seg>
<seg id=1577> However, my greatest fear is that the United Kingdom, France and Germany are now in a position to reverse the delicate balance that existed between the Member States and between the institutions of different sizes for decades.</seg>
<seg id=1578> In fact, it is hard to see, in this decision of Nice, which is to facilitate enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1579> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be very brief today.</seg>
<seg id=1580> As a result of this, when we proceed to the vote on the Treaty of Nice, my vote can only be negative.</seg>
<seg id=1581> Mr President, the most important outcome of the meeting of Nice is the fact that we have reached an agreement, so that we can now prepare them for the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=1582> The real winners of this conference, Mr.</seg>
<seg id=1583> So, let us forget Nice, look after Nice - and you will permit me to put my hope in the draft great Convention put forward by Belgium for its Presidency, because the proof is made, we must turn the, we must change method, we must speed up the story: 2004 is too late, it is too far, it is too dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=1584> Instead the spirit which prevailed in Nice was instead to ask how making real progress in Europe, to ask how we could block, how it was possible to obtain a system of decision-making at intergovernmental level, how we could boast returned home, once again, to have been the defender of national interests.</seg>
<seg id=1585> This before what we are after Amsterdam and Nice, that is a Europe of princes, a Europe of national administrations, and not a Europe of political union.</seg>
<seg id=1586> We cannot continue without the decision by qualified majority on the key issues.</seg>
<seg id=1587> It is true that - I paraphraserai Mr Bayrou - I am on this platform for this morning, firstly with the President of the Republic, and then by myself and criticism mounts, it seems to me, moderate, friendly but criticism.</seg>
<seg id=1588> We must not forget that this is the first time, in fact, since 1957, that we reform and really revise the grid.</seg>
<seg id=1589> We are in the constitutional systems and the powers cannot be confused.</seg>
<seg id=1590> Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office.</seg>
<seg id=1591> But it has not been incorporated into the Treaties and has not been mentioned in Article 6 (2) of the Treaty on European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1592> Finally, there are some positive elements: the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty, the article on the political parties and their status, the right of this Parliament to translate the other institution before the Court of Justice - it is also an important element of political control, the new formula for the European Commission, which is what is known as the 'Prodi' law in the Treaty, which strengthens the President and the new composition of the Commission - a reasonable compromise, which I accept and which will work, in time, and, as my colleague, Mr Tsatsos, pointed out, the road to the future.</seg>
<seg id=1593> Mr President, we have already carried out a rigorous evaluation of what happened in Nice, but we should remember that Nice was a very limited agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1594> Let us note things: the Charter has not been included in the Treaties, it is not even mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=1595> We want to show the Heads of Government that we can do better.</seg>
<seg id=1596> Despite laudatory statements made himself this morning by the French Government, the IGC has not ended.</seg>
<seg id=1597> Mr President, the French Presidency is not present in this debate, it is not easy to criticise it.</seg>
<seg id=1598> Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the method of the Intergovernmental Conference.</seg>
<seg id=1599> 2001 budget (continuation)</seg>
<seg id=1600> This does not mean, however, that we could do more and better.</seg>
<seg id=1601> These maximum oblige the Commission to set priorities within the limits of a certain budget as any authority must do so.</seg>
<seg id=1602> The vote that will follow this debate will conclude a long and complex process of adoption of the European Union budget for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1603> That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by returning to Article 272; the financial perspectives have been maintained, even if we have used the flexibility instrument.</seg>
<seg id=1604> Let me just say to the Council that, on this issue, we have balloons and that, on this side, we intend to play as long as we have not got the right result.</seg>
<seg id=1605> We do not want to see a proposal for revision for next year is already included in the resolution Colom, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we share its critical view when she says that this way of solving the financial shortfall in Category 4 distorts the multi-annual nature of the great objectives outside the Union and the definition itself of the financial perspectives.</seg>
<seg id=1606> For this to be possible, we will have to define, in the future, of the priorities of major proportions.</seg>
<seg id=1607> Only in this way that the money that is available to our citizens, will be used properly and wisely.</seg>
<seg id=1608> If we add to this SAB, it almost seems to 8%, whereas in all the other areas - whether it be the policy of training, the entire field of international actions, including research, foreign policy, the administration and pre-accession aid, we have only a growth rate of 1.1%.</seg>
<seg id=1609> Since this cooperation is so good, certainly we will have the opportunity to continue in January, at the presentation of the supplementary budget.</seg>
<seg id=1610> The criticism of relations between Russia and the Baltic States which have not yet been satisfactorily resolved we also need.</seg>
<seg id=1611> We are following with great interest to the development of society and internal policy in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1612> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1613> Even if President Putin can guarantee the democratic development of his country, it is not automatically the guarantee of a stable and democratic Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1614> We must not be insidious, but instead build a Europe of economic cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1615> With regard to the Caucasus, Mr Van Orden is quite right.</seg>
<seg id=1616> If we look at Russia from outside and that we receive direct impressions promptly of the Russian interlocutors, there is the risk to speak on a selective basis of a Russian reality which is the image that we have made themselves of Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1617> In political terms, the common strategy proposes to Russia to initiate a permanent dialogue on the political and security and to create a permanent mechanism.</seg>
<seg id=1618> In this paragraph, I wanted to stress how important it is to stress the fact that Russia is really political union with Belarus.</seg>
<seg id=1619> Do you think support such a project, Mr Patten?</seg>
<seg id=1620> In this context, as Parliament knows, during the last summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi has initiated an in-depth dialogue on energy.</seg>
<seg id=1621> I fervently hope that I am personally in Kaliningrad at the beginning of next year, not just because Immanuel Kant has spent the whole of his life.</seg>
<seg id=1622> Once again, I congratulate the honourable Member on his excellent report, which concerns an issue of great importance on which I am sure we will look again and again in this Parliament over the next few years.</seg>
<seg id=1623> You put me in a very difficult position.</seg>
<seg id=1624> Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is very important, because the mad cow crisis has enormous effects on food products, on the manufacture and import of food products.</seg>
<seg id=1625> The Council has expressed its concern at the many meetings with Russia, at all levels, particularly to avoid the excessive use of force and a possible extension of the conflict, to carry out independent investigations and effective violations of human rights, to support the OSCE assistance group in fulfilling its mission and finally to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id=1626> Mr President, on a point of order: it is customary in this House that when the issues have not been the subject of an oral reply is satisfactory, they are then dealt with in writing.</seg>
<seg id=1627> (Interruption from Mr Posselt)</seg>
<seg id=1628> This directive dates from 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1629> It is in this spirit that we will have to work.</seg>
<seg id=1630> These groups are obviously not exempted in the new proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1631> The presidency and several Member States have already received from the Committee of European sugar manufacturers various letters relating to the Commission proposal which they will take account in their deliberations.</seg>
<seg id=1632> Question No 6 by (H-0886 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1633> I would firstly like to say that, in my view, the President-in-Office of the Council has not yet answered the question by Mr Korokas.</seg>
<seg id=1634> We must now put in place this authority, and I believe that the awareness of the European authorities is strong and that we must move forward.</seg>
<seg id=1635> Specifically, the representative of the presidency, in this case the Ambassador of France in Algeria, he met Mr Ahmed Taleb?</seg>
<seg id=1636> We welcome the measures proposed in this respect by the preparatory committee and decided by the General Assembly as regards the accreditation of non-governmental organisations, in the preparation process and the special session of September 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1637> The partnership has several references to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=1638> As the Council has pointed out to the honourable Member in her earlier reply, the process of mutual recognition of judgments would lead to better protection of the rights of people.</seg>
<seg id=1639> I would like to urge it again.</seg>
<seg id=1640> It ensures in particular the political control and the strategic direction of a military crisis management operation.</seg>
<seg id=1641> I would simply like to remind you that the system of the Treaty makes a difference between the treatment of taxes and the indirect taxes which harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and operation of the internal market - that is Article 93 - and the approximation, provided for in Article 94, of the laws which have a direct impact on the establishment and operation of the common market, including those concerning direct taxation.</seg>
<seg id=1642> Just take a brief look at these three main areas.</seg>
<seg id=1643> If the traditional attitude that "in doubt, remain enemies' persists, that could be the stability pact of southern Europe based on the principle of regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1644> We also need cooperation with Yugoslavia and, more specifically, for bilateral cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1645> Mr President, our group supports the work done by Mr Baltas on the report on the possibility of negotiating a stabilisation and association agreement with the Republic of Croatia.</seg>
<seg id=1646> Mr President, I have had, during the years that I have exercised the mandate of President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the opportunity of accompanying many Croats in their efforts towards freedom and prosperity they identifiaient to their integration into the European institutions, like other peoples of our continent.</seg>
<seg id=1647> In view of the progress made by Croatia this year, I have to say that I do not doubt our ability to make progress at high speed.</seg>
<seg id=1648> That is what we believe, and the speed with which we have adjusted our policy with regard to Croatia in recent months bears witness to this.</seg>
<seg id=1649> We need to Croatia to make the government and the people of that country all possible assistance in the coming years and we are very grateful to the honourable Member who has the wisdom to encourage us to continue along this path.</seg>
<seg id=1650> In this connection, it is incomprehensible that thousands of members of Laskar Jihad have been able, in the spring, go in the Moluccas to stir up once again the conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1651> In the East, the militias are blocking the return of refugees and the rescuers are harassed.</seg>
<seg id=1652> On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I shall confine myself to three points.</seg>
<seg id=1653> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen on her excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1654> However, in this respect, the country is no exception.</seg>
<seg id=1655> Continuing violence which are the scene Moluccas, Aceh and Irian Jaya are causing great suffering to the population.</seg>
<seg id=1656> Tomorrow, we will be presenting the Sakharov Prize.</seg>
<seg id=1657> The latest news from the Indonesian archipelago compel us, however, to ask ourselves whether the situation of President Wahid and his followers is not even more serious, more critical than the rapporteur's analysis suggests.</seg>
<seg id=1658> If we want to help Indonesia, we must speak with money and actions, and not just with words.</seg>
<seg id=1659> This report is extremely valuable because he can enlighten us on the development of events.</seg>
<seg id=1660> It is clear that the difficulties of Indonesia will not be resolved in a day.</seg>
<seg id=1661> Protection of the Communities' financial interests</seg>
<seg id=1662> The obstacles to its independence, both in the recruitment of staff and in terms of its structure, must be abolished.</seg>
<seg id=1663> It is therefore essential that a process of internal reform, the Commission must finally achieve its stated desire to no longer tolerate any fraud and pursue them accordingly.</seg>
<seg id=1664> I believe that this is what should be, and which must also result in Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1665> We would like to see the Member States initiate negotiations with a view to the adoption of uniform legislation in the field of crime, but we refuse to accept that our countries are dependent on a federal public prosecutor of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1666> I would also like to know why the publication of the communication from the Commission on this subject has been postponed to the following day the Danish referendum on the euro.</seg>
<seg id=1667> I have tabled an amendment to designate these countries by name, because it is time to make it clear that they are and that they be covered.</seg>
<seg id=1668> I am sure that OLAF believes that it is in its interest to make transparent the choice of its leaders.</seg>
<seg id=1669> However, we must ensure that, in the European Parliament, not to miss the beam in our it to concentrate on the mote in a neighbour, the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1670> We are trying to put out a fire, but the smoke we suffocate.</seg>
<seg id=1671> Nobody can understand, either.</seg>
<seg id=1672> To understand this point, I would like to highlight four points which I believe are fundamental in the work of the authority of budgetary control.</seg>
<seg id=1673> With regard to Parliament itself, its problem is the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1674> It is rather worrying, Commissioner, that the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - should be explicitly mentioned the order in relation to respect for the rights of Members.</seg>
<seg id=1675> This last example, we can recommend to the Committee on Budgets to freeze or reduce the amount of appropriations for budget lines in next year's budget, or not to allow any transfer of appropriations when it comes to increase the budget lines and that, until the end of the internal investigations under way. They can go so far as to demand that the President of the Commission requires the resignation of the or the Commissioners concerned by the serious problems which have been identified, European Caesarean sections in some way.</seg>
<seg id=1676> The report calls for detailed inventories of operational activities, the proper scrutiny of budget lines and irregularities and an internal audit of the parliamentary committee.</seg>
<seg id=1677> Commissioner, the legal basis for the transmission of information to the European Parliament is the EC Treaty and not the interinstitutional agreement.</seg>
<seg id=1678> Without changes, the final outcome of this common position would be an inequality of weapons not only with North America but also in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1679> I really do not see why we would not here as in all other cases a compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1680> This is a proposal that has come a long - and I fear - to overcome certain difficulties, weary path.</seg>
<seg id=1681> The first amendment concerns Article 4, which establishes what must be the competent authority for the control of the supply.</seg>
<seg id=1682> We are now being confronted with a proposal which would lead to a real pagaïe, a free-for-all as far as with its trail of potential disputes at a delicate stage of the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=1683> In the United Kingdom, the regulation of the times, through the voluntary code of practice implemented by the Committee on takeover bids are concerned, is a real success: this is a good example of the pragmatic approach of an extremely complex problem, where legislation would be less appropriate.</seg>
<seg id=1684> But what is even more important is that it enables us to move the Lisbon agenda aimed at creating a European economy competitive and dynamic.</seg>
<seg id=1685> What is important for us here in the European Parliament is ultimately that the contradictory interests, for example, the Executive Board versus the shareholders, the large versus small shareholders, companies which enhance the financial market, to be regulated in a minimum form at European level.</seg>
<seg id=1686> Some of the amendments tabled by Parliament make further improvements to the text of the common position of the Council. They highlighted the points that could give rise to difficulties in interpretation and insist on a more rapid transposition of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1687> Indeed, it is not at all convinced that the definition of fair price which is proposed is better than another, because the different definitions used are all in the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1688> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1689> In addition, during a period of three years, the artist will have the right to demand of the professionals of the art market any information on the amounts which are due, which is sensible because they have to keep a register of purchases and sales.</seg>
<seg id=1690> Therefore, it is the Austrian legislator is and not the European legislator that creating positive framework conditions for artists and auction houses.</seg>
<seg id=1691> Moreover, in the matter in hand, the need for a common position is all the more important that only a common position will enable the European Union to put pressure at international level to ensure that the interests of authors can be defended at global level.</seg>
<seg id=1692> I have confidence in the wisdom and understanding of this House.</seg>
<seg id=1693> In Germany, for example, in 1998, on 7 000 artists who have transferred their rights, 274 only have finally recovered money, not to mention the fact that 40% of the resale right is recovery costs of the sums owed.</seg>
<seg id=1694> In short, there is no need for a harmonisation of this kind in the sector.</seg>
<seg id=1695> A similar amendment was rejected at first reading.</seg>
<seg id=1696> They have thought that the translations could follow despite this timetable quite tight and difficult.</seg>
<seg id=1697> However, we have reached a point where we can no longer postpone this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1698> We have proposed in the committee of doing a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id=1699> Our Parliament is, of course, on the side of these values, and it will continue to defend them.</seg>
<seg id=1700> The technological developments and the fluctuations of the market will lead to changes in any way.</seg>
<seg id=1701> Here, we cannot find legal justification for an exclusion of competition.</seg>
<seg id=1702> The restriction of the universal service - the pillar of the postal sector - to 50 grams runs the risk of putting national control jobs in a difficult situation, in the sense that they can hardly offer a universal service at an affordable price to the citizens, regardless of their place of residence.</seg>
<seg id=1703> I would remind my Conservative colleagues the problems they have had in the United Kingdom when they tried to privatise the British posts.</seg>
<seg id=1704> We have either more or less turned the safety net of users of the postal service in a hamac in which the major players in the postal sector can continue to vautrer and act in freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1705> I am very pleased because, nevertheless, this notion of special services to put new technologies outside the scope of the universal service.</seg>
<seg id=1706> Madam President, Commissioner, we cannot and will not tolerate such a situation.</seg>
<seg id=1707> That is why the European Commission has not proposed, as a second phase, a total liberalisation of this sector.</seg>
<seg id=1708> This is of such a development that I hope the other Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1709> Mr Bolkestein has recently condemned the liberal attitude of lack of French in the Dutch press, or at least that is what was the title of the article in question.</seg>
<seg id=1710> In this connection, we could point to Spain, which has been a fund of this type and uses, to talk about the legal framework random on which the funds is based, virtual criteria relating to its composition, discretionary avals for its application.</seg>
<seg id=1711> We are voting tomorrow: I hope that this vote will take place before the amendment tabled by Mr Atkins or by Mr Sterckx, otherwise I will have to vote against this report.</seg>
<seg id=1712> Royal Mail participates in competition, and giving my mail in Malmö in Sweden.</seg>
<seg id=1713> Madam President, Commissioner, that we have learned from the debate, or rather the controversy caused by Commissioner Bolkestein in its pursuit of a liberalisation of postal services, in the absence of any assessment of the first stage and in violation of the rules laid down by this directive? What under the guise of enhancing and progressive terms such as modernisation, liberalisation, the technological essors, switches in a decline in the social quality of a country.</seg>
<seg id=1714> The safeguarding of the universal service by means of a compensation fund which would make it possible to engage in private profits for the benefit of public service will probably long.</seg>
<seg id=1715> These limits and these delays have also contributed to a debate in which we often confuse the end and the means.</seg>
<seg id=1716> We cannot discuss the subject, Madam President, not to mention economic and social cohesion.</seg>
<seg id=1717> Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, because he has actually carried out a complex, difficult and it has tried to strike a balance between the proposals, positions and points of departure and arrival completely different.</seg>
<seg id=1718> I fear that this proposal strengthens the current position of monopoly at the taxpayers' expense and increases the threshold imposed on newcomers.</seg>
<seg id=1719> I am also pleased to see that our Liberal friends of the continent show an example to the British Liberals.</seg>
<seg id=1720> Of course, I admit that the liberalisation in itself is not a problem, and that it can be beneficial for consumers.</seg>
<seg id=1721> Justifiée, because it is part of the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union, which highlights the completion of the internal market for the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id=1722> The universal service is the cornerstone of the policy of the Community in this area and what we are doing is to create a climate conducive to improve it.</seg>
<seg id=1723> The special services are also a sector where innovation and modernisation must be encouraged.</seg>
<seg id=1724> According to him, by the end of the decade, the opening up to competition of the majority of the postal market seems inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=1725> I believe that there is a need for guarantees in order to preserve a permanent universal service and its obligations.</seg>
<seg id=1726> That is why I cannot and do not remain silent when the future of the sector is threatened by any decision which would mean not to respond appropriately to the challenges that have been set to Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id=1727> Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.</seg>
<seg id=1728> However, I would remind you that this common organisation of the market is mainly the guarantee of access to the Community market of its products.</seg>
<seg id=1729> I am glad that we have been able to reach a unanimous vote in the Committee on Agriculture, and I would like to thank my colleagues and Mr Fernández Martín, the rapporteur of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, for its support.</seg>
<seg id=1730> We cannot prevent us from expressing our concern for the banana production of some ACP countries, the smaller countries, the West Indies and some West African countries which are traditional suppliers of the banana market and with which we have made commitments that we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id=1731> Therefore, I hope that this report is supported in its entirety by the Members of this House, as was the case in the Committee on Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=1732> In the meantime, the United States condemn in the first time the reference periods for historical but now their own reference periods of history.</seg>
<seg id=1733> Powerful interests come into play, especially those of the United States, which are not themselves of banana producers, but who have hidden the American capital in commercial firms.</seg>
<seg id=1734> It seems sometimes that the Commission, in the proposals for the deregulation of trade and agricultural production at international level, goes further than the Cairns Group.</seg>
<seg id=1735> It is a pity that the Commission and the Council persists in a solution that can seriously compromising this production, especially after 2006.</seg>
<seg id=1736> The decisions of the WTO does not say that it is forbidden to give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers.</seg>
<seg id=1737> For example, the transitional period should be around 15 years and no less than ten years; the compensatory aid must include the guarantee of the incomes of Community producers and the disposal of the production of the outermost regions and it must also include aid to bodies which trade in bananas which are produced.</seg>
<seg id=1738> I hope that it will listen to today our arguments, because this system proposed by the Commission, the tariff preference, even of EUR 300, may prove very useful in practice because the ACP producers will be rolled out by the system known as the 'first come, first served.</seg>
<seg id=1739> VOTE</seg>
<seg id=1740> (Parliament approved the Commission proposal)</seg>
<seg id=1741> The Commission rejects the other amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1742> Before the vote:</seg>
<seg id=1743> (Parliament accepted the oral amendment)</seg>
<seg id=1744> Report (A5-0376 / 2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the reform of the procedures and institutions of budgetary control (2000 / 2008 (INI))</seg>
<seg id=1745> Most of the smokers do not know all the risks and do not pay the real price of their choice.</seg>
<seg id=1746> I am always held in this principle during my long parliamentary career 35 years.</seg>
<seg id=1747> I fear that their hopes are in vain.</seg>
<seg id=1748> It is our last attempt to put on cigarette packets of labels and images which reflect the real dangers of smoking.</seg>
<seg id=1749> Lehne report (A5-0368 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1750> This seems to me to be both relevant and justified, even today, and that is why I voted against this report in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id=1751> It is right that the Committee on Legal Affairs persists in refusing a ceiling and in the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be below 7%.</seg>
<seg id=1752> If this directive is also for my group a means of giving a clear political signal: we must not waste our time to create in Europe with unnecessary rules.</seg>
<seg id=1753> If it is right to denounce the Stalinist dictatorship of the past, how can there be any confidence in Mr Putin, the murderers of the Chechen people, the godfather of the various mafias, anyone who is trying to destroy all the opposition, civil society (unions, political parties), in order to strengthen its personal power?</seg>
<seg id=1754> Of course, Indonesia does not merit such a development of relations because we cannot say that, over recent years, its leaders have distinguished themselves in their great democratic spirit and their great merits, but we must take account of the Indonesian citizens, and therefore agree to the development of relations and this aid.</seg>
<seg id=1755> The unit be that of the criminal acts committed by officials of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1756> The Theato report on the fight against fraud makes it possible to discover that the European Central Bank, without doubt, to prove its well-known independence, has not seen fit to accede to the agreement on the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).</seg>
<seg id=1757> That concludes the vote.</seg>
<seg id=1758> Either we are part of the club, or we are not, and we must therefore abide by this decision.</seg>
<seg id=1759> It is therefore totally EEB - and bananas Everything but do not cause, ladies and gentlemen, a change of name.</seg>
<seg id=1760> The tariff only system, however, is an important element which ensures the balance of the Commission proposal and is an important basis which should enable the Council to make progress.</seg>
<seg id=1761> There are also measures to the labelling of these bananas in the national and regional programmes to promote rural development.</seg>
<seg id=1762> Europe and the United States are working closely with the defence of the values we share.</seg>
<seg id=1763> We believe discuss a new WTO round and the implications for this round of the many bilateral trade initiatives which are the subject of discussion in the US.</seg>
<seg id=1764> It has quite rightly said that transatlantic relations are very developed in the past ten years - to a large extent, it is true, the American side by President Clinton, but I believe that history will recall that there has also been a European contribution to these new relations - quite fundamental contribution - with the 1990 transatlantic declaration and the New Transatlantic Agenda adopted under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995.</seg>
<seg id=1765> It will therefore be important to undertake a reversal of the way and to conclude a transatlantic agenda for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1766> I will conclude with the Dominican Republic who said: "The WTO was supposed to be an honest broker applying common rules and where the different countries could learn to play the game.</seg>
<seg id=1767> Secondly, even though we welcome the withdrawal of the Communist sham, the collapse of the Soviet Union has left a only superpower: the United States of America.</seg>
<seg id=1768> I know that he has a constructive dialogue with Parliament and with the committees which deal with these issues.</seg>
<seg id=1769> The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:</seg>
<seg id=1770> These objectives, the primary objective and secondary objectives, will be the touchstone for us to judge the concrete proposals put forward by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1771> It is clear that such a solution - the registration in one country with the possibility of providing services throughout the European Union - can cause an avalanche in countries where the rate of taxation is low.</seg>
<seg id=1772> For example, an agreement was reached in 1992, considered at the time as minimum harmonisation, which says that the standard VAT rate could not be below 15%, the Member States which have the right to apply one or several reduced rates cannot be below 5%; derogations will be made in this case.</seg>
<seg id=1773> We have asked the European Commission to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and to submit a report to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1774> In short, the aim of this proposal is laudable, but the method is ill-conceived and if we really want to promote the e-economy of Europe, it would be good to give our electronic commerce of VAT, rather than trying to impose our problems to others.</seg>
<seg id=1775> If we are to meet the demand for reduced emissions of greenhouse gases, we must take all possible measures to restrict their production.</seg>
<seg id=1776> The only case where any tax is not yet seen is that delivery in the European Community from third countries.</seg>
<seg id=1777> The positive discrimination in respect of air transport must stop.</seg>
<seg id=1778> The companies of third countries who are not members of the European Union are not subject to any taxation.</seg>
<seg id=1779> The CDs are not so archaic and they should be tax, while the programmes that would move by the Internet would be détaxés!</seg>
<seg id=1780> However, the proposed solution can only be technically unworkable and hinder the development of on-line trading in the Union, precisely at a time when everyone wants, on the contrary, their expansion.</seg>
<seg id=1781> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the European Union are being eroded and lost in return.</seg>
<seg id=1782> We should seek to encourage electronic commerce and not new ways of the tax.</seg>
<seg id=1783> The Liberals we say that we must state the least possible.</seg>
<seg id=1784> The Primarolo group has drawn up simple rules which must be applied.</seg>
<seg id=1785> The group that I represent in this House, an objection and think that we must balance the situation between the daily newspapers, which enjoys a reduced rate of VAT, and newspapers, which do not.</seg>
<seg id=1786> A tax on kerosene cannot therefore exist as part of an international consensus, in order to ensure balanced competition.</seg>
<seg id=1787> I particularly welcome the fact that the report highlights one of the key points that I raised in my report to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, voted by this Parliament a few months ago, namely that, given that it is certainly politically difficult to reach an international agreement on the taxation of aviation, at least in the short term, we should use alternative tools to achieve the same effect, including a tax on emissions.</seg>
<seg id=1788> In fact, the industry is paying 100% of its infrastructure costs through the air traffic control and airport charges, which cost USD 4 billion in 1998 - unlike other modes of transport, such as rail transport or by road, which are still much subsidised.</seg>
<seg id=1789> The current situation is unfavourable.</seg>
<seg id=1790> In this respect, it is clear that there is a problem about emissions caused by air traffic, even if the percentage is not so high, it is increasing significantly and therefore we cannot underestimate the.</seg>
<seg id=1791> This system would be detrimental for SMEs within and outside the Union, particularly if we consider the proposal to reduce the exemption threshold at EUR 40 000 excessively low annual turnover.</seg>
<seg id=1792> If we are too greedy as regards the matter under discussion, we are really in danger the future of electronic commerce, important for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1793> The principle that service providers established outside the Community and making the provision of services to customers within the Community should be no record that in one place should not lead to a shift of tax revenue between the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1794> Given that the discussion is not yet completed within the Council, and given that the Commission wishes to complete the issue of VAT and electronic commerce quickly enough, I believe that the wisest course of action we would not even accept formally the amendments made by Parliament, but to try to produce the greatest possible number of these proposals in the Council negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=1795> I cannot therefore accept the proposed amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1796> Thank you very much for all the issues that you have addressed this week.</seg>
<seg id=1797> Three months after the accident, the Commission, for its part, has assumed its responsibilities by adopting a first package of measures, that the European Parliament has fully approved on 30 November.</seg>
<seg id=1798> With more than fifteen directives or regulations in force, it is, in fact, an urgent need to standardise practices and to exercise tighter control on the application of Community rules, in order to avoid possible differences, important and unacceptable, within the Union in the field of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1799> Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her continuous commitment in the field of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1800> I would like to remind Members that in the field of air safety, the compensation applied in the European Union and in the North American levels do not in other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1801> Secondly, I would say to you that it is the French courts which could deny or freezing the funds from one company to compensate some damage or other; it is the French courts which could establish responsibilities beyond those laid down in accordance with the criteria objectives of the current international regulations on pollution hydrocarbons.</seg>
<seg id=1802> The Commission considers that such adjustments go in the direction of the establishment of a fairer tax system which also encourages a more rational and efficient use of the road network.</seg>
<seg id=1803> In view of the criticism, especially those in Ireland and France, the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a new interpretation: it would be a tax for all users, including the British lorry drivers.</seg>
<seg id=1804> I am determined to ensure that the food consumers meets the highest standards, it comes from the inside or outside the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1805> Of course I understand the concern of the honourable Member.</seg>
<seg id=1806> I am sorry to tell you, Commissioner, that your reply does not suit me.</seg>
<seg id=1807> So the honourable Member's remarks are important.</seg>
<seg id=1808> In Nigeria, the indigenous people All-Ijaw have accused Chevron of inciting violence against them and go so far as to pay Nigerian soldiers to take on the demonstrators in the Warri naval base.</seg>
<seg id=1809> In his report adopted on 15 November, the Commission concluded that operating aid granted under Regulation 1540 / 98 has not solved the problem of prices in South Korea.</seg>
<seg id=1810> I believe that all the intentions is extremely reassuring, but, in the meantime, the fact is that our shipyards are closing their doors.</seg>
<seg id=1811> Question No 38 by (H-0868 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1812> I understand, Commissioner, that you do not want to change your decision in spite of the fact that ten Member States are opposed to such tariffs.</seg>
<seg id=1813> This initiative is based on a Council regulation amending the regulation which defines the current GSP.</seg>
<seg id=1814> I represent some farmers and I am therefore very worried.</seg>
<seg id=1815> We are working in committee, we have not taken this week, Poul Nielson is not present because of the shift in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg id=1816> We are working on the safeguard clause, and if Mr Clegg needs arguments, to speak with the beet growers, I should like at its disposal.</seg>
<seg id=1817> I would like to thank Mr Liikanen for his reply, which is very positive and valuable.</seg>
<seg id=1818> I will discuss it with my services when the budgetary resources for next year will be defined.</seg>
<seg id=1819> At present, the efforts made by my services and I seek to limit the consequences of the distance between the parties and the future court.</seg>
<seg id=1820> Like the specialized courts in the patent law of Düsseldorf, Munich and other German cities, but also in London, a Community court responsible Community patent should be very specialised.</seg>
<seg id=1821> In order to prevent this provisional situation is having a definitive nature, the Commission, on 13 July last year, pointed out in a letter to the Member States concerned their obligation to indicate what their competent court in the field of Community trademarks.</seg>
<seg id=1822> As the honourable Member knows, the tabling of a complaint would in itself has no influence on the progress of the project concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1823> Question No 47 by (H-0877 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1824> This means that the Commission makes use of the legal means at its disposal in the sense in the Rules of Procedure.</seg>
<seg id=1825> The question is: who must address these students to understand that, when they are following this round of studies and concluded in the United Kingdom, they have the right to have results.</seg>
<seg id=1826> The King, elected for a limited period, could, for example, be chosen Finnish amongst Members of the European Parliament the most deserving.</seg>
<seg id=1827> This can also be seen as a question of competition, since we can continue to practise duty-free sales in the southern part of the Baltic, on the line between Stockholm and Helsinki, while they are banned on the line between Umeå and Vasa.</seg>
<seg id=1828> We must rectify the situation by stimulating and encouraging the multilingual content, since it is absolutely crucial to the success of European content.</seg>
<seg id=1829> The problem which concerns me most is that small businesses do not always have sufficient guarantees, or the background to offer commercial investors.</seg>
<seg id=1830> To complete the ambitious development of this European programme e-content, we need to simplify and secure the procedures envisaged.</seg>
<seg id=1831> It is for this reason that the measures of public subsidies in favour of the content industry in the European Union (use has been proven) must also achieve a culture and a high-level education and cultural diversity.</seg>
<seg id=1832> On the other hand, there is the communication networks which need to fulfil their content constantly virtual area and who see it as self-evident to submit the content of the corner and exploited without really production rules.</seg>
<seg id=1833> Mr President, I welcome the launch of this programme -content and would like to draw attention to two aspects.</seg>
<seg id=1834> That is why I support the amendments calling for the adoption of specific actions in the field of new technologies.</seg>
<seg id=1835> Firstly, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament emphasises the social and cultural dimension of digital content.</seg>
<seg id=1836> Assessment and Management of ambient noise</seg>
<seg id=1837> Indeed, I am grateful for the support that the Christian Democrats, and also a member of the Liberal Group, have contributed to this amendment, to begin to restrict noise nuisance caused by aircraft.</seg>
<seg id=1838> Only this year, six years behind, and under the insistent pressure of the French Government, that the Commission presented its proposal for harmonised noise indicators.</seg>
<seg id=1839> It is a moderate proposal. The Scandinavia has already stricter standards than those proposed for 2012.</seg>
<seg id=1840> Orly, Schiphol, Barcelona and others already meet strict standards.</seg>
<seg id=1841> Another important point made by us and that will be of great importance in the context of the problem of noise caused by aircraft, concerns the need to provide additional noise indicators in addition to those mentioned by the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=1842> Due to a lack of common standards in the European Union, we have seen situations of distortions of competition between airports and lack of equality between the citizens of the various Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1843> That is why I find the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange so important.</seg>
<seg id=1844> First of all, I must say that I welcome this report.</seg>
<seg id=1845> That was the point of principle behind Amendment No 36, although I think that this idea is not yet sufficiently a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1846> We should look into it carefully and adopt the combined approach on the two levels, i.e. establishing limit values for each source of emissions on the one hand and, on the other hand, setting quality standards for these emissions.</seg>
<seg id=1847> We need more time, and I regret that we have not prepared, even if, in general, I support the framework directive.</seg>
<seg id=1848> As soon as the Member States have provided comparable data, the Commission will take into account the question of maximum values at Community level, as well as other measures to reduce the number of people affected by noise and to refer the matter to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1849> Food additives other than colours and sweeteners</seg>
<seg id=1850> These are the three criteria.</seg>
<seg id=1851> Thank you, Mr Onesta, I am in favour of your question, because if you have a carrot against the grain, I have a pig in my throat, as we say, but the flu short somewhat here.</seg>
<seg id=1852> Furthermore, in the event of chronic dietary problems, the risk of cancer is increasing.</seg>
<seg id=1853> It is also clear that the Commission did not have the appropriate instruments to intervene properly.</seg>
<seg id=1854> Tomorrow, a new stage on the agenda and our colleague, Mrs Paulsen, the Liberal Group, will then be on track and will have the opportunity to improve the present directive.</seg>
<seg id=1855> The Member States and the Commission now have a better instrument for ensuring that Community law on animal feed is properly applied and to ensure that, in the event of crisis situations arise in third countries, for quicker reactions are possible.</seg>
<seg id=1856> We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities and that up to now, it is above all the cities that have been "the poor relations" in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1857> The planning process must be implemented in a fair and innovative.</seg>
<seg id=1858> The multiannual programme 2000-2004 for sustainable development in urban areas is an appropriate instrument to achieve this, as well as the implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent tool for coordination and development actions.</seg>
<seg id=1859> The reduction of transport and the abandonment of fossil fuels at local level are necessary to achieve a change from the point of view of the climate threats we are experiencing today.</seg>
<seg id=1860> Many have suggested that this budget was too low.</seg>
<seg id=1861> It is anticipated that the main partners in this context are the Commission and the networks of local authorities whose legal responsibility is to develop and implement policies relating to sustainable development in urban areas.</seg>
<seg id=1862> The Court of Justice of the European Communities and even the bodies responsible for resolving disputes of the WTO, we believe that the precautionary principle is to apply environmental or in the field of public health, and sometimes even against the Europeans, as shown in the case of cheese made from milk pending.</seg>
<seg id=1863> The aim must not be a reduction of the damage or compensation, the primary aim must be to prevent any adverse effect on health or the goods of persons.</seg>
<seg id=1864> In 1996, the European Parliament had voted in favour of a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only we had listened to.</seg>
<seg id=1865> A complete scientific certainty on the new products or substances does not exist and will never be.</seg>
<seg id=1866> Finally, if the precautionary principle must be implemented in a credible and effective way, it is vital to involve all the key players, including the representatives of civil society, in the political choices surrounding its implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1867> Finally, health and the environment must take precedence over other considerations, particularly those of an economic nature.</seg>
<seg id=1868> A condition related essential for the application of the precautionary principle is that the concerns about the possible harmful effects are backed up by a scientific basis.</seg>
<seg id=1869> Only yesterday at Lisbon, an American, Professor George Carlo, which has received a study on the effect of the waves to human health by the Food and Drugs Administration, has revealed that the use of mobile phones could lead to the emergence of brain tumours and Alzheimer's disease and disability skin.</seg>
<seg id=1870> Mr President, the environment and public health are the same to a machine whose complexity is such that we need to monitor and control its multiple functions, in order to be able to intervene and prevent problems.</seg>
<seg id=1871> The application of this principle must avoid at all costs to curb innovation and economic activity, give rise to intolerance and stagnation industrial, become a means to prevent competition.</seg>
<seg id=1872> Parliament has noted that the Commission agrees with most of the questions raised in the motion for a resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1873> The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=1874> Article 2 enshrines the right to life. And every time that in Spain terrorism kills a person, it is the whole of the European Union which are involved in what is one of its most important principles.</seg>
<seg id=1875> Our intention is not to replace the institutions legitimately established, but to encourage them to protect our rights and our freedoms without making concessions to terror.</seg>
<seg id=1876> VOTE</seg>
<seg id=1877> It has also mentioned the observation of the Council on the classification of budget lines on the draft early retirement of the Commission and on the administrative expenditure of the fisheries agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1878> (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1879> I think that this is more!</seg>
<seg id=1880> Over the past consider that the number of 23 428 is insufficient, but they will be satisfied with the area of growth which is offered.</seg>
<seg id=1881> This omission, which began in the middle of last year, has caused as we feared falling dramatically in the rate of adoption of projects and implementation of payments, so that the annual implementation authorisations for this fund was less than one per cent at the end of June 2000.</seg>
<seg id=1882> This text is a licence to close the General Secretariat of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id=1883> Before I start, they said to me: 'It is Christmas, and we, in Bergamo, we are celebrating Christmas and St Lucia.</seg>
<seg id=1884> In particular, we are very critical of the overproduction of agricultural products and the use of means of information to the EU to sell this surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1885> Mr President, I voted in favour of the Garcia-Margallo y Marfil report, which concerns the taxation of services provided electronically.</seg>
<seg id=1886> Mr President, I will try, before 2004, to do something in Malta in making a statement in favour of it.</seg>
<seg id=1887> However, I say this with a certain solemnity: it is the maximum that I can accept a Europe, for me, too liberal!</seg>
<seg id=1888> The deadline would encourage the posts to develop and modernise their services and facilitate the planning and investment on the market.</seg>
<seg id=1889> They will continue to put pressure. The money they gain with the distribution beyond the limit of 150 grammes enables them to strengthen their position.</seg>
<seg id=1890> The liberalisation of postal services proposed by the Commission is neither appropriate nor consistent, and that is why I voted for the report and all the amendments which express the same direction.</seg>
<seg id=1891> Roo Report (A5-0378 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1892> We are not convinced of their compatibility with the WTO, we are also reservations on the subject of Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31.</seg>
<seg id=1893> A globalisation which despises the most basic rights of the human person.</seg>
<seg id=1894> It would be contrary to respect for national identity (Article 6 (3) of the Treaty of the Union).</seg>
<seg id=1895> It must be stressed that the linguistic minorities, instead of being crushed by the globalization of the Internet, have found new openings cultural and economic.</seg>
<seg id=1896> Mr President, in the absence of other results, the haggling of Nice will shed light on the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1897> The tone of the joint resolution is, at this point of view, far too unilateral.</seg>
<seg id=1898> The delay in the publication of the written conclusions - which are still not officially available at the moment, four days later - shows the difficulty of drawing up clear decisions taken in the confusion.</seg>
<seg id=1899> The only way to avoid the future of dangerous conflicts is to remain the traditional concept that Europe is based on mutual respect for national communities.</seg>
<seg id=1900> The Nice Summit has concluded Sunday with an agreement which should lead to a draft treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1901> The resolution on the Nice Summit, which has just been voted, does not reflect.</seg>
<seg id=1902> Finally, I would like to make a reference to social policy, on which France insist at the presentation of its presidency, but which is ultimately a hand full of very little, despite the declarations of intent and the titles of documents the content very vague and clearly insufficient in relation to the existing problems and to the enormous dissatisfaction, including the demonstration of workers in Nice has been an important expression.</seg>
<seg id=1903> Clearly, nothing has changed for the really important issues such as taxes, taxes, social policy, asylum and immigration.</seg>
<seg id=1904> The fact according to the debate on Nice is the image of a treaty finally without a father or mother, because there is nobody's son. The French Presidency has confused in excuses, rather than to accept the results of the IGC and their reasons; the political groups, which are the governments of the Member States have increased their criticisms.</seg>
<seg id=1905> On the contrary, the power of national democracies is ever more power to restrict the right of veto and to give more power in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1906> If we had been able to foresee these consequences at the conclusion of the Chicago Convention during the year I was born - 1944, no tax exemption for fuel and other equipment for aircraft have probably been agreed.</seg>
<seg id=1907> Zero risk does not exist, scientists or at least the politicians should apply the criterion of proportionality, assess the risks uncertain and assume their responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id=1908> This Parliament has also fought for this reduction of funds for innovative actions to be offset by the use of the framework of flexibility, laid down in a statement on the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1909> Everyone has a role to play. Indeed, we are engaged in a global market, it is undeniable, and it is the innovations that will enable Europe to maintain its place among the major technological developments in new industries and, in particular, information technology, on the assumption, of course, that they receive sufficient financial resources and support realistic and relevant.</seg>
<seg id=1910> During the previous speeches, a few words seriously have been spoken about the budget. 400 million are really only a minimum for the funding and we must, in the second half of the year, take advantage of the opportunities for additional appropriations offered by the flexibility instrument, as the report.</seg>
<seg id=1911> In my view, it is automatically the loss of the European added value, contrary to the conclusion of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1912> As we all know, in the European Union, unemployment is concentrated on the least-developed territories of the technological and economic point of view, especially the territories of Objective 1. It is therefore necessary that the innovative actions are not only a technical nature, but they are from a clear desire to develop the economy and employment.</seg>
<seg id=1913> When I return in my home region, in the east of England, and that I see that no local authority has used the money that it has received during the last period, I doubt that we have shown the effectiveness which we need in the future to accommodate the new communities.</seg>
<seg id=1914> Mr President, first of all, I would like to convey to Mr Markov my thanks and congratulations for the presentation constructive, extremely competent and serious of the draft communication on these innovative actions of the ERDF for the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id=1915> The energy efficiency and aspects of environmental policy are not forgotten in these guidelines. They can give rise to innovative measures under the third issue, which concerns regional identity and sustainable development.</seg>
<seg id=1916> We hope, however, that the projects are selected at regional level, as was well understood Mr Berend in his speech.</seg>
<seg id=1917> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1918> That is why we are calling for in this report and in the three additional amendments that the Commission multiplies the efforts to impose international procedure for settling disputes in the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1919> It seems to me that the Commissioner must show the industry is doing everything in its power to respond to this external threat to it.</seg>
<seg id=1920> Finally, of course, we expect from the 18 December, in the group meeting, 6 of the OECD, the "seagoing vessels" arrangement should be examined.</seg>
<seg id=1921> But it seems that the finishing line is always postponed, so that we will never achieve.</seg>
<seg id=1922> As you all know, this procedure will take more than six months.</seg>
<seg id=1923> For the major corporations such as for their lawyers, political, call for less State only means that the State and its funding must be available to them exclusively.</seg>
<seg id=1924> But for that to happen, so that the process will enable us to consolidate the shipbuilding industry and employment and to reassure the families that depend on aid, we must continue beyond 31 December 2000 because, on the market, we are not on an equal footing, there is unfair competition and dumping practices.</seg>
<seg id=1925> Improving the competitiveness of shipyards in the EU is encouraged by the Commission, but in the face of mass dumping prices applied by South Korea, the improvement possible productivity is not enough.</seg>
<seg id=1926> It has also pointed out that the existence of this mechanism should not create distortions of competition within the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1927> The presence of the nuclear submarine with a problem in the waters of the Bay of Algeciras has unfortunately turned into a diplomatic conflict between a military nuclear power and colonial and a Member State, according to the latest classification of Nice, which does not safeguard their rights and is submitting to the childhood explanations.</seg>
<seg id=1928> When, by means of the programmes in the countries of the medical owner - in other words, by means of the British press - we découvrit that the disease was serious, instead of a change of heart, they changèrent the qualification of the centre.</seg>
<seg id=1929> We are of course awaiting with interest the response of the Commission to see whether the objective has been achieved.</seg>
<seg id=1930> Mr President, I too wish to firstly to express my condolences to the family of councillor murdered and the Members of the European People's Party, and reject this barbarity fascist ETA and groups protect him.</seg>
<seg id=1931> I also think it would be good if the submarine Tireless is taken in Britain to be repaired, as soon as possible, when appropriate climatic conditions allow.</seg>
<seg id=1932> The honourable Members have asked whether the Commission considers that Directive 89 / 618 / Euratom on the information of the population on measures to protect health and the behaviour in case of emergency radiological and Directive 96 / 29 / Euratom laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers of ionizing radiation were applied in the event of the submarine and what measures have been taken.</seg>
<seg id=1933> If it is best lawyer that our advisers, I look forward to hearing, and I therefore come back to Article 37.</seg>
<seg id=1934> One aspect of the Euratom Treaty on the transportation of radioactive waste from one Member State of the European Union to another, but, as Gibraltar is, of course, part of the UK, all shipments of waste will be part of the United Kingdom to another without involving another Member State of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1935> That is my opinion; it is simply a matter of winning the confidence of the people living in the stone.</seg>
<seg id=1936> However, we see here a Member State which deals with public opinion in another Member State as it would do with any State in the world, as if, in fact, there was no affectio societatis fifty years after the start of the European project, as if European solidarity did not progress.</seg>
<seg id=1937> It is a fact that, at a time, the only nuclear submarine operating in British waters was a German submarine.</seg>
<seg id=1938> Here, we debate, but the citizens based on their knowledge and their sensitivity, run their attention to the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1939> It is clear that the reduction of investment in new military equipment linked to the restrictions in the military budget decided by the Labour Government will multiply, in the future, the withdrawal of military equipment for repair.</seg>
<seg id=1940> However, it does not extend, contrary to what some people would wish, to the classification of ports that are likely to receive submarines broken down, or to the questions of technical safety of nuclear reactors and the conditions which must answer a submarine to be sent to repair it in another place.</seg>
<seg id=1941> We need to help them further, ask the Community institutions to strengthen the human and material resources.</seg>
<seg id=1942> I would ask the Commission to raise this aid to the UNHCR and also to appoint it as a body of coordination in all its contracts with NGOs.</seg>
<seg id=1943> It must therefore be able to have access to civilian victims and its staff on the ground should be able to deploy safely and have the resources necessary to carry out their mission.</seg>
<seg id=1944> On 22 November, the Commission adopted a communication on the establishment of a common asylum procedure and on the granting of refugee a uniform status valid throughout the Union. It is towards this final objective which is the aim of the common European asylum system established in Tampere.</seg>
<seg id=1945> I shall conclude by paying tribute to the work that Mrs Ogata has done for the UNHCR and in welcoming Mr Ruud Lubbers to his new post.</seg>
<seg id=1946> It is important to encourage an amnesty policy in Yugoslavia for the restoration of democracy, but it also seems important to us to condemn, without doubt, the resumption of terrorist activities and the border between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo because they alarmingly reminiscent of what happened during the Kosovo conflict, where the Western powers have had some responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=1947> Our compromise resolution is clear in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.</seg>
<seg id=1948> I also call on the President Kostuníca to explain what happened to people like Mr mention Ukshin Hoti, whose fate, that we do not know completely, is of great interest to us.</seg>
<seg id=1949> I also agree with the appeal to KFOR in order to prevent any further attempt to violence in the Presevo Valley.</seg>
<seg id=1950> I welcome the measures taken now by KFOR to deal with the problem and I continue to call on all parties to moderation.</seg>
<seg id=1951> B5-0916 / 2000 by Mr Barón Crespo and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1952> This clause has been agreed to the palace of the Moneda in March 1990, and I know because I had the privilege of being present at the handover of President Alwyn, after the referendum which brought an end to General Pinochet ’ s regime.</seg>
<seg id=1953> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak on the joint resolution that obviously we are voting on.</seg>
<seg id=1954> It is important that the international community should exercise its right to democratic scrutiny, not as interference in the internal affairs of an independent country, but as a political process, cautious and preventive action.</seg>
<seg id=1955> The situation in the prisons and police stations is totally unacceptable, particularly because of the ill-treatment and torture which are very widespread.</seg>
<seg id=1956> This would be exactly similar to that we see in Western Europe and the Minister Hikmet Sami al-Turk, faced with these protests, postponed the transfer, so that social and political consensus on the reform of the prisons is growing throughout Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1957> It is urgent and that is why we have decided to put this item on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1958> It is on trial on 8 January; it is accused of having participated in a meeting of Tunisian opponents in France, which incidentally it excludes.</seg>
<seg id=1959> When activists and leaders of these associations want to meet the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, their homes are surrounded by the police and those who go there are attacked in the streets by men.</seg>
<seg id=1960> The second problem is basically just one example of many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id=1961> My group, like this Parliament, is particularly sensitive to the human rights situation in Tunisia and in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1962> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us a little extent please.</seg>
<seg id=1963> The negotiations are extremely well, I am delighted that we have made great progress in these negotiations, which I hope, will lead to the conclusion as the honourable Member.</seg>
<seg id=1964> Several Members have mentioned the situation of the prisoners in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1965> B5-0912 / 2000 by Mr Van Hecke on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1966> We cannot be, I believe, Mr President, Commissioner, back on this.</seg>
<seg id=1967> The military has seized power in this context, which, as always, has only worsened the situation.</seg>
<seg id=1968> This attitude is in line with the policy of French imperialism.</seg>
<seg id=1969> The Commission is also very concerned about the recent outbreaks of violence.</seg>
<seg id=1970> The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1971> This is unfair competition can contribute to downgrade the quality of the working environment in the shipbuilding sector, to reduce the technical knowledge and to create a loss of jobs and lead, in the longer term, a monopoly situation, which would be detrimental to world trade.</seg>
<seg id=1972> Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg id=1973> That is why I would like to thank all my colleagues for their contributions, especially at the stage of the amendments, as well as the technicians of the Committee on which to help to finalise this resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1974> The adoption of the social agenda by the Nice European Council satisfies us and we hope that the Member States will take this opportunity to promote the development and coordination of social security systems and care for the elderly and promote other measures which will ensure that reintegration into working life, as the lifelong learning.</seg>
<seg id=1975> The promotion of the lifelong learning - an issue which has already been addressed by another speaker - is an issue that I also support.</seg>
<seg id=1976> Of course, people over 60 or 70 years can still do many useful things, but it is not reasonable to rely on their income of the work they provide.</seg>
<seg id=1977> In its monthly report of July 2000, the European Central Bank has launched several urgent warnings about this.</seg>
<seg id=1978> For my part, I believe that the Member States are more able to resolve this problem by means of their legislative instruments.</seg>
<seg id=1979> With its proposals for an active life in the old age, society is a whole generation.</seg>
<seg id=1980> The promises relating to pensions must be honoured, pensions, though, must be guaranteed by the funds of these countries without payment at the expense of the common monetary policy of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1981> We have experienced a most important social revolution over the last 150 years to, when our life expectancy has doubled.</seg>
<seg id=1982> It only gives full meaning to the extension of the mathematical medical progress.</seg>
<seg id=1983> They have been subsidised - the whole of society has therefore taken part - older employees have left their jobs, but no young worker has been committed and many jobs have been lost.</seg>
<seg id=1984> The family policy and taxation should instead ensure that women and men who have family obligations to decide freely to have a professional activity or not.</seg>
<seg id=1985> My brother and I have joined there.</seg>
<seg id=1986> The next steps in the field of public health are addressed to questions of health and care for the elderly and the promotion of a healthy old age.</seg>
<seg id=1987> Mr President, I have accepted the amendment tabled by Mr Pronk, both on 2 and 3, which requests that the text be amended and insists on the concept of demographic development, rather than ageing of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1988> It does not duplicate the promotional advertising or operations of operators or with the public authorities.</seg>
<seg id=1989> Mr President, the Committee on Budgets was also of the opinion that it is, in principle, in favour of the Commission's proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1990> That is why it is very important to achieve a balance which can be achieved through measures to promote sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id=1991> I believe that with regard to marketing and sales, learning as a framework for life should be placed at the centre of education programmes because the new technologies, the management of research to find a completely new offer opportunities to a modern logistics.</seg>
<seg id=1992> First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Dary on his excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=1993> The next item is the debate on the export and intervention.</seg>
<seg id=1994> There must be no special premiums and advertising for products which are not requested.</seg>
<seg id=1995> Everyone has enough to eat, and therefore if we are the promotion of a product that militera clearly against the use of another product.</seg>
<seg id=1996> Proposed Amendments Nos 18 and 24, first part, by which time during which the themes and products to be proposed will be assessed, are reduced from three to two years in order to improve the effectiveness of the instrument of promotion.</seg>
<seg id=1997> In the Greek version, Mrs Haug Juta is presented as rapporteur, involving a man, male and female Ferler as rapporteur Mr Marcuse, involving a woman.</seg>
<seg id=1998> This is a good example of how small changes in practice can have a considerable effect.</seg>
<seg id=1999> That is provisionally the last Friday in Strasbourg, in other words, Strasbourg loses 12 days of the presence of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=2000> Furthermore, I would like to wish everyone, and particularly the few who have taken the trouble to attend this Friday to the last sitting of the year 2000 in Strasbourg, an enjoyable festive season and a new century which is good, but above all.</seg>
