Our Charter of Fundamental Rights is the first in this millennium.
We must succeed in ensuring that the Union of the Fifteen in such a way that the countries who come knocking at our door, can receive under the proper conditions.
In Article 87, the area of services of general interest for social, cultural and charitable interests will be included in the long term, so that this important bodies can be protected.
Some are of the opinion that we can create a single market in Europe, without agreement on the fundamental values and principles.
For my part, I should like also to the clear and substantial speech by President Prodi.
As you know, in Amsterdam, there has been deliberately chosen to separate these two roles clearly reflects the High Representative - in contrast to the Commission - not completely independently, but its task in the coordination of the foreign and security policies which fall within the competence of Member States, and here we need a greater place the intergovernmental co-operation.
He has expressed the wish that the Presidency in Nice the future path.
It is in fact a more comprehensive and better offengestanden wishes, but I am of the opinion that we have made a good start.
I therefore hope that the European Council in Nice will decide on this project and, specifically, the fait accompli projects, not to introduce the reforms needed now, of course, have been adopted.
However, I have also specifically referred to in today 's reality that we are extremely important objectives can be achieved with the Community method, such as, for example, now more effective action in the Balkans.
Only if we in the West and Russia attachment to the European Union, we will also be able to exercise influence on its policy and in contact with Russia, and in discussion.
Motion for a resolution (B5-0767 / 00) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union
He is currently trying to this genocide, moreover, media freedom and the rule of law in Russia, in any case, not to eliminate hardly exist.
The expectations, the intention of this pensioners, Giuseppe Italia in Cremona, and would like to live with the ship sailing the POSEIs would be fair, I voted in favour of the Piecyk report, of the development and the development of the sea and inland ports and intermodal terminals.
The result of the vote in the House, the objective of the directive, which is recognised by all the speakers, and the Commission has been advocating and inaccessible.
Mr President, I have, as I said during the debate, that is to say, before the vote, have made it clear to Mr Skinner 's report because I consider to be very important venture capital.
My group colleague, Mrs Bordes are very clear yesterday that it is only a minority of Community funds and pension insurance contributions to cover risks of enterprise.
Consequently, the Charter is even more, the current practices of the nation states to affirm retrograde, rather than a genuine step forward.
Mr President, at last we have a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European citizen, what we have on the table a whole article, Article 25, the elderly.
But if he legal validity and incorporated into the Treaty, as the European Parliament is calling for in the course of time, he would inevitably to a harmonisation of the national law of the various European countries, it would mean that the Court of Justice a disproportionately large power to obtain that the centralisation of the European institutions and the independent decision more limited scope of each people.
Â· a saturation of the Charter with detailed regulations, and that these measures should be reserved for the secondary legislation.
I will be voting for a different kind of charter, I participated in the demonstrations on 13 and 14 October in Biarritz, on 7 December 2000 involved in Nice.
Progress of the 12 candidate countries towards accession
I believe that a number of Member States, it has still not understood that there is this context and that the slow pace of progress of the Intergovernmental Conference, we will be able to get into serious difficulties in the necessary period of enlargement.
All this, as I have said before, we will only succeed if in the candidate countries, and also in the European Union 's policies, and the elites in this limited context - and I would ask you, Mr Commissioner, advertise it at last that enlargement of the European Union for themselves.
This is the general principle.
Let me now turn to the second objective, which the Presidency over the next six months to make progress on the enlargement process.
I therefore suggest that you in this direction, to work with the idea that we need to consider in relation to 2003, which candidates are willing to join us on this date.
I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his comprehensive and clear report.
It is in any case "whether in the negotiations, it is only about the 'how' and 'when'.
But you have also done so, because the prospect of membership in the European Union, the hopes of the solidarity of the European peoples and because you are offered so strong political and economic support.
There are a number of countries are also the second economic criterion of competitiveness within the internal market, is that you have made good progress in getting ready for accession as quickly as possible.
We therefore seek engst possible coordination with the programmes of the national governments, of Parliament and other institutions.
Every year, and this will be very soon, on 8 November, once again, will be the case in each of the candidate countries with very great excitement the verdict of the Commission on the progress that has been made.
We have quite rightly decided in favour of the principle of differentiation, under which each beitrittskandidatenland in accordance with its progress and services.
This debate is a further opportunity for my group, to affirm that the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries, but also of Cyprus and Malta, the best secure future for all of us in Europe in the East and the West.
This is a matter of the utmost importance, but the scant attention in the eyes of the public.
Many believe humorous note that after the fall of the Berlin wall the time remaining before enlargement is always the same: five years.
The next natural opportunity in connection with the next elections to the European Parliament in the year 2009, but we want to try to have that as many countries as possible to join in 2004.
Moreover, there are six substantive issues on which we have reservations about the method applied.
It is, in actual fact, the elected model of European integration itself, i.e. all the sectors involved, regardless of the traditions and the special characteristics of the parties involved in this blind alley.
'This in Central and Eastern Europe artikulierten fairly generally at the end of the 1980s, makes sense to give substance to this day for all of us a commitment.
But what about the clear: there can be no accession to the cheap price.
At the same time, it is a great and fine idea that we are not against the enlargement and that the best way to make public the enlargements, in accordance with the public, in its participation in the elections, because the elections are an expression of democracy and a form of involvement of citizens in the political system.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly address the conditions for a scenario to say that a number of parties.
I would be very surprised if they do not exert pressure.
But I had already pointed out that all countries will be ready for accession approaching relatively quickly.
In other words, the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products is already agreed, without the fear that Poland therefore Polish agriculture collapses.
It has also been burdens, but by and large, peace and the citizens of the countries of the European Union and the Monetary Union closer to each other this development continues.
The results of the negotiations should be decisive.
The only amendment which has been presented is already contained in my report, but I am pleased that the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance, the importance of equal treatment of citizens.
This should include not only a law in the public sector, but that it is the young verwaltungsangestellten opportunities and appropriate remuneration.
This applies both to Latvia and for the European Union.
The litas connecting is planned to the euro in the second half of the year 2001.
- (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, for which I am the rapporteur, is the largest and most important, but, as we know, the countries at the same time, the problematischste on accession to the European Union; it is preparing to such a plethora of problems that we even rumours about a possible exclusion from the first group of Poland, i.e. that the first group of accession countries.
And the eastern Poland, as have many former Communist countries, which we must not promise.
Time and again, a point which, when it comes to the Czech Republic, which is the issue of the Roma.
Slovakia was not mentioned, and in the second group would like to join at the same time, to be consistent with the Czech Republic.
Finally, I should also like to comment on one internal policy.
Thirdly, as regards agriculture, whose productivity still in the European Union is that it will be necessary to keep the agricultural market fully for the privatisation of land, the modernisation of farms and distribution structures and to increase the yield necessary capital markets.
Bulgaria is very much in the way of accession to the European Union and NATO.
Since 1990, the acute poverty is one of the most serious problems in Romania, but the present government is that the economic situation is actually take a turn for the better.
I hope that these issues will be to safeguard in 14 days of the priorities set by the new Parliament and the Slovenian government.
It must be emphasised, however, that a just and lasting solution to both the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council, i.e. none other than the current international law, and the European Union must take into account the principles behind.
Malta has, moreover, on stable, democratic functioning institutions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we want to make our contribution to this debate.
They must also be implemented, and the European Community law is not just a law in the books, but also in the candidate countries is a law in action.
This change is tough demands on the people in the candidate countries, and also, at the same time, safeguarding their future and the future of their children.
Special attention - and here I agree with the previous speakers - is on the border regions.
In this context, the Commission must not be left alone.
The candidate countries' desire for a rapid economic growth, even if this is at the expense of an already established nature conservation policy.
We had a bad habits exchange, including in the field of health.
Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and united European continent.
The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, which is also in the area of transport and the trans-European networks is responsible, are aware of the need for different sectoral Community policies to coordinate a global European regional planning policy.
But we still have a clear indication that the transport infrastructure of key importance to the success of enlargement will be.
Mr President, I would like to join those who, in the forthcoming enlargement is the main task of the EU.
In the former planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe to the traditional social values considerable pressure.
The PPE Group would not accept responsibility for the accession of the candidate countries to speed, for we can set a date of accession.
The second point is the inclusion of data.
There is another reason.
Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and the positive prospects for the individual countries and for the EU as a whole, that Denmark has shown that a great impact on the social and democratic deficits of European policy.
As herabwÃ¼rdigende populism is the will of the people, with the technocrats if it is universally disparaged and in a way which does not suit you.
Ladies and gentlemen, you have meal and recovery recess, it goes further o 'clock.
It is, albeit in the long term, a common currency for the whole continent.
On these issues will be internal conflicts "in the individual countries.
We call on you to the fight for a different Europe, a Europe of all the peoples, which is exempt from these inhuman stigma, where all the nations themselves determine their own destiny and that they can exchange relations of peace, freedom, brotherhood and the cooperation established at the mutual benefit.
I would like to pay tribute to the work of these organisations, the public is also, and above all, the challenge of the Romanian appeal has its headquarters in Birmingham and organisations in Ireland, which is supported by many people, including from the Irish entertainment artists, Daniel o 'donnell a donation of EUR 1 million pounds duty and this amount in Ireland and other parts of the world.
The summit in Nice shed light must, above all, whether and how the EU can allow themselves to be ready for enlargement itself fully and in good time.
Poland, will you wonder, when we are also joined us, or are we paid second-class countries?
However, I am sure that, with good will, with the help of the European Union and a solution can be found to the two communities to live together in harmony and live in prosperity, as has been the case for centuries.
However, we have taken care to the issue of minorities, because the issue of the integration of these minorities, including their linguistic integration, is also important in these countries.
The conditions for membership is compliance with the basic criteria of Copenhagen.
We have heard a lot about the benefits of enlargement, but this is an area where we can learn from Lithuania.
Imagine that we will all be the case!
Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs thank and congratulate, but I would like to focus, in particular, to the country and, in particular, the policy on minorities.
I urge you, in Nice, by setting a date when it with the most advanced candidate countries - haunted - intend to put an end to the negotiations.
The European Union must continue to Bulgaria on its path to enter the Union and, of course, to help ensure that the planning of this aid is still dezentralisierter.
The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of civil society, the government and the Parliament plays an important and positive role - as we say.
We are now in the process of overcoming the division of Europe and not a new.
All of this is set out in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, and I should like to thank her on behalf of our group, for this report.
This understanding, in my opinion, the issue of Cyprus should be one of Europe 's ability to decide to adopt a political reality.
I, myself, live near the Baltic Sea, which is a common concern for all of us.
The political vision remains.
We have the desire of particularly pleased to note that Mr HÃ¤nsch spoke for the PSE Group that the Commission has a genuine assessment of the effects of enlargement and the economic consequences are too, if it is not to enlargement.
However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling that without transitional periods in the interests of both parties, and that will not go down as a Member for a border region, which, as Mrs Schierhuber a farm in the vicinity of the Czech border, I am concerned that the emergence of near the common economic space and can be solved without major problems on both sides to a positive outcome.
As a Social Democrat, I would like to make three points.
The issues of the first pillar of the economy in the EEA containing granted applicant countries access to the internal market, the young and science, obliged the EU legal exchange programmes but, on the other hand, the system of agricultural aid does not extend to these countries from the EEA agreement, so it would be good for the economy, in particular in the candidate countries - they need for their society, growth, to make it fit for accession, and for the economy in the EU, when assessing the cost of enlargement, even two thirds of economic growth in the EEA model, possibly even more.
Secondly, they will adopt the 'big bang' - idea to include many of the candidate countries at the same time, this would contradict the principle that each country according to its progress.
Thirdly, we must do everything in our power to the European Union until 2003, in the spirit of the excellent speech by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, on the enlargement process.
In this connection, I would like to address the relationship between Parliament and the Council with the comment that it has considerable delays in reply to written questions.
It is worrying that this is happening in a country that wishes to join the European Union.
I would request a referral back to committee, in which the necessary measures should be prepared.
Mr President, today we are three reports on this issue as a whole, including two, perhaps by myself, discuss and vote on it.
That would be at all stages of the food chain.
Safe food mean throughout the entire chain costs.
We must therefore vote in favour of Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and the verschneidung, so that animal feed ban will be safer and the European consumer protection.
The 1999 directive was well thought through, and it may also be a success, as already indicated, there could be reduced burdens.
However, mixing up then simply is not the solution.
In short, we need to Amendment 37 on the dioxin problem.
We are all agreed on this point.
The result will be that we, as the European consumer to buy meat, milk and their waste in the world market, which in no way set by the Union in this threshold and limit values are manufactured feeds - in other words, in a system in which raw materials to be acquired in the world markets, where every substance can be mixed or any preparation freely before the products into the territory of the European Union.
The Commission should us between now and the second reading on the proposed procedure regarding risk assessment.
On the other hand, it would be extremely serious if, for example, Amendments Nos 39 and 40 will be adopted, as it is for the Member States, then there is no possibility of intervening in newly discovered dangers quickly.
Consumer protection already starts with feedingstuffs, sstoffen feedingstuff content, the quantitative description and finally the official controls.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Paulsen, on undesirable substances in animal food is an important subject, which, like all the important issues is a highly controversial.
The discussion on the excellent report by Mrs Paulsen, we have before us today was a highly emotive on a number of points, and at the end of this debate, we must assume that the feedingstuffs industry have strict conditions, the quality of mixtures, however, can be changed now.
Each of these three proposals, both individually and in the common work together to contribute to the elimination of the main shortcomings which characterise the dioxin crisis.
Amendment 33 re-export of feed should subscribe to the requirements of this directive, which do not comply with the export to third country should be avoided.
The Commission is unable to accept Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which proposes that the possibility of dilution ausgangs#erzeugnis feed mittel-ausgangserzeugnisse kontaminierter under certain conditions.
This should be given our pledge that we, in the framework of the new proposal for the creation of a food authority, a system for the rapid exchange of information that will make the whole of the food and feed chain will cover.
Commissioner Byrne, to take this directive on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs in fact conceal our old problem, namely the question of open declaration.
And this is for me the earlier this morning.
Because if we were to do this, if we were to implement quickly and speedily through the codecision procedure, it is certainly a great asset, and I am sure that it will be a very strong and united in relation to the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the future too, there may not be excluded, but at least it is contaminated, in animal feed ingredients.
The BSE scandal was the worst and most well-known example.
As our rapporteur has already said, it would be best if we have open declaration, with a label on the list of ingredients.
I think that the professional qualifications and the judgment of the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in the field of agriculture and also, therefore, in the field of animal nutrition is beyond question, in the sense of a practical and workable solution of the farmers and consumers will be understood and applied.
As far as the positive part.
I believe this to be a legitimate right to information, which we must support.
On behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, I would like to ask you, Madam President, the families of the victims and the local authorities of MarÃ­n, Galicia and Brittany, where most of the victims, to convey the condolences of the House.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Is there anyone who wishes to - against the tabling of this oral amendment?
The rapporteur has explained the situation.
Most of the technical proposals deserve our strong support, such as, for example, in the field of food safety, decommissioning of the nuclear power stations of the first generation, environmental protection, the fight against social dumping, the essential code of conduct for companies in the East and much more from the West and these tasks are enormous and therefore absolutely priority.
At the same time, it will continue to be considerable difficulties, especially in the area of the budget.
An enlargement to change the geopolitical context not only 13 countries of the European Union, but it is changing their structure, since on the one hand, the total population will increase (+ 28%), on the other hand, but also the number of 'poor' regions.
It is important to note that in the candidate countries a competitive agriculture and food industry because of their high economic and social balance to the successful transformations and restructuring process will be of crucial importance.
In this context I would like to express the wish that the outermost regions, which are still being six of the ten poorest seven of the EU structural funds alone, not only because of the GDP criterion, but also because of geographic, demographic and, above all, social indicators.
Since we are in the interests of the people of Europe, can we reject its extension to the countries and peoples of the East, which are exempt from the Communist dictatorship only and do not yet know what the technocratic and, in a kind of this measure totalitarian case they are not in good conscience.
We would have been in the country report and in a short but at most incisive resolution should leave.
The present system of subsidies, subsidies exists through free trade and quotas must be replaced and adapting to the market.
The importance and significance of the problems posed by the enlargement are not fits in with the hypocrisy with which we in the European Union.
To talk about enlargement, which in my view that means not belonging to reiterate some countries to Europe or not.
Our neighbouring country over the last ten years has been working to meeting the accession criteria.
Latvia has its place in this House, not only because it its progress in general, the right to give this' trust 'for a successful conclusion of such negotiations is essential, but above all because it is at home in Europe.
I believe that the State that Poland is the best of all candidate countries deserves our support and our commitment to the extremely important initiatives, for without Poland would be communism has been overthrown and we are not here today to deal with this problem.
For the sake of these people, who are still largely from eurosceptic, this may not be in the same way.
I would appeal to Prague, this message, this invitation to address such a request to respond to this dialogue and, together with this House, to ensure that this can be overcome the legacy of a nationalist era.
I welcome the report by Mr Wiersma, on the request of Slovakia to join the European Union and can support the majority of his conclusions.
It is with great pleasure that I take this opportunity to offer the elderly and pensioners special greeting the Republic of Bulgaria.
If Romania continues to make progress and the European Union has to adapt their institutional structures and policies, in order to be able to cope with enlargement, I see no reason why Romania should be incorporated into the Union.
The report 's position is clear, however hard to find a solution to the problem of the settlers might look like the country, which is extremely difficult to return for both sides.
Unfortunately, some of the statements made in the draft report, which the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the application by the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union, is not helpful.
Given the lack of good will of the Turkish Cypriot community and Turkey, this will not be an easy task.
Stenzel report (A5-0243 / 2000)
Unfortunately, I was the victim of an, albeit slight, food poisoning that I fatalerweise left in the European Parliament.
For all of these reasons, I voted in favour of the ban on verschneidung proposed by the European Commission.
We must call on the ASEM countries in this motion for a resolution to put pressure on the military regime in Burma to be a democracy is restored.
We are not consistent in our approach and in the implementation of our measures.
Now is not the time for small courage and tremendous grief.
A number of important points in the regulation are firstly, regulation of the burden of proof.
Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU.
Those are the 'legislation reasons why we need to combat discrimination.
As a result of this, too, we now have a large number of amendments, fachjuristische by the same level of protection against discrimination on grounds of race, on the one hand, and on the grounds of religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, on the other hand, should be guaranteed.
He had to achieve a balance, care and a good legal technology, and his report is reflected in my opinion these qualities.
Moreover, these Members of the view that the discrimination is not so often that specific legislation.
The financial resources of the action programme is not strong enough to replace the work done in the fifth framework programme, and I hope, will continue in other framework programmes and it is our duty to ensure that the programme will be working across borders.
On the need to combat discrimination, although it is true that, on the general agreement, as, to what extent and in what are the means to be applied.
In the committee, I had the opportunity to defend themselves against that experts who are not able to speak for NGOs.
We also welcome to a large extent, the equal treatment directives provision for disabled people, which also means that appropriate adjustments in the workplace are provided by companies.
This is the only way we will manage, discrimination in all areas of human coexistence to fight effectively in Europe.
All in all, the major Anglo-Saxon democracies also teach us that racism and discrimination, with the help of liberal democracy, and not by limiting and gradual dismantling of freedom of expression, freedom of expression, freedom of association and the economic freedoms, be combated.
In a proposal, the equality of homosexuality with the Holy marriage.
In this way the European Union can in specific cases in which the discrimination or the equal treatment of its citizens, a clearer stance.
I would also like to highlight the issue of exception in terms of religion.
From various quarters, concern about the possible interpretation of Article 1 of the explanatory statement, which is still, however, is somewhat unclear distinction between sexual orientation and sexual behaviour.
In this way, there is a hierarchy of discrimination.
In neukaledonien because of the colour, we can benefit from the advantages.
Together with the recently adopted directive 2000 is the orientation of the directive the declared will of the European Union to stand up for an open society by patterns and, above all, of the stigma entrenched in the history of Europe that is free of racism.
Those who say that, here in this Parliament, the values which we all want to defend a European directive does not need to be laid down, are wrong.
This success must not produced hard.
Finally, the Media is also an important role in this task.
Experience has also shown that the promotion of legislative proposals on the fight against discrimination is essential, but it is not enough.
We must prevent an empty bureaucratic mess, that Europe, only to a purely materialistische Community without deeper sense politically correct, would be reduced.
I believe that this Parliament has in actual fact restrained legislation which the European Commission ausgeschmÃ¼ckt wanted to propose a Christmas tree.
Let me begin by the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, for two excellent reports.
I can also accept your amendments, which highlights the importance of prevention and the fight against discrimination should be emphasised.
The second category is aimed in terms of content, the text of the Commission proposal to make quite clear during the third category from a large number of amendments with which this proposal is in keeping with the directive adopted last June against racial discrimination.
Particularly in Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20, it is proposed that the reference to discrimination on the grounds of racial and ethnic origin.
I can forward your comments in Amendments Nos 21 and 45 on natural and legal persons and groups of persons nichtformalisierte not approve this proposal on employment, because only for individuals.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
We can expect no public support for friedensschaffende operations, if our troops are threatened with the weapons we have delivered.
In my own country, I could not even a schrot flinte without authorisation, whereas I can cope with the opening of an arms trade in my garden schuppen needs no approval.
Another important point is the ban on the export, the promotion and marketing of equipment or of know-how, which primarily for purposes of torture.
Having said that, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Titley, of course, like to congratulate on his excellent report.
In addition to the issues of binding obligations on the one hand, we must also look at the immediate priorities to extend to military action, aimed at strengthening converting disarmament, the work of the police and customs officials, and, on the other, to just raised by Mr Wiersma candidate countries.
The money is distributed, it is much more difficult to control of the arms trade, the current provisions.
The aim of the annual review is to identify such potential improvements.
The European Union is currently examining whether this project on the project, the period ending in November of this year, can continue.
There was a methodology and indicators at the next research Council will be presented.
I would like to thank you, Mr Busquin.
With regard to the problems of the SMEs, of course, we have ensured that the SMEs in the budget decision, as provided for in the framework programme will take into due consideration.
It would appear, at least from the debate on the budget herauszukristallisieren in Greece, and many jobs are even to the attitude of the European Union.
With regard to the multidisciplinary nature is concerned, I share your concerns.
The first point which he expressly referred to in his statement, the participation of the EU 's national programmes.
Therefore we could not speak in terms of a European research area, if we only 5% of the research budget.
Thank you, Mr Busquin.
On the one hand, the efforts of the appropriations until the end of the year 1999 to bind in full at the beginning of this year, the number of the amendments to the decision for the financing of new projects in accordance with low.
Once again, however, I would like to point out that, during the previous period, Portugal has fulfilled all to our satisfaction.
Question No 2 by (H-0730 / 00):
The setting of excise duty at a high level, does not mean that the Community competition rules are not being complied with.
Secondly, Mr MacCormick will be aware of the following: to encourage the Member States to a particular industrial sector with tax money, they violate the rules on state aid, and it must do so in this case fiscal aid that roughly the same subsidies.
A clear case is, for example, the use of nuclear energy.
Subject: budget line since 1983 minority languages, in addition to the budget of the European Union in favour of minority languages and 1995 saw a constant increase in the year that has been achieved with their levels of EUR 4 million.
Mr President, the Members of this Parliament are probably aware that the Structural Funds - and this is new - if a large number of appropriations for cultural activities, together with Commissioner Michel Barnier, because I have emphasised that the structural funds are not only to invest in roads and in airports but also with a view to the people.
Next year the Commission will therefore in any further financial commitments.
What concrete proposals for financing is concerned, I am not in a position at this stage, because we do not accept the normal procedure.
I have several options under consideration.
And this must be avoided, since we are talking about millions of small and medium-sized enterprises throughout Europe.
Do the provisions relating to the hunt elk hunting, including, for example, the treatment of certain meat for personal use?
If the rules on meat from animals preyed apply for personal use, the bureaucratic disaster for the elk hunting.
After the conclusion of the report, I intend to put forward proposals to improve the transport of animals, I shall also present in the problem of inadequate enforcement of the journey time restrictions.
We have on this issue before my meeting with the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance.
Our question was clear: what measures is the Commission taking?
General product safety, the manufacturers also committed to their customers on possible risks.
The case ayubi Maryam is an extremely worrying trend.
Question No 14 by (H-0745 / 00):
The attitude of the EU in relation to the meeting on ministerialebene in Vientiane, certainly with regard to the question of whether it was to take place at all and at what level the EU should be represented by the developments in Burma will be dependent on until December.
A final comment.
The elections are an important step for the incorporation of the inhabitants of Kosovo in shaping their local communities.
I can assure you that these elections are held democratic elections and better than in our own countries, in which I have participated or often either where I was present as an observer.
However, we saw it as a beginning and not an analysis of the process.
It is a more effective and coherent control of the arms trade and more transparency.
Now I notice that, every year, more supply contracts for weapons and what must be closed.
On the basis of virtual realities of fictional information, we can not relevant decisions.
The arrangement in these activities of one and the same directorate-general should be reviewed, have been carried out.
Although these institutions must have the opportunity to set up an internal auditor, however, it would be quite sufficient to the financial controller certain minimum standards with regard to the obligation to the audit.
With this proposal, as the Commissioner knows very well, not unanimous approval in Parliament.
Therefore, I have nothing against an independent internal audit service, for which we are today, with the report by Mr van Hulten give the green light.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur.
We are of the opinion that there is an urgent need for the modernisation of administration.
An independent gegenprÃ¼fung is essential if we are to avoid mistakes.
The money should be spent in a more focused and more effectively in the future, and, of course, also be better guarantee that the money is to be spent on the purposes for which they were intended by the budgetary authority.
Now to the proposed amendments make the following: the introduction of this additional recital, the Commission agrees.
I should therefore like to thank you for your suggestions and your advice.
I would like to take the proposals in this report which, in my view, the most important and most effective: firstly, set up a group of experts to summarise, appointed by the Member States in order to meet high-level people generally recognised parameters set for the protection of minors in the media; secondly, to contribute to the introduction of a code kontroll-kodex itself by all the television companies; thirdly: method of promoting and access to filter systems for both the television and the Internet.
Unfortunately, I do not agree with the demands of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
That is, and remains, mainly the responsibility of the legislation of the Member States, but what a konsensuale understanding on certain parameters in the dialogue with all interested parties in no way excludes at European level.
Under the prevailing conditions, I think it is the task of the parents, their children against this type of programmes at home.
Parents are particularly on assistance in this field, which must contain the following: parameters for the protection of minors in the media sector throughout the European Union, the establishment of and cost-effective availability of filter systems, legislation on the protection of minors and the responsibility of the media, companies and operators in the private and public sectors.
When it comes to debates in committee some say that there was no evidence of the negative influence of the various forms of violence on television on children, then I am surprised and believe that this is a fatal trivialisation.
With regard to the introduction of a code kontroll-kodex itself from a technical point of view, it is interesting to note that broadcasting services in some Member States have already drawn up a code for television, television should enable the parents to eliminate.
The debate is closed.
Above all, in my report to the praiseworthy generalisations by returning the decision-making powers of the Member States.
This is the least we can do for the area of freedom, a fundamental right of every citizen of the European Union is to be guaranteed.
There is a backlog in payments for the year 1996.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to offer the rapporteurs, Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani, for the work they have done.
I commend this report to the House and in favour of the adoption of the amendments put forward by Mr Evans.
Our human resources are the sole future in a world in which know all means.
And I know it is not a good deal more problems with green, knows, undeclared or red books, but by means of concrete measures.
But Parliament has fulfilled its role, so that the researchers and pressure, however, be included in the text.
It occurs at a time when, for the future of the European integration process is of great importance.
We know, however, that this process is not yet complete, and is, therefore, is in danger of losing its vitality.
If we do not now, in this difficult and stormy transition phase of European and world history, when will we do it done?
None of us can now claim to know exactly when and in what order in which we will be able to achieve these objectives, but we are all aware that, if we want to believe in you and they assiduously, half of the way we have behind us.
We must ensure that women, with the induzierten nutznieÃerinnen placements are not the same inequalities in the traditional sectors such as should arise, i.e. less qualified jobs, part-time work on a voluntary basis, does not always fixed-term contracts and difficult access to decision-making positions.
The Council will deal with a proposal on the basis of which the relevant indicators, progress can be assessed.
In short, the fourth pillar concerning equal opportunities means support for the integrated approach of equality through gender mainstreaming and specific guidelines.
I am thinking in particular of violence against women, one of the main themes of my government, and I know that this issue is a very special concern to you.
We know that the measures for the reconciliation of family and professional life, women in particular, if there is a lack of studies on the current situation of the family and the role of women in the family, which is no longer the traditional role, because society has changed considerably, and also the family structure.
Some people seem, sometimes, some Members in this House, however, to believe that this was the case, but that is not true.
Mr President, I would like to finish by stressing that the equal opportunities in its own four walls begins.
I think that such a position, and it should zwielichtig cause for concern and, in my opinion, in the light of the projects to be considered, because it is not certain that this will take us to the practical implementation.
In this area there is no equality.
The image of European women, as it is from our reports, from our directives, is not up to the result of the Danish women who voted by a majority to reject the euro.
So, I think it is significant that the report, in all sectors of society, for example in the labour market, zahlenmÃ¤Ãiges need to strike a balance between men and women.
For that reason, it is a missed opportunity, that in this report completely ignored by marriage and the family.
That should be the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities, better to heart.
We have heard that the previous presidency Ministry of gender equality and then only in restructuring has abolished.
The average wage of women is on average 28% of men, and in the process of ensuring that the majority of the poor women 's population, and their participation in social and political life more difficult.
This really is an excellent one.
Today is a process taking place throughout Europe, including the impoverishment of women in France, where at least 15 per cent of them less than a month onwards 3.650 have to live on.
Not all countries have succeeded to follow their example, and I hope that the example of France in other countries will bear fruit.
The history of the women seem far enough.
The applicant country, the adoption of the acquis communautaire really be helped.
In this respect, but I need your help.
That is not the case, but it is a satisfactory text, and the Committee on Legal Affairs chose after careful consideration and a wider debate, no amendments.
After a long debate came before the Committee on Legal Affairs believes that it is not appropriate to the prevailing legal uncertainty over six years, and to maintain the specified period of three years is a more than an appropriate period of time and with the necessary resources to be able to say that the average care whether a statement documents of irregularities or not.
That is Amendment 15, which deals with the fraud.
The objective of a simpler, but, in particular, qualitative communications in the basic regulation sufficient flexibility, however, improve the procedures for the recovery of the duties and greater adjustment of the provisions concerning the registration with the customs to carry out that one of the requirements of the single market that has been achieved here, even in such a way that, in many countries also have to draw inspiration from quickly be able to participate in world trade.
They would like to thank Parliament and in particular the committee chaired by Mrs Palacio for the work both institutions in this dossier, and the interest devoted to it.
Welcome
I would not like to see the votes, but the translation is influenced by the French version really needs to be reviewed.
Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Evans report.
It is recognised that foreign language skills are a necessary condition for mobility.
We also feel that, to a large extent, the Member States themselves should decide on taxation.
I have some regrets that we had no chance to obtain a majority in favour of the need for a verjÃ¤hrung deadline for the aufbewahren of documents.
- (FR) In the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam, we had at the time the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination on grounds of sex, race, ethnic origin, religion or belief - not a sectarian), disability, age or sexual orientation.
The problems of certain minorities in those countries is, of course, all aware of this.
On the amendment from the explanatory statement clearly shows that this is also the intention of being pursued in the Member States to apply the relevant provisions of the age of entwicklungspsychologischen reasons, however, are perfectly right of all meaning of life and in employment.
I also think that all of this in a new Article 12, which was verzichtbar zusammengeschrieben a).
On religion and faith, and the EPLP welcomes the principle of a specific protection.
- (SV) We Christian Democrats broadly welcome the proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for the implementation of the equal treatment in employment and occupation.
But it says something not only on the staff of internal audit service and nothing on the financial importance and therefore the usefulness of such a service.
The EU has decided to establish a common military jurisdiction to meet the so-called Petersberg objectives of combating and conflict resolution (crises outside the territory of the EU), but do not have their own defence policy.
Without weapons, the world would be much safer.
The motion for a resolution is not intended to drastic cuts of arms sales to promote a policy of abrÃ¼stens rules for this, but I should like to continue to take to safeguard the profits of military groups.
In its communication, the Commission recognises the problem is, however, proposing any practical measures, because it is the idea of the liberalisation of the market and competition is arrested actually all of its proposals, particularly children - the harsh reality of the unaccountability of multinationals, which ignores the thirst for profit indifferent to the impact of their programmes and products, and any responsibility parents deadlock, even more to the acquisition of new products to be stimulated to protect their children.
As the rapporteur, I am also of the opinion that the measures for the protection of young people from violent and harmful to the traditional television programmes will no longer have to limit, but also for all media are to apply.
With an average of three hours a day is television, in addition to the sleep for adults and - in addition to the work - the most important human activity.
Furthermore, women occupy often 'flexible' jobs; fixed-term contracts and low wages are typical of the sectors in which mainly women are employed.
They are the first victims of the cuts in public funding of privatisation in the health sector, the restriction of the right to health care and medical treatment, cuts in unison, which still have the right to preventative and information programmes.
B5-0792 / 2000 by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, on the crisis in Peru.
Mr President, I would like to see us here, in fact, not only in connection with one or two topical and urgent, but following a debate in the committee is in favour of a debate on Latin America.
We must make every effort to get Peru with candidates being able to achieve the objective of equal to the challenge and are in a position to the call from the Peruvian people in political renewal and substantial democracy.
The joint debate is closed.
We now know, Afghanistan is not far from Afghanistan is the world 's largest opiumproduzent, so that we can imagine the role played by these political - not only in political terms, in the extension of drug trafficking mafias.
The Commission will make an assessment of the humanitarian aid programmes for the benefit of the Afghan population calls on the ground, so that no one is being forgotten.
This conflict brings unspeakable suffering.
For years, we have a budget line for mine clearance and prevention programmes will be financed.
Let me at this point to the comments by Mrs Paciotti, of course, to say that I still within the Commission will raise the question of the money for what has happened and what is happening to mine clearance.
B5-0794 / 2000 by Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, Mr Medina Ortega, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the abduction of a in negotiations with the Spanish jesuiten guerrillas in Colombia;
We all regret that we want, and we would not have to speak again on Colombia.
The Commission has already offered to coordinate such a package of measures, and the Commission intends to do in the next few days, we have already promised substantial sums of money for this purpose.
Once again, then, will be applying double standards, which is regrettable.
In particular, I understand the behaviour of the Albanian opposition party, but that they are aware of accepting the need for a solution to the Albanian problem in Macedonia.
I think it is an extraordinary achievement of the Macedonians, within their own country to each other.
That is why I also believe that this reconciliation can be sustained, but the government which, with great courage and a solution to the university, many other issues need visible signs of success and needs substantial support, otherwise it is peace in the region as a whole at risk.
In the context of the national programme for the year 2000 PHARE funds can be made available to support the university in the coming academic year, 2001 and 2002.
I should like to emphasise that all the Greek Members already today in the European Parliament on this issue.
After all, since all these problems affect Greece, which has the largest shipping sector in the European Union, they basically relate to the security of all kinds of maritime throughout the Union.
In the last few years in our waters have far more people have lost their lives, not only by big ferry accidents, but all too often in our fischereikommunen too.
On the contrary, innocent victims must now ensure that the shipowners to serve their objectives in the broadest sense prevail.
We must be aware that this is also about the credibility of the European Union.
Finally, I would stress that the Commission is convinced that the issue of European legislation on the safety of passenger ships a matter of the highest priority in the European Union should be and how important it is to ensure that these laws throughout the Community and uniformly applied rigorously.
I apologise for the fact that, for reasons which you are well aware, a little late, I would like to make a brief statement on the two on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade and in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East.
Commissioner Verheugen, as Mr Solana to refer to the two issues on our agenda for this afternoon, that is, the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.
We must be prepared, as soon as this promise to respect the will of the people.
Madam President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I do not entirely without reservations in this debate; I wanted to, that our Parliament is not given the dramatic consequences of the new outbreaks of violence in the Middle East, just a month after the here in this Chamber today raised expectations as confident as judge, that only the competent to this or that are to be condemned.
Madam President, I should like to fernanalysen based on current contribution, but not on my own experience of the last week, because I happened to be in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip, when it came to the violence.
As an opponent of the violence is the violence of the Israelis and the Palestinians on the same footing.
I would like this House to ask at this crucial time, a declaration of solidarity with the brave people now to adopt in the streets for protecting the freedom to show the same solidarity even a few years ago, we Europeans will be the people of other capital cities, who are fighting for their freedom.
There is no doubt that the Europeans would be well advised to us here in this House by the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council, to take the opportunity offered schopfe.
The status of Jerusalem is a difficult point in the negotiations.
For many years he has succeeded in brutalem propaganda machine and put pressure on the media to deceive the people in his own country, but also, unfortunately, many of them in the Western world a false picture of the reality, believing.
As the curtain falls to this tragedy, it is the duty of this Parliament as a symbol of a united, free Europe, the mass before the Yugoslav parliament and Mr KostunÃ­ca to support in carrying out and help to fulfil his mandate.
At the same time, it is precisely these unversÃ¶hnliche fear the worst attitude leaves the events of this moment, and to underline the words I have noted a couple of hours ago.
I wonder whether the Commissioner on this point steps will have to show that we as the legally elected representatives KostunÃ­ca at the Serbian people and as a partner with which the European Union today.
The European Parliament would like to him at this historic moment, since the tyranny in equipment and democracy triumphed, tell its complete solidarity.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0237 / 2000) by Mr SeppÃ¤nen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending the Decision 2000 / 24 / EC as regards the extension of the Community for any losses Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank loans for projects in Croatia [COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000 / 0122 (CNS)).
The following the parliamentary and presidential elections in this country have adopted new political line is to be welcomed.
It is a consultative task force, the objective of which is your competence and Croatia to offer technical assistance in the Treaty negotiations.
We must not forget that Croatia until recently the classic example of a totally failing privatisation programme, which was only a few people have benefited from the privatisation of this whole process, must be supported.
The EIB 's contribution in the form of a loan of EUR 250 million for the period 2000 to 2007, this can not a milestone, but a befÃ¶rdernde aid.
It is therefore incorrect, if in this report by a democratisation.
Croatia and Slovakia than half a century ago, in particular, for the first time, they have been independent servants of the Hitler regime.
We can, of course, the question of the guarantees and the issue of Croatia was not divorced from the discussion yesterday evening and development in Belgrade.
If it is true that Milosevic from the will of the people, and that has been gained the upper hand in practical terms, we hope that the inclusion of normal partnership and relations between Serbia and our Europe of democracies only next.
I declare the on Friday 6 October 2000, resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The House rose and observed a minute 's silence)
My question is: who is entitled to speak on behalf of the European Parliament on the Statute?
I ask you, Madam President, that all possible steps for the current procedure in the Committee on Petitions is that of more than thirty groups of society and NGOs, submitted in writing and protest against the petitioners of the current situation in which Community rules on radiological protection are being violated in flagrant manner to be speeded up.
Autopsie in Georgia 's shows that this is clearly a murder, probably in connection with torture has acted.
We have the opportunity to their dream - which is, in fact, my is not - a major step forward.
This is the basic legislation and the basis for any other legislation of genetically modified plants.
It comes from a fat nÃ¤pfchen appears on the other.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.40.p.m. and resumed at 17.50.)
The next item is the report (A5-0291 / 2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council [COM (2000) 379 - c5-0508 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 (COS)], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the social policy agenda.
The importance of this open method of coordination should emphasise this method is not in the place of social legislation in Europe too, because we want to lay down minimum social standards, social rights and social laws must formulate, within the framework of the European internal market are needed.
In our opinion, we also call for dialogue and cooperation with civil society and in particular with the women 's organisations in the countries which are currently to prepare themselves for accession to the European family, because here too there, we must launch a harmonious development in good time in theory and in practice to follow the example of the rest of Europe.
In the communication from the Commission to the business sectors also mentioned, there is general agreement.
At this point in my speech, I would like to remind you, which is holding a seminar on this subject, on 4 and 5 December will be organised in Biarritz, which I shall chair.
With regard to the fight against exclusion on 17 October, we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs made a great deal of progress and appropriate objectives in the fight against poverty and social exclusion, which is defined as a basis for the national action plans.
I have heard from certain quarters that we read the report on the diagnosis, but not the mandated recipe.
Technological development and the new forms of organisation is certainly also for a flexible cooperation arrangements in rigid with less, but rather towards the goals and results.
In our view, it is precisely the old-fashioned views the blame on those who do not expect of a liberalised market for the best that it regulates.
This has played a key role in the social peace in our country and helped reinforce the confidence of foreign direct investment.
The chosen method, seems to me to be somewhat questionable.
When we talk of a charter of fundamental rights and of a European Constitution, we should not be short-sighted, well, we need to say is that all the necessary steps need to be taken, even if it needs to exakterer rules.
A critical note, I would like a lack of initiatives to the new challenges in the workplace, the involvement of employees and the labour relations.
Mr President, I too would like to offer the rapporteur, the Commissioner and Mrs PÃ©ry on this report on the social policy agenda.
We know that these points be combated by the conservatives in Europe but, in our group, we attach special importance to ensuring that.
The third aspect concerns the content of the enlargement.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30.p.m.
The action taken by the Commission, by means of a review of the impact of access for the individual to medical care, social insurance and pension system and an analysis of the deficiencies in the organisation of work, and perhaps the question of a general cut in working hours.
In this way, the women of Europe, but we also feel that Europe is close to benefit from the interesting and innovative ideas from the level of commitment to this programme.
We want an annual report by the President of the Commission in the context of an annual debate in the European Parliament.
Furthermore, I am delighted that an improvement in the measures to child care, which is scheduled for reconciling work and family life easier.
My group will take account of this in the final vote.
(The President cut the speaker off)
In my view, the new approach adopted by the Commission is extremely positive and the proposal for a decision on the programme for the period 2001-2005 well thought through.
I believe that many of us reflect the amendments approved the common position, which the Commission and the Committee on Women 's rights in this matter.
On the one hand, I have questions in the course of the last year by a number of companies that receive a certain amount of impotence in connection with the testing procedures have seen, not least in those cases in which an appeal against the decision of the Commission had to be recourse to the Court of First Instance.
I would also like to take the opportunity to ask when Commissioner Monti and the implementation of a public, effective and well-functioning list on state aid, and it is to be expected when the panel has for a long time, may prove to be implemented.
Mr Monti, I would also like to point out that in the next report the giving of credit should be given wider area.
As I have said, is not only in the field of energy policy as a whole, but also in other areas.
Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work on the two reports, in which a complimentary assessment of the activities of their person and the Directorate General for Competition, have done.
I stress this because the market is not everything can be regulated and it therefore also not unlimited competition and.
Mr President, nobody is disputing today - and I also, of course, that State aid should not change the conditions of competition are bad and, in this respect, the ineffectiveness of companies.
At least that is what it is strange to hear that the reduction in state aid in the period abstreitet 1994-1998, despite the fact that the Commission itself acknowledges this.
My opinion is, of course, the xxix., the Commission 's report on competition policy, but we have no choice but to look back at the past.
In the time available to me, I would like to focus on the following three points: modernisation of Community competition law, activity in 1999 on the enforcement of the rules of competition and state aid.
The Commission is always resolutely opposed to the monopolies, and anyone against the abuse of a dominant position.
Mr Rapkay, the Commission attaches great importance to the support of your competition policy by the European Parliament, and I do not have the impression that this support is falling.
This system can, either at the request of a Member State or in accordance with Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, a provision to be activated during the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union just for the States with a derogation, which is currently for Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.
In future, the recourse to the capital market should remain the only possible option.
I would ask, therefore, that the report in its present form will meet with the approval of the House and that, therefore, including in the area of the single European market is good reb plants can be used.
Now that it needs to be changed to the development of the phytosanitÃ¤ren rules and to scientific and technical progress, especially in the field of in vitro propagating material which have been achieved.
This precautionary principle by genetic changes to the possibility, for example, of the intensive use of plant protection products.
Finally, I would like to say that we, in the interest of the precautionary principle, which I have just mentioned, if the articles and amendments, then it should not be withdrawn, as is also calling for the opinion of the winegrower Marianne Isler BÃ©guin and, therefore, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and for their deletion of votes.
Mr President, if I may, Commissioner, you could give its opinion on the amendment of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy - it is the present Amendment 1.
The only controversial point was whether I of the decree on the withdrawal of Mr Le Pen 's parliamentary mandate immediately after his transfer by the French Government should have to record or not.
I would remind you that this vote will take place at 12.30.p.m..
In the field of justice and home affairs, I am optimistic about a solution to the civil judicial cooperation.
The task of the preparatory group will fully by 19 November, the date of the next meeting at ministerial level.
We need such a anregendes climate, as Mr Moscovici pointed out, and I, too, have the Heads of State and Government of the very strong feeling of a common, historical responsibility at an historic moment for European integration.
We must ensure that we are only now on qualified majority voting on these issues do not lag behind the spirit or the climate in Biarritz.
The small countries are not the warrant recipients of the large countries of the European Union.
The President-in-Office of the Council, I would be grateful if he would clarify this point.
On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica an historic event.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are making progress in the closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting has been reached, but there are profound differences concerning the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council, as you have pointed out.
It seems to me that we are moving in the opposite direction.
Anyone who is not following the enhanced cooperation, on the rÃ¼cksitz freedoms of a mitfahrers a motor vehicle.
I would also like you, even less than not to interfere in the internal affairs of Germany, but I am of the opinion that this position completely consistent and which, moreover, is a step in the right direction is concerned, the Commission, if I am not mistaken.
We have an exchange of views with the Member States on this issue, which shows that all Member States are in favour of maintaining this ceiling following enlargement.
This will certainly not be the case.
Firstly, we have sometimes had the impression that a degree in Biarritz obsession of the debate vorherrschte between small and large states.
In this respect, I feel it is not enough to say that the Community method should be respected.
Today, even after the accession of the candidate countries, each Member State must retain a junior Commissioner - or senior.
The wording of Article 93 is particularly problematic in view of the fact that, after the first successful accession wave of totalitarianism, will be almost impossible to achieve progress in the direction of a qualified majority.
The citizens of these countries must be provided by the undisputed benefits that any new European Treaty, to be convinced.
It would be to end this crisis lieg the profound reasons, it would lead us to forget that the new problems for generations of fears without a final peace settlement, which is a prerequisite for the reconciliation could make room.
I am concerned, the only right weak ECHO on Parliament 's demand for democratisation.
It all seems rather forces can be accused of the implementation of the comprehensive reforms before enlargement.
On the one hand there is the decision of the Heads of Government of Israel, the peace negotiations in the area as a result of the use of violence to freeze and his efforts to the formation of a contingency government with the leader of the opposition, Mr Sharon,.
We have, of course, the victory of the Yugoslav people unspeakable pleasure and the election of Mr KostunÃ­ca to President noted.
I commend Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, his Italian Members but to ask for a statement, why you with a very Communist Party in Italy and in government with another very Communist Party, of the Partito della Rifondazione Comunista, to take part in the parliamentary elections.
We must progress of the codecision procedure.
The Commission is the possibility of a simple majority of votes within the Commission is in a position to do so, to give an impetus to this in the future.
Now, in the Union, which do not need the visionaries 2030 fixated with solutions, it is the people who are in a position to identify the problems which enlargement is bringing to bewerkstelligende 3-8 within a period of years, and to find answers to them.
This is therefore an open conditions under which do not work out or enforced from the top down.
The debate is closed.
This fundamental reference is being lost at best, and at worst will no longer be to each other.
Democracy in Europe, but it is better krÃ¤nkelt of European democracy.
Today, the European Parliament has, on 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, a simple and clear statement: yes, you will be able to implement the European Constitution, yes, we want it to be.
Consequently, the island in itself sufficient criterion.
I shall confine myself to the heart of the matter, while I am on the main thrust of the report by Mr President Gil-Robles to focus on which I would like to say briefly that I think it is excellent.
First of all, simplifying and clarifying the Treaties.
I shall leave it there, because the report by the European University Institute in Florence, at least for me here - is not at issue.
According to the information available, it is now very technical, please, please forgive me - that the Presidency seems to be available in a clear majority of the language versions in contrast to the Italian version of the application of the cohesion policy, but only on the most disadvantaged islands in general and not to be referred to the islands.
Mr Duhamel, you will agree with me that in the statement that there will not be a success if Nice, or at least no credibility for considering the future of European integration, at least not in the current framework.
It is also necessary in the European Constitution, the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union very clearly and the momentum of European integration to be involved, in areas where it is essential to act together, as was the case in the foreign and security policy.
They could also be necessary to overcome continuing blockades.
We need a clearer distribution of responsibilities and a better application of the principle of subsidiarity.
We know that there are very different opinions on this in the various Member States, in the various social forces.
The ultimate objective of a European Constitution, however, it is precisely the opposite, and we can therefore not accept it.
Since in the greater European House on military, there will be people on monetary and fiscal policy may be on the table, and then the others who are excluded.
The second version is clearly not correct, because on the one hand, that are lagging behind in the areas covered by the structural funds and, on the other, there is no reason for this interpretation for the adoption of the Declaration No. 30.
Mr President, I will speak in my modest short 60 seconds to concentrate on the report by Olivier Duhamel, which is excellent, as it is called in the name of things really lyrismus and our rapporteur has reminded us just now finally convinced of this.
I believe that the unity of Europe can only be a political one.
We believe that the new Constitution should be available at the next European elections and can enter into force.
Consequently, the name 'most disadvantaged both to the island regions' and to the other areas, and after the proposal by Mr Barnier must, in accordance with the provisions of the agreement in Vienna, an amendment of the Italian Treaty text to be made.
The debate is closed.
As Mrs Rothe said that she wanted to vote against that amendment was withdrawn.
Mr President, we are apparently seeking to be a recipe for chaos.
I welcome the adoption of the report Mr Trakatellis, through this House, because it is of high quality and safety standards for blood and blood plasma derivatives.
If the European parliamentary immunity is independent, then the French authorities have with the lifting of the immunity of Mr Le Pen to us.
I am particularly disappointed at the vote on the report of the European Parliament vegetativem on the marketing of propagating material of the vine.
As a clash of alcohol, tobacco and drugs for a product for consumers and their fellow human beings do great damage to the other, on the other hand, can see it as a means of creating jobs and a source of sprudelnde.
In general, the rapporteur welcomes the proposals contained in the White Paper on this subject, the Commission is, however, concerned at the possible impact of the reform, the purpose of which is, in principle, to decentralise the enforcement of competition rules.
In the debate yesterday evening, I congratulate, Jonathan Evans on his work, but first I had my clear criticism of the Liberals, if not ultra-liberal orientation of his report.
This priority is the way in which to refocus the next three years, half of all new projects on the Green wiese emerging jobs in the Objective 1 area.
Given the indignation that the consequences of this policy, there are sometimes able, with the help of state intervention, aid and other economic or tax incentives, at least in part, to defuse the situation.
(The sitting was suspended at 14.06 suspended and will resume at 3 o).
We are now in October 2000, just before the decision on the basic structure of the 2001 budget figures.
This has not prevented the Council but in agricultural expenditure as a whole to cut 555 million euros.
Of course, we are also of the opinion that it is not easy to create additional 400 posts, can be obendrauf simply.
I can only say that the Council will follow us!
That is why the management of this House to the Members here and not the other way round.
The European Court of Auditors makes us the least concern.
Finally, the budget of the Ombudsman of us to deal with.
On the contrary, we believe that it is in relation to the candidate countries in the research area should be pushed through.
In addition, we propose that Parliament will continue to be informed on a regular basis.
And if a legislative conciliation on Social Affairs takes place, to culture and environment - the Commissioner will agree with me -, then we are giving us the Commissioner for the budget, the Finance Ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets, in order to jointly to pray that no financial ambiguity is committed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your friendly welcome.
Indeed, it has already at first reading of the budget for 2001 were approved, without it may seem justified to indulge in tactical considerations, the objective of a proper application, that the Community institutions should pursue only continue to be harmful.
Before you decide on the 2001 draft budget, I would like to highlight a number of objectives, on the consensus between the Council and Parliament, and to reach an agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority.
In structural policy, we are in a similar situation.
In the summer, the conciliation procedure - Mr Colom I Naval pointed out, have had a good result, namely that in the future ausgabewirksamen legal bases, better information to be made available to Parliament.
May I remind you that in the last year of financial planning for the Balkans, adopted by only 1 850 billion for the period up to 2006.
I would ask you once again - the Commission makes its proposal on the table - to examine this proposal in an even-handed and as an opportunity to consider.
Both the material for the programming of the 2001 budget, and for the discharge for 1999 appears to be very useful.
Much as I, as a Member of the Committee on Budgets, the work of this body, and so I also very much appreciate the work of the rapporteur and the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets, I wish to pay tribute to the rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but not fail to point out on two amendments, which were presented to the Committee and again in the plenary, despite their importance is not unimportant smaller amounts.
With these measures, we want to make the legal control fully up and running again that confidence in the legal security of the EU and the European Union as a Community of law.
The Commission 's immediate withdrawal of this initiative was a clear violation of the political will of Lisbon and the priority of this House.
This decision is very strange and has many of us with the feeling that this important programme simply become the plaything of between the Committee on Budgets and the Commission.
My third point is the European agricultural policy, as they are now in the preliminary draft budget.
If the employment constitutes a political priority for the Union, then we must fishing as one of the other economic sector does not have been left out in the cold.
I am particularly pleased that the funding for the last annual exchange programmes adopted for Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000 programmes.
The arrears in our Mediterranean aid, for example, amount to the budgets of several years.
Mr President, in recent years, I was the spokesman for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on behalf of Mrs Iivari said this afternoon.
But I would like the members of the European Parliament this afternoon to say also that we do not lose sight of the fact that the EU should be used only 1 per cent of GDP and a large proportion of these is administered in the Member States.
Let me now turn to the overall strategy.
This is the strategy of my group, I now come to the point of departure for our convictions, for the European citizens the desire to provide the best cost-benefit ratio.
On the contrary, we need to work towards a Parliament for transparency, efficiency and an effective democratic control of the European institutions.
Then we have to give some thought to how we solve this problem.
We want to drive the processes of democratisation, and we want a balanced relationship between the traditional policy areas of foreign policy, which we now have before us.
The biggest problem in the new draft budget relates to the external action.
Sparsames economies is, of course, necessary, will be supported by us, and we should not mogeln across.
This is an extraordinary initiative, particularly in the first reading and it is a thankless initiative under the present circumstances, because they will not get a majority vote.
Nevertheless, the size of the appropriations for Kosovo a number of problems.
With the budgetary policy, we need the confidence of citizens in European policy.
All measures to boost the development of small and medium-sized enterprises are therefore to be supported.
The extent of the implementation of the budget.
It retains this strategic line as a starting point for the budgets of this and of the next few years, then, Parliament adopted its rightful place in the budgetary procedure.
With the transfer of approximately EUR 175 million to EUR 25 million are available to more than we expected.
On the subject of MEDA the Council stated that commitments are not a problem, as has been accumulated backlog in payments for eight years.
I believe that Mr Duff was here this morning, when we referred to the European Council in Biarritz.
My answer is quite simple.
The murder was the last time a Ramiro 25 human rights activists, and recently published the 'Plan Colombia' s press 100 'of the paramilitary groups, after the 100 human rights activists have been murdered.
The present attitude of the Council agrees with me rather happier than in July, but the European Union, as we have seen in many crisis situations, as the final more and more internationally precisely and its voice to be heard.
My question is this, and I will end here, if there is no way, a greater pressure by the President, as has been proposed in its information, and whether the aid we provide to the aid of the States in this respect is fundamentally different from that they do not seek the fumigation of the crops, but to the planting of other cultures and not to the military, but on the social aspects.
The questions put to me and the other Members who refer specifically to the situation in Colombia.
Since it is the same subject, Question Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 lumped together.
Subject: taxation of financial transactions, the call for a tax on speculative capital is becoming increasingly in recent months, there have been many ATTAC committees as ground (Association pour une taxation sur les transactions pour l 'aide financiÃ¨res et aux citoyens) in France and Europe and in the French National Assembly and in the Senate and the amendments tabled.
Furthermore, it is also answer the question of what impact they could have on the volatility of exchange markets, particularly in a sentence of 0,1 with devaluations, while the speculators in the order of 20 to 50%.
Furthermore, in paragraph 26 it calls for the establishment of an international schiedsorganisation on the cancellation of the debt of the countries of the South.
In the jahresmaÃstab which was also the case in the case of the euro, irrespective of whether or not this regrets or welcomes.
What Danielle Auroi earlier in connection with the countries of the South, has said, I would like to add that the estimates of specialists interesting figures, such as, for example, that a tax in the nature of the Tobin tax revenue from 50 to 250 billion dollars would provide, according to the calculations of the UNDP, while USD 40 billion per year would be sufficient to ensure a minimum standard of living conditions for the hundreds of millions of people, who are in the countries of the developing world is in short supply.
Over the past few months, among other things, the disease has occurred in various parts of France.
Now, as the representative of the French Presidency is here, I would like to know whether the slaughter of livestock from the EU or from the national budget and whether it will be paid, as they see it from the EU budget.
I would ask for your consent, that you can be answered.
The margin for manoeuvre of the two governments concerned by the international community is therefore limited.
It is a mystery to me how the Commission can contribute in February, which it needs, and the Council in July.
If the European Union, in the name of subsidiarity, such an approach, it is, in actual fact, however, it must perform a task as they both in the last few weeks in Northern Italy and Spain, has done.
How can I, as a Member of the European Parliament, this majority, which is dear to allow 11.5 billion pounds from British taxpayers' money - that is our current annual contribution, if the general public is not altogether?
With a flexible attitude on the part of the Council in a second reading agreement could be found in order to conclude the budget.
If anyone should be convinced, yet it is looking at the proof of this.
Mr Joan Colom I Naval, the Vice-President responsible for buildings, this strategy has already presented.
As Commissioner Schreyer has already said, this year 's draft budget contains many political messages, and the reform of the agricultural policy, new structural programmes, security and better implementation of structural policy, implementation of the decisions of the Lisbon Summit, with the aim of creating a stronger and more competitive EU and on combating social exclusion.
NATO war has destroyed leave too much and too great suffering.
Despite the implementation of agreements, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible that this objective within the framework of the existing budget constraints, without the agricultural budget, for a sustainable agricultural sector in the current Member States is essential.
Quite clearly, and I have told you must reply to his opportunity here: Kostunica and will, I hope, in the next few weeks or months, an amnesty, meanwhile, however, I am very much in favour of that, at political level, and with regard to the budget to the introduction of these two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, political conditions.
The elections in Yugoslavia, two: the people of the dictator Milosevic finally have enough, and they have confidence in Professor KostunÃ­ca.
I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners must be released as soon as possible.
If we do not do that, it will inevitably lead to a 'financial planning', both on the priorities and cuts in general, social and environmental expenditure and in terms of cooperation.
There are initiatives to solve the major social problems, such as unemployment, is called for.
Needless to say, a fact I classify as enormously important, namely that we started with Category 4, they have to tackle is still not entirely clear, however, that we have succeeded in finding a solution, because the Council is not sufficiently involved.
Any budgetary work, it is important to set priorities.
This is with a view to the expiry of the Treaty in the near future, not very significant, but it would be worrying if the legal framework on the European Coal and Steel Community following the possibility for the continuation of such practices.
My third observation, leading to what is now facing us.
This is not the new financial agreement. Mistrust of the politicians in the EU is growing, as I have discovered.
That is something for which I would recognition.
All the institutions involved in the dialogue, which has an unparalleled cooperation will enable us, I fervently hope that will allow for the first reading to reach agreement.
Those of us who are in favour of European values in an EU country, have now sceptical yet another argument for the European Union: a more effective protection of personal data, for the citizens in modern society is of great importance.
I have noticed that in my own country personengebundene an amendment of the law on data is to be carried out by the influence of MEPs to the decisions of the Commission.
There is a whole raft of other points, we also see the judgment must be problems await practice err on the side of safety.
- (FR) The Commission would like to begin by referring to the commitment towards the citizens, all of which we have, the protection of personal data processed by the institutions.
With this statement, the Commission accepts that the scope of the regulation on the activities within the framework of the first pillar is limited.
Under the political agreement with the Council, the Commission and the rapporteur for adoption at first reading, it will submit any further amendment not by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights is Paciotti report approved, in addition to reject Amendments Nos 69 to correct the Amendment 41.
That is why it is essential that the staff of the intergroup within the General Secretariat of the Commission 's proposals will be increased immediately, so that all legal acts with general scope for your consideration by the College, on the basis of Article 299 (2) can be accompanied by a detailed impact assessment.
From the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market, it is important to emphasise that we really can only apply equal treatment, and that is what we should be equal.
In view of the importance of the fisheries sector for the outermost regions, rather that very much.
The presidency of seit unter Delors an interdepartmental group for the outermost regions, we set up a long and fruitful way, and I have, this group has the deepest thanks to the has led Europeans living in peripheral areas.
So while the Rome Treaty already contained a reference to the French overseas territories, it took until 1989 and to the POSEI programmes, programmes specifically to solve the problems and island zurÃ¼ckzufÃ¼hrenden until the European Union finally realising that the immutable nature and the combined incidence of the structural disadvantages of the outermost regions, a special treatment in comparison with other regions of the Community is justified.
I have no doubt that the proposals that the Commission will be submitting to the Council will be characterised by those characteristics.
This question will be all the more relevant, as the eastward enlargement of the EU.
This right of differentiation is nothing more than the result of gleichheitsgrundsatzes different treatment for this too, which is what is different.
It is a document that my team and I, as a rich in ideas and proposals, which goes to the heart of the issues, and none of the issues in the outermost regions are cause for concern.
In her report, Mrs Sudre, rightly highlighted the need for a permanent policy actions.
With regard to the relaunch of the economic diversification, we have made progress in a number of key areas.
What matters now is that a large number of projects proposed within the framework of the eppd this activity, but at the same time as we have specific needs on the ground, the specific access each of these outermost regions comprehensively analysed.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
I shall, of course, inform the President of your comment.
I am concerned about the fact that many of the decisions taken by the House in equipment and could be called into question, because the necessary provisions for such a case.
Both these food authority and the legislative proposals that we tabled, aimed at guaranteeing food safety, will receive the support of this Parliament, Commissioner.
The main focus of its activities is scientific advice, because the debate on food safety should also be held on an objective basis.
Mr President, I would not like to miss this opportunity, the rapporteur, for his constructive work and for his willingness to take account of the opinions of the other committees, I thank you.
When we are confronted with a potential risk, the precautionary principle must be applied.
As far as the still contentious question concerns whether we have the remit of this authority, issues such as food and the advice and support of the agencies, which should involve the risk management, we take the view that this principle of food standards in all aspects of food safety should be given the chance at least to deliver an opinion and their support.
It is of crucial importance to the preservation of the rich traditions.
We will not see any such recognition by legislation, not by means of regulations, but by scientific excellence, quality and integrity of independence, by means of accountability, transparency and clarity.
Good scientific knowledge are certainly essential if the risks in the context of the food chain, from farm to table, would be better evaluated.
Mr President, there is no doubt that the establishment of a European agency for food safety, as our rapporteur call them - generally supports.
If this continues to be the necessary resources who programme and the necessary support, we do not need any additional agency, and this applies in particular to an agency with the 15 Member States of the European Union is so limited scope.
Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers who want to eat healthily for consumers, and we must make it our concern.
If we do not get a new framework directive, we will have a great deal in the area of food safety can only smile.
Consequently, changes in the EU Treaty, so that the Commission sanctions in the area of food has been given today, as they are already in the field of competition.
I support all the partners involved in political, administrative or whether, on the other trÃ¤gerschaften strategy "food for all '.
I agree with this statement is not just a human being is more than just a body.
The authority must be a real head of the coordination of the network of national agencies, which will, in turn, a network of centres of excellence for food safety at the level of the individual regions must be coordinated and to bring forward.
Your Amendment 11 and my Amendment 17 should therefore be to combine very well.
The reform of the food legislation in the European Union should take place at the level of the European Union.
In his report, not so much as it is to put forward amendments priorities.
This requirement in the report, we have clearly formulated, something I particularly welcome.
The creation of a European food safety authority is, however, extremely positive.
In the interests of all the citizens of the Union is to be hoped that these criteria will also be obeyed.
I think that we need to be laid down specific periods within which the European Commission on each case, which are allowed to give cause for concern.
The EU must make their citizens in the food sector, guaranteeing the highest possible standards.
The Commission is proposing the establishment of a European food authority.
I am concerned that Europe is once again a danger to make an inflated bureaucracy, which is unable to act.
We are creating ever more new bureaucratic levels and the more money we spend it can lead to, the less.
They prevent similar and parallel work in several institutions.
It is important, however, that in the shadow of the discussion on the White Paper, the public, the fear of a bureaucratic Europe, which influence on the quality of the products, against the harmful to health without effective delusion and mislead consumers, will be strengthened.
As you know, the strategy for the food safety in the Commission 's top priority.
The Commission will adopt a proposal for a regulation, which is the framework for future threatened use in the area of food and which will provide the general principles of food law and objectives to be laid down.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
But now to our report, I regard the Commission proposal as a positive and have to say that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation of Parliament have done a hard work and, in particular, to make it possible to further improve on certain points.
Our colleague, Mrs Bonino, as has already been mentioned, clearly and specifically with the proposal for a regulation from the Commission a further step forward.
We believe that the proposal for a regulation from the Commission for too vague.
It is essential that the budget for mine clearance and that we will be organised in accordance with reasonable - and for detektions research fund for dismantling instruments which, on the ground, in a simple way, so that they can be used in the developing countries.
We have in the past eight years, more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget for the fight against landmines.
We can, however, the people are not punished for their unable government.
As I have already said, I think it would be good intentions, but nevertheless counterproductive and wrong to sign up to the Ottawa Convention immediately and compulsory condition to be met for the support of mine action by the European Union.
I reject Amendment 19.
Secondly, the international Community coordination at a global level and, particularly, in the countries concerned.
Mr President, the Socialist Group agrees with the comments made by Mr Van Orden and is also proud of the role of the European Union.
We remember the Soviet toys bombs in Afghanistan.
Thank you very much for an excellent report.
Mr President, the Cambodians describe as a permanent state of the mines guards.
People with uniform forces have a legitimate suspicion, the war has built up over many years.
Mr President, I am pleased that, at last, a European legislation in the form of a regulation on anti-personnel mines and that is before us today is a good report by Mrs Bonino on this regulation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we have today is a very sad issue.
It is not by chance that it is mainly the mines in crisis regions, i.e. in areas where different initiatives could be taken to deal with this crisis.
In two kilometres from a bosnischen village in 1999, is a sign of the mines danger in a field which, however, does not suggest that there is a small boy.
It is tragic that the civilian population is suffering under the inability of its leaders.
Please allow me, ladies and gentlemen, you on behalf of our institution to which your country has special relations in the framework of our common project to build an area of prosperity, security and peace in the Mediterranean area, has to be very welcome.
All mines are in deposits.
Mr President, since I agree with almost everything in advance what my fellow Members have said, I will not repeat it.
The concept of open cooperation is synonymous with a relapse into the institutional system of philosophy of Commission officials.
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions as close to those affected as possible.
However, as the main amendments just a significant majority of the PPE Group, I could not vote in favour of the report.
Mr President, I have abstained from voting in the vote on the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz, abstained from voting for two reasons: first, because I had the opportunity, particularly paragraphs 2 and 5 as a separate vote and to express my opposition to two.
In other words, at the table of some of the common European House dine Ã  la carte, whilst others have to content with the single menu.
And the democratic control must not weaken, but, in our opinion, the main problem is not the European Union in the list of those rights or their inclusion in the Treaties.
The instrument of referendums and the related amendments to this report have already been mentioned.
At the elections to the European Parliament in 1999, the electoral turnout was only 40 per cent of the countries with electoral duty and those who, at the same time, with the European elections abrechnet national elections.
The desired objective of a European Constitution, it is not advisable to impose strict legal entities and methods for the fatal consequences, which would fail to achieve the desired objective.
A real social constitution should the important achievements of the world of work, in favour of women, immigrants and the citizens of upper adjusted.
- (PT) I have voted in favour, although I do not intend to increase their a commendable, lighting and deepening of the European Union and the simplification of the texts which is close to its citizens is essential, not abspreche.
The distribution
I believe that it is crucial that the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the EU is following the human rights convention of the Council of Europe.
The report by Mr Gil-Robles, for me, however, to assistance, because it contains the proposal that a number of Member States of the European Union on certain issues, sectors and areas of a coordinated joint action.
If ever more important issues are decided by qualified majority decisions, basic standards of democracy are being violated.
Today, it is trying to obstruct the flexibility of closer cooperation, and will also be subject to this.
This report is intended to clarify the position of our Parliament (resolution of 13 April 2000).
Broadly speaking, we are in favour of a so-called flexible cooperation.
The British Labour Members of the Socialist Group welcome the support for your contribution to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference on the issue of closer cooperation, although we do not agree with all the details.
These island regions must be an active part of the European Union, which, I hope, be it in a paradise for tourists and for the local population will turn.
In the Middle Ages, these areas were not to Europe and its people, and now they are not really European.
In fact, the specific features of these regions, which are, in general, and its removal from its island to the European mainland, but also from their chronic dependence on a few products or a single product, need to overcome these obstacles to appropriate, specific action is taken.
Mr President, please excuse me if I once again the Bureau and the interpreters, so that aufhalte my last explanation of vote, and I would particularly like to express my solidarity with the translators our explanations of vote, in my case, the italienerin, ornella buson.
From these texts are clearly shows that this agency or in restricting the paralysis of the national protection powers so that it is aimed at the service of the Commission 's objectives.
This does not mean, however, that the Commission and Parliament, this institution does not refer to as the 'European authority', although this name the philosophy behind this completely.
This is not exactly what the Bowis report proposes that we get the feeling that, in the main, food safety will be regarded as a further excuse, by means of which is well-known in the process of strengthening the powers of the Commission to the detriment of the national institutions and continue to work on the safety of our citizens.
That is why I think it is appropriate to this statement on behalf of the European Parliament, which has always been in favour of respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all faith communities to take these horrendous acts are to be condemned.
Madam President, I understand the interventions of the rapporteur, but with the amendments of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, not only about money, but it will also have a vote on one particular direction.
I would also like to ask them to support this budget line that we a-206 to adjust, acquisition of property that, depending on what amendments are adopted, so that we have our own limit of 20% of total administrative expenditure should not exceed.
Before the vote on Amendment 929
Section VI - Economic and Social Committee
Report (A5-0276 / 2000) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation with additional technical measures for the recovery of cod stocks in the Irish Sea (ICES zone VIII (A) (COM (2000) 0190 - C5-0219 / 2000 - 2000 / 0071 (CNS))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The export subsidies in the EU, the food surplus at dumping prices on the world market, which in turn serious competitive disadvantages, for example, for the food industry in many developing countries.
We have sufficient financial resources for additional aid operations in the Balkans, the Member States need to free up the resources umverteilen from the existing budget.
Nevertheless, Parliament has succeeded in imposing a number of important tasks - not least in relation to step up efforts in the fight against unemployment and poverty, a number of important environmental and equality issues, etc., we voted against the attacks on the right of the LIFE programme and the European Women 's lobby.
As far as the travel expenses for Members of the European Parliament is concerned, we consider that our view that this only for actual travel costs to be paid.
I assume - and I hope that the Commission will bring forward appropriate solutions - that we are positively with the three years between 2002 and 2005 will fill a transitional arrangement.
In particular for the national parliaments to miss a downright muzzling, the European Commission, within the framework of its regulatory mania for liberalisation, and a proposal for a direct binding regulation, rather than a directive into a genuine presented last minute procedure by Parliament and the Council of Ministers has already at breakneck speed on 31 December of this year to come into force.
We therefore support the Commission 's reform efforts and reject the other advantages for this sector.
It was in strong dependency on credit.
Nicholson report (a-0276 / 2000)
The purpose of alienation of resources for military targets should be avoided.
We have always held the view that the cost of the reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by the actual perpetrators in the first instance, be borne by the big business, and to the detriment of their super profits should take.
Mr Moreira da Silva report (A5-0271 / 2000)
These funds should be spent by the expenditure on research policy in all 15 Member States of the European Union to be coordinated and synchronised.
So it is right that we should be clear about these substances, to give us.
That concludes the vote.
It will then have to take the place of the national format used everywhere now.
The zahlungsbilanzstatistische loss as a result of this amendment is minimal.
You must bear in mind that this is mainly small and medium-sized companies are affected.
For years, we insist on a harmonisation of effort.
I believe that this report is of crucial importance for the citizens, small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro area and the acceptance of the Economic and Monetary Union.
With regard to the free movement of capital, with the single currency must not barriers or greater differences of opinion.
Nevertheless, the European Parliament and the Commission, to the great attention.
I support the two-pronged approach of the rapporteur, which they want to encourage the hesitant banks to move forward.
We can force the banks, but not to verlusttrÃ¤chtigen shops, can we, as politicians, the amendment tabled by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs, for the PPE-DE Group, have tabled support measures before the end of next year, and also adequate rules on the introduction of the euro coins and notes will be called for.
The amendment by Mrs Peijs and myself, is also a step in the direction of the banks together round a table, not targets, but because we are the pressure from the political side no longer can grow.
This means that, if the handling of cross-border payments remains as expensive as they are now, the credibility of the new coins and banknotes system in question.
In our view, this form of the collection of statistical data on the internal payments as a relic of the past which, in a single area integrated, no longer be justified and the proper functioning of the internal market.
The speeches of some of my colleagues when I in the committee, which Members of this House when I hear that for a long time, I have the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, which the European Parliament is now to be subjected to the fourth time in this category.
I would like to thank you in advance for supporting my report.
But if we look at European level, then we have to withdraw the regions are increasingly turning.
The SMEs are first and foremost in the creation of jobs in both qualitative and quantitative terms, and in this way, to play a key role in social cohesion and regional planning.
Through the careful study of the proposals and the vote with many interested parties, it has a contribution to a clearer wording of the programme and the optimum preparation.
Thirdly, we must strive for an additional European value.
It follows that, as a result, small and medium-sized enterprises will not be well, when unemployment is low and if the public budgets at all levels are free of debt and adequate means of investment in the budget.
Businesses need clarity.
In particular, when a man or a business operation under 250 employees, not only is there a project with certain positions of land with a 120% assurance, but it should also be possible, and that is a good idea to be financed.
The nation states and also the regional or local authorities to act as a huge financial pumps, already exists, the taxpayers' money, i.e. by the majority of the population, including the poorest, eingetriebenen amounts in the large companies and their owners and shareholders in the pockets of pumps.
Small and medium-sized enterprises, thousands of zarten flower for the large companies as a seed for human create power and ideas.
I would like to see the Commissioner here in connection with all measures proposed priority concern that an easier and quicker access to assistance and information will be created, so that those who make these businesses are able to effectively use of this information.
You will all have their place in the multiannual programme.
Finally, I also welcome the idea that we meet once a year to assess the results of the implementation of the programme.
The recent actions against the Greek minority in himare areas, measures have actually for the democratisation and to strengthen the institutions and the protection of human rights in Albania.
The fact that a large number of Albanians to abandon their homes due to the uncertainty in your country, because of the social problems for society and for the prÃ¤modernen family structures.
Zugeschnittene specifically to Albania, we need a preventive measures which help to build up or reconstruction of the country, so that we can constitute a decent standard of living in the region.
In this way, the documents of a body to others, and the Commission is refusing to, for example, the report produced by the Albanians, amongst other things, customs assistance mission to publish), (cam.
Let us look at the truth.
Mrs Karamanou, my congratulations to the broad and comprehensive tour Ã¯horizon of her report.
This is a very important issue which, for historical, social, political and economic realities.
The true number of deaths we will never know.
Joint operations create peaceful commitments.
However, what I find totally unacceptable on this report, and which I wish to draw attention to is that cause and effect, i.e. the illegal immigration with a procedure of gewichteten confuses the migrationsmÃ¶glichkeit visas and, therefore, it is the other way round.
Derived from the Treaty of Amsterdam had great institutional reforms impact on the treatment of problems of refugee and immigration policy.
Thirdly and lastly, the action plan and its implementation must be considered on a regional basis.
But, of course, also sends the message to us ourselves, economical with European regulations.
The strength of the Community action must be highlighted right now.
In addition, I should like to call for changes to existing legislation in the EC codified proposals being submitted in the changes to the existing directives or regulations are incorporated.
The principle of subsidiarity, properly understood, has put us in both directions: decisions are to be taken at the lowest level, but that the lowest achievable level can sometimes be a very high level, when it is a question of general values which, if they are not in danger of losing equally protected everywhere.
The report is a perfect example of clear, concise, and I hope that honourable Members will also note with great seriousness.
The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market in terms of its Members had not enthusiasm.
I am in the report on the SLIM project, because the Community legislation with Mr Medina 's read out one of the articles of the Treaty is a test for experts are even difficult to understand.
A number of aspects of this report therefore solve little enthusiasm in me, because I would have liked to stop a more 'vergemeinschaft' report with regard to the internal market, the report is clearly not just of the Union.
For the EU 's institutions, it is important that we have the strong commitment, the quality of legislation, particularly with a view to subsidiarity, to improve.
The debate is closed.
The persistence of this situation could the recruitment and the acceptance of citizens with regard to the euro, adversely affect.
Mr President, we have had with very great care in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Karamanou report prepared.
However, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to take advantage of this debate to our oral question, and that both sides - because our motion for a resolution is addressed to both sides - and I would like to make a few comments in relation to do this with a great deal of consideration.
This is the requirement of the peoples of the Union, whom we represent here.
Hinunter much water is the Rhine, and was, however, the agreement is not replaced.
I can understand the reasons for the Commissioner, but not the Director-General.
We could say that we 11 months after the closure of our vessels continue to pay for the previous agreement and for the previous of the previous ones.
Mr President, we had a similar debate, a year ago, and the fact that it has taken a year before negotiations will be included in the first place, shows how difficult it is, fish stocks for our EU fleets.
The second agreement was the position clear.
But we must understand that everything is, at last, including the fisheries resources.
That is why I am particularly keen to make it clear that the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats, principally in the fisheries agreements, not only to support, but also to defend and promote determined to encourage them to be extended.
Thirdly, the exploitation of the fishing grundes Sahara since the suspension of the agreement by the Community fleet has continued, and others that are not controlled by the Commission or by the Member States: it speaks of a significant fleet, in particular from the Netherlands.
I understand this very well, because the fishing industry has been a source of income and creating jobs for a measured against European conditions, poor region.
Another aspect I would like to emphasise is the phasing out of temporary aid for fishermen and ship owners at the end of the month in compensation for this year to halt this situation is unsustainable., because everyone wants to work but rather as aid.
I am as a parliamentarian for a year andalusischer unaware that, in the Committee on Fisheries in the offices and in the course of discussions with the Commissioner proposing to negotiate and initiatives, so that the very special identity will be taken into account in the fishing fleet to the fishing operations in Morocco.
Spain has the difficult neighbourhood in the history of repeatedly between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco has given, in an excellent way.
As a Spanish Member of Parliament, and I would urge the andalusischer right of thousands and thousands of families of Spanish and andalusischer preservation and protection of their jobs are being put at risk for almost a year ago and which we also from this House must defend.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Almost a twelve-year-old history full consolation services also hopes that delaying tactics to personal suffering for the people concerned, placebos in order to protect the tough old rights to citizens who are looking for nothing other than your right.
As you know, the matter is extremely complex and approximately 700 workers to 25 Italian universities.
If the Italian law be amended and reformed, as is the case for the European university staff was not, in our opinion, the Commission can intervene every European citizen, with the same opportunities to access all functions.
The injustice lies in the fact that two people working on the same job, but different, side by side and different working conditions have to be paid for.
Worst of all, it is, I think, if we must draw attention to the fact that a judgment from the benefit of just a few reassuring words and for their power is not really is important.
I expect an answer from the Commission to the point that it is in accordance with the decision of the Court of Justice in the case of alluÃ© against Article 48 (2) of the EEC Treaty, if a Member State in the legislation the duration of contracts of foreign language assistants each is limited to one year, with the possibility of renewal, while in others there is such a restriction of teachers do not in principle.
Well, in my opinion, these relate to the essence of the matters with European law, in particular the fundamental principles of freedom, freedom of movement, and there must be no exceptions to these principles.
We have, as today 's debate shows that still many shackles, very many obstacles to the internal market, not only in this case.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Condolences to the Austrian Federal President Klestil and to Chancellor SchÃ¼ssel, I, on behalf of this House, to the families and the entire Austrian people at this difficult time to express our condolences.
Are there any comments?
I support the proposal of Mr Ceyhun and would be very grateful if the Council could actually say whether he intends to draw up a new proposal on this matter.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group considers that event is so important that we believe that it is not properly handled as a matter of urgency.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, I have the impression that they are, if I have understood you correctly, this explanatory statement.
Madam President, some time ago, we debated in this House on the sanctions against Iraq.
It is essential that we implement the promised changes before by the British authorities to carry out a debate on this issue, and the Commission has made it very clear to the legal provisions in this matter.
(A5-0314 / 2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the conclusion of an agreement on the improvement of the legal assistance in criminal matters, particularly in the area of the fight against organised crime, money laundering of the proceeds of crime and the financial crime (10213 / 2000 - C5-0394 / 2000 - 2000 / 0815 (CNS)).
The statements of intent need concrete steps to be taken to ensure that the proceeds of crime occurred, frozen seized and confiscated.
The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice should not be in the hands of a specialised body under the sole control of the national governments.
On the other hand, Article 8 of the draft Convention restricted the grounds for refusal of legal assistance, to which a ersuchter Member State can invoke the essential interests.
First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Marinho on his work and to point out that the efforts to support the fight against economic crime, but also care.
If terrorists and arms or drug trafficking, money laundering and, of course, it must be punished, persecuted and identified.
It is our duty to track down the proceeds from organised crime, to identify, on seizing and freeze confiscated.
It is these points in the amendments and, following the debate in the committee, I am very confident that this Parliament votes for it.
It seems to me that this catalogue of initiatives in a direction which Article 6 of the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms may alters the protection.
In reality, however, things are not so easy.
Finally, the PPE-DE Group supports the compromise amendment on the activities of the lawyers, on which we have reached with Mrs Roure.
The second measure, the second instrument is the harmonisation.
This is a Portuguese initiative, on which a number of speakers have expressed praise.
And that was also the objective of the joint meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the Ecofin Council on 17 October this year.
The best way for a strengthening of parliamentary and judicial control over Europol, the full involvement of the Europol Convention in the legal framework of the European Union.
A step in the right direction, which the European Parliament has been striving for a long time, is the creation of a temporary body to judicial cooperation.
That is the purpose of the guarantees, namely in the development of this issue of freedoms.
And the European Parliament is the supranational Community institution that sets these relations with my speech, I should like to ask you, on the basis of this relationship is to affirm and our rapporteur for their approval.
Only when clarity about the institutional model and the rules for the future European judicial area, will the citizens and the European Parliament on individual measures proposed by the Council.
Eurojust is a logical, therefore, that the citizens are part of the efforts by the fight against serious organised crime on an area of freedom, security and justice, and to provide a high level of safety.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we can only Mrs Gebhardt on her excellent report, which you in implementation of a decision by the Council in Tampere.
However, such as Eurojust, there is talk of coordination at the level of national public prosecutors and judges to combat all forms of serious crime - and here I agree with the approach of the rapporteur, then that represents an extension of the approach here: it is not just about cooperation in purely cross-border crime, but also about cooperation on combating criminal offences.
We will already have from 1 January 2001, we have an opportunity in this interim unit to judicial cooperation, but the Commission wants to be involved in the discussion on the recovery of the definitive Eurojust unit.
It was from all sides, I believe, the honest opinion, without, however, to indulge in rigid front.
The problems relating to the expenditure for the Committee on Fisheries, were not very worrying; other areas is of more interest.
It is really unacceptable that we have no clear objectives and the results are not able to judge, it can be found in any other institution.
My second point is this: in the area of the hierarchy of authorising authority here it is, in fact, unacceptable overlapping, Commissioner.
I would like to make it clear that in some areas that the programme has played a positive role.
It is obvious that this work should not automatically within consortia duality regarding the common financial responsibility, and the problem is more complicated lead.
We therefore really 3.4 million back in this and it is true to say that we have succeeded in more than 90%.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, following neunmonatiger work and a long battle for a consensus is the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European in the draft.
I hope that this Parliament, even if it is only now that says' yes' to this Charter of Fundamental Rights, in the next few weeks will no doubt that those by the Council for the legal validity of this Charter, and that this Charter for access to the European Court of Justice has to offer.
This position is, as we know, the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Biarritz, unanimously approved the Charter fully and, therefore, I can only call on behalf of the Council, I will support this position, set out a number of reasons.
Above all, however, I am convinced that the Charter, through its importance in terms of content, I might say, a epochale important.
For its part, the European Trade Union Confederation has - as he calls it - there are gaps, such as the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum income.
Irrespective of this, a number of people, particularly in some Members of the European Parliament, proposed that an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which is already included a reference to the European Convention on Human Rights.
Our group agrees with the exception of the British delegation of the Charter unanimously.
We, as the European People 's Party, unanimously together to ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the Treaties as soon as possible, so that they are also direct legal force for the people in the European Union is developing.
You have shown that you have a new European issues and exemplary way of approaching because of their democratic, open and transparent way of working and the ability of the citizens to participate in the form of the Intergovernmental Conference.
The right to health, housing and social insurance, to a minimum income in the area are fully or lack of solidarity.
Fourthly, the Charter, and this seems to me to be particularly important - is the indivisibility of civil and political human rights and of fundamental social rights.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, this is the umpteenth demonstration charter only the capacity of the Union to keep bedeutungsleere texts and declarations of intent to produce.
The representative of the Court of Justice has already indicated that it will be inspired by the Charter, and the representative of the Commission in the Convention in Turin attaches importance to the legal document.
The time of the market is so that perhaps the time has at last come the Europe of rights and the concept of citizenship is a relatively new concept of the European Union.
The Charter is indeed worded as a text which can result from becoming legally binding.
I can also say with pride that a representative of my parliamentary group in my own country, Mr Mr Gunnar jansson, has a very important role in the drafting of the Charter.
As I said last night, and I do so again today, in this respect, there are still too many shortcomings, right across the EU, will enable us in our endeavours to legal and police cooperation are not always to eliminate certain effects of the fight against crime and to prevent the innocent victims too passive.
Madam President, the draft resolution of the European Parliament to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the same lack of clarity, such as the work of the Committee.
The Italian Constitution, common decency, for example, the limit of the limits of the Convention on Human Rights and the rights of other or public order.
Mr President, in today 's vote at 12 noon, we conclude a process that began in this Parliament in 1984, the draft of the Treaty on European Union, which has already adopted a declaration calling for the rights of the 1989, and to continue with the resolution de Gucht.
The Charter will have consequences, whether it is enshrined in the Treaty or not.
This is to be welcomed, and not, as Mr Bonde seem to think, to fear.
It appears that the neigende century, with all its fight for the liberation of disadvantaged social classes, taught us nothing has gone and useless.
The Charter fills a gap in the EC law and enhances the protection of individuals with regard to the European police force, with regard to the authorities to combat fraud, and the competition authorities.
However, the rejection of the general failure to complete the Charter is justified, I do not understand.
Mr President, I can continue where Mr Gahrton has left off.
Allow me to make a third comment on the rights of third-country nationals.
The Council of Europe has, in addition to the Court of Human Rights, a great deal of experience gained with such forms of control on which we can build.
In view of the text of the Charter, which we will be giving our assent today and, I hope, by a large majority -, it is clear that our Charter of Fundamental Rights and a zeitgemÃ¤Ãeren will achieve protection than the accession to the European Convention on Human Rights have produced.
It is therefore important to moving forward.
I believe that we need to pursue this objective if we are to have the necessary support for the charter by the citizens of Europe want to achieve.
After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental Rights as analysis consideration for this report and, as far as my personal intellectual potential and the human resources available to me, I will allow countries to rights and compliance with the Charter untergliederte analysis in the 15 Member States of the Union.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to begin by echoing the words of President Moscovici the substantial contribution of the members of the European Parliament on the debate in the Convention and, in particular, to pay tribute to the role of Mr Mendes de Vigo, in the Praesidium of the Convention in the drawing up of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I would like to concentrate on some of the markantesten points in this debate.
The Convention has the fundamental rights enshrined in the various legal instruments of the European Council, under the Treaties and the constitutions of the Member States.
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:
As things currently stand, the Turkish people, our Parliament has also to make it clear that, at the moment, there are at least three prior conditions for its accession.
Such conditions would also not only by means of a decision of the European Parliament can be made.
I have therefore tabled by Mr Morillon 's suggestions to the prior conditions for the accession of Turkey to note the great interest deserve.
I am happy to be able to say that the Turkish Government, in the meantime, this accession partnership recognised as a basis for further cooperation, so that we can have a legitimate hope, just to achieve what we set out to achieve, namely our policy in the reformers in Turkey, to help to give a new impetus to the reform process and in relation to the objective of membership of the European Union.
For me, the most important thing is that after Helsinki in Turkey The Turkish public opinion, in a debate on the conditions of Turkey 's accession to the EU, a debate that has been triggered by the reform forces in the country and calls for.
This text is its opinion before you.
It is now a question of a necessary boost for a future accession.
I would however - I do not know how the vote goes, Turkey also urge this question seriously.
The European Parliament will be actively for the reception and care of relations with the political parties, the NGOs and the press, and is trying to improve their difficult and sometimes tense relationship to the Grand National Assembly.
Mr Morillon, your report is, in my opinion, very realistic and responsible.
On the occasion of your visit to Turkey in March, they have the problem of the Kurdish population, just now, at least still with names.
At the same time, it is a sign of great naivety and great arrogance, the Turks to believe that the Europeans - and I quote - 'a radical change in their habits and their mentality could move ".
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report fills me with great concern.
Recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the adoption of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487 / 1 / 00 C5-0570 / 2000 - 2000 / 2233 (AVC))
In any event, we must take in the coming times that we are discussing the power of data processing, to make it clear that a engmaschigere greater legal certainty and, hence, the citizens anxious control is required.
Duff / Voggenhuber recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000)
We would like to highlight the following points:
In the charter of rights already enshrined in the national constitutions are defended and will, by the national parliaments, is close to the people and their cultures.
1, which provides that 'collective expulsions are prohibited, "does not stipulate that this ban in times of war or in cases of serious disruption of public order can be suspended in Article 52 (.
We will be following a short explanation for these three reasons, in that order.
The right of any government to the arbitrary suspension of its own constitution is characteristic of a tyranny.
Today, however, I repeat, we have every reason to be proud of how we have provided this important stage for Europe.
A society that is only right, but not, is going to be a selfish society.
This is our struggle as a matter of priority, so that the proclaimed fundamental rights on the political choices to be made more concrete.
The Convention method is very interesting and efficient, for the preparation of a basic text which requires a broad consensus, but it can in no way justify, the European Parliament, as representatives of the European peoples and supplementing the opportunity to amend the text.
This Charter must be improved, and our Parliament must update a strategy to propose and wealth.
It should, therefore, at the Council meeting in Nice and decided not to be declared, but by the summit should the impetus for a European debate on the Charter.
Fortunately, the tendency seems vorzuherrschen when it comes to the national governments to pursue the path of reason, in other words a charter with a purely political and not binding scope.
The Cologne summit has described as' body ', it declares itself as the' convention ', a term that in fatal way of 1793, another Convention and the verantwortenden excesses of the French Revolution in the form of terror.
The procedure followed the disbursement of exclusion and the lack of clarity regarding the nature of the text, however, throw a clear light on the new totalitarian approaches, which are already in the heart of the European integration process.
Fortunately, the European Parliament in this area to the full implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but only a consultative role it will use these in the ways and means of that right decisions be delayed.
The opinions on the way but are diverse.
That was a century ago, and after it had been pushed into the background, it is now fully back to the fore.
What we want at all costs, which means that there are criminals may, by the back door to the internal market.
We are in favour of the creation of a future cooperation, to support the fight against organised crime and money laundering and the various proposed measures to achieve these objectives.
In other words, there will be a provisional unit of judicial cooperation is established as a representative of the public prosecutor, judges and police officers with public prosecutor 's office powers of our 15 Member States.
Mr President, as a Member of the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee, I have dealt with Turkey closely with the prospect of accession of Turkey.
In Cyprus, Turkey 's behaviour is unacceptable.
However, we support the rapporteur 's critical comment about the lack of an effective evaluation of the lending by the EIB and the lack of transparency and proper public control of the activities of the Bank.
Despite its diversity, Turkey was and is an integral part of the real Europe.
The accession of Turkey to the European Union is on an issue that is more topical than ever today.
Mr Morillon, who says that Turkey must make an effort to make the European Union not to regard as an exclusive Christian club, Turkey, which they want to exclude.
Turkey will then have to be a genuine democratic state, if it is to live with their past have learned, just as it is the democratic Germany, from which we have the same demands, has managed to live with its past.
As soon as the government in Ankara has understood that the status quo for Europe and the rest of the world is not acceptable, huge progress could be possible reunification of the island and a comprehensive, just and lasting solution can be found in international law.
Why are all these issues in the report makes no mention of the European Commission?
In this balanced framework, we must work to promote closer relations between the Union and Turkey to continue with determination.
When you see the Armenian issue in connection with the EU accession - please note, dealing with what I am saying: the Armenian issue in connection with the EU accession, and it is the project on which we have spoken about today, it is as simple as that.
For this reason, we have so much to ensure that, after the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process to be a conclusion in Marseilles, so that we are able to establish the necessary guidelines.
But we have managed to maintain the dialogue and sensitive issues such as stability, terrorism, migration, human rights.
Irrespective of the Council has attempted to, especially since 1995, for the Mediterranean more funds available to the objectives of the partnership.
This is an extremely important matter, and I should like to say this as someone who comes from Central Europe.
Mr President, as you know, there is a saying in English, which make a show of Hamlet without star, such as a list without first dead graves.
For us, it is the combination of policies on internal market issues and a consensus on the introduction of cumulation of origin, whilst preventing the conclusion of sub-regional free trade agreement between all the parties and in the adoption of the harmonised protocol on the cumulation of origin.
We also have the intention of the Commission to give a new impetus to the Barcelona process, noted with satisfaction.
I have emphasised these aspects, because that is the key to the resumption of the process is the political agenda of the Barcelona Summit and also needs to be supplemented.
It is therefore our main task of guaranteeing the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean, and we must do everything we can to ensure that this cooperation is enforced and support on the basis of their own interests, shall we say, the generosity of the European Union be used effectively.
These are important and specific questions I would like to put is, and I would like to thank Mr Brok, of this debate and immediately before the meetings of the Presidency and the Commission on these issues.
The world is now have an unaufhaltsamen globalisation, and in such a scenario is an organisation in general, in the vast field of international competition, as the main actors operating reactors.
It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries of the 4,7 billion euros in the MEDA programme, which has come to an end in 1999, just over one quarter have taken up.
Therefore, the Commission 's proposal for a new impetus is positive and we fully agree with the priorities, as the Commissioner mentioned in his speeches and reaffirmed here this afternoon.
This is an alarm signal for the European Union, a much more active role to play in the Mediterranean, our European continent has enriched and historical and cultural strengthened.
But what is even worse is that at the same time, as we in this House are sometimes very different points of view factual exchange, an increasing number of Palestinians are killed.
Aid for reconstruction
We should not, however, in December, the appropriations for the implementation of this regulation, then today we contribute dreschen empty hay.
But we must not close our eyes to the role you have played in turn a blind eye to do this, and I hope that the Member States may not.
The mass media in the region have often responsible for local tragedy; it is needed, one that is completely free media according to the rules in force in our democracies.
I am a very happy man, because Parliament is, I believe, by persistent pressure have succeeded in achieving a situation that is not as good as originally could be called for the better.
Once again, unnecessary expenditure for unnecessary meetings must really be avoided.
We must, however, our attention not only to Kosovo.
The fact that a number of programmes with the so-called 'performance reserve' performance reserve ', which have been allocated, is regrettable.
He has in Feira on the stabilisation and association process countries participating in the status of the potential candidate for accession.
Once again, I refer you to the basic objectives of the CARDS programme: institutional consolidation in the spirit of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction and regional cooperation.
It was a good thing that the European Union, on the coup by President KostunÃ­ca has responded in a positive way.
A first meeting was held on 6 November.
What initiative in accordance with the request of the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, the Presidency intends to take to play a more active role to the full and, especially restlose implementation of the plan will be guaranteed?
How can this be recovery without the settlement of this conflict?
I can only say that France and Germany - and I speak here as President-in-Office of the Council - these issues on a bilateral summit last week in vittel raised and the establishment of a working group for the solution to this problem.
At the same time, the European Union continues to be granted to these two countries, through its various programmes extensive aid, especially TACIS.
The Presidency is the question of the honourable Member would like to give some uncertainties.
The accuracy, let me add something else: it is the concern both texts, the criminal framework for the combating of organised gangs of human traffickers.
In the report that the Council of Ministers on 21 September of this year, as the reform programme was adopted in the part relating to the legislative changes are several projects: host of measures to increase the effective equality between men and women in the field of sozialpÃ¤dagogischen into the civil code; greater control of violence within the family; better condemnation of this violence by setting up special family judges and ban on the possibility of a criminal estate crime for reasons of parties in breach.
The Presidency has therefore not reply.
Next week in France, there was a meeting of the europakonferenz my invitation to take place, in other words with the candidate countries.
Do you believe that the model of Austria, namely bilateral, majority decisions in the future will be an instrument of the European institutions over decisions and a new institution or a new group should be established, unanimity in the Council in order to be able to deal?
The Council has not dealt with this letter, but the Presidency has, of course, Mr Cem and the wording of these response was sent to all Member States.
And what does it in fact of what Mr Cem, the President-in-Office of the Council, has not replied to Mr Moscovici, could, in his opinion, the Cyprus issue in the further consideration of the accession partnership between Turkey and the European Union should not be taken into consideration?
We must be aware that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is far more than a simple agreement on fishing and that this agreement should not happen, as he well knows, a deterioration in the relations between the European Union and Morocco could be in the House.
I must therefore express my scepticism, as far as the outcome is concerned.
With regard to the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that the strengthening of cooperation between the Member States, but also the protection of individual rights must become possible.
The supplementary questions must be asked by other Members.
Moreover, the Commission has announced on 4 October 2000 adopted communication on the oil supply in the European Union, the Gothenburg European Council a plan for energy savings and diversification of energy sources, which will present will contribute to energy efficiency in buildings and, in particular, in the transport sector.
In this spirit, we have during the vote on the resolution on the embargo within the framework of the Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 November, to appeal to the Cuban authorities fully cooperate with the international human rights organisations.
It is therefore up to take steps????, which it considers necessary, so that this type of incident will not be repeated.
(The sitting was suspended 6.55.p.m. clock and)
If we are to money, it is the person who has had the privilege of the money, the political objectives are quite clearly to define, and the Commissioner has done repeatedly.
His visit can send out a signal and the whole of the policy that we are pursuing a perspective.
If we look at it in a region in which political conflicts are quite possible, we are wrong.
And the second request, which were imposed by the two rapporteurs and all of us must be supported, concerns the regular consultation and information of the European Parliament.
The Heads of State and Government also emphasised this process, the Union 's determination to substantiate by means of technical and economic assistance.
It was Parliament that, the Commission 's proposal for the creation of the European Agency for Reconstruction.
As the House knows, we believe that an explicit reference in the regulation is not necessary.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30.
For the cooperation of the Asia-Europe 2000 agreed an enlarged and updated framework, the work programme for the coming decade.
I think that in Europe we have to remember the importance of Asia, and not only in terms of economic and trade, although, at this point, it should be pointed out that Asia is the recovery of the economic situation, for example, have to thank for the fact that we have kept our word and our markets in the last two years have been open to Asian exports.
I think that was a very good political commitment, but we have some problems.
As you know, the Commission takes very seriously, and we support the ASEM process, the Commission also fully in this respect.
It is essential that the existing mechanisms for the implementation of Community law, to improve and increase legal certainty to overcome the current slow pace.
That is why it should promote the creation of new regional organisations and to start where there is already a presence of the Community, such as the western and southern Pacific.
That is the prerequisite for a truly sustainable fishing industry.
I believe that the future of fishing in international waters of these organisations, and all the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, are too small for the attitude of the UN, both in the Convention and in the mentioned here from 1982 to defend in New York, we have a very active presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing.
I therefore think that the Commission has a particularly important role to play, and it should ask the fishermen to cooperate and to propose solutions which we can all agree.
In addition, the Commission is also a plethora of tasks in connection with negotiations to take responsibility in the context of the regional fisheries organisations.
Mr President, I have the same problem as Mr Nicholson, only more acute.
As far as the solution proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Sometimes we even have asked to what extent the cyclical crisis even perhaps by speculation triggered the company structures in this way, the control of the sector, depending on their interests.
The new EU aid, which is proposed in the Garot report, I think it is unreasonable at a time when the Agenda 2000 and the forthcoming enlargement with Central and Eastern Europe, the reform of the agricultural policy is on the agenda.
I think it is rather for a good piece of work, which the rapporteur has hingelegt here, which shows what we can do with administration if a specific objective, and is clearly indicated.
On the one hand, the biggest producer or those who are integrated with all companies from this instrument to keep the systems and systems they already have: individual savings, bank loans, compensation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me say that I in principle - the Commission 's proposal to set up a compensation fund, also in the context of the Austrian agriculture welcome.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.
I understand that if we want to have a market organisation for the intensive animal husbandry and a reduction in the number of agricultural policy, bodenabhÃ¤ngige, provided that they bodenabhÃ¤ngig production.
There is the pig market organisation, and we should not make the mistake of the existing pig market regulation, which works in principle into question.
The Commission believes that it would be justified to the farmers, but also to join, the compensation fund a discipline, because these wars are subject to a certain amount of income as a bargaining chip, which do not guarantee, while others will not accede to this income guarantees.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10.p.m.)
Based on the VAT revenue 36% to 15% and the traditional own resources from the overall amount.
Another part of the reform which is a priority area is highlighted by the Court of Auditors, is the increased importance of results and success of measurement within a system of resources allocated according to vorgegebener measurable objectives, priorities and clearly defined.
That is a good thing, and I wish to thank you, Mr Karlsson, the members of the Court of Auditors and the services of the Court of Auditors also very warmly thanking in her report that you support the reform of the Commission.
I now hope very much that this proposal at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice will not simply buried or will be swept under the carpet, but that seriously.
The reality, as it is described in the annual report is rather sobering.
The number of its error is too high, as such a guarantee could be adopted.
The amount of work for construction and public works consortiums has been set too low. 240 million.
I would like the report of the Court of Auditors also somewhat anwenderfreundlicher imagine, accompanied by clear recommendations, for example, one or two per chapter.
In 1995, a convention on the protection of the financial interests of the Communities.
The Commission and the Member States should look at it in the light of this, and the results of the report as a tool to improve the management of the financial resources of the European Union.
I am aware that this report and the work of Parliament, within the framework of the current discharge procedure to greater vigilance with regard to the Community expenditure.
And now, Madam President, I would like to mention and waiting for someone to us by the Council.
As the Court of Auditors has, in recent years, no precise data on where the mistake described.
Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union is imminent, and in the report by the Court of Auditors has also highlighted in the candidate countries, there is still a lot to be done.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have recently reached an agreement with the Court of Auditors, in which the question of whether we were already vorinformationen to the secret kÃ¤mmerchen report from the Court of Auditors, and we have also agreed that we keep silent about this.
I would also like to appeal to the Council and to ask the question why the decision on Article 24 of the financial regulation is still awaited.
Perhaps a little sense from the European Union to the solution of the problem and George Bush its rightful place in the history, namely in the basket of waste.
It is not our task to make a scapegoat out, either in our institutions, nor in our countries.
I am pleased that the Members of Parliament of the view that the situation in relation to the procedure to the presentation of the annual report in Parliament and in the Committee on Budgetary Control was satisfactory than in previous years.
However, we will have the opportunity to speak on all points.
If it from the point of view of the auditor is relevant to all the facts, we call must be mentioned.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you will have noticed, the last part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors, which affects a perilous virus in his contribution and this House has crept in.
Some of the amendments, such as Amendments Nos 1 and 18 are linked with issues concerning, in particular, the UK, and it must be said that all representatives from the groups, the British, the people 's Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Greens, they have defended with great vehemently here, and they have been adopted in the Committee on the environment.
Mr President, in March of this year, we have the directive on railways rope adopted for passenger transport.
We are of the opinion that in these cases of trade is not in keeping with the manufacturers of the law must be a burden on product safety.
We have the justification for these amendments and for the resumption of the arguments of the Industry Committee, have been made.
It should be sufficient if the seller buyer can give general information on the products and the lack of information and documents.
Finally, a small request to the European Commission to Article 4 on the European standards and the question of whether they should be published.
Facilities for sale of voluntary organisations and charities existing exemptions and derogations for in markets or from the boot were needed to be sold, which I welcome.
The reliability of product safety and increase the customer service the value of the European label in a particularly difficult and direction at all.
If we ask the Commission, on the other, in the near future, a proposal on the safety of services, that is no reason why we are here now aspects of services should take place with rules and want to wait for the Commission 's proposal, because it is already delimitation problems that will arise between the various arrangements for the legal uncertainty and will increase over the course of time.
I would like briefly to outline the main points of this proposal.
We will also enable the opening up of the system to third countries, in particular for the candidate countries: we have the procedures for the implementation of emergency measures at Community level to the recommendation to simplify, so that we can be active a regulatory committee as soon as possible.
By means of this new provision is no significant additional responsibility on those shops.
The proposal of Amendment 11, the word 'manufacturers' with 'service provider to replace' but more clarity, would not cause confusion, because the directive no definition of the term 'service provider ".
Although the Commission is in favour of rapid deployment of such a network, but it must be coordinated between Member States.
Such a certification can be used as evidence, it is, however, not be attempting to safety.
I have explained in detail now, which is why the Commission proposed Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 and 30, 32, 33, 36 to 34 and a part of Amendment 7, and the second part of Amendment 21, and the first part of the Amendment 27 to 34, however, rejects the Commission accepts, Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31, 35 and a part of Amendment 7, the first part of Amendment 21, and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, as the present Commission proposal, these amendments will improve and greater clarity.
We must obviously Mr Crespo than Italian socialist, not the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
In my opinion, Amendment 12 and Amendment 37 no contradiction.
With regard to the order in which I will leave the decision of the President, but I would remind you that, in any event, I am against all three amendments.
The non-EU Mediterranean countries have in terms of economic development, with particularly serious difficulties with the regional inequalities are constantly tensions there.
With regard to the respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, it is in the spirit of a harmonised European immigration policy, in addition to appropriate legal instruments to ensure a fair treatment of these immigrants also instruments for financial support to all those young people who, after the absolvierung university studies or a specialist in the European countries want to return to their countries of origin, in order to arrive at a professional activity.
I would like to highlight a factor which I consider to be a determining factor in this matter really: the lack of equality in the labour market.
- (PT) late, but still has the Commission has come out of the programme in support of the Community framework strategy for equality between men and women (2001 / 2005) by previous programmes, which was presented at the end of this year and, in particular, of the fourth framework programme, which expires striking.
There have been a number of improvements on the one hand, and on the other hand, my group has been dealt with. For studies on the situation of women in the national labour markets and the lack of access to the insurance systems, which is why we need to aussagefÃ¤higen statistics, geschlechterbezogenen data.
- My party has serious reservations about the application of Community law on the sale of consumer goods, instead of the application of the concept of mutual recognition of standards.
It is now, and the changes made labour is the guarantee that the shops and upholding of charities are excluded from the directive.
Amendment 15, the Commission finally have a free hand in the language regime in the Agency, which we believe is a very worrying development.
The simplification of the codecision procedure, the establishment of decentralised use centres (not only in Pristina, what would be its separation of Yugoslavia) and the solution of the problem of dual structure with management board and management committee could be as positive measures towards restoring the huge administrative shortcomings within the European Agency for Reconstruction.
We are therefore voting against the Commission proposal and the report of the European Parliament.
An adaptation of the existing Community rules in this area can therefore be seen as a right.
It also offers the possibility of funds in the form of cofinancing by the Member States more or less disguised State aid will be granted.
- (EL), despite its serious shortcomings, the Morillon report clearly go further than the Commission proposal on the accession partnership between the European Union and Turkey.
On the other hand, we have voted against this measure.
Like the rapporteur, we must recognise that Turkey has made progress in a number of areas and that positive signals.
Parliament has already been used for this recognition, since 1987 and the adoption of the amendment is an indication of the coherence of Parliament on this issue.
The Union must more concrete proposals and enlargement to include Turkey as an essential geopolitical policy decisions.
Such ulterior motive is not worthy of Europe and Turkey.
For several years now, I, as a Member of the delegation for relations with Canada the work of one of these regional organisations, the NAFO Fisheries Organisation (a), the North-West Atlantic, on which the countries in the region, including Canada, and all those who use traditional fishing areas in the region, such as France, Spain and some other European countries.
It is only when they are satisfied with its own arms boat fleet under the banner of its fisheries policy rash way.
The most important thing is not to respond to the hegemoniestreben by the Commission weakens the European position, which is a proper application of the subsidiarity principle would be totally contradictory.
After long drawn-out negotiations at the end of a final result which deserves to be defended.
With this proposal, which is the replacement of three directives on waste incineration, therefore, is the quality of the air, water, soil and public health, is to improve the emissions from schmutzpartikeln, in conjunction with the incineration and co-incineration and, in particular, the emissions of heavy metals, dioxins, furanen reduced.
I believe that it is also important to point out the innovation that is now no longer only of emissions into the air, but also in water and the soil.
During the debate, the proposal has been rectified.
The introduction of more stringent limit values for nitrogen oxide in new coincineration plants, such as, for example, cement kilns, is a step forward, an incentive to reduce emissions will offer, even though the proposed standards are not just the latest state of the art.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you will excuse me particularly you, Mr Blokland, I am talking about a few minutes late.
Finally, I would like to say that this directive is an essential contribution to the reduction of the negative effects on the environment and the risks to human health.
It would be a credit to the European Parliament when, in the name of the rejection of any form of discrimination, the fight against exclusion and taking account of the introduction of a system of individual responsibility to give new impetus to the practical implementation of the fundamental principle of solidarity.
There is, however, from country to country big difference, and there is a lack of detailed and comparable statistics, which is the reliable system where information in the way that the best results will be, what its weaknesses, etc., and that is precisely why I, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs opinion stressed the need for the Commission to set any specific rules for the supplementary sickness insurance transfers of a Green Paper in which all these dispersed data and information and will use has been compiled.
Until now, this to a certain extent, a taboo subject.
The danger is that, not quite healthy citizens and older people only partly because of its high risk can assure private social development, is not an option.
The second approach, which the rapporteur explained in his introduction, and which is supported by many of the Members, the promotion of the necessary rules and codes of conduct for the introduction of forms of mutual costs between the insurers, all the provision of high-quality services guarantee and the dangers of the emergence of discriminatory practices and a risk and consumer choice.
In my opinion, it can not be right that, in which money is dependent on who is on the waiting list above.
The new proposal of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is right to take stock of the situation in the form of a Green Paper, and only then to decide whether we need a directive or a recommendation.
In the Netherlands, about structural changes to the system are being discussed.
On this basis, the Commission should take an initiative and concrete benchmarks as guidelines for replenishment of the health systems of the Member States.
It is, therefore, an absolute unity solution for the insurance would probably not have been possible.
That is why I believe that we should Mr Rocard on his report, in which the Commission a service, a Green Paper asks us an insight into the present state of the insurance companies in the Member States and, at the same time allowing the course for the future in terms of content and congratulate him.
Both are based on a dreisÃ¤ulenmodell: the State, the company and the private sector.
With regard to the supplementary pensions, the European Union has already drawn up certain rules, it is a Green Paper, which then arose of the draft directive.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Rocard and congratulate him on his report and I would like to congratulate Mr Marinos, and also the opinion of its committee.
This study will then be able to form the basis of a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament, in the initiatives and measures.
The Committee on Budgets with regard to the amendments, I can tell you that it all pleased to have been adopted.
We have voted in favour of the key figures of the programme, to which the multidimensionale dealing with the phenomenon of measures in the areas of health, education and housing, consistency and complementarity with other neighbouring areas of policy, and also the participation of non-state media, but also the social exclusion of the people themselves.
That means that we need to use the cyclical growth stages, in order to achieve a balance or surplus.
Here, I would remind you that the last Ecofin Council has asked the Commission to do, from next year, it is precisely these long-term aspect of public finances in relation to the ageing of the population in the evaluation.
One of the positive aspects of the programme of the Netherlands is the special consideration - as I said at the beginning, the consequences of the ageing of the population in the budgets for the next few years.
It emerges from the budget account for the year 2000 in Germany a surplus of one and a half points in the gross domestic product.
We still take the exchange rate of the euro to the dollar, we have a clear negative impact on inflation.
If we want to continue to be a public pay-as-you-go system with private capital to combine education systems, and that they have also with support for the creation of specific compatible, investment funds can receive the long-term tax benefits, and perhaps in solving the problem of the ageing of the population are useful.
This is the third senior principle, namely, the precautionary principle.
It must be remembered that, at this moment, a number of proposals for legislation, all of which will be discussed the efficiency and effectiveness of Community rules, and consequently, as I hope, boost consumer confidence.
But this is relatively low incidence no grounds for complacency.
Quite frankly, I was disappointed that in the statement yesterday by Prime Minister Jospin the extremely positive role played by the Community in recent years have not been honoured.
Of course, it will require increased incidence of BSE, not just in France, but also in other Member States, after statements.
The Veterinary Office of the Commission to address, as far as the safeguards against BSE is concerned, the controls in the Member States already have the highest priority.
With regard to its safety, I would like to repeat that there is already a whole series of controls to ensure that meat and bone meal in the transmission of BSE is not a danger to them.
Yes, it is hard to believe that it has lasted four years, to agree to a measure for the protection of public health, I think it is essential.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I also expressly to at last, the Council stated its opinion on the regulation on TSEs.
In the current situation, the only way to the cycle of BSE infection, to break the use of animal meal in the total ban on feeding.
In this context, I should like to mention that we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled an amendment, which I hope will be adopted.
The policy must change here so that really responsible for this crisis in concrete decisions, with a first step towards the end of this dramatic crisis, it is done.
They must therefore be reconsidered.
The agreed labelling for beef and veal, which was a mindestetikettierung, which has only been in force for two and a half months to the origin of the animals do not have proper traceability spezifizierte risk material, and this is something that we have far too late.
The citizens must be fully on the characteristics of the tests that I have just mentioned.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have done nothing or virtually nothing like their colleagues in the light of the consequences of Chernobyl, the AIDS epidemic and the contaminated blood products have been inactive, always been as reason not to panic among the public.
The French ban will need to lead to a massive increase, but this is the supply of raw materials is limited.
Consumers have lost their confidence, and in order to put a stop to this phenomenon, compulsory testing for BSE in cows and sheep are introduced.
Instead, it is more important now, in the spirit of the Commission 's proposal that meat and bone meal to work to the highest safety standards.
Otherwise, I am not hurt, for once, is in complete agreement with what the Members, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs GrossetÃªte said.
The Council and the Commission, that denn mal has a sufficient financial basis and can now implement a vigorous policy.
We must address this problem.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am very pleased, should be heard in this House that the CAP is to review at any price.
We have the soil, is the appropriate climate and the necessary skills, know-how, with animal meal, no genetically modified pflanzenproteine immediately, and yet we have to replace the right to on our own soil for the feeding of our animals and the necessary pflanzenproteine feed the people at the same time as we grow set-aside land and finance, our group has tabled an amendment in which the Council and the Commission are called upon to examine ways of tobacco growing in Europe, to increase this pflanzenproteine a suitable substitute for prionenhaltiges animal meal and American genetically modified soya.
The food must ensure the safe food for the people.
I think it is vorbildhaft that France has managed to get this step.
But help them Mr not!
That is why I am surprised that, under these circumstances, verwertet or processed carcasses.
In Britain was recently published Phillips inquiry into BSE.
I would like to ask the European Commission to propose that the precautionary principle be applied with regard to beef from France as well.
We still do not have a certainty and must therefore know how the scientific fact situation is and what measures are needed.
In addition, of course, I have noted all the proposals, for which I am very sensitive.
If people come from the Member States, the legislative reports, and I would not fully implemented properly or not, then perhaps we should think again, but not because the scientists tell us that it is necessary, but because it is in the European Union to the lack of respect for the law.
If we do not want to hear us, then we are not even the most effectively.
The Commission is of the opinion that the readmission agreements for the clarification and coordination of these measures will have an important role to play, and at the moment, the negotiations on the first readmission agreement with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco.
What proposals does the Commission, on the basis of Article 31 of the Treaty on European Union?
(The President cut the speaker off)
The aim of this period was the reduction of the public deficit to achieve a more satisfactory monetary policy, lower interest rates and a higher growth.
I have said several times that the euro is introduced on 1 January 2002, we have introduced it; we have already in our pocket in different him, but we have to face in our pockets.
The current limit values for nitrogen and lead are not exceeded, not even the schwellen#wert Athens threshold value in the inner city in accordance with Directive 92 / 72 / EC and we must, however, bear in mind that the tests were carried out in summer.
Subject: State aid for the audiovisual sector in the French Presidency at a seminar on the subject of cultural industries a representative of the Directorate General for Competition was of the opinion that the European Commission concerning channels of legal investment obligations imposed by the legislator, that they have been compulsory would represent, state aid.
It must be respected and protected '.
But this is not the case, because this new growth is very inegalitÃ¤r and, just as we in the USA, for about a decade of continuing phenomena of insecurity, of exclusion, poverty and the urban ghettobildung be accompanied.
The governments of the Member States have accepted this definition is not something to be simple and devoid of substance.
Incurred in the cold climate, there is an increasing number of people who do not keep up excluded and can be excluded.
Mr President, in this House, we very often hear a litany, such as the European social model and the social market economy, which proclaims, unlike my many, a chaotic model of United States of America would form.
(technical disruption)
This is a huge amount of money.
Furthermore, we must involve all political levels.
I agree that it is necessary to know the causes of poverty, and I am in favour of better innovative and practical answers by means of prevention, involving the social partners, local and national administrations and the joint action of the citizens against exclusion as a result of mergers, restructuring and relocation of companies, extensive rural exodus and settlement of the urban areas.
We had a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and the role of social and structural reforms.
This is a legal problem, given that the wording of the Treaty is not only to social exclusion and poverty.
These proposals are, I think, a pragmatic answer to your request.
However, voted in favour of the strategy is not necessarily agreeing to the detail.
If we create a clear and binding framework for the Member States to define the different systems should have to comply with these requirements, a long time after the acid.
Renewable energy sources are not a panacea for solving this problem, but no one is questioning the fact that she is to a great extent, and also to bring to the diversification of energy sources and to reduce our dependence on oil and natural gas, and on the other hand, can contribute too much of a good thing.
I should like to make three of our demands.
The setting of realistic objective indicative values can only the confidence of citizens in the energy policy, to be followed.
In my opinion, has a consistent policy in the field of renewable energy sources has a symbolic value for the future of Europe.
Finally, with these agreements, the Member States of the European Union must show that it is making a contribution to achieving the Kyoto objectives.
It would be unfortunate if a category which, on the whole, would be excluded from waste of energy to erwirtschaftung whether for small projects can help or as part of the accounts.
The education of peat mass of forest in the forceful assimilation and other vegetable biomassen resembles the emergence of faith.
Mr Chichester, I should like to inform the House that in my native coast at sea already very modern wind power plants have been set up, and it is a project that will certainly be introduced as soon as possible.
The dispute over the renunciation of nuclear power, for example in Sweden and Germany, has shown that without any visible environmentally friendly and a competitive price realisierende energy alternatives to the debate will probably becoming bogged down.
That is why the Member States must draw up binding objectives.
That is why I am optimistic about the future potential of renewable energy sources, provided that the right incentives will be created.
I believe that there is a great deal of courage to continue to renewable energy sources is to adopt a position, as it has earned.
A very strong increase in the price of oil is undoubtedly aware of the problems with greater severity with our dependence on fossil energy sources.
We can therefore not accept Amendment 28.
However, it is very important that we respect the terms used do not constitute interference in its right of initiative and that they are not incompatible with the internal electricity market.
In the Commission for the reconstruction of tadschikistans live, where 25.000 widows only under 26 participants, was a woman.
Although the proportion of women has been relatively small, studies have shown that the presence of women in the friedenssichernden UN troops to improve relations with the local population and the general standards.
The report Theorin is in details in this area and also in repetition, we in the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats, ask that, in the spirit of the official document to be abolished.
Politically speaking, I can present Amendment 19, not a tactical defeat or tactical withdrawal as a fundamental compromise values are, and that should be unworthy of that, for women.
They were being held.
Portugal, where women are also until after the aprilrevolution of 1974 access to diplomacy, has recently received with East Timor and our ambassador in Indonesia, Ana Gomes, shown how the role of a woman and its awareness of the problems and the suffering of a people, the 25 years alone in his freedom struggle, throughout the world, and, in particular, here in the European Parliament can be seen.
This has very few of them have done two or three, so I am told.
This dimension must, therefore, also in future in the development of the policy of the European Union will be taken into account.
Unfortunately, the terminology is not defined, and there will be no distinctions.
I would like you to convey our protest to the Council.
They are people with other experiences - experience for the political leadership and, in particular, are essential for the settlement of conflicts.
The debate is closed.
Secondly, if the sector is to be regulated by law, must, of course, be examined a number of points.
In the last few weeks I have noted that, both in international trade union circles and in certain national trade unions, there is a great deal of interest.
My second comment is this: are you also in favour of women at home are remunerated?
At present, all those who engage in undeclared work then received a working under decent social conditions.
It is also for this project to have been resultierend frequently have joined forces and two or three families together a budgetary aid.
We were in a plenary session during the first October part-session, when we, in our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia by the courageous reaction of the Serbian people, following we heard immediately, as you will remember, ladies and gentlemen, the lifting of international sanctions.
The life force so that Europe has its civilisation in the history of the world and its political creator force in the shape of the future development of road.
There must be no doubt that the question of the status of Kosovo is a democratic issue.
On the other hand, we should like to have a chance to show that we, Europe, through their own efforts and in recognition of the true principles of democracy, the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro to develop within Yugoslavia.
I must say that I - as I said - very impressed with them was, as you said this very difficult situation, and how determined meisterten they were.
In the next protocol in order, Mr Watson.
Access to documents and information on the activities of the institutions, which will allow the citizens to decision-making bodies and encourages greater efficiency.
The fifth important amendment is, in my view, who, in particular, the annual reports on the documents must remain secret or at the very least, are still secret.
This issue is resolved, and there is a possibility that the transparency of rules, too, more to remain in force, and has, among other things, we have tabled amendments on this point.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy are fighting against the proposal, documents, foreign or security issues touch on, and as a whole will automatically excluded from the principle of public access.
If we want the citizens to exercise their rights, we need really geschulte staff in these contact points, in particular, to some extent, seeking information and citizens in the path of finder than by the complex labyrinth of the institutions.
Registers are essential, if we do not want a prior opinion from the public.
It is very encouraging to see that Parliament has been able to enjoy the support of a broad majority in favour of more transparency.
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs for their excellent work.
Mr President, openness and transparency in the European Union are in a good light.
If this is fehlkalkulation, then this is a, because what is at stake here is the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens.
The document is now under different things and we want a broad access to many types of document in various forms.
Mr President, the Commission 's attitude to the right of access to documents is evident from the internal manual on 11 October, which has been distributed to the employees of the Commission in which you, as you will be aware that requests for access to documents by Members of Parliament for it.
Or, at least, to delete this provision must be supplemented the duty of a balance of interests.
The normal way of international cooperation with the diplomatic traditions and rules, for example, that everything takes place behind closed doors, does not fit for modern forms of cooperation, as you have been developed by the EU.
We should the role of the European Parliament not to confuse or with future interinstitutional agreements.
It has been a step forward on the implementation of the right of the citizen to information and knowledge.
But it is not the only thing that I should like to thank, who also deserves a great deal of gratitude is Hanja Maij-Weggen from the PPE-DE Group which, because of the consolidated Hughes procedure mitverfasserin of the report.
Transparency must become the cornerstone of the activities of the whole of the European Union, but the right of access to the documents that can be found in the implementation of the transparency alone is not enough.
Therefore, the European Parliament is demanding that the European security and defence policy in future in the structures of the Commission will be involved.
As President Prodi, on 3 October to Parliament, he spoke of the institutional triangle and pointed out that, in a Europe based on a system of checks and balances of the proper functioning of each institution to the common interest.
I have to admit that the great challenge in this regulation is the exact definition of documents.
I should like to emphasise that the Commission, when the time comes, to accept practically all of the amendments, such as Nos.
In some cases, I would like to vote in favour of the proposals of the Commission and, to this end, the members of the list of amendments that the Commission can support, and with the proposed amendments, which they do not want to have to support.
Own resources of credit institutions
Finally, and this is the most controversial point strongly supported the committee asked for an accelerated procedures for the implementation of this legislation.
These changes are to take the place of a number of other proposals in the report, which rejected in the vote and now probably be replaced by the new amendments, which are the result of this consensus.
Mr President, in view of the excellent result of the vote in favour of this report, and the response of the Commission this morning is very clear, if you consider that we all share - that we have voted in accordance with Rule 69 (2) of the vote on the draft legislative resolution should be postponed, with the Commission and the Council in successful negotiations may arise.
Mr President, I am sorry to say that the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats (PPE-DE), the postponement of the vote, but I must point out that it has come to my coordinator to inform me that you too, as the vote until the November II part-session, instead of trying to postpone this evening.
Another reason I would propose a postponement of the vote - Mr Goebbels said - this is a very important matter.
I do not know what a roll-call vote costs, but there are certainly some thousand francs or Belgian francs from our budget.
I know that in France, whole-herd were slaughtered, and this does not seem to be the best solution.
Removal of animal meal in animal feed, not only for cattle and sheep, but also for pigs and poultry, fish,
This is not acceptable.
Such provisions are likely to restore the confidence of the consumers and the farmers to send a message of solidarity, which we want to convey to you.
There is an urgent need to go any further, and a change in the face of the common agricultural policy.
The ban on the use of meat and bone meal as animal feed is merely the first step in this direction.
We regret, however, that our group has tabled amendments were not adopted.
I believe that it would be logical if the working time of employees in companies that pollutes the environment.
In conclusion, I should like to stress once again that the public dissemination of hazardous waste recovery, we must not result in the production of such waste becoming.
Because if, for example, the pensions is so low that it would not be enough for the living there would be less poor.
The report provides for funding to the tune of EUR 100 million for a period of five years to reduce poverty.
The proposal, a second Luxembourg process in the area of social exclusion, of the guidelines and national action plans, amongst other things, receives my unqualified support.
The report calls for the establishment of qualitative and quantitative indicators for the social exclusion.
With the presentation of its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission is following the request of the Council by June 2000 ',' A 'initiative on cooperation in this field'.
Mr President, I have a very specific reason, I abstained from voting on this report, I think that the progress in environmental terms not wanted and that I would have liked to have seen.
I hope that this system in all European cities are exported.
Some of the proposals in the European Parliament are unrealistic and do not find my backing.
It must also be better in the future, to make the bestpractice publicly known.
GroÃverdiener umweltbewusste received in a liberalised market the opportunity to contribute to a cleaner energy voluntarily, while for the other everything can stay the same.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
It is for the following three reasons for this: firstly, in accordance with this request from the process of consolidating democracy and the increased demand for respect for human rights, particularly in relation to the indigenous population groups.
We would, in this debate, as the previous speakers rightly said, is that the solidarity and support of our institution in respect of the Central American Parliament. This is happening at a time when we are trying to ensure that the external relations of the European Union with the countries of iberoamerikas continues to be a priority.
I do not have reservations about the human rights, our colleague and dear friend, Mr Seguro responsible, President of the delegation for relations with Central America and Mexico was authorised to countries.
Finally, the Commission is also engaged in dialogue with the Central American authorities reiterate the importance which the regional integration process as a tool for the consolidation of democratisation and development in this area must be attached to it.
The power to him, he has not hesitated to cling to the absurd debate on the 'ivoritÃ¤t to conquer', which provoked a wave of xenophobia, hatred, on the other, the burkinabÃ© or the malinesen tourism, of which many of ivorischem ground for many years to live and work.
A precondition for the creation of a genuine democracy in CÃ´te d 'Ivoire, the establishment of an independent committee of inquiry on the crimes and the formal obligation to respect human rights and the internal peace.
Some believe that democracy is of relative importance, when it is a question of Africa, it was complex procedures and we should allow for working time and I am, on the other hand, believe that there can be no compromise relating to democracy and that in CÃ´te d 'Ivoire, such as, for instance, the same question today in Guinea, where we know that people are imprisoned and there is no democratic system.
Finally, let me say one more thing: dictatorships are only possible because there are people live in poverty, which have no access to knowledge and knowledge.
It would not be inconsistent, now that the European Union has called for new presidential elections, all the candidates to take part in this time.
In many parts of Africa, we are dealing with very different ethnic and religious mixtures.
These elections must allow the national representation of the political parties, which were excluded from the presidential election, so that, if only in part to compensate for the shortcomings of this first choice.
On the situation in Burma
There will be a large-scale offensive against the Shan led the Karen and helped, and, as the rapporteur pointed out, there are no indications of a dialogue between sdpc and the NLD.
We would therefore once again the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment on the part of the Commission and the Council in this direction.
I hope that the European Parliament through the handling of this issue in the debate on topical and urgent subjects of the Burmese people are a clear signal that his desperate situation is that we should not forget that the situation in Burma is getting worse rather than better, and that we are determined to do something about it.
It has been a long time coming.
It is precisely in Asia, there is a risk that economic and political reforms entkoppelt that economic progress and economic liberalisation without liberalisation can give in the political arena and without strengthening the rule of law, despite the fact that I think that, in the long term without a functioning state under the rule of law, trade and investments, subsidies have been wasted.
Mr President, I can agree with the previous speakers in a number of essential points, because much of what is happening today in Vietnam is not acceptable.
The human rights organisation Human Rights Watch, as Mr Swoboda said, said just now that Vietnam on the question of human rights in recent times has undertaken to improve the situation.
We are giving this top secret documents behind the scenes a rare view of the policy of the Vietnamese government.
However, the Commission is still convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation about a dialogue between the military regime, the democratically elected opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities can be achieved.
There is also a clear pressure by the Vietnamese authorities in the direction of self-censorship of its own press.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
We also need the help and support of the European Union, not only in the south-west of England, but in all the affected areas.
I would ask you all to support our resolution.
It is urgent that the European Union does not in an extraordinary aid after the entry of disasters.
In this context, the Commission has taken two initiatives.
Mr President, it is a purely linguistic errors in the inclusion of one of the amendments in the joint resolution.
That means that we postpone the vote to postpone the task for the Commission.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The report is based on the realisation of a growing proportion of health care in Europe by means of supplementary sickness insurance schemes.
I think it is rather strange that we already have the hands of the Commission for a proposal for a directive, but at the same time we want to tie up a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and supplementary sickness insurance requested by the Commission.
In view of the fact that the proportion of elderly people in the population, it is important to increase dramatically improving the health of people throughout Europe to consider.
We can, of course, do not go ahead.
Mr President, a lot to be said for a fast-track procedure with regard to the implementation of the results of the Basle reformulate the adequacy regelungsrahmens.
The sense of urgency with regard to Mrs Villiers, which gave the Commission the need for excise sense by the adoption of the measures in an accelerated procedure, it has to be said that the rapporteur himself acknowledges that these arrangements will have no impact on the anti-competitive practices which, unfortunately, are used in the USA.
We must not, of course, to be careful, in addition to the Basle by means of increased capital requirements of the banks, there will be a second disadvantage.
That having been said, I would like to point out that the economic operators, in my opinion, also consider the approach of the satisfactory to the capital, the issues related to the risk abstÃ¼tzen, is based.
These are some of the early thoughts on how we, within the current rules of the Treaty, we could achieve a swift legislative process, which would be monitored and efficiently.
Now is the time to recognise that the institution of the European Ombudsman has grown up enough 'has been sufficient evidence and now that they are ready for its own budget.
The PPE-DE Group supports the view of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the powers of the Ombudsman should be extended, the sooner the better, in particular with regard to the 1994 decision in Article 3 of the Ombudsman 's powers of investigation laid down.
Of course, an ombudsman is subject to rules governing confidentiality, but it is important for the public to know that he or she might be given access to documents as bÃ¼rgerbeauftragter remain closed to the rest of the citizens.
The starting point of this report by the Ombudsman was then up to the Commission, on the recommendation which it organised selection procedure and the access of women to their own candidates are improved scrutiny.
We believe that the recruitment procedure of the institutions of the Community, and indeed all the recruitment procedure with the greatest transparency and openness should take place at any suspicions of biased, injustice or incompetence of the administration.
I refer, for example, to an amendment concerning the demand for the undeniable evidence oral examination.
Mr BÃ¶sch has already touched on the amendments to the report.
I have two questions to the Commission on the implementation and organisation of the last internal tender was addressed, I have received a precise and detailed answers to them.
Administrative processes will be open and transparent.
Firstly, the audits carried out by the Commission always be anonymous corrections.
It was clear in July 2000.
Votes
(Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote)
In the review of the directive on the capital adequacy of banks must be vigilant in conflict between various interests can be measured.
This is the idea of a European police college for the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries.
This position is also the rapporteur, and also to the European People 's Party shares.
The social situation in most Member States of the European Union is now actually requires cross-border cooperation between the different police forces.
Most of the other speakers seem to believe that it is vital that the College has a single permanent seat.
The umpteenth provisional, but not widerrufliche decision with which the Council used to our Parliament a small gift.
The rapporteur wants to crime prevention, provision of services, innovation and monitoring of the borders are involved and the protection of internal security in the spirit of the maintenance of law and order are amended.
These were the ideals suggerierten us, and it is what the state from which they have.
A levelling of standards in certain Member States of the European Union, I would welcome.
Since the first considerations in relation to this issue, on the initiative of the European Parliament at European level, the Commission has made a commitment to the Member States, with the aim of action, something which we, as European police culture could look at the highest level of professional ethics, respect for the rights and freedoms of the citizens and the effectiveness of the fight against crime.
This is a development of the police academy primarily at government level.
For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
- (SV) I have voted against the initial setting up the European Police Academy.
There is no doubt that many of our courts and bedÃ¤chtig very slowly, and it is very difficult to a rapid action on these issues.
The proposed regulation is not perfect, of course, since it is based on the Brussels II regulation, not for children of separated parents living and unmarried.
My mother, such a divorce and abduction 85 years ago today, and it is still part of it.
I would therefore like to say to the House that the Commission in the action programme on the mutual recognition of civil decisions - which I hope we will be decided on until the end of the year - to the extension of the scope of the Brussels II regulation and, therefore, this regulation on visiting rights first and high priority to children, so that they verheirateter couples equally, without distinction, as they are for children from living communities.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Meanwhile, the sport - and this must be said - linked closely with other industries, for example with companies in the audiovisual sector or the advertising industry and the sports goods sales.
What we need is an intelligent and flexible interpretation of the current rules.
Strictly speaking, this is an attack on democracy, we also oppose, to look at things from that point.
Therefore, the Commission will shortly expecting an answer to your request for detailed information on the measures planned by the British Government.
The proposal was taken up by the Finance Ministers in connection with a preliminary draft budget half a year before the statement on the general budget presented in the spring of 2001.
I also think, as Mr Simpson said has helped us in extraordinary way, in view of the probable intentions of the UK Government to verify.
Not only would we lose a lot of time by traffic jams, not only at a very high cost, but it is quite a major problem for the environment and, therefore, I believe, in fact, the money from the British Government in its efforts to solve the problems we have all made of them, in particular by all the citizens of Europe.
We are more or less the only oil producers in the European Union, and we have the highest petrol and diesel prices of all the countries of Europe - 1,20 pounds, we pay in the UK of a litre of diesel.
That concludes this item.
The European Parliament has a duty to assure you that it is at your side, in turn, I ask you to observe a minute 's silence, our solidarity and our embarrassment.
Madam President, I would like to give my full and wholehearted support to this proposal, because I am one of those who have applied to this point.
We have a good deal of progress.
The EU will continue in its relations with the main groups as quickly as possible and, furthermore, with the new government in contact with each other in the USA.
In the light of - what a surprise - enthusiastic about the report by Mr Prescott secured, which he himself has negotiated deal, I do not understand why he is not only Mrs Voynet 's declaration, but also, I believe, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, and also of almost all the other European Environment Ministers have been rejected.
There is a danger that we now have the momentum that the American negotiators change their position in May, and we need to start completely from the start.
The main point of contention, this time the forests.
A steady warming for some EU countries have meant that parts of their territory or versteppt flooded.
They have a high level of prosperity and low prices for products.
I would like to congratulate Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m on her efforts in the Hague and wish her more success.
There is no doubt that there is no better than a bad agreement, because the American proposal for Europe is totally inadequate and was not acceptable.
Climate change have far-reaching consequences in the developing countries.
I would like to reiterate that the English carbon forest turns to carbon sinks well from sources.
Only if the European Union, it can retain its credibility in the discussions and the actual measures at COP6 - 'B' take the initiative in Bonn.
We must make our own assessment of the events and to prepare documents with the different parties and, of course, the 'umbrella' to contact group.
Of course, there is a step at the end of the next COP6 COP6 or the continuation of the fact that the agreement will be ratified in the Union.
We will be before the European Council, Mr Pierre Moscovici, i.e. on Sunday, and I still hold a closing sitting at ministerial level, on which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, and on Monday at the meeting of the General Affairs Council will be held a meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference.
The minimum number of Member States will be established, while in the opportunity to take a unanimous decision by the Council to a de facto veto at the moment to be replaced by a recourse to law.
We can, but I must regret this fact.
The European Council will also address the issue of the state of accession negotiations and, therefore, with a view to enlargement.
The Lisbon European Council, guidelines on the promotion of innovative and competitive Europe.
The protection of consumers, for obvious reasons, which I am not going to insist bedeutenderes concerns the need to continue the Europeans.
We must prepare ourselves for this unprecedented enlargement.
Indeed, this is the criterion, we must assess the Nice Summit.
(Applause)
Firstly, the candidate countries to adopt and implement the acquis communautaire, which is also our task.
We are very concerned that the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and we do not want to convey the fact that it is splendid.
However, the text could be better formulated after Nice, but it can also be rectified and clarified.
I think it is simply unacceptable that a number of governments of the question of the inclusion of a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty simply brushed off the table.
They do not want them to incorporate into the Treaties, which is proof that this text should be set aside to this elaborat.
Within the WTO, we are unhappy with a single voice.
I think that, given the rather sombre prospects for the burden on the Intergovernmental Conference with a more complex and controversial issue no wise move.
I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the French Presidency, a maximum effort to close this gap, because it is very destructive.
To trade policy, the Commission drew up a proposal which must be examined carefully.
Despite some progress with the previous agreement about the extension of the formula has been able to achieve this, we verrÃ¼ckte formula of codecision, including the unanimity on matters of nationality, and social security, the inclusion of self-employed acquisition activity and the cultural policy is being created.
The fact that this question is, is in itself a clear evidence of the failure of a policy to strengthen the ties of mutual trust between the countries of the Union.
That is the situation in which we are at this Intergovernmental Conference for months because nobody will abandon its toys.
The experience of this year have led us to the observation that following Nice the progress in Europe, with a view to the future of the Union in the konstitutionalisierungsprozess must be achieved, not only now depleted method of confidence between the government representatives of the negotiations.
The qualified majority will not, then this will become the rule, which Mr Prodi has quite rightly said a moment ago, the decision-making process was blocked.
This aspect of the principle of subsidiarity has been mentioned in this debate, is not, however, be of great importance.
So we have made in 1995, enlargement has taken place, there has been led by Carlos Westendorp, there has been so prudent reflection group 'Amsterdam and Nice, and we are now practically the same point, Mr President: We circles about the institutional issues, without finding solutions that will allow us to fulfil a very challenging task of enlargement to 27,.
Let us not make the disappointment that the Nice Conference, if you will, in any case, still the outcome without major disappointment of the peoples of our Parliament to add.
In the past, we have proved that this objective is possible, and as a citizen of one Member State of a programme which has benefited transition to membership, I see an enlarged and peaceful Europe with great expectations.
But when you have a right of veto, it must be made clear that this will apply to all the others.
However, a first exchange in the 2004 will be necessary electing at least some Member States before the elections or during the election period 2004-2009 would be added.
The President-in-Office of the Council has raised the question of closer cooperation bewege and stated that there is a consensus on this matter.
Mr President, at first sight, the left overs in Nice and about the necessary adjustments in the context of enlargement.
We no longer have one ounce of those mentality that we to adverse developments in our part of the world and can have a positive processes less emphasis could into sharper focus, then we would be happier than is currently the case.
We should not just to the movement of goods, but also the necessary services, investment, intellectual property and competition in the majority decision in the Council of Ministers and the Article 133 (1) in accordance with the Treaty.
The right of initiative of the European Parliament, but also in this very sensitive issue of party political arbitrariness.
We must, therefore, also be capable, as one of you said, to the American optimism and when he talked about the way in which the Americans to highlight this issue in itself, which is, as we would like.
I should also like to say that it is my view that it is not a problem of large and small countries.
We have done a great deal, but we always come back to this old problem, and I do not believe that there is a development, because it was only one country moves, because what we have here is, I repeat, by a very strong national, political, democratic realities in twelve of the fifteen countries to do so.
Mr President VÃ©drine, you have said that there is a climate spannungsgeladenes perhaps, and you have also spoken by a certain degree of pessimism.
I would also like to ask you to make every effort to the safety requirements appropriately in order to tighten up, so that such an incident does not happen again.
I believe that we have to take steps to ensure that we are still far from this Parliament that the passengers can feel as guests in this House and not fear of threats.
Hospitality here, hospitality and respect for them.
Thank you very much for your comments, Mr Tajani.
The best honour that we can prove to lluch Ernest his life, and it is to comply with its embassy in Catalan means they dÃ¬aleg - we can all the dialogue and give a chance in the Basque country?
On the other hand, can, of course, all his opinion.
(B5-0549 / 2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Council, on the political situation and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan;
When I speak of organisation, I mean that the European Union is making great efforts, which should also have responsibility.
Secondly, they will be in the resolution, the clear will of the Parliament, the security and defence policy to be based on balanced two pillars: civil crisis management, in the event of a failure to military crisis management, and these two pillars complement each other.
Mr President, in view of the already occurring late and the commitments I have today, I will try to the speech I had prepared to be reduced.
These relations are particularly at meetings between the NATO Council and the copsi and meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European applicant countries and / or the allies.
Take the example of reference to the events in the Balkans, of which you can say that everyone has exercised its role.
During this period the USA, too, we have kept fully informed of developments within the framework of the European security and defence policy to be kept informed of what are an essential condition for this is that they develop harmoniously, as is the case at the moment.
That is how the second annual report on human rights in the European Union, submitted to the European Parliament and a human rights forum will be held in Paris on 13 December.
This policy, as you find out that chooses not to the competitors of the Atlantic Alliance, which is to be the basis of the collective defence of its members, or a permanent European army.
If I have mentioned the figure of one man, it does not mean that we are sure that in Helsinki objectives, but that we have a reserve of different qualifications and spezialisierungen, and the aim is to ensure that the relevant 60.000 among all the Council working environment can be achieved.
Let me now very quickly to the actual policy accepted a large number of our public purpose of this new task, with which Europe has a lack of the instrument of political influence.
However, we are now also has the problem of how to ensure that, when we talk about the freedom of consolidating democracy in Europe, the whole of the continent, because that is what it is in the enlargement process and the process of enlargement.
Three areas we need to combine into a coherent whole Community policies, the CFSP, including the ESDP and national policies of the Member States.
Despite the necessary procedures within the Commission, we do not need 60.000 soldiers strong force, in order to achieve our objectives.
In other words, we must urgently find a way of humanitarian aid.
I do not agree with the zynikern claim that Europe is on the increase, so that a toys is nothing to do with it, but it is true that the rapid reaction force to be deployed in many situations will not immediately.
The EU should not form their own defence with fixed troops.
Finally, I would like to express the concern of my Group, on the situation in Afghanistan verschlimmernde and call upon the Commission and the Council, as far as it is possible to their efforts towards a peaceful solution and to increase aid to the civilian population, especially now before the winter.
To put it in simple terms: where, when and how the European rapid reaction force should be used in future?
The interview highlights the appalling record, as these two months to come out of the Intifada, based on the Palestinians, and deaths, mostly 270 almost tens of thousands of people with disabilities, often for life '.
That is why it is also constantly trying to schrecklichster an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.
On the other hand, and contrary to what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it would be possible and desirable that the European Union, in the face of the conflict and the escalation of violence in the Middle East, particularly now doing more than it has done in the past, during the transitional period, in which the USA.
Mr President, in my speech, I should like to refer to the report by Mrs LalumiÃ¨re, which I think is very good and clearly formulated.
But there is no real political project, and there is still no common foreign and security policy.
The EU has a problem, namely that it is only the public interest for such actions, although this has not so far been more sustainable and much more effectively.
Another point is, of course, the question of the distribution of the budget.
Despite the large number of this I would obviously assurances on this issue over the last few days, as always.
Our potential is still very limited, at last, and that the Member States should reconsider their defence expenditure, which is significantly different from country to country.
Even those who use, for example, of the decision on the creation of the so-called Euro army have questioned the significant political content of this decision and its effect on the cohesion of the European Union.
The first appearance of a Minister of Defence is such a historic time in this Parliament, that we have to set aside the night sitting, so that the image of our Members is not too much.
For all of these conflicts is a civil crisis prevention is better than a military action.
Russia, in the long term, will be a non-democratic regimes political Union partners?
Europe will not, therefore, a new military alliance, as some would, I think, on the basis of incomplete information have suggested.
I have, in accordance with Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure, to wind up the debate, a motion for a resolution.
Given the size of the task of four committees were affected, and a new type of procedure with the drafting of four reports were applied simultaneously.
The measures proposed in the White Paper must serve as a whole the whole operation of the Commission, to modernise and more effective.
It would therefore be appropriate to take advantage of the reform, for your intervention in order to limit the areas that do not involve expenditure.
The costs of assessment, but differences are not just a reflection of a political nature, in particular the cultural differences between the Fifteen.
The main task of the new internal audit service, which you, Mr Kinnock, the Vice-President responsible for reform is directly responsible, the analysis of the internal control functions and systems within the Commission.
The cooperation has made great fun, and I believe that the process, the Commission to carry out a major reform which, for the future of the European Union is so important is, has gained in depth and wealth, since we have four have played their part in this.
They should expect to other European institutions and the national governments, or to be put to work in the private sector.
That is why our committee points out the importance he once again a strong, independent, efficient, transparent and leaders of the Commission to Parliament.
As the Committee on Budgets, we believe that the establishment of the budget for activities because of the poor visibility of expenditure and because of our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority headaches.
That is the clear will of Parliament to clarify this reform, together with the Commission.
Mr President, I would first of all four rapporteurs for the work they have done.
This is shameful, in view of the fact that the EU itself is campaigning for modernisation of the economy.
Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteur to support the work of the Commission, it is a fact that to the recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts is not a comprehensive and consistent response in the spirit of the quest for a real government policy, and not just for a better management of the Commission.
The change in attitude is expression in a transparent administration.
In my view, there are around the world substantielleren no structure with a larger and more important than the 15, 20 or more countries have an entire continent - the most industrialised part of the world pulsiert within the Union and by the Commission on its structures.
Changes are never easy.
It was the Group of the Party of European Socialists, however, of the opinion that the management of the Community is currently very effective work.
We know the outcome, which is why the many Members of the Commission and its administration to deal with the issue in depth and expertise.
Thousands of project applications for over a year, an assessment has to be put into practice.
As we have seen, in the course of the debate, it is not so much a question of principles, objectives or opportunities for reform, but rather about procedures, speed timetable possible faults or undesirable consequences of their implementation.
First of all, I should like to inform the House that, as Mr van Hulten in today 's sitting has already stated, the Commission adopted a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement, which was an advisory group on rules of behaviour in the public service, as it has set up the action programme 1 measure on the White Paper.
Mr van Hulten has raised this issue in the course of this debate again to my knowledge.
The main aim of the new version is a simplification, the increase in transparency, the strengthening of budgetary principles, in concrete terms this means fewer exceptions, less incomprehensible exception, and it means increasing the efficiency and effectiveness in the budget procedure.
It is also very unprofitable for the Commission, if agreements for cost X, to be replaced by 20 to 30% costs y and often be replaced by kleinstbetrÃ¤gen the evidence collected and consideration.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on relations between the European Union and the developing countries, and the effects of the reform of the Commission in these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI)).
The latter issues, in particular the NGOs.
Of course, this is not enough, but that we should in any case against excessive representations of the weakness of our development aid.
We will come back to this, as this is in itself a useful framework.
Mr President, I am now returned from Mozambique, where the European Union after the flood disaster has done excellent humanitarian aid, reconstruction projects, but, once again, for which we have put the money has already been delayed, because not everyone signatures are meeting here in Brussels.
Faced with this reality, a greater commitment and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is essential.
We now have a harmonised system for the production of country strategy papers and indicative programmes for cooperation in all developing countries.
It also provided for the establishment of the SEM no solution to the remaining disparity of eight an inflated administrative body.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am very attached particular importance, today in this debate about the first package on maritime transport in the European Parliament, because they are going to deal with three important texts, the first essential step in this area and that, unfortunately, is by recent events raises awareness of it.
From the point of view of the Presidency of the Council that would offer an opportunity to discuss with the Member States, on the basis of its proposals in the Council to reach an agreement at first reading and, if necessary, the text adopted by a qualified majority.
This rapid and effective approach, the result of two Erika packages and six proposals are, has a huge potential.
The lesson learned this morning that this Parliament should have to lead to the conclusion that the maritime law throughout the world in a shameful condition and it is time that we are in order.
On ships that do not comply with the standards, must give a clear signal that we propose in European waters do not tolerate or in European ports.
The tankers lower tonnage if we are to reach a compromise between the 5000 tonnes of sustainability, the limit value of the IMO, 600 tonnes of sustainability, and the ceiling proposed by the Commission.
This information must be European, State and port authorities and the interested public is to be made available.
The grenzenÃ¼bergreifende nature of the marine environment, namely, the pollution of an area could spread to a wider area, requires a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution.
Cooperation at local level in nature conservation associations are also included.
The amendment to the directive in the sense of a stricter application, a harmonisation of the legislation, particularly with regard to the selection of the Ã¼berprÃ¼fenden ships and the scope of the various forms of review, it would, of course, be seen as positive.
Once again, I would like to point out that the request for urgent procedure, which is not to urge you now.
I think that the limit for classification societies, and between the Council and Parliament must certainly be considered new once again, irrespective of what is being decided today.
A voyage data recorder, a black list, with all these things, we are entirely in agreement, but I should like to draw your attention to a few points.
In view of this disastrous situation in maritime transport and anarchischen, Europe is the challenge, and eleven months after the wreck of the Erika, the European Union will be in a position to have a procedure, which has been produced so quickly, as none before.
Imagine that shows the extent to which the liberal logic in conflict with a high level of safety in maritime transport.
What technical measures to be taken are one of the main sources of uncertainty will continue to exist as long as people in the English Channel and the North Atlantic zone as a result of the exponential increase in traffic not devote has stopped the North Sea ports.
The President-in-Office of the Council, it is good to see if he would also order in his country.
Mr President, since the break-up of the tank under political pressure vessel, the Erika was put together a package of measures to improve the safety of ships at sea.
The simple fact that, under the Greek ships in the area, without storm, Mr Gayssot.
Thirdly, when we should be clear about these dossiers, that between our oil stockpiling, on the one hand, and the fact that we continue to use fossil fuels, on the other hand, there is no link.
We should at last have the political courage to our environmental ambitions.
This means that, in this area, we have a very great responsibility and must, as it seems to me that any institutional eigenliebe leave aside.
For example, in Finland, it is vital that Russia is involved in these agreements.
This applies both to stricter requirements for the design of oil tankers, better rules on port state control and the stricter rules for the classification societies, the outcome will be.
Mr President, today we are discussing the ship safety at sea, on the basis of three reports, on which I congratulate the rapporteur.
As regards the three new proposals on safety at sea is concerned, there is an urgent need for me to congratulate the three rapporteurs, in a very short space of time: you have the proof that our Parliament is determined to new measures to increase maritime safety and the strengthening of controls and tightening up the design requirements, and that in the future to adopt such disasters can no longer be tolerated.
Madam President, a series hochgradiger shipping disasters involving oil tankers, above all, in the recent past, our continent has been seriously affected.
More than 80% of accidents are caused by human error, but there are reasons for human error, a social one.
Someone spoke of 'traceability'.
With the directive on port state control and monitoring compliance with international standards should be introduced a new rules.
Amendment 18, the port state control on rest periods of seafarers in the implementation of the provisions on the working time of seafarers, however, is already covered by the existing Directive 99 / 95 fully covered.
I am pleased that the rapporteur in Amendment 21, is a reference to the system for the evaluation of the conditions, and we are in agreement with the proposed thrust is even more, but we need to work on the wording for the whole clearer.
Amendments Nos 4 and the 'C' part of Amendment 18 dispute about are not acceptable.
I can assure you that a ship at such a ship owners, flag states to register its intention, as soon as it intends to reconsider our proposal is in force.
The Commissioner has spoken of 18 minutes and at this time of dozens and dozens and dozens of articles quoted, and reflect the position of the Commission.
Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on a package of measures on the trans-European network, preparation for the collection and dissemination of the statistics of the inside and non-Community movement (EDICOM) [COM (00) 0458 - 5-0401 / 00 - 2000 / 0201 (COD)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)
I therefore zurÃ¼ckziehe by the motion for a resolution, however, I would like to express the conviction that our Parliament can have its voice heard more effectively when it with regard to the meeting of the European Council in Nice, a specific and separate motion for a resolution on the important and difficult issues, rather than the intergovernmental conference you have placed in the context of a single, including all the other items on the agenda of the summit meeting of comprehensive resolution.
(Because more than 12 Members were opposed to voting, will be of no account is taken of the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the resolution.
Report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on relations between the European Union and the developing countries, and the effects of the reform of the Commission in these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI))
I have seen this as a sign of protest because the European Union has done in this area, are still not to intervene, as they actually ought to.
Despite the fact that neither the proposal to amend the existing directive on port state control, the actual requirements of the Watts report, they contain some aspects that represent a step in the right direction, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of the report.
It is regrettable that the Commission proposal does not taken up the idea of a genuine European coastal monitoring authority in the style of United States' coast guards exist '.
An essential condition for the safety of ships, the protection of life at sea and the environment, the fight against the unaccountability of shipowners, strict measures to control the condition of vessels, the harsh punishment of shipping companies against the safety rules, which are contrary to the improvement of the working conditions of seafarers, your specific training and composition of the crew in such a way that, in the increased demands on the ships is able to meet.
Unfortunately, the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, the precise opposite.
The wreck of the Erika in December 1999, the question of safety at sea, on the political agenda of the Community, and the Commission has these texts on which we are today, almost a year after the terrible accident, voted, at the insistence of this House.
The current compensation funds are inadequate resources; this was only too clear when it comes to human disaster, in which the fishing industry of the Shetland Islands was not adequately compensated for their losses.
Madam President, I have already mentioned that I am a seaman earlier.
The rapporteur 's proposals, which seek harmonisation at European level, can only be a positive thing.
The area concerned is very important, as it concerns the ship klassifikations societies.
This would be a great success on the eve of enlargement, because we do not need a supranational Europe, which is rigid and bÃ¼rgerfern hierarchical, but a flexible, to the peoples of Europe in the near future, which is based on respect for the national democracies.
The public is increasingly in the power struggle between many Member States ausgetragene we focus on possible compromises.
In Nice, the most important task is to ensure that the EU institutions to work efficiently.
Personally, I look forward to a week in promising summit.
I am also not for an automatic link of qualified majority voting and codecision and also believe that every decision to extend the power of codecision, must be taken on a case by case basis.
With the amendment of Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union will be the use of qualified majority voting in the Council at the moment, to apply for the goods to other areas such as public services, intellectual property, health or education.
This Parliament is deprived of the right to influence, keeping quiet and pay tribute to the parteilichkeiten in silence, the national responsibility and the governments and forgets its obligations towards the citizens.
In addition, I have therefore voted against a text which the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty, which will be adopted in Nice.
It is a mistake to divide Europe into two classes, and so I am unable to accept that a third of the Member States at an even faster pace.
His new role heralded the end of the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.
There is a great deal in this report, the British Conservatives, can give us your support, particularly in the home, to the enlargement of the Union.
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament support the report on the creation of a common European security and defence policy.
But also against the peoples of the European Union, which is the new military expenditure, to which the report refers, in any case, not even a guarantee that these forces is not one day, on behalf of the maintenance of order 'against you yourself are used.
Just as serious is the proposal that a State should not participate in a task will be obliged to make a financial contribution in this war, under which Member States will be shared out.
Outside with military means there is no solution, because it does not address the root of the conflict still cause a turnaround in the public opinion.
That military operations from a budget line should be financed by the Community and the Member States for a financial contribution for these tasks should not, even when they wish to take part (paragraphs 49 and 50).
The EU, on the other hand, it would be good to reverse the priorities of the Petersberg tasks and to become more focus on civil and humanitarian solution models.
I support this report by my colleague, Maj Britt Theorin.
But the needs of this group will only to hide behind the call for the 'tax (s) absetzbarkeit of financial services "and" adaptation of prices and costs to the financial reach of private individuals'.
In actual fact, it is sagenhaft that, in the twenty-first century, we recommend that the Member States should, domestic workers are entitled to social security and adequate pensions should guarantee.
For many young people of undeclared work is the first contact with the labour market.
The worst thing is that, if women from distant countries, which have adopted and this work will see no other way to deny their livelihoods.
The reform of the Commission will be judged according to their results, hence the need for regular progress reports from the Commission, throughout the duration of the programme and the importance of the December 2002 expected total balance.
It was not so very long ago, as a result of all kinds of scandals and management weaknesses in March 1999 on the resignation of the European Commission.
Finally, I think it is essential to remind you that we are vital for the future of this reform, at the same time, greater consistency and greater transparency on the part of the Commission in their day-to-day administration, but also a greater sense of responsibility, for their part, with strict restrictions on the competences conferred on it.
The Conservatives also support the statement in paragraph 7 of the report that the democratic control of the three pillars of the system and to make it operational.
(The sitting was closed at 13.15.)
We have heard - and I will immediately add that I do not believe you - that the Council and the President of the French Republic, only 30 minutes tomorrow will be here to discuss.
I therefore share my full and reasoned opinion.
Let us in any event to vote, and I personally am in favour of a resolution, as Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others have proposed.
These texts and into the night work was looked like the number of votes in the Council and the distribution of seats in the European Parliament.
Madam President, I would like to make a plea to the de Roo report not to remove from the agenda, because he is very well prepared for environmental summit at the latest during the French presidency next Monday and Tuesday will be drawn up on a common position.
Thank you very much, Mr Parish.
In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, of which it is often, it may take.
The political basis is clear: harmonisation of the market, taking account of a high level of health and consumer protection, building on existing legislation and new scientific findings.
It is about their standard of living and life, in view of the increasing importance of health protection.
This rule is also to all consumed during their leisure time does not, however, be applied dangerous drugs, if no other, apart from these drugs konsumierenden person.
Just yesterday, in the USA, legal proceedings against multinational tobacco companies with a condemnation of poisoning and false information about the harmlessness of products to an end.
With regard to the cigarettes in the EU are banned for health reasons, but to be exported from the European Union, we believe that an end to these exports is the only right and consistently.
Instead of the lessons from the failure of 9 October of this year in Luxembourg, we are still in a position that is legally untenable.
I have listened very carefully to what the Commissioner said: "Mr Hume no massive job losses in this sector.
These are the positions of Parliament and the Council to approve this proposal for a directive, and to consider the appropriate legal basis for this.
I do not believe that one can have recourse to such a narrow, irrespective of the content of the material, as Mr Maaten and others aufzeigten, there is a risk that this Parliament, the Council and the Community institutions in general, this Parliament and the Council, provided by the Group of the European People 's party chairman, as proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, accept restrictive interpretation in the legislative work of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law is to be bound by their feet and hands.
Its weakness is the emphasis on the promotion of free competition.
At the end of the following: since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament is entitled to questions of environmental and consumer protection, and it will be to coordinate, of course, in this respect, to cooperate closely with the Council and the Commission.
In fact, it has nothing to do with tobacco, but the decision of the European Court of Justice to have as good a ban on the advertising of alcohol can go to a ban on the advertising of chocolate or damage to sugar, also because, as you know.
I simply do not understand that a majority of this Parliament wants to introduce a more generous export regulations than by their own governments of the Member States - those governments which are intended, but also to the many industries have been pointed out.
It has been proved that 80% of smokers to stop the tobacco industry has to offer few strategies, to help these people.
If we insist on other countries to prescribe what health standards they should put our reasonable proposals on exports to the internal market, we extend the excellent work done by Mr Maaten in question.
We support the implementation of this test by a in a country akkreditiertes test laboratory for the EU as a single method.
The effects of tobacco on health are now widely acknowledged, and is as public legislator and come to the conclusion that it is time to strict rules and rules of this product.
The Community legislation will therefore very well in the future international rules and, therefore, the risk of the birth of trade barriers, consumer protection and at the same time guaranteeing a high level of public health.
It should be made to wait for the whole question of additives in the first report of the Commission.
As regards the amendment on laboratory tests is superfluous, since the approval of tests in another article stipulates that only such were to be put on the market must comply with the provisions of the directive.
Madam President, this report is very clear: at the moment, the duration of directives on summer time is limited to five years, then they must be to extend Parliament again.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on the organisation of the summer period which we are examining, seem to me to be a good proposal.
I therefore think that we in this House do not reside with this issue for far too long, but the Member States should have the people and the regulation of the summer time, and it is already largely accepted as part of our annual rate was recognised.
I am in favour of issues relating to the time zones and harmonisation of the summer time arrangements, as proposed in the decision-making power of the Member States.
There is more in favour of summer time at the end of September, some six months after that.
We are in favour of appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report to be drawn up in 2007, as mentioned in Article 5.
It is clear that interventions in the human germ line are unable to accept.
We will vote in favour of this compromise, if we still have a set of rules to guarantee the therapeutic progress and the protection of patients in Europe as it is not only, but can be improved, and that is why I am in favour of this compromise.
These groups must remain within the scope of the directive.
I am glad, though, that we have succeeded in putting a stop to the germline therapy.
I would say to the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on his report and congratulate him on his efforts to reach a compromise with the opposition.
These programmes relate to the fight against cancer, the prevention of AIDS, the addiction prevention and health promotion; it would detract from the end of the relevant plans and the work of the established networks.
It is extremely favourable, the ground in the run-up to proceed as quickly as possible to put a second reading and, if necessary, as far as possible to approach the issue, on which a decision can be taken.
We must also take account of the fact that both the prevention and promotion and monitoring, and that is why we must be increasingly important to a higher budget greater priority and be made available for it.
Madam President, on the occasion of the Trakatellis report on the extension of the current European action programmes in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about the direction in which to express the European policy in the field of public health.
I have been informed that the Council, too, has indicated its essential agreement.
In the European Union, there is now the paradoxical situation in which internal borders for the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, the 15 borders were abolished but also in the fields of police and justice in criminal matters will retain their removal, by the Member States will be more difficult.
Finally, the initiative is a real and important step forward in the creation of a European criminal law area is only part of areas; if you also covers and in their effect is limited, but it is the actual needs of very many European citizens who have been realised to date, because, if they are actually outside their country of residence of the territory has been a victim of crime.
What have we called for these people?
At the same time, to ensure that the experts, the direct contacts with the victims, a special training.
Victims must not be victims, victims of crime and then of the system.
In this context, it is also important that the members of the family of the victim, discreetly, on the issue of professionalism and be informed and, if required, the necessary support, and that they do not have all read in the press.
This is regardless of the type of crime.
We must not ever at national or at EU level to move on from the fundamental principle that an individual always bear responsibility for its own actions.
In other cases, it would be necessary to the necessary information in a language of the Union, which should not to find their own.
I welcome the favourable response of the House to the first text on such an important issue, that of the area of freedom, security and justice, we have to establish the protection of our fellow citizens, with which you are in situations zurechtkommt often only with difficulty.
Vote on request for urgent procedure
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
We have in the night of 23 to 24 November with the Council on the salient points of the budget, which is certainly not glanzvoll agreement, although it is reasonable.
Therefore, the Commission had a review by EUR 300 million proposed by the Council has been handed over fought against this.
But I know from conversations is many times that it is more difficult to formulate a verhandelbare Council position to obtain a mandate, and the puren national self-interest in a reasonable rational and acceptable result pan-European decision.
I hope that the work on a common recruitment office as it new German, that is to say, a European attitude authority, so that we really do make progress, including the problems which, in the next few years on all the institutions in the same way as the Council - to send to the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions, namely the need for personnel, to join together in the next few years.
Now the Council has denied this revision, we should really have on the data at our disposal - and I would like to warn against him as a preventive measure: the flexibility instrument in two consecutive years, in fact, less than 15 months and the first time less than six months after the adoption of the financial perspective - to use the flexibility instrument financially, weakens its restoration, since it prevents the accumulation and possible up to a level of EUR 600 million.
This considerable amount, which the high needs in the year 2001, in particular due to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in the sum of EUR 200 million will be financed.
In the light of this new facts, at second reading, the Council has adopted a budget increase of 2.5%, which is a.
Before it finally adopt this budget, I would like to stress the value of the Council in the application of certain fundamental budgetary rules with regard to the recruitment of funds in the reserve, the legal basis and the classification of expenditure.
In contrast to Nice, and I believe that all three institutions, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - with the result of the law.
Ladies and gentlemen, the recent BSE how animals vaccinated and also for the area of the budget, namely immediate action is needed in the protection of human health, consumer protection, but also in the form of aid for farmers affected by this situation.
In addition, the Council has for the framework programme for the support for the reconstruction of the Western Balkans a multiannual sbetrag, while the only one directive value, but is in tune with the financial perspective.
We have to do and wÃ¼rgen herausgeschlagen a few million euros.
My sincere thanks go to Mrs Haug.
Mind you, therefore, that this 1% of the budget of the European Union is very well used.
If I have understood you correctly, then, you said that we should not use the reserve, because it goes against the rules.
I therefore think that we have now, together with many other, which I will not mention of the shortness of time can be seen, very good things.
While the expenditure that almost half of the entire budget, taking account of the letter of them during the coming year will grow by more than 5% of the entire budget is growth only 3.5%.
Now we see a great risk that, in the next few years, the confrontation between Mediterranean staat-projekten MEDA project will increase and the Balkans, although we all know that that is where money is needed as a matter of urgency.
Take pleasure from the fact that the difficulties have to be overcome is on the way to achieve the objective we auftÃ¼rmten in Helsinki in relation to the candidate countries to meet its commitments, without the Union in the future, and with a view to enabling Europe to continue to act efficiently.
Progress has been made, however, to make real progress, although this would not go as far as the presidency - as, I might add, national, has shown a great deal of openness - would have liked.
For the Statute for the European political parties is a new legal basis, and Parliament will have the right to take action in accordance with Article 230 of the Treaty.
In recent months, three important steps forward.
This is the aim of the Nice declaration adopted in this regard and of the reflections on the fight against doping at European level to coordinate.
The environmental risks to be heard - as is well known, global warming.
In Nice, the European Union will continue to provide for the provision and leadership of a common foreign and security policy necessary permanent bodies: a political and sicherheitspolisches Committee, a military committee and a European military staff.
For this cooperation, for their support and also for the reception given to our thanks you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Now we must carefully examine the text in Parliament.
I would point out, incidentally, Mr President of the European Council that the cost will be borne by the taxpayers.
I see it as a failure, not only in terms of the European Union 's declared ambition to change, the institutions and to improve the efficiency of the European Union to include the new Members properly, but also in relation to another important aim, which may have been too little in relation to the rapprochement between the European Union and the citizens.
We believe that the right issues, the impressive of people who bewegte, on the eve of the summit, which was zusammengestrÃ¶mt from all over Europe in Nice.
First of all, the fifteen grundrechtecharte rush in a trÃ¤nengasgeschwÃ¤ngerten signed the atmosphere.
(Applause)
My group is disappointed by this Treaty and on the future, he is concerned and we shall use all its powers, on the other hand, please.
Mr President, you have the floor.
Finally, I would like to reply to Mr Hager, the instrument of closer cooperation, I think that it is useful to make Europe more dynamic, and the way to a short while ago - I believe - as it has formulated, Romano Prodi, for my part, I fully agree with that.
Mr President, I would like to know whether the jurisdiction of the European Parliament for the summer time after Nice a new achievement.
Up until now, the complexity of the clinical trials abgeschreckten pharmaceutical companies will perhaps by the States and by our Parliament clearly expressed wish, the market for pÃ¤diatrische encouraged to develop medicines, even if it is not enough to guarantee the profitability of investments.
- (FR), the summer time regulation, which, at the time of the oil crisis for reasons of energy saving and will continue until 2001 was extended?
The position is not always appropriate protection of victims in criminal proceedings.
This European initiative will therefore benefit many passengers and urlaubern.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, who is here with us, the Presidency of the Council, to enter the Chamber at the moment, and to point out that in this House will probably never such a consensus on the evaluation of the results of a summit showed.
The Europe of which movement is, is one in six months under the French Presidency, as it seems to me that, in spite of all the work he has done in six key areas.
Above all, however, I fear that the UK, France and Germany now will be able, in the course of decades of different sizes between Member States and between the institutions to upset the delicate balance.
It is difficult to see how the decisions taken in Nice, facilitate the enlargement of the EU.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be very brief today.
For all of this, I can only draw the consequences of that I should be voted on the Treaty of Nice will vote 'no'.
Mr President, the most important result of Nice was that, despite everything, an agreement was reached on the candidate countries and now place can be created.
The real winners of this conference, Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, Mr who say 'no' to Europe.
So let us look at Nice and we post Nice, I hope you will allow me, I hope that Belgium for his Presidency plans to set up a Convention announced, because it has become apparent, we must adopt new approaches, we need a new approach, we must speed up the history, because 2004 is too late, is too distant, too many risks.
Instead, the spirit of Nice was obviously think, how can we, how can we block, therefore, how can we intergouvernementalisieren defender of national interests at home instead of celebration, to ensure that the European Union is really to be improved.
What we are after Amsterdam and Nice 's princes that there is a Europe, a Europe of the national administrations and not the Europe of the political agreement.
On the key issues, we can no longer afford to qualified majority voting.
It is true that - I am opposed to me here - in the words of Mr Bayrou, first of all, this morning I have seats on the side of the President of the Republic, and now in the criticisms we have received from all sides of moderate, friendly criticism, as it seems to me that, in any event, critical comments.
We must not forget that it is in fact the first time since 1957 really is that this approach has been reformed or change.
We have to do it with constitutional systems of the powers, and can therefore not be mixed.
Thank you very much, Minister.
But it has not yet been included in the Treaties, there is a reference to the Charter in the Article 6 (2) of the Treaty on European Union.
Finally, some positive aspects that have been mentioned, for example, the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty, the article on political parties and their statute that the other institutions, Parliament 's right to sue in the Court of Justice - an important factor of political control, the new formula for the European Commission, the inclusion of the so-called' lex Prodi 'in the Treaty, the strengthening of the President and the new composition of the Commission, all of this is a reasonable compromise, which I am sure will accept and the truth.
Mr President, we already have an uncompromising evaluation of what happened in Nice.
If we look at the realities: the Charter has not been included in the Treaty, not even a warning.
We want the Heads of Government will be able to show that we are better.
The thrust of the French Presidency, whatever the nature of this morning is the Intergovernmental Conference have not been brought to a successful conclusion.
Mr President, it is not so easy to criticise the French Presidency now, since he is not here.
Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the model of the Intergovernmental Conference has do.
2001 budget (continuation)
This, however, does not mean that we should not have more and better things to do.
The Commission will be forced by such ceilings, within the framework of a limited budget to set priorities, as every authority must do.
In this debate, with the following vote is a long and complex process of decision-making on the European Union 's budget for the year 2001.
We are therefore proceed as follows: we have recourse to Article 272, to avoid a budgetary crisis, despite the financial perspective for the use of the flexibility instrument.
To the Council, I would like to say that, in this game is not quickly and that we have to start the balls will play such a long time before we have achieved the desired result.
We do not want to see a revision of the resolution Colom I Naval already contains a proposal for the coming year, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we share his criticism that a solution in terms of category 4 of the financial unterausstattung, in this way, the multiannual nature of the major objectives of the external policy of the European Union, and also the definition of financial perspectives distorted.
In order to achieve all of this, in order to be able to achieve our long-term commitments must be priorities in the future.
Only in this way is the money for our fellow citizens is sensible and properly spent.
If we have to calculate expected supplementary budget, it will be almost 8%, while we are in all the other areas - whether it be the education policy, be it on the whole area of internal policy, including research, of foreign policy and the administration of pre-accession aid, as a whole, a growth rate of only 1.1%.
Since it is so good cooperation, we will be in the supplementary budget, in January, you have the opportunity to continue.
Equally, we welcome it, if not yet regulated in relations between Russia and the Baltic States criticism.
We are following with great interest the social and internal developments in Russia.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.
Even if President Putin to us to guarantee the democratic development of his country, he is not automatically guarantee for a stable and democratic Russia, is the fundamental democratic regulation is not actually experienced reality in Russia.
We should, however, there is no secret, but a Europe of economic cooperation.
As far as the Caucasus is concerned, Mr Van Orden, is absolutely right.
Anyone who wants Russia, and then also in from the outside, from the country itself and immediate impressions of Russian interlocutors in danger, it is easy to get it to the reality of the country selectively to say what it thinks land-bild Russia in its image.
In the political field, the common strategy for Russia, a permanent dialogue on political and security and to establish a permanent mechanism.
I should like to emphasise that we really need to make it clear that Russia will in actual fact in a political union with Belarus.
Are you, Mr Patten, is prepared to support such a plan?
As the honourable Members know, at the last summit between the European Union and Russia to a wide-ranging dialogue by Romano Prodi, to set in motion the energy issues.
I very much hope that I will have the opportunity at the beginning of next year, to visit Kaliningrad, not only because Immanuel Kant who has spent his whole life there.
I would like to congratulate the honourable Member once again on an excellent report on an extremely important issue for us in the next few years will focus on numerous occasions here in Parliament.
It puts me in a very difficult situation.
Mr President, I would like to say that this debate has been very much needed, because the BSE crisis has huge implications for animal feed, on production and imports of animal feed.
The Council has at its many meetings with Russia at all levels, expressed its concern on the Russian Government in particular this, excessive use of force and to avoid a possible extension of the conflict, independent and effective investigations into the violations of human rights, of the OSCE support group in fulfilling its mission with aid and, finally, for the transport of humanitarian aid.
Mr President, on a point of order: it is in fact also customary in this House that the oral questions will be answered in writing, not enough to be provided.
(Interruption from Mr Posselt)
This directive dates from 1992.
In this sense, and we must work towards.
These groups are, however, do not appear to have been included in the new proposal.
Some Member States have the Presidency and by the association of the European sugar industry has a number of letters from the Commission proposal, which it will take into account in its deliberations.
Question No 6 by (H-0886 / 00):
First of all, I must say that the President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, the question raised by Mr Korakas has not yet answered.
Now we need to set up this authority, and I believe that the European authorities are well aware of the problem and that we must make progress.
In a nutshell, the representatives of the Presidency, in this case in France in Algeria, the Ambassadors met with Mr M. Ahmed taleb?
In this connection, we welcome the proposed by the preparatory committee for the General Assembly adopted provisions for the accreditation of the non-governmental organisations in the preparation process and for the special session in September 2001.
The accession partnership, the text contains a number of references to the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
With regard to the honourable Member, as the Council has already, in its previous reply, the process of mutual recognition of criminal decisions with better protection of the rights of individuals.
However, I would like to press the point further.
He is undertaking, in particular, the political control and the strategic management of a military action to crisis management.
I would just like to remind you that the system of the Treaty makes a difference between the treatment of indirect taxes, their harmonisation for the establishment and the functioning of the internal market is required - as stated in Article 93, in accordance with Article 94, and harmonising legislation - who are directly linked to the establishment and the functioning of the common market, and this includes the direct taxes.
I would like to say a few words about these three key areas.
If the behaviour patterns that everyone remains opposed to any doubts, this could fighting, the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, built on regional cooperation.
In the end, we need cooperation with Yugoslavia, which is a mutual cooperation.
Mr President, our group supports the work of Mr Baltas in connection with the report on the possibility of the negotiation of a stabilisation and association agreement with the republik kroatien.
Mr President, over the years in which I President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe was, I had the opportunity, many Croats in their efforts to accompany, freedom and prosperity of our continent, as other people, with their integration into the European institutions gleichsetzten.
On the basis of the development of Croatia in the course of this year, I am convinced that it is possible to submit a straffes pace, because that is what it has done in the past months.
In any event, this is the approach adopted by us, and the speed with which we have, in recent months to developments in Croatia have proof of this.
We owe it to the people in Croatia you and your government, that we fully support in the years to come, and we are very grateful to the honourable Member that he is recommending that we continue the path.
In this context, it is incomprehensible that in the spring of this year, thousands of supporters of the Laskar Jihad able to draw on the Moluccas too the conflicts.
To deny the return of the refugees to Timor militias and workers at risk.
On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should like to refer to just three points.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by Mrs Maij-Weggen Â­ Weggen congratulate on her excellent work.
In this respect, there is no exception.
Continued violence in the Moluccas, in Aceh and Irian Jaya bring great suffering on the people.
Tomorrow, it will be the formal presentation of the Sakharov Prize here.
As a result of recent reports from the Indonesian archipelago, however, the question is not whether the situation even worse, for President Wahid and its allies, is even prekÃ¤rer described by the rapporteur.
If we want to help Indonesia, then we shall have to do with money and do it now. Words alone are not enough.
I believe that on this point the report before us makes important information work.
It is obvious that the difficulties overcome the country not overnight.
Protection of the Communities' financial interests
The obstacles to its independent activity, especially in the personnel recruitment and in its institutional structure, must at last be removed.
The Commission must, therefore, by means of an internal reform process finally fulfil your announcement that fraud will not be tolerated and consistently pushed any fraud.
I think that we must also actually be the result of Nice.
We welcome the negotiations between the Member States on the approximation of legislation in the field of crime, but we wish to anklagebehÃ¶rde federal EU, none of our countries.
In addition, I should like to know why the publication of the document from the Commission on this subject to one day after the Danish referendum on the euro has been delayed.
I have requested that these countries naming because I think that it is time to put to you.
I am actually sure that OLAF is interested in the selection of more transparent management.
However, we must be careful that we, despite all the problems of the Commission not to focus on our own, which after all is quite considerable problems we also have problems.
We are trying to put out the fire on smoke and vague.
No one can understand, I too do not.
So that this objective will be achieved in every respect, I would like to highlight four issues which, in my view, take a leading role in the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control authority.
Parliament itself to the problem lies in the Treaty.
It is true, Commissioner, if the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, respect for the rights of Members must be mentioned explicitly.
He has the opportunity for a certain period of time, no money transfers, on the budget lines in question, particularly those which are on the increase in the funds earmarked in the budget with a view to further internal investigations have been carried out, and it can even to invite the President of the Commission to demand the resignation of the Commission Members in their environment, serious problems have been identified - a kind of EU kaiserschnitt.
The report calls for detailed inventories of operational activities, thorough reviews of budget lines and irregularities and internal Commission performance assessment.
Commissioner, the starting point for the provision of information to the European Parliament is of the EC Treaty and not to the interinstitutional agreement.
The result of this common position, if it is not, however, it would be that we would be changed at the end of the day, not only in relation to America, but does not even have any waffengleichheit within Europe.
I do not know why this is not possible, as is the case for all the other directives in the end have managed to put together a compromise.
It is a proposal which, I am afraid that the long and rapid way to overcome some of the problems that exist.
The first amendment relates to Article 4, in which the issue of the competent authority for the offer.
The proposal before us now, on the other hand, would cause confusion and a search for the best in each case and potential legal streite during the adoption of a company with a very sensitive time.
In the UK, by the adoption of committee during takeovers voluntary code of conduct verordnete excellent, and it is a good example of how, with a very complex matter, for which there is a legal regime and less well, can be dealt with in a pragmatic way.
It is far more important, however, that it is possible to set in Lisbon was the task of creating a competitive and dynamic European economy forward.
It is for us here in the European Parliament at the end of the day, the large areas of tension in the adoption of legislation, for example, their directors versus shareholders, companies versus small shareholders in a mindestform capital market versus European rules.
Through a number of amendments proposed by Parliament, the text of the common position of the Council, improvements to the points that could lead to difficulties of interpretation, and also called for more rapid implementation of the directive.
After all, it is not clear that the proposed definition of a good price is better than another, because the various currently in force in the Member States of provisions are all very significant.
The debate is closed.
In addition, the artists who granted a right of information within a period of up to three years in a professional art dealers find out what is sensible, because it is on the rise and sales of paper.
It is therefore asked the Austrian legislation, and not the European legislator, the only for artists and auction houses positive framework conditions.
In addition, the issue we are discussing, the need for a common position, because only the bigger one that will allow the European Union to be strongly at international level to ensure that the interests of artists in the world are protected.
I trust in the wisdom and far-sighted vision of this House.
In 1998, the only advantage of 7,000 274 artists in Germany, which have had their rights by the resale right concession, with 40% of the amount to which erhebungs and administrative costs.
In short, there is no need for harmonisation in this area.
A similar amendment was rejected at first reading.
We have assumed that the translations, despite this very closely and difficult schedule could be provided.
We are only now that this is, unfortunately, that we can no longer postpone.
We in the committee have proposed to do this by one year.
This Parliament supported these values, and will it continue to defend.
As a result of the technological and modified markets will inevitably bring about a change to take place.
We can find no legal basis with competition.
The core of the reduction of the postal sector, of the universal service, and to the promotion of postage by an weight limit of 50 grammes would seriously for the national postal operators, the risk of not sow the seeds of universal service at a reasonable price for the whole of the population in all regions.
I should like my colleagues of the Conservatives in this House the mess remind you, which anrichteten them in the UK, when they want to privatise the British Post Office.
From the safety net for the postal customers, we have a suspension carpet for these large companies, the rest of the post and continue to do what they can still be permitted.
I am very pleased with this result, because the special services in connection with the new technologies to exclude from the scope of the universal service.
Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, that we can and will not tolerate.
The Commission therefore proposes for the second phase of the complete liberalisation of postal services.
I would also like to see such a future for other countries in the European Union.
Mr Bolkestein has recently in the Dutch press, the French position was accused of a unliberale title at least a newspaper article.
In this regard, Spain could say something about such a fund, which has been set up, and has taken, i.e. it could be the uncertain legal bases of the Fund to the virtual criteria, its composition and the discretion of decisions in its application.
I hope that tomorrow we will be voting in favour of the amendment tabled by Mr Atkins or by Mr Sterckx, because otherwise I would have led me to vote against this report.
In this competition Royal Mail is involved in MalmÃ¶ and distributes my letters, Sweden.
From the debate what have we learned from the controversy, or rather the Commissioner Bolkestein, with its follow-up to the liberalisation of the postal services in the absence of any assessment of the first stage and in breach of the provisions of the directive has caused rules? we have learned that, under the guise of progressive and aufwertender terms - such as modernisation, liberalisation or support of technological recovery - the dismantling of social quality of one country can hide.
The planned, protection of the universal service by setting up a compensation fund, on the private operators contributions to the financing of the universal service obligations of the postal service providers in remote areas, will not be there.
These shortcomings and have also contributed to this late in the debate and for that purpose often be confused.
Madam President, in dealing with this subject, we talk of economic and social cohesion.
Madam President, allow me first of all to the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, of course, to congratulate him, because he has carried out a complex, difficult work, in which he had to seek the balance between very different proposals, attitudes and to find points of departure and objective.
I fear that the result will be that the current monopolies its position at the taxpayers' expense and further consolidate the yardstick for new service providers can set higher still.
I am pleased that our liberal party friends from the other European countries, the position of the British Liberal Democrats support.
I believe that liberalisation is desirable in itself, and welcome the advantages for consumers who will arise from it.
Because it was justified in the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union, which fits the completion of the internal market by the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment is.
The provision of such a service is the cornerstone of Community policy in this area, and all our activities are aimed at improving the service.
The special services are a further important area in which innovation and modernisation must be promoted.
He also said that he thought that the opening up of practically the entire postal market by the end of this decade for inevitable.
I want to make is that the obligation to provide a universal service in the future too, once and for all, and will be guaranteed laid down.
For this reason I can or will not, however, remain indifferent to the future of this sector, because we are at stake, the tasks entrusted to us all in Lisbon was not properly implemented.
Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.
However, I would remind you that the main objective of this common organisation of the market their products is a guarantee for the Community market access.
Fortunately, at the end of the day, we were able to achieve unanimity in the Committee on Agriculture: I should like to thank my colleague, Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, for your support.
We have to continue to, for example, our concern over the banana production in certain ACP countries, in the countries of the West Indies and small producers of West Africa, in some countries, the traditional suppliers in the banana market, and whom we have commitments that we must not forget.
I therefore ask that this report in its entirety, just as, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, is supported by the Members of this Parliament.
The USA had originally rejected the historical reference periods, in the meantime, however, is a solution with own historical reference periods.
Strong interests, especially those of the Americans, who are themselves, but which do not banana growers American capital into the commercial enterprises to have a role to play.
Sometimes it seems as if the Commission on the proposals on deregulation, in trade and in agricultural production on an international level we even further away than the Cairns Group.
Unfortunately, the Commission and the Council have decided on a solution here, which may jeopardise this production, particularly after 2006.
In the various WTO decisions, it does not mean that we do not give our traditional countries from which we supply ourselves make preferences.
The transitional period should therefore around fifteen years at least ten years, however, and we also need the compensatory income guarantee for Community producers and the marketing of production in the outermost regions, which include the institutions will therefore also includes those who produce bananas marketed.
I hope that you are now listening to our arguments, because the proposed by the Commission, the tariff preference system, even if it is set at EUR 300, could prove to be quite ineffective is, in actual fact, because the ACP producers by the so-called greyhound ausgebremst procedures.

(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
The Commission is unable to accept the other amendments.
Before the vote:

Most smokers are neither on the full risk nor about the consequences of their actions.
I have in my long parliamentary life 35 years from now always.
However, I fear that this hope has been in vain.
This is our last attempt, by means of labels and photographs on cigarette packets to illustrate the actual consequences of smoking.
Lehne report (A5-0368 / 2000)
This is a view which I still relevant and correct, and, therefore, I have voted against the report in its entirety.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market, is absolutely right when he, on the rejection of the maximum limit and insists on a minimum amount, which are not covered by 7%.
With your vote against this directive, my group would like a political marker in this respect too, as we in the European Union should not superfluous provisions.
Of course, the former Stalinist dictatorship must be condemned, but also Mr Putin, how can we trust the slightest bullies, that of the Chechen people, this godparents of various Mafia organisations, the Head of State, any opposition and civil society (trade unions, political parties would like to remove), to strengthen its own power?
Indonesia is, in fact, would not deserve such intensification of relations, because over the past few years, not just of the leaders of that country with a high degree of democracy or the great merits, all well and good, but we must also bear in mind that the Indonesian citizens, which is why we have this intensification of relations and that assistance is to be welcomed.
Only this unity must deal with crimes have been committed by EU employees.
- (FR) the Theato report on the fight against fraud will allow us to state that the European Central Bank, certainly for the better proof of their much-talked-about independence, accession to the agreement on the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has not regarded as well.
That concludes the vote.
We must appreciate that there are only two options: either we include, or we do not belong to that end.
Ladies and gentlemen, please let us no reason to change the name.
But the tariff only system is an important element, which provides for the balance of the Commission 's proposal and represents an important basis for it in the Council, so that we can make any progress at all.
Measures for the marketing of these bananas are to be found in the national and regional programmes, in addition to promoting the development of the countryside.
Europe and the United States in defending our common values are working closely together.
We will probably also have a new WTO round and the effects of the many new bilateral trade initiatives at this WTO round, which is currently being discussed in the American hemisphere.
He pointed out that the transatlantic relationship in the last ten years has been considerably extended to the Americans, in particular, the efforts of President Clinton. But I do not think that one day in the history books will note that these new relations with Europe, too, with the 1990 Transatlantic Declaration and the transatlantic agenda under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995, has made an important contribution to the success of this relationship, which play a key role.
This is, therefore, important to set a new course, and indeed a transatlantic agenda for the year 2001.
I would like to finish with the statement made by representatives of the dominikanischen Republic quote: "the WTO should initially be an impartial arbiter for ensuring that the common rules are observed and that the countries with the free world trade.
Secondly, while we are on the decline of the Communist in graphic terms, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but it is only one superpower left, namely the United States.
I know that he has an excellent and very constructive dialogue with Parliament and the committees involved with in these matters.
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
The main objective of these objectives, and the secondary objectives, will be the test, with the specific proposals put forward by the Commission must be judged.
As you know, could such a solution - setting up in one country with possibility of the provision of services across the Union, as an avalanche in those countries with a lower taxation.
Although it was not fall below the normal rate of 15%, but the Member States would be given the right to one or several minimum rates applied by no less than 5%, and it is now planned derogations in this case.
We called for the Commission to monitor to make sure that there is no distortion of the market and that the Council and Parliament should be informed.
In short, the purpose of this proposal is the right one, but the method is wrong conceived, and if we really want to support the electronic economy, then Europe would be a VAT exemption of our own e companies and not the attempt, our problems to other transferred to the right signal.
The demands for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, we need to be able to meet all kinds of measures to take their limits.
The only case, where there has been no tax, is the if from a third country will be delivered in the European Community.
Positive discrimination of air transport must be brought to an end.
Companies from third countries, on the other hand, are not taxed.
As regards CDs are not very old-fashioned, but should be taxed on the Internet, while available programmes should be exempted from tax.
However, the proposed solution is not technically feasible and as a barrier to the development of the Internet transactions in the European Union, despite the fact that all the expansion so.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the Union, and are losing their ergiebigkeit toothless.
We must think of ways to how we can promote the electronic commerce and we do not think up new methods, such as we are able to levy taxes.
The Liberals represent the principle of 'as little as possible' state, with the USA as an example.
The Primarolo group has drawn up simple rules that will have to be implemented.
As an objection is which I represent in this Parliament Group believe that the fact that the newspapers should be corrected in the prescribed normally be constrained VAT rates, while the reduction is not applicable to the digital newspapers.
A tax on kerosene, it can therefore only be in the international consensus to guarantee a level playing field.
I particularly welcome the fact that the report is one of the most important of which I have in my report for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which has made statements which this Parliament a few months ago, namely that we supported, so long as there is no doubt that is difficult, politically, an international agreement on the taxation of aviation fuel, at least in the short term, should examine alternative instruments to achieve the same effect, including the emission levy.
The industry will actually be 100% levy by air traffic control and airport charges for their infrastructure costs, which amounted to USD 4 billion in 1998 - in contrast to other modes of transport, such as rail and road transport, which is still heavily subsidised.
The present situation is prejudicial.
Unfortunately, in this context, we must, however, say that there is a problem with the emissions from air transport, even if it is not so much a percentage, but it is very strong and that is why we should not talk down there.
This plan for the development of SMEs will be harmful within and outside the Union, particularly in the light of the proposed reduction of the threshold for a derogation from the tax on an unacceptable low levels of the turnover of 40,000.
If we are now to beflissen issue for Europe, we in fact important future of electronic commerce.
The starting point, according to which a service provider based in a third country, which provides a customer in the Community, only to a single opportunity to register need, must not be allowed to become a shift from tax revenues between the Member States.
Since the debate in the Council is still under way and, amongst other things, in view of the attempt by the Commission to put the issue of VAT and electronic commerce in the short term to bring to a successful conclusion, it seems to me at the moment, the most positive element, the amendments proposed by Parliament, but not yet formally to accept to try to provide you with regard to the discussions in the Council to get as much as possible.
I can therefore not accept the proposed amendments.
I would like to thank you very much for this week, that you have adopted all these different issues.
The Commission, for its part, has only three months after the accident and its responsibility, a first package of measures adopted by the European Parliament on 30 November has been fully confirmed.
It is, in fact, with more than 15 existing directives or regulations, the urgent need to harmonise practices and greater control of the application of the Community rules, with a view to carrying out the emergence of considerable and unacceptable differences in the field of maritime safety in the European Union.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her sustained efforts in the field of maritime safety.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that, when it comes to safety in the air transport sector in the European field and in the field of the USA applied in other countries, is not in keeping with the compensation amounts applied.
Secondly, I would like to say that it is the French courts, which would have the possibility to confiscate the money to freeze or a particular company or other, to pay compensation for damages, which could set a liability on the amount of the objective criteria, which goes beyond the current international system on pollution caused by mineral oils.
The Commission is of the opinion that these steps in the right direction and will lead to the creation of equitable tax systems, with incentives for a more rational and more efficient use of the road network.
In the light of the criticism, especially from Ireland and France, and now to obtain this amendment by the British Chancellor of the matter with a completely new phrase: it is now as a consumer levy for all, including British lorry drivers,.
I am obliged to ensure that the food available to consumers, whether they are from the European Union or from outside, the highest standards.
I certainly understand the concern of the honourable Member.
Commissioner, I have to say that, sadly, your answer is not enough.
The point raised by the honourable Member is very important.
In Nigeria, from the Group of the ijaw Chevron accused, violence against this people angestiftet Nigerian soldiers and even to have paid warri demonstrators at the naval base to bomb.
In its report, which was adopted on 15 November, the Commission came to the conclusion that the operating aid, in accordance with Regulation 1540 / 98 preispraktiken does not solve the problem of the South Korean could be found.
I believe that the intentions in their entirety are very reassuring, but the reality is that our shipyards in the meantime.
Question No 38 by (H-0868 / 00):
Commissioner, I can understand that you do not want to change its decision, despite the fact that ten Member States reject such a customs.
This initiative is based on a Council regulation on amending the regulation, which lays down the current GSP.
I represent a number of sugar beet growers and I am therefore very concerned.
This work will take place in the committee, and they had to cancel this week, there is a balkanreise Poul Nielson.
We are currently in the safeguard clause, and if Mr Clegg arguments for the talks with its sugar beet may be needed, anbauern board at any time.
I should like to thank Mr Liikanen for his very positive in every respect and helpful reply.
I will discuss this matter with my services, as soon as the question of the budget for the coming year has been clarified.
My services and I are now trying to bring the from the geographical distance between the parties and the future Court to limit the consequences.
In the same way as the courts in DÃ¼sseldorf, Munich and elsewhere on the patent law in Germany - and there are also specialise in London, such a specialised courts should also meets a court of the Community, and the number of cases relating to Community patents very specific.
So that such a provisional situation, the Commission has not verstetigt in a letter of 13 July last year, the Member States of their duty to national Community trade mark courts.
As the honourable Member knows, submitting a complaint is not impact on the progress of the project.
Question No 47 by (H-0877 / 00):
The Commission is therefore of the legal means at its disposal only in the terms laid down in the regulation.
The question is, however, to whom the students, must be able to ensure that the following this course, and his conclusion in Britain them the right to recognition of their studies results.

The whole of this can also be seen as a competition issue, as, in the southern Baltic, Stockholm and Helsinki on the tax free sale - are allowed to continue, whilst it is banned and Vaasa between umea.
We must take advantage of this situation and to encourage and support it, because that is the correct multi-lingual content for the success of European content industry is absolutely vital.
In particular I would like to deal with the problems that small businesses do not always provide sufficient guarantees and investors can draw on a sound business development.
The ambitious project of this European eContent programme to a successful conclusion to the planned procedures must be simplified and must be ensured.
There must therefore be objective of public support for the Community 's content industry, there is also a high level of education and a cultural diversity.
On the other hand, there are the communication networks, which are dependent on the content of their virtual area inexorably to fill it, in turn, but it is, of course, that you submit to buy up the content of the production and without special rules to be able to use.
Mr President, I welcome this programme, eContent very much and would like to draw attention to two points.
I therefore support the amendments in which the implementation of specific measures in the field of new technologies.
Firstly, with regard to the social and cultural function of digital content: that the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament is the social and cultural aspect of digital content.
Assessment and management of environmental noise
In fact, I am grateful that the Christian Democrats and also some of the Liberal Group, that a specific amendment by aircraft noise is already have to be supported.
Only now, six years later and stetes pressure from the French Government, in its proposal, the Commission has put forward for European harmonised noise indicators.
This is a modest proposal; in the Scandinavian countries apply stricter standards than they are already being proposed for the year 2012.
Orly, shiphol, Barcelona and other airports already meet strict standards.
Another important point, which has been tabled by us, and in connection with the issue of aircraft noise will be important, is that, in addition to which the rapporteur referred to give additional noise indicators noise indicators.
As there are no common standards in the European Union, it is a clear distortion of competition between airports and unequal behandelung of citizens of different Member States.
That is why my colleague, Bernd Lange amendments tabled, in my view, is so important.
Mr President, first of all, I have to say that I welcome this report.
This was in principle the idea of Amendment 36, although I believe that this idea is not yet ausgedacht once and for all.
That is something that we should be very carefully and then, at both levels combined approach of emission limit values for the various sources and, on the other hand, quality standards for emissions.
We need more time, and I regret that we did not have this, although I broadly support the framework directive.
Once the Member States have comparable data, the Commission will put forward on the issue of the Community, limit values and other measures to reduce the noise, and will then report to the Council and Parliament.
Food additives other than colours and sweeteners
These are the three criteria.
Thank you very much, Mr Onesta, I feel the same way: they have a dry mouth, and I have a frosch in the hals with us, as we say, but there is a little the flu.
Furthermore, chronic food problems increase the risk of cancer.
At the time, can also be seen that the Commission does not have the right instruments to take appropriate measures in place.
The next stage is already tomorrow on the plan and then Mrs Paulsen, sitting in the saddle by the Group of the European Liberal and has the opportunity to make improvements to the present directive even further.
The Member States and the Commission is now a better instrument available to ensure that the Community rules in the field of animal nutrition to be properly enforced and the commitment of emergencies in third countries is a rapid response.
We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities, and, in particular, to date, they have been dealt with these issues.
The planning process must honestly and innovative.
The multiannual programme 2000-2004 for sustainable urban development is a suitable tool, and the implementation of Agenda 21 constitutes an excellent means of coordination and implementation of measures.
Less transportation and the withdrawal from fossil fuels at local level is essential if we are to be a change in the current climate threat.
Many people have believed that the financial framework is too small.
Within this framework, the main partner, but the Commission and the networks of the local authorities, which for the preparation and implementation of the measures in the field of sustainable urban development, legally responsible for it.
The Court of Justice of the Communities, and even the WTO dispute settlement sgremien are of the opinion that the precautionary principle in the field of the environment, or in the field of public health point of view can be felt even against the Europeans, such as the fact that procedures to raw milk cheese.
Harm reduction or compensation must not be the intention, our primary objective must be to damage to the health of human beings or possessions.
In 1996, the European Parliament has already approved in accordance with the precautionary principle a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in the whole of the European Union - we have only...
Absolute scientific safety on new substances and products does not exist and will never be.
If the precautionary principle is to be used in an efficient and credible, it is important that all the key stakeholders, including representatives of civil society in the political decisions taken in the context of the application of the principle is involved.
And, finally, the public health and the environment from other considerations, particularly economic, take precedence.
The basic conditions for the use of the precautionary principle is that the fear that there could be a scientifically justified, damaging consequences.
Only yesterday, an American professor George like the Food and Drugs Administration in the last seven years, with a study into the impact of radiation on human health entrusted informed in Lisbon, there is a risk that the use of mobile phones, the incidence of Alzheimer 's disease tumoren brain damage and skin.
Mr President, the environment and public health are like a complex machine with many roles, monitor and control so that we can intervene, so that there may be no bad things happen.
With regard to the application of this principle must be prevented in any case that the innovation and economic activity, to be hampered restraint and inertia in the industry, and that competition will be circumvented.
The House will be aware that the Commission, with most of the issues raised in your motion for a resolution.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 o 'clock.
In Article 2 will be confirmed, and the right to life, when the terrorism in Spain, human life is calling for the whole of the European Union feel violated in one of its fundamental principles.
We want the institutions established legally, not replace, but our rights and our freedoms, without giving in to protect the terror.

A deadline, the postal services to modernise and develop their services and to facilitate the planning and investment.
They will continue to exert pressure on the distribution of the money they earn above the 150 gramme level to strengthen their position.
The liberalisation of the postal services in the terms proposed by the Commission is neither sensible nor in a uniform manner, which is why I voted in favour of the report and all the amendments have been voted in this direction.
De Roo report (A5-0378 / 2000)
We are also voting against Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31 of our reservations, because we are not convinced that they are compatible with the rules of the WTO.
Against a globalisation which rides roughshod over the most basic human rights.
This would be contrary to respect for the national identity (Article 6 (3) of the Treaty on European Union).
It must be emphasised that the linguistic minorities through globalisation, the Internet is not lost; it is a cultural and economic opening up new possibilities.
Mr President, in the absence of other results, the haggling in Nice at least the intentions of the protagonists, laid out in the European Union.
Underlying tenor of the joint motion for a resolution on this matter is far too one-sided.
The delay in the publication of the written conclusions after four days - even now - not yet officially available shows how difficult it is to decisions which have been taken in a general confusion, clear to put down on paper.
The only way to avoid conflicts of dangerous for the future is to remain in the traditional concept of Europe in which, based on mutual respect for national communities.
The Nice Summit on Sunday has come to an end with an agreement which should culminate in a draft Treaty.
The motion for a resolution to the vote today reflects this not to Nice.
Finally, on the issue of social policy which France in the presentation of his presidency wanted to tackle it is now the fine declarations of intent and that, in addition to the content of vague documents which, in view of the problems that exist, and the great dissatisfaction by the workers, and this has also been clearly expressed in Nice are quite inadequate, with a handful of details.
The really important issues - such as taxation, taxation, social policy, asylum and immigration - has remained the same everything.
In the debate on Nice impressive, the idea that the Treaty has not even father, mother and baby nobody - it is the French Presidency, instead of falling in beating about the results of the Intergovernmental Conference and the reasons for this.
On the contrary, the influence of national democracies, because the right of veto is being restricted and the European Parliament more power.

Given that zero risk does not exist, or at least the politicians, the scientists have to apply the criterion of proportionality, uncertain risks and assess their responsibilities.
This Parliament has been fighting for that, but also for the innovative measures, this reduction in the funds available will be compensated for by making use of the flexible framework, set out in a statement on the financial perspectives.
Everyone must in this very important area, since it is a role in this truly global market in which we now have to finance new ideas and provide a realistic, valid right - to ensure that our place in Europe at the top of the list of technical development in the new industries and, in particular, in the communication technology.
On the question of the budgetary resources are in the previous speech already serious words: EUR 400 million are in fact only a minimum for funding, and in the second half of the opportunities offered by the flexibility instrument could be used for additional funding, as described in the report.
This must, in my view, as the report also concludes that it is not automatically the loss of European added value.
As we all know, the level of unemployment in the European Union, in the most economically and technologically less developed regions, especially in the Objective 1 areas, the innovative measures must not only technological ones, but also of the strong will be supported, the economy and employment.
If I may return now in my own region, after eastern England, and note the fact that not a single local authority in the last time this money, then, I doubt whether we are as effective as we would have to be in the future, so that we can welcome new communities.
Mr President, I would like to start by Mr Helmuth Markov, for his constructive and very detailed statement on the draft communication on innovative measures under the ERDF for the period 2000-2006 and pay tribute to thank him.
Energy efficiency and environmental issues have their place in these guidelines, and you can cause for innovative actions to the third point, the regional development and sustainable development.
However, we would like to ensure that these projects are selected at regional level, as Mr Berend nous has understood very well in his speech.
The debate is closed.
We would therefore call in this report and in the three amendments which have been tabled, the Commission in its efforts to an international disputes procedure, before the WTO.
It seems to me that the Commissioner with regard to the industry must show that it is making every effort to this external threat to our industry.
Finally, we hope that the Convention bau-Ã¼bereinkommen ship at the meeting of the group 6 of the OECD will be discussed on 18 December.

When the medical report in the countries of the besitzers - in other words, by the British press was distributed, the seriousness of the disease was not became known, but in a different access to move an amendment to the classification of hospital.
