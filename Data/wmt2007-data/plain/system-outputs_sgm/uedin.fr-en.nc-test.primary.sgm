<seg id=1> The racial house divided Europe</seg>
<seg id=2> The extreme right in Europe is characterised by its racism and its use of the issue of immigration as divergence policy.</seg>
<seg id=3> The Lega Nord in Italy, the Vlaams Blok in the Netherlands, supporters of the National Front of Mr Le Pen in France, are all examples of parties or movements trained on the subject of the aversion to immigrants and the promotion of policies simplistic to monitor them.</seg>
<seg id=4> While people like jorg Haidar and Jean-Marie Le Pen can go and (never too early) come racial, the question will never be European policy in the near future.</seg>
<seg id=5> An aging population and the borders of increasingly open imply a growing racial fragmentation in European countries.</seg>
<seg id=6> The mainstream parties of the centre left and centre right have met this perspective in applying the sand, hoping against all expectations that the problem will vanish.</seg>
<seg id=7> This is not the case, as clearly demonstrates racial history of America.</seg>
<seg id=8> In the US have attracted race relations for decades, and have cornered always - the political scene, to the point that the racial divisions are as important as incomes, if not more, as determining factors of preferences attitudes and policies.</seg>
<seg id=9> The first step to address the issue of racial policy is to understand the origin and the consequences of racial animosity, even if it means the discovery of unpleasant truths.</seg>
<seg id=10> This is precisely the aim pursued largely by research teams in economics, sociology, in psychology and in political science in the US.</seg>
<seg id=11> This research shows that the representatives of different races are much less confidence with each other; whites are less inclined to support social welfare spending which, according to them, the minorities; communities more fragmented racialement governments have less efficient, a corrupt and influence peddling most important, higher crime and less productive public goods per dollar imposed.</seg>
<seg id=12> This does not mean eliminating the heterogeneity and create racialement communities homogeneous, but it is necessary to recognise the reality of these problems to begin to develop a strong public policies relating to racial relations.</seg>
<seg id=13> Of course, the Americans repudiate the methods to be used.</seg>
<seg id=14> Some pronounce themselves in favour of action programmes affirmatifs offering to minorities of preferences in the allocation of employment, the admission to university and public contracts.</seg>
<seg id=15> These policies are seen as a way to offer of reparations for past wrongdoings and, more importantly, create role models and overcome the remaining discrimination and perhaps involuntary.</seg>
<seg id=16> Others are protesting against affirmative action and support a policy that does not race, associated with the policies of the free market and family values pro enough to create jobs for minorities and help not to separate black families.</seg>
<seg id=17> This last point is crucial in any policy because one of the most significant causes of poverty in the US is the dissemination of lone parents (understand mothers) in the Community.</seg>
<seg id=18> Whatever the right answer, the question is that the determination of steps in the race represents a dominant problem in American politics.</seg>
<seg id=19> Of course, minorities have progressed towards more integration and economic success.</seg>
<seg id=20> In the 1950s, the dark could not sit down at the before buses, today two of the main players of American foreign policy are blacks.</seg>
<seg id=21> We cannot deny that American politicians right-wing continue to deploy the ‘ race card 'as a tool tactics.</seg>
<seg id=22> Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, who won the former assistant Nixon and Reagan presidential candidate who has brought independent during the last election.</seg>
<seg id=23> He recently published a bestselling book entitled ‘ the death of the West: how dying immigrant populations and invasion imperil our country and civilization. "</seg>
<seg id=24> But for every book like this, there are other ten which contain a serious analysis of the question racial in America.</seg>
<seg id=25> The analysis and political debates on race relations have a considerable delay in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=26> At best, the issue is examined closely in terms of immigration quotas and restrictions borders, not in terms of opportunity and social problems created by a Europe increasingly racialement mixed.</seg>
<seg id=27> Of course, a clear immigration policy is necessary to prevent the accumulation of illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id=28> But we must not stop there: border controls in Mexico does not mean the end of the US policy on the internal problems of race!</seg>
<seg id=29> Europe is rich and its population ages quickly: Europeans, strengthened by programmes generous social assistance, are no longer prepared to accept 'dirty', say, in agriculture and the leather sector.</seg>
<seg id=30> This attitude is unavoidable increased immigration.</seg>
<seg id=31> However, Europeans are quick to criticise the US to the failures of their policy towards minorities and for all manifestations of racism on the other side of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id=32> Reading the European press is often appear sound superior to the US on issues racial: they (the Americans) have problems with racism; we are unaffected against him, with the exception of skinheads neo-Nazis mad and their counterparts.</seg>
<seg id=33> What has happened in recent weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, racial demonstrates that the problem in Europe is deeper and, as in the US, because the sad truth that racial relations are inherently difficult and that confidence and a cooperative behaviour do not travel on the racial lines.</seg>
<seg id=34> If the mainstream parties of Europe not undertake more seriously to understand the racial tensions that exist in their countries and for placing 'race' at the centre of their priorities, individuals such as Le Pen will always try to fill the gap with their message of hatred.</seg>
<seg id=35> The exception Française combat</seg>
<seg id=36> The attention of Europe today is any tour and with regard to enlargement and the Constitution being negotiated between the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=37> However, the result of several spats Gallic with the European Commission will be no less important to determine the fate of the new enlarged Europe.</seg>
<seg id=38> France has unilaterally chosen to ignore the Stability and Growth Pact leaving run its public deficit beyond the limit of 3% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=39> The French like to talk about a rational rigour of their thinking, but where budgets are concerned, Descartes is no longer and confusion done its entry.</seg>
<seg id=40> France was one of the main criticism of Ireland when, in 2000, the Irish Government undercut its budget surplus, who was then to 4%, that a simple 0.5%.</seg>
<seg id=41> Other countries have not respected the Stability Pact, but France is the first country with a small smile satisfied openly contemptuous.</seg>
<seg id=42> None of this should not surprise.</seg>
<seg id=43> France is European regulations that apply to the usual deep-rooted consider its own culture as an exception.</seg>
<seg id=44> Thus France opposed systematically veto any reform of the common agricultural policy of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=45> As everyone knows, the CAP is a fine gift offered to European rich farmers (particularly French farmers) that do not deserve, at the expense of farmers in difficulty of developing countries and of European consumers.</seg>
<seg id=46> France is also trying to go back to the old policies to boost private companies in deficit and on the verge of collapse and to public money.</seg>
<seg id=47> The European Commissioner for competition, Mario Monti, cannot lose this battle: it needs the support of those who believe in the markets and equal treatment for all.</seg>
<seg id=48> History is simple.</seg>
<seg id=49> The French Government plans to bail out Alstom, a company which has developed high-tech products, including the TGV high-speed train, French, but who recently is bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id=50> The French government proclaims that never abandon its rescue plan for Alstom, a plan which has all the usual dirigiste motives: maintaining employment protection of investors, etc.</seg>
<seg id=51> Moreover, insofar as Alstom is a company of high technology, the French Government plays the map of research and development, because investment in R & D is beneficial to growth.</seg>
<seg id=52> Save Alstom by nationalising the company is obviously a mistake.</seg>
<seg id=53> The company is made up of various units, some profitable, other bankrupt: it is clear that it must abandon it.</seg>
<seg id=54> Units profitable, such as the TGV, will easily buyer; the deficit units must be closed down.</seg>
<seg id=55> French taxpayers' money would be better spent on the costs of conversion of temporary workers rather than to sustain a company which is not profitable.</seg>
<seg id=56> It is important that the European Commission will not be able to France to obtain laws for itself in the policies on competition, as it seems to be doing with the budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=57> The Commission must condemn public funding of private companies in France as it condemns the European state subsidies in any other Member.</seg>
<seg id=58> The Commission has already had some success in this area, particularly in forcing Germany to cancel the government guarantees state-owned banks.</seg>
<seg id=59> Alstom in particular France and in general must not be an exception and must meet the same standards.</seg>
<seg id=60> If the Commission does not act, the European Union will even more to a playground for the French officials.</seg>
<seg id=61> France has already taken the lead in the European Union's foreign policy with its Foreign Affairs Minister Dominique de Villepin, and which is increasingly a Foreign Minister of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=62> At the same time, France ignores basic regulations common economic policy and government aid to private companies.</seg>
<seg id=63> The European Commission lose the credibility that it has finally resemble a district in Paris less important?</seg>
<seg id=64> On the question of losing Alstom would have serious repercussions in Europe and not just for the policies on competition.</seg>
<seg id=65> The war for oil</seg>
<seg id=66> For decades, both republicans that democrats pursue the same objectives in the field tanker: to maintain stability as possible oil prices, reduce smoothly domestic consumption, reduce the dependence linked to imports and diversifying sources of supply.</seg>
<seg id=67> Despite appearances, these objectives are always the same today, under the Bush administration.</seg>
<seg id=68> Many observers believe that with the invasion of Iraq, Bush has chosen a different path.</seg>
<seg id=69> A significant increase in the production would probably Iraqi oil dependency of the US.</seg>
<seg id=70> The price of a barrel of oil will probably with the emergence of a new source of supply, hence increased dependence on us, particularly in relation to the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=71> It is ironic that the US had more control of Iraqi oil in the context of the 'oil for food' programme against the UN before the war (then it was the UN and not Saddam Hussein who set the level of Iraqi exports) that they will not be able to do in the context of a future democratic Iraqi state.</seg>
<seg id=72> If the Bush administration sought oil supply sources stable, secure diversified and cheap, it was sufficient to lift the embargo against Libya, Iran, Iraq and Sudan and leave spilt oil.</seg>
<seg id=73> But America's interest for Iraqi oil is not dictated by the economy or by energy policy.</seg>
<seg id=74> The Bush administration has recognised that the Iraqi oil is primarily a geopolitical asset.</seg>
<seg id=75> Who controls Iraqi oil, control Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=76> Saddam has had its power to the fact that it controlled the second world oil reserve.</seg>
<seg id=77> He knew perfectly well what it were to black gold.</seg>
<seg id=78> Faced with the possibility of the invasion and defeat, it has threatened to set fire to Iraqi oil fields.</seg>
<seg id=79> The desecration and looting of Iraqi oil and gas pipelines shows that almost everyone has understood that control oil is control the country.</seg>
<seg id=80> During the preparation of the invasion by the US, the securing of oil fields was a priority.</seg>
<seg id=81> The aim was not an increase in supply or lower prices on the American market, but the overthrow of Saddam and replaced by a new government.</seg>
<seg id=82> Iraq's future is linked to oil production of the country.</seg>
<seg id=83> But given the vagaries of the oil market, especially in a situation as unstable, we do not see how the Bush administration will achieve its goals in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id=84> The problem is simple.</seg>
<seg id=85> The US must use the oil revenues to alleviate the financial burden of the Iraqi regime change based on American taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id=86> In the long term, any reconstruction plan depends on the ability of Iraq to export volumes important oil.</seg>
<seg id=87> If Iraq does not produce oil, President Bush cannot keep the promises it made to the Iraqi people, the American people and the international community.</seg>
<seg id=88> Before the invasion, Iraq was a productive capacity of three million barrels of oil a day.</seg>
<seg id=89> But it can return to this level of production in the time allotted to establish an Iraqi government.</seg>
<seg id=90> Increased production requires the development of oil installations, which requires substantial investment, a government in place and political stability.</seg>
<seg id=91> Nobody, not even the Bush administration, expects that these conditions are met soon.</seg>
<seg id=92> Political stability is the precondition to increase production capacity.</seg>
<seg id=93> The experience of Iran, Kuwait, Russia and even of Iraq, shows that we have to around three years of political stability before production capacity can increase significantly and sustainable.</seg>
<seg id=94> It will take several years for Iraq to develop a new Constitution, establish a democratic government, negotiate the distribution of oil revenues between the various regions, regulate investment and make the economy attractive to investors.</seg>
<seg id=95> He must also time to negotiate with multinational oil companies and neighbouring countries achieving feasibility studies and necessary technical studies and reconstruction, rehabilitation and the exploration of its oil fields.</seg>
<seg id=96> Also, even a period of 3 years seems optimistic, because this means that during this time the occupation, the Iraqis are setting up their own government and an end to the political instability.</seg>
<seg id=97> But the reality is likely to be very different.</seg>
<seg id=98> Enormous tensions cannot survive for years.</seg>
<seg id=99> And it would not be surprising that the Iraqi oil production interrupts is brutally, even with a democratic government.</seg>
<seg id=100> History shows that the strikes and social unrest which can occur more easily disrupting oil production in a democratic context that under a dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id=101> If Iraq is unable to increase its oil production in the next few years, this will be a thorn in the, both for foreign policy for energy policy of the USA.</seg>
<seg id=102> How could finance long-term reconstruction of Iraq?</seg>
<seg id=103> Who will pay for the maintenance of a fragile democracy in Iraq?</seg>
<seg id=104> The US could maintain their occupation of the Iraqi people without ensuring food, medical care and other basic services?</seg>
<seg id=105> These are difficult issues, and we cannot respond before a democratic regime does not guarantee control and Iraqi oil production.</seg>
<seg id=106> Let the killers defend human rights</seg>
<seg id=107> If it was not so sad, it would be the grim joke millennium: Libya has been elected to chair the UN Commission on human rights!</seg>
<seg id=108> When caligula appointed his horse in the Senate, the horse, at least, had not blood on its hooves.</seg>
<seg id=109> Of course, the procedure was perfectly legal: the presidency changes every year of a region of the world to another.</seg>
<seg id=110> This year, was to appoint the President and Africa has appointed Libya.</seg>
<seg id=111> Only the US and Canada have voted against.</seg>
<seg id=112> Shame has infinite, the European countries have abstained.</seg>
<seg id=113> This speaks volumes about moral bankruptcy nations that this Vienna decision at a delicate moment for this organisation.</seg>
<seg id=114> President Bush has defied the UN express their serious about their own binding decisions on Iraq: otherwise, they can suffer the same fate despicable that society of nations, which has proved impotent in the 1930's when it has been faced with the aggressive policies Nazi Germany and Italy fascist.</seg>
<seg id=115> The election of Libya to chair a United Nations body responsible for ensuring respect for human rights currently contributes nothing to support the legitimacy or the moral authority of the world body.</seg>
<seg id=116> Remember that Libya is a totalitarian tyranny; its leader, Muammar Ghaddafi, combines a sometimes changing behaviour policies extremists by supporting the dictators of the world.</seg>
<seg id=117> It leads one of the most tyrannical regimes in the world, in which there is no travesty of election and where the opposing views are instantly suppressed.</seg>
<seg id=118> Under his reign, Libya supported the terrorist organisations of the world, the IRA to many groups Palestinian extremists.</seg>
<seg id=119> It still faces the UN sanctions for the role it has played in the attack on a flight Pan Am Lockerbie above, Scotland, ten years.</seg>
<seg id=120> Over the last decade, the position of the United Nations as a symbol of the ideals of a peaceful world community has regularly been undermined.</seg>
<seg id=121> They have proved totally incapable of stopping the war in the Balkans; and in at least one case, Srebrenica, Dutch forces to the UN peacekeeping remained here and attended the worst massacre of post-war Europe while the Bosnian Serbs around 6 000 Muslims slaughtered defenceless.</seg>
<seg id=122> A committee of inquiry later Dutch admitted that the Dutch battalion UN was, in fact, accomplices in this war crime.</seg>
<seg id=123> In Rwanda, when the genocide began, the UN representative responsible peacekeeping operations ordered the evacuation of the UN forces of the country, leaving the door open to genocide the bloodiest since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id=124> The name of this UN representative is Kofi Annan.</seg>
<seg id=125> It is a past depressing and pathetic that the United Nations, probably trying in vain to buy coming in the Iraq crisis, as the voice of reason and international legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id=126> But at a time when the UN inspections in Iraq resemble the sending of the Salvation Army to remove a bunch of gangsters, it may be that the election of Libya at the top of the Commission of human rights remains an historic date, the definitive failure of an organisation whose creation had raised immense hope.</seg>
<seg id=127> The organisations do not usually die, and certainly, there are too many reason of State not to ensure that the United Nations will continue to be an obstacle.</seg>
<seg id=128> But they will be a mere shadow of what they should and could be.</seg>
<seg id=129> The United Nations today give the hypocrisy a bad reputation.</seg>
<seg id=130> Supporters of the authority are</seg>
<seg id=131> Last Thursday, the judges of the Court of central Jakarta in Indonesia were sentenced to one year in prison.</seg>
<seg id=132> I am guilty, in my capacity editor of tempo weekly newsmagazine, according to the Court, slander against tomy winata tycoon, a affairs, for having understood its possible involvement in a fire in the textiles market of South-East Asia in Jakarta and of instigating riots in disseminating lies.</seg>
<seg id=133> My case, and other cases présagent-ils once again the end of a short democratic experience in Indonesia?</seg>
<seg id=134> "The riots' which I instigated occurred in March last year, when almost 200 calls of winata thugs attacked the tempo offices, threatening inflaming the building, pressing the staff and injuring a journalist.</seg>
<seg id=135> To try to resolve the situation peacefully, I was convinced to negotiate the Bureau police Jakarta Central and découvris, horrified, that the leaders of the clique took power to the police station.</seg>
<seg id=136> I was struck by fist and footing while the police forces engaged do.</seg>
<seg id=137> Fortunately, many journalists have come to our rescue with magnétophones cameras and for registering these events.</seg>
<seg id=138> The spread of these images launched public outrage forced and Parliament to open a public inquiry.</seg>
<seg id=139> Those responsible for the national police and police in Jakarta were called and, because of strong pressure from public opinion, the leaders of this clique were charged.</seg>
<seg id=140> However, winata échappa himself to the police investigation by saying simply publicly that its own way--assisted by extensive supporters without informing and without her agreement.</seg>
<seg id=141> It brought by the complaint itself against Ahmad taufik, the author of article, teuku iskandar Ali, the editor and myself.</seg>
<seg id=142> The hearings of the trial durèrent a year was marked by a series of developments suspects all in favour winata.</seg>
<seg id=143> Firstly, the dossier mounted by the police and the prosecutor contained obviously forged documents if that the police inculpa two officers.</seg>
<seg id=144> But the Court rejected our request for suspension of hearings until the clarification of the legality of the dossier of Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id=145> The case against the officers involved seems to lead nowhere.</seg>
<seg id=146> On the contrary, one of them has been promoted to the head of the new anti-terrorist unit Jakarta that has been created (and is funded by the United States).</seg>
<seg id=147> The other, they say, has been referred to school police to receive specialist training.</seg>
<seg id=148> Then, after six months hearings, the main judge suddenly panel of the three judges was promoted to take the head of a local court an hour Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id=149> One of my lawyers noted that 35 years of practice to the tribunal, he had never seen a judge main be replaced underway.</seg>
<seg id=150> In fact, despite its promotion, the judge continua to preside over another matter in the same building.</seg>
<seg id=151> A judge who in the past had ruled against tempo at the civil proceedings brought by winata came to replace him.</seg>
<seg id=152> Finally, winata during his testimony, presented a false testimony denying have been interviewed by pace.</seg>
<seg id=153> A registration of a telephone conversation was circulated during the hearings, the journalist realizing the maintenance and the two authors who assistèrent témoignèrent under oath, the telephone company mean the official documents attesting to this telephone call as proof of its existence and experts attestèrent that the voice of registration was that of tomy winata.</seg>
<seg id=154> However, the judges rejected the request of the arrest of winata tempo calling for it to be tried for wrong and we conseillèrent testimony to complain to the police, something that we have made.</seg>
<seg id=155> The justices were then rejected our request for postponement of the decision of the Court until the matter false testimony of Mr winata will be tried.</seg>
<seg id=156> Given all these defects form, my condemnation and my prison sentence are hardly surprising.</seg>
<seg id=157> But I am very hopeful to win in the end when the appeal of tempo will be challenged before the upper bodies.</seg>
<seg id=158> The Indonesian higher courts are more respectful of ethics and the director of the Supreme Court is a defender of democracy and freedom of expression. The tempo could well become a decisive step for our democracy, just as the decision of the US Supreme Court in the case of the New York Times against'Sullivan.</seg>
<seg id=159> Having noted the tolerance threshold in the accusations against defamation, this decision has enabled the American press call those responsible to account of public affairs.</seg>
<seg id=160> No country knows better than Indonesia that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are indicators tested democratic development and penalising journalists is one of the first symptoms of authoritarianism.</seg>
<seg id=161> Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the 1950s, before the muzzling the press by President Sukarno helped the military junta in 1956.</seg>
<seg id=162> Any criticism was stifled, the consolidation of power without against power was easy, and in July 1959, Sukarno could determine the beginning of enlightened "democracy".</seg>
<seg id=163> During the first few years after the fall of Sukarno in 1966, all the benefits of real democracy, including freedom of the press, were restored (except for the Communists).</seg>
<seg id=164> Yet the regime of President Suharto pursued in the muzzling the press in the early 1970's, by suspending various newspapers and imprisoning many journalists.</seg>
<seg id=165> The press gagged, other political rights and democracy were quickly violated Indonesian disappeared again.</seg>
<seg id=166> Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the first democratic Muslim community of history.</seg>
<seg id=167> Free, fair and peaceful elections were held twice for the parliamentary election and the direct election of the President, including the last presidential elections, proving the co-existence possible between Islam and democracy.</seg>
<seg id=168> The enemies of democracy, however, are based ever.</seg>
<seg id=169> The extremist Islamic groups have wallowed in bomb attacks without distinction, while the authoritarian tendencies groups said to have been a breakthrough in the near the President Megawati circles.</seg>
<seg id=170> But Mrs Megawati has just lost the recent presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id=171> The newly elected President susilo, continue to persecute journalists?</seg>
<seg id=172> My condemnation, and the trial and condemnations of other journalists, means the beginning of the end of the third Indonesian democracy if hard won?</seg>
<seg id=173> The answer lies in the support that the Indonesian democrats will generate activists domestically and internationally.</seg>
<seg id=174> Losing Indonesia, torch potential activists hope of all democrats in the Muslim world, would be a terrible defeat.</seg>
<seg id=175> The moral of the death penalty</seg>
<seg id=176> Often accused us their refusal to abolish the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=177> Many claim that the abolition of the death penalty is a necessary condition for establishing a civilised system of criminal law.</seg>
<seg id=178> The Nobel Prize-winner Gary Becker is not the opinion.</seg>
<seg id=179> European governments are resolutely opposed to the death penalty -- the European Union completely forbidden, and some Europeans believe that its use in the United States is barbarism.</seg>
<seg id=180> In fact, many European intellectuals think that the death penalty, and death in general, do not deterring criminals.</seg>
<seg id=181> But, while Europeans, with crime rate well below those in the United States during the last half-century, have long afford a certain 'soft' to most of the crimes have seen their crime rate increase sharply over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=182> On the contrary, the American rates fell in part thanks to the increased use of punishment.</seg>
<seg id=183> Capital punishment in fact part.</seg>
<seg id=184> I am for the implementation of certain persons accused of murder because, and for this reason alone, I believe that this prevents other murders.</seg>
<seg id=185> If I was not convinced, I am opposed to capital punishment for revenge and other motives possible must not serve as the basis for a public policy.</seg>
<seg id=186> Serious empirical research on the death penalty in the United States began with a study of ehrlich Isaac, published in 1975 in the American economic review.</seg>
<seg id=187> Some studies that followed sometimes have discovered a deterrent effect weaker, other much stronger.</seg>
<seg id=188> However, the information available is limited, it should not be based its conclusions solely on the econometric evidence.</seg>
<seg id=189> Of course, public policy in terms of punishment can hope evidence perfect.</seg>
<seg id=190> But even with the limited quantitative evidence available, the good reasons to believe in deterrent power of the death penalty are adequate.</seg>
<seg id=191> Most people, and the murderers in particular, have fear of death, especially when it follows quickly and almost inexorably perpetration of a murder.</seg>
<seg id=192> As the David Hume said about the suicide, "no man has never rejected the lives that it was worth living.</seg>
<seg id=193> That is our horror … "natural death, schopenhauer believed that" when the horrors of life reach the point where they exceed the horrors of death, a man puts an end to his life.</seg>
<seg id=194> But the death terrors which were opposed considerable resistance... "</seg>
<seg id=195> Opponents of the death penalty often declare that the state has no right, morally, to take the lives of anyone, even the most murderous reprehensible.</seg>
<seg id=196> Yet it is a conclusion quite wrong for who thinks that the death penalty is deterrent.</seg>
<seg id=197> To see why, suppose that for every murderer executed, (instead of, say, to be sentenced to prison for life) the number of murders should be reduced to three, which is a figure well below that of ehrlich and other estimates of the effect of deterrence.</seg>
<seg id=198> This means that for every murderer not yet implemented, three innocent victims will die.</seg>
<seg id=199> In fact, the government "would 'indirectly many lives if he did not use of the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=200> Save three innocent lives for each person executed seems a very attractive market, and even two lives saved by execution seems a cost-benefit ratio persuasive in favour of the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=201> We must agree, however, that the argument in favour of the death penalty is becoming less clear-cut when the number of lives saved every execution fall.</seg>
<seg id=202> But even if one lives were saved whenever, the market can still be desirable if life saved is much better than life eliminated, which is generally the case.</seg>
<seg id=203> Many people are protesting to the idea of compare the qualities of life saved and that is deleted.</seg>
<seg id=204> Yet I do not see how to avoid such a comparison.</seg>
<seg id=205> Take the case of a career criminal wheel and killing a victim who led a life correct and leaves several children and a partner behind it.</seg>
<seg id=206> Suppose that it is possible to save the life of an innocent victim executing a criminal of this kind.</seg>
<seg id=207> It seems obvious that save the lives of such a victim must weigh more heavily than take the lives of criminal.</seg>
<seg id=208> Of course, all cases are not as clear, but a comparison of the qualities of the individual lives must be part of any reasonable social policy.</seg>
<seg id=209> This is also why the death penalty should be used for the murders and not for less serious crimes.</seg>
<seg id=210> When it comes to choose between take lives and, for example, reduce the number of private goods, the theory of the more benevolent punishment is far more powerful.</seg>
<seg id=211> Although serious aggression, including some appalling rape, approaches sometimes murders in their seriousness, and might call the death penalty, I am not for its use in this type of case.</seg>
<seg id=212> One of the main arguments in the death penalty murder is the 'deterrence marginal. "</seg>
<seg id=213> If the attacks were punished with the death penalty, it would the aggressors to kill their victims not to be discovered (which is a major reason for that the severity of punishment is proportionate to the seriousness of the crimes).</seg>
<seg id=214> One of the complications could be, however, that a murderer will fight with greater determination to avoid being caught, which could cause more deaths.</seg>
<seg id=215> But, while deterrence marginal is important, I believe that the murderers resistance to their catches, sometimes at the expense of their own lives, represents a truly indirect evidence that criminals fear the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=216> Of course, the risk to execute the innocent worries me.</seg>
<seg id=217> My support for the death penalty faiblirait much if the rate of implementation of innocent people was also important that many claim.</seg>
<seg id=218> However, I believe that the appeal trial in the United States provide protection enormous, not against the wrongful convictions against executions unjust, which means that there is very little or no cases executed people which it has been proven that they were innocent.</seg>
<seg id=219> And this situation has been immensely consolidated by the development of the identification by the DNA.</seg>
<seg id=220> I say again that the debate on the death penalty is a debate on the power of deterrence (which can be reduced by calls for too long).</seg>
<seg id=221> I can understand that some are skeptical before the existing evidence, although I think they are wrong about this and the good sense of the problem.</seg>
<seg id=222> It is very disturbing to take the lives of someone even in a murderer, but sometimes extremely disagreeable acts are needed to prevent behaviour even worse causing the deaths of innocent victims.</seg>
<seg id=223> The people against Putin</seg>
<seg id=224> I contributed to the choice of Vladimir Putin to replace the first democratically elected President Boris Yeltsin.</seg>
<seg id=225> Since the KGB such structures and the Mafia run today Russia and manipulate the judicial system, it is accepted that Yeltsin wanted to choose its successor to avoid prosecution.</seg>
<seg id=226> But we who have chosen Putin, were responsible for finding a successor able to continue the reforms initiated by Yeltsin, and not someone who protect the him and his family.</seg>
<seg id=227> Yeltsin did nothing to fear and did not have in its own survival, but to the survival of the democratic idea that he had introduced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=228> This idea is now threatened by the successor that we have chosen.</seg>
<seg id=229> I do not seek to deny responsibility for support Putin.</seg>
<seg id=230> We were not cozy friends, but he and I worked together in critical situations, and I have never doubted its sincerity.</seg>
<seg id=231> Putin is that its convictions.</seg>
<seg id=232> The problem is that his convictions, particularly the belief that Russia can prosper only if it is headed by a single source of power, are wrong.</seg>
<seg id=233> And this gross error is conducting Russia to his downfall policy.</seg>
<seg id=234> Of course, no one can take a great responsibility misunderstandings, without making the same fundamental mistakes, and this is particularly true when times are confused.</seg>
<seg id=235> Yeltsin was not exception, but he acknowledged its mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=236> When he withdrew 31 December 1999, he apologized for having triggered the war in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id=237> Putin, by contrast, seems unable to acknowledge and recognise its mistakes, and still a policy long after its failure becomes apparent in the eyes of the world.</seg>
<seg id=238> One of the errors of Yeltsin was its failure to put the moral priorities in his reform programme.</seg>
<seg id=239> Russia should have repent Stalinism and the system of gulags.</seg>
<seg id=240> The entire nation, without exception, should have repent, as Germans did since 1945.</seg>
<seg id=241> This failure account, because it has allowed the faith unconditionally Putin in the central authority leads to a new catching the state by the security services.</seg>
<seg id=242> Indeed, a direct result of repentance national should have been the ban of the Communist Party and the disqualification of all political post of those who have worked for the KGB.</seg>
<seg id=243> Even if such policies are not sorting simple in post-communist societies, where victims and staff were so many, and the border between the two sometimes so vague, a viable solution could be found, as in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id=244> The choice of do nothing has left Russian security structures unscathed and able to make their return on the political scene, what they have received today.</seg>
<seg id=245> The political structures resurrection KGB under Putin, and their efforts to silence the despised, have again transformed Russia in a country transfuges.</seg>
<seg id=246> It is impossible to silence the politicians and the independent media without stifle independent financial sources, which is why the Kremlin of Putin has concentrated its attacks on the so-called "oligarchs."</seg>
<seg id=247> The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his trial have been orchestrated for this reason.</seg>
<seg id=248> Eliminating the independent financial sources, the security services that dominate the Kremlin hoped destroy independent political life in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=249> Without bases of independent thought, it is a climate of fear which is fostered.</seg>
<seg id=250> But fear is not only degrading, it fails to govern.</seg>
<seg id=251> Yeltsin had intuitively understand that fear and centralised decision-making top-down and could not be the right way to run a modern country, and it was therefore insisted reform relations between the citizens and the state.</seg>
<seg id=252> Putin still does not understand that a centralised political system is also unable to understand and correcting today than it was at the Soviet era.</seg>
<seg id=253> In the absence of a solid education, Putin is, quite frankly, taking Russia to the same disintegration that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet state.</seg>
<seg id=254> The people are beginning to see it.</seg>
<seg id=255> It notes that Putin's desire to create a strong and effective modern state cannot be achieved, because a modern state is not governed the upper hand, but informed citizens by forcing their leaders to recognize and correct their mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=256> Putin, too, seems suspect the powerlessness of his regime.</seg>
<seg id=257> This is one of the reasons that have made Russia aggressive with its neighbours, Ukraine and Georgia, and that the drive to maintain a military presence in places like Transdniestria, the secessionist region of Moldova.</seg>
<seg id=258> By imposing itself in neighbouring regions of Russia, the Kremlin thinks that he can persuade the Russians of his omnipotence.</seg>
<seg id=259> Given that the debates in Russia are châtrés and that the Kremlin is able to manipulate the elections, regime change is the only solution that remains to preserve the idea of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=260> It is pointless to hang on to the illusions.</seg>
<seg id=261> Those who oppose Putin must decide what they want and announce that if the regime fails to uphold the Constitution, they have the right to the force by all means.</seg>
<seg id=262> Today, the question of power in Russia can no longer decide to the polls.</seg>
<seg id=263> As in Ukraine, Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan, it will decide in the streets.</seg>
<seg id=264> (svp saddle and spend)</seg>
<seg id=265> Excessive taxation can blunting the encouragement and impede growth.</seg>
<seg id=266> But insufficient taxation can also produce the same effects.</seg>
<seg id=267> Governments with a tax revenue meagre may not provide the essential public goods.</seg>
<seg id=268> Worse still, tax revenue weak in the poor countries often results from defects inherent in tax recovery systems (rather than tax rates low), which also encourage not productivity.</seg>
<seg id=269> India illustrates the importance of a well thought-out tax system.</seg>
<seg id=270> Has Bangalore, high-tech companies built campuses grasslands world-class extant are flawless and communication networks of high-speed data.</seg>
<seg id=271> Outside these CAMPUS, however, extend sewage open, of waste collected and not of roads in a state of collapse.</seg>
<seg id=272> While technology firms instantly of téraoctets transmitting data continents away, local transport advance at a rate almost medieval.</seg>
<seg id=273> Therefore, companies to exploit their own Bangalore bus services, sous-traitent with private providers for drinking water, and install generators to protect themselves against their power failures.</seg>
<seg id=274> The state cannot plug this disaster because it is bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id=275> The Government of India debt exceeds 70% of GDP so that more than half of its tax revenue is spent on the reimbursement of interests.</seg>
<seg id=276> But debt is not the excessive expenditure in the past.</seg>
<seg id=277> India's government expenditure represent around 15% of GNP, against an average of about 40% of the GDP of the OECD.</seg>
<seg id=278> The financial difficulties India have instead for a tax system ill-conceived and badly managed.</seg>
<seg id=279> The rates and the rules for income tax individuals and businesses appear sensible in view of international standards.</seg>
<seg id=280> However, the Government of India perceives of income taxes representing just about 3.7% of GNP, roughly half of those South Korea and other Asian tigers.</seg>
<seg id=281> Agriculture in India is about a quarter of GNP, but even the rich farmers do not pay taxes.</seg>
<seg id=282> Export businesses in the software industry and in other industries have temporary tax exemption on their profits, although their employees pay taxes on their personal income.</seg>
<seg id=283> Despite reasonable rates, tax fraud is commonplace.</seg>
<seg id=284> Fraud is explained by the fact that the government has not invested in the staff or to discover the recalcitrant taxpayer systems, which are rarely in prison and who can often get out of paying bribes when they are caught.</seg>
<seg id=285> More subtly again "," direct flight taxes on income and benefits reflects disorder inherent in the system of indirect taxes levied on 'consumption and production.</seg>
<seg id=286> Excise duties account for more than 60% of indirect taxes India, which in turn the same proportion of its total tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id=287> The basic excise duty has been set at 16% of the value of the production of a company.</seg>
<seg id=288> Then follow different cuts, exemptions and surtaxes.</seg>
<seg id=289> For example, a rate of law "conditions favour" 8% from categories as food products, spirits, the son of cotton and computers.</seg>
<seg id=290> A "right" another special excise 8% from products which include filaments in polyester, cars, and tyres conditioners.</seg>
<seg id=291> A "excise duty another" (not to be confused with the "special excise duty") is deducted from "products of special importance."</seg>
<seg id=292> The exemptions excise duties are many and complex, including companies with annual incomes total below 10 million of rupees and companies in certain areas choppy or backwardness.</seg>
<seg id=293> In general, the exemptions fall into 70 broad categories, in themselves sous-divisées 259 entries, 52 conditions and 7 lists, each containing many elements.</seg>
<seg id=294> The exemptions incite abuse.</seg>
<seg id=295> For a certain amount, officials located at the bottom of the hierarchy, which show a discretion exemplary in the implementation of the conditions, can be encouraged to interpretations favourable.</seg>
<seg id=296> Products imposed with high rates (for example, the Granite Poli) are sold as products imposed with lower rate (for example, as Granite unpolished).</seg>
<seg id=297> Fraud on excise duties is more contagious than tax evasion on profits and incomes.</seg>
<seg id=298> If a company fraud excise duties and that the rate of taxation is higher than the margins before taxes in industry, its competitors must also cheat simply in order to survive.</seg>
<seg id=299> While fraud increases, governments take additional 'or' rights' special "who incite greater fraud.</seg>
<seg id=300> The perceptions of direct taxes also suffer.</seg>
<seg id=301> The bribe destined for the tax man excise duties for a classification favourable, the difference between the value of Granite polite and unpolished, and the omission registration of real income create fund 'black "which cannot be declared on forms of declaration of income.</seg>
<seg id=302> In addition to weaken the ability of the state to provide essential public goods, systems to escape the indirect taxes discourage businesses also to adopt technologies more productive, which requires technology involving a large-scale deployment.</seg>
<seg id=303> But as indirect taxes can be more easily circumvented by deploying several small units instead of one great unity, it is impossible to make economies of scale.</seg>
<seg id=304> It is important to note that in the software industry, where all units are to tax-free indirect Indian companies operate on a scale effective.</seg>
<seg id=305> India could follow the example of China, a country in which the rationalisation of indirect taxes in 1994 has prepared the ground for a great boom?</seg>
<seg id=306> Or the governments of the coalition in a vigorous democracy are unable to such reform?</seg>
<seg id=307> Last year, the government led by the BJP India has enacted legislation authorising considerable cuts in the budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id=308> Then he appointed a working party to make the necessary changes to the policies of public spending and fiscal policies.</seg>
<seg id=309> In July, the working group has proposed to increase taxes (rather than reduce expenditure) by removing the majority of exemptions of indirect taxes, amongst other things.</seg>
<seg id=310> The new government led by the Congress of India also seems to promote these proposals.</seg>
<seg id=311> If the Congress and the opposition parties, they will help much to support the country's economic growth and to dispel the idea that democracies cannot take the necessary measures to encourage development.</seg>
<seg id=312> What is the problem with Turkey?</seg>
<seg id=313> On 16 December, Orhan Pamuk, one of the most famous authors Turks, will face a court of Istanbul. It must respond to the charge of "insult to national identity" to be called for an open discussion on genocide by 1.5 million Turks and Armenians in 1915 today.</seg>
<seg id=314> Pamuk faces three years in prison.</seg>
<seg id=315> The efforts of Turkey to impose fines and prison sentences those who go beyond the official framework convince me that I was right to oppose the opening of negotiations on the accession of this country to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=316> In December 1999, the European Council gave Turkey candidate status of the EU, which meant that Turkey would in the Union at a future date not yet set.</seg>
<seg id=317> Subsequently, the Council asked the European Commission to decide before October 2004 if Turkey met the political criteria for accession, which include democracy, the rule of law and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg id=318> This decision was one of the few taken by the Commission of Romano Prodi, of which I was a Member.</seg>
<seg id=319> Among his 30 members, 29 said that Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the criteria to continue.</seg>
<seg id=320> I was the only dissident.</seg>
<seg id=321> It is the report by the Commission on Turkey, prepared by Günter Verheugen, then responsible for enlargement of the EU, which has led my decision.</seg>
<seg id=322> This report mentioned that in 2003, approximately 21 870 Turks have asked for asylum in the EU, including 2 127 have been accepted.</seg>
<seg id=323> In other words, the EU governments themselves have admitted in 2003 that the Turkish government had persecuted over 2 000 of its own citizens.</seg>
<seg id=324> In the meantime, the Commission published a progress report on Turkey believing that the continued reforms, although at a slower rate, under the government to Islamic moderately orientation of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id=325> But this report state serious doubts: the human rights violations, including the practice of torture continued; the military influence were too big, freedom of expression was not universally observed; non-Islamic religious minorities and cultural were victims of discrimination and violence against women had not a sufficiently strong opposition.</seg>
<seg id=326> The situation has not changed much since discussions about accession started in October.</seg>
<seg id=327> Beyond the persecution Pamuk is currently the victim, the unacceptable behaviour abound.</seg>
<seg id=328> In March 2005, the police is strongly intervened in a demonstration celebrating International Women's Day.</seg>
<seg id=329> In May, the largest trade union teacher was banned for having supported the education of 14 million Kurds in Turkey in their own language.</seg>
<seg id=330> It is undeniable that intolerance reached to the heights of Turkish Government.</seg>
<seg id=331> The Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül recently cancelled sharply a press conference in Copenhagen when he saw a journalist Kurdish in the public that the Danish refused to escape.</seg>
<seg id=332> Such acts and of such attitudes justify largely my disagreement in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id=333> But even if these shortcomings were corrected, Turkey should not be permitted in the EU, because this is not a European country.</seg>
<seg id=334> Christianity, the féodalité, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, democracy and industrialization have made us Europeans that we are, but they did not Turks what they are.</seg>
<seg id=335> Therefore, I am not convinced that reforms in Turkey, implemented due to the insistence of the European Commission, would be continued after accession.</seg>
<seg id=336> I suspect that there would be even re-offending.</seg>
<seg id=337> Moreover, Turkey's accession would certainly that of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and perhaps Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.</seg>
<seg id=338> These first three countries are certainly more European than Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=339> Leaving aside the three Caucasus republics but including the successor states to Yugoslavia, it would give an EU of approximately 35 Members.</seg>
<seg id=340> What kind of a Union even?</seg>
<seg id=341> The EU is not merely a club friends.</seg>
<seg id=342> It is based on the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.</seg>
<seg id=343> The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties of the Union, must protect these four fundamental freedoms, which means that it must persuade, and sometimes if necessary force, Member States to change their legislation.</seg>
<seg id=344> Policies concerning alcohol in Sweden, the loi-volkswagen in Germany and discrimination against foreign investment funds in France are examples of which have made the Commission unpopular.</seg>
<seg id=345> But they were necessary.</seg>
<seg id=346> When I left the Commission, I had to hold back me a pile of 1 500 findings irregularities of this sort.</seg>
<seg id=347> In short, EU membership means accepting deeply incisive measures that affect the internal affairs of a state.</seg>
<seg id=348> This will turn out to be impossible with Members as disparate.</seg>
<seg id=349> The EU fall victim of what the historian Paul Kennedy called the "imperial surextension."</seg>
<seg id=350> It would dilute in an unacceptable way.</seg>
<seg id=351> It is for this reason that the former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing feared that the entry of Turkey leads to the end of the EU, and that is why the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: "Turkey's accession would be more than the EU could bear."</seg>
<seg id=352> But the strongest right to oppose Turkey's accession is a matter of democracy: the majority of the population of the EU there is simply not.</seg>
<seg id=353> The crisis Bolivian failure of Latin America</seg>
<seg id=354> Bolivia is not a typical countries of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=355> And if it were the Haitian disorders, it would be the poorest country in the Western hemisphere: it is even less stable Haiti as its history and its two hundred coups since independence.</seg>
<seg id=356> In a region in the past, but now strong indigenous dispersed and isolated, perhaps Bolivia is, with Guatemala, the only Latin American country where indigenous peoples represent the majority of the population.</seg>
<seg id=357> Its ethnic and its distribution topography generate autonomist secessionist forces and even threatening national unity provocative significantly more than anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id=358> And it is, of course, with Paraguay, the only country in the whole subcontinent denied access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id=359> It would be very little prudent to extrapolate the crisis that is currently experiencing Bolivia the rest of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=360> The generalisation would be far too simplistic: elsewhere, the institutions are much stronger, poverty, and particularly misery, was reduced and struggles of ownership of natural resources have generally been settled.</seg>
<seg id=361> Even in countries such as Venezuela, which has enormous reserves of oil and which has a nationalist government traditional in mind, the status quo had enabled the preservation of foreign investment during the almost eight years of government of President Hugo Chávez.</seg>
<seg id=362> Even if the existence of indigenous movement is a reality in many countries, since the Chiapas until the araucania "," of the Amazon until ayacucho, they have not asked any real threat to national integrity in any country of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=363> Thus, Bolivia do not live a crisis an omen, nor the eternal "domino theory, on which Lyndon jonhson and che guevarra believed both in the case of Bolivia, or even partially valid seems reasonable.</seg>
<seg id=364> However, the current crisis in Bolivia pointing the finger "the democratic deficit" afflicting Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=365> Elected leaders are failure for one reason or another in Bolivia, Ecuador and in Haiti.</seg>
<seg id=366> Democracy is failing or absent in Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua and is threatened pure one reason or another in Venezuela and in Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=367> None of these cases is to another and they are all different degrees of danger, destruction and reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id=368> It remains to be seen what can be done against this state of affairs, which contrasts hard with the encouraging prospects which prevailed until in recent years.</seg>
<seg id=369> At the last meeting of the Organization of American States held in very lauderdale, in Florida, the United States delegation has set a good idea provided by others and were simply enshrined in its support.</seg>
<seg id=370> History has begun two years ago when Dante caputo, former Foreign Affairs Minister Argentine, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) were responsible for preparing a report on democracy in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=371> Their conclusions indicated that an early-warning system of democratic crises in the region would help to generate certain actions before any loss of control, as is the case of Bolivia today.</seg>
<seg id=372> Mr caputo and the UNDP team had convinced the President of Chile, Ricardo Lagos, to take responsibility for the initiative and promote with several of its Members.</seg>
<seg id=373> What he has done without the initiative goes too far.</seg>
<seg id=374> In fact, the UNDP report on democracy in Latin America, published in 2004, the barely mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=375> The United States and the new Secretary-General of the OAS, Miguel insulza Jose, have relaunched at the meeting of the OAS in Florida, but it was killed by the reasonable fears Latin Americans convinced that it is action against Venezuela, associated with Latin Americans anachronistic fears on the violation of the sacrosanct principle of not intervention.</seg>
<seg id=376> Despite the inability of the continent to agree on the principle, the idea of an early-warning system deserves consideration.</seg>
<seg id=377> Today, the Community has probably little Latin American intervention on the situation Bolivia, and yet it is dangerous for everyone.</seg>
<seg id=378> Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and growers of coca leaf, is perhaps an honest democratic leader, a rather unwise, but its supporters are all absolved of any authoritarian will?</seg>
<seg id=379> Hugo Chávez is perhaps not Mr Morales and the other dissidents Bolivians, but Venezuela and Cuba are not tempted to meddle in the affairs of this country where guevarra che dead in the head of the guerrilla almost 40 years ago?</seg>
<seg id=380> The business community of Santa Cruz in Bolivia may not give following its threats of secession, but préfèreront-ils share the oil and gas reserves of their region with indigenous peoples rather than the Highlands of São Paulo Brazilian industrial?</seg>
<seg id=381> Before the events are extreme, perhaps it would be good if the OAS (and not the United States) to become involved.</seg>
<seg id=382> The region continues to need this participation, in terms of time, message and proper democratic platform, separate from the traditional American intervention and indifference usual Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=383> The decline of France?</seg>
<seg id=384> The French is notoriously sensitive, not to say on the defensive, about the stature of France abroad.</seg>
<seg id=385> The French State devotes a large amount to the dissemination of the French language and culture, but the French are painfully aware that the global position of their country is no longer what it was.</seg>
<seg id=386> In this context, it is not surprising that in the last presidential elections, the publication of a report by the European Commission saying that the economic standing France among the European countries was past the 3</seg>
<seg id=387> The OECD and Eurostat, the European body to meet these data, thought they had put an end to this aspect of the debate in demonstrating that France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain had all living standards roughly the same per capita.</seg>
<seg id=388> But the controversy on a much wider scale has not disappeared.</seg>
<seg id=389> Rumours concerned on the "decline French ’ have been reappearance with the marches of protest which took place this year against pension reform, growing disputes on fiscal policy with the European Commission and the bickering with America on the war in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=390> The book romancé not successful in France at the moment is a controversial written by nicolas baverez, France, which falls.</seg>
<seg id=391> The book baverez is full quotations from de Gaulle and Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id=392> According to the author, the latest achievements of France dating to the 1970's, with the rapid the TGV, and the Airbus.</seg>
<seg id=393> It severely critical Mitterrand and Chirac together by a ‘ common talent to win the elections and make France a loser. "</seg>
<seg id=394> The success of the book is in itself a sign of ‘ malaise. "</seg>
<seg id=395> But what type?</seg>
<seg id=396> The evidence degenerative made by baverez are not as convincing that he would like to think.</seg>
<seg id=397> For example, he mentions the exhaustion of industrial jobs as proof the most flagrant the decline in France.</seg>
<seg id=398> But the de-industrialisation is a reality common to all advanced countries.</seg>
<seg id=399> Indeed, France has in fact better than most of its rich competitors neighbours and, unlike Germany, the UK, or the US, it has maintained the same world market share in the industrial sector than it once held at the beginning of the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id=400> Furthermore, according to a more precise competitiveness and foreign investment, France has achieved excellent results in these areas.</seg>
<seg id=401> According to a recent report published by the Council of economic analysis direct investment in France are EUR 60 billion in 2001, nearly twice that Germany.</seg>
<seg id=402> French competitiveness costs has also improved (20%) in the last three decades, higher productivity counterbalancing the rapid growth of wages.</seg>
<seg id=403> But the heart of economic problems in the long term France is precisely the fear of the industrial jobs.</seg>
<seg id=404> France remains a strong industrial power in traditional sectors such as the automobile and aerospace, but it has been delayed in markets where innovative smaller firms disseminate new technologies.</seg>
<seg id=405> France, for example, devotes only 30 billion dollars per year in research and development of technologies, against 51 billion dollars for Germany, 98 billion dollars for Japan and 265 billion dollars for the US.</seg>
<seg id=406> In short, the analysis of baverez hand in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id=407> France has made a number of extremely important reforms on the last two decades: economic liberalisation and financial, the elimination of controls prices and currency, the end restrictions of credit, European liberalisation, the reduction of inflationary and trade deficits, the advent of the euro and forced globalisation companies in the country.</seg>
<seg id=408> The French malaise has certainly not been duped by these reforms.</seg>
<seg id=409> The problem of France has just what it has failed to recognise the new world which it is already part.</seg>
<seg id=410> French capitalism is dead and France fails to accept its disappearance.</seg>
<seg id=411> France must be the only country in which a Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, felt obliged to apologise having said on television that ‘ the state is not all-powerful. "</seg>
<seg id=412> There are several reasons to explain this schizophrenia French, but the most important of them is the political game of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=413> Until 1981, France was clearly divided between right and left.</seg>
<seg id=414> Since this period, administrations Mitterand and Chirac have more flexible approach by their side ideological in order to implement the difficult process of adaptation to Europe and globalization.</seg>
<seg id=415> A "shock therapy" to the Mrs. Thatcher two decades ago could forge a new political consciousness.</seg>
<seg id=416> But the transition slow and consensual reforms has enabled the French to live in a world and think in another.</seg>
<seg id=417> This state of affairs explains in large part the political catastrophe that exploded in the last presidential campaign, when the leader of the extreme right Jean-Marie Le Pen has reached the second round of the presidential elections to the outgoing Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.</seg>
<seg id=418> The rise of the extreme left, which gained 10% of the votes of this presidential campaign, is also of this political failure.</seg>
<seg id=419> France needs a political revolution far more than an economic revolution if it wants to come to accept the reality, especially the fact that the ‘ decline French ’ is a fear created by the French people.</seg>
<seg id=420> The value of European values</seg>
<seg id=421> European leaders have accepted the constitutional discussions which had ended in December following a dispute about the voting rights.</seg>
<seg id=422> These debates must of course lead to compromises, which cannot delay.</seg>
<seg id=423> Still clear what are the supposed objectives of the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=424> Two fundamental principles have led to European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=425> These two principles are at the crossroads of the philosophy, politics, the economy, and the sociology of law.</seg>
<seg id=426> For years, they have been an integral part of the legal and institutional structure of the European Union, in the Treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which quote in its preamble) and in the recent draft Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=427> In short, they are included in history and the ideals of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=428> But what is the real significance of these two principles?</seg>
<seg id=429> Take solidarity, which is ready to interpretations at least static: solidarity, which is only the distribution of income and wealth, and the broader concept of solidarity dynamic, which concerns the production of income and wealth.</seg>
<seg id=430> Post-war period in the history of European integration, the dynamic solidarity is strongly expressed during the first period, the European Coal and Steel, both in its economic development strategy (reconstruction) that in the Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome.</seg>
<seg id=431> This does not mean that solidarity dynamic was subsequently deleted: the European Monetary Union, for example, is this principle.</seg>
<seg id=432> Thus, although some countries have not immediately benefited from the euro, they have nevertheless accepted because they were convinced that it would have positive effects on the long term.</seg>
<seg id=433> In other words, the dynamic means solidarity encourage policies that encourage investment, innovation, economic growth and employment.</seg>
<seg id=434> However, as indicated GDP growth in the EU, solidarity dynamic has been shaken over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id=435> The gap between research and development is a particularly worrying.</seg>
<seg id=436> The implementation of the so-called Lisbon strategy of the EU, adopted in 2000 with the promise to create the most competitive economy in the world, is threatened by the growing importance given to the solidarity static, reflected in the high cost of social assistance and high taxes necessary to finance it.</seg>
<seg id=437> The primacy of solidarity static is due to an ageing population which, together with a sluggish growth, led structural fiscal imbalances.</seg>
<seg id=438> One of the greatest challenges posed in the future of the EU is to deal with the current predominance of solidarity static, which is geared towards the elderly, at the expense of solidarity dynamic, which favours the young.</seg>
<seg id=439> After all, the Union cannot allow current consumption continues to prevail over the investment needed to the future prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=440> Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity that his interpretation is twofold: subsidiarity vertical and horizontal subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=441> Vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of powers between the various levels of government and sovereignty: the EU, the Member States, the regions and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id=442> The application of this principle is the most well-known federalism.</seg>
<seg id=443> The European Treaties clearly express this vertical subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=444> But is it enough to include the emerging constitutional and institutional framework of the Union?</seg>
<seg id=445> The horizontal subsidiarity concerns accountability and freedom of human beings and on the social and economic powers.</seg>
<seg id=446> It covers the relationship between the state, society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=447> But society and the market have their own rights and their own sovereign States that are not granted by the state.</seg>
<seg id=448> The problem then arises: how to guarantee the autonomy of each Kingdom?</seg>
<seg id=449> One example of horizontal subsidiarity the internal European market, which has created a new type of economic freedom and increased competition between companies, eliminating the protection that national governments were offering.</seg>
<seg id=450> The horizontal subsidiarity means that in society and in the economic sphere, the state cannot violate individual freedom and responsibility, which must be respected at the highest possible level.</seg>
<seg id=451> It also means that a "higher power" must support whenever individual freedom and responsibility are not enough to achieve the necessary aims to human dignity.</seg>
<seg id=452> This support should be given using methods which promote the natural potential individuals, society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=453> But this is only possible if the role of the horizontal subsidiarity is clear, this was not the case in the European Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights or the work of the European Convention.</seg>
<seg id=454> In short, solidarity means today a redistribution rather than a growth (such as the current generation expresses solidarity with future generations), while subsidiarity concerns the distribution of political power rather than a careful definition of borders between the state, civil society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=455> At present, these two values are defined in order to promote the state.</seg>
<seg id=456> Indeed, the emphasis on growth market-oriented has often been identified with the values semi-étrangères of America.</seg>
<seg id=457> But these values are deeply rooted in Europe and they must be uprooted new.</seg>
<seg id=458> The EU must restore its economic vitality in pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity more balanced market-friendly and society, that diminish the socio-economic impact of the State.</seg>
<seg id=459> The public institutions must produce public goods (such as defence, justice and fiscal and monetary policy), society must offer social goods (such as culture, education and help the needy) and the market must produce goods (linked to profits, economic growth and employment).</seg>
<seg id=460> In the 21st century, Europe must review the value of these two principles (solidarity and subsidiarity), if it wants to achieve the objective historical integration: freedom and prosperity required to overcome the differences and the political divisions which led to the tragedies during the 20th century.</seg>
<seg id=461> This is the spirit in which must be drawn up the European Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=462> The politics of values</seg>
<seg id=463> The debate on the American elections has not yet steadfast.</seg>
<seg id=464> How President George W. Bush could obtain three million more votes than Senator John Kerry and afford a Republican majority in both houses of Congress?</seg>
<seg id=465> There is little about the answers, but two topics are recurring in many explanations.</seg>
<seg id=466> One of these issues is its personality.</seg>
<seg id=467> Time has our full of uncertainty and threat, citizens have placed their trust in a President they trusted rather than in a candidate who have not yet delivered.</seg>
<seg id=468> The second is that of values.</seg>
<seg id=469> The citizens have voted for a set of values rather than for specific policies.</seg>
<seg id=470> Indeed, some (it) are compatible with the policies of Kerry but have made their voices to Mr Bush because they felt ‘ comfortable "with all its attitude.</seg>
<seg id=471> It is clear that the United States are now deeply divided into electoral terms.</seg>
<seg id=472> A blue Ark of States (democrats), in the north and west extends around a huge area (red republican) at the centre and the South.</seg>
<seg id=473> Beyond the geographical division, the divisions occur at local level.</seg>
<seg id=474> The gerrymandering, this practice of retraçage electoral borders to promote a political party at the expense of another, is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id=475> Voters tend to moved into regions where the majority of the inhabitants share their values, be they republican or democrats.</seg>
<seg id=476> What are these values exactly?</seg>
<seg id=477> These are the values which deal, we said, "of God, arms and gays."</seg>
<seg id=478> Religion plays a role, particularly with the truths own to the Bible in the field of history of creation.</seg>
<seg id=479> The possession of a weapon is the ultimate test individualism and use of weapons in times of war has nothing to odious.</seg>
<seg id=480> Gays and other practices "modern ’ are rejected because among selfcentred.</seg>
<seg id=481> As the political scientist Andrew hacker recently said, "the candidature of Mr Bush was built forming a majority in giving 60 million voters the chance to feel well with themselves."</seg>
<seg id=482> Is all this phenomenon is an American or other trends elsewhere?</seg>
<seg id=483> A answers as to American phenomenon, the politics of values can of a majority today but is not general.</seg>
<seg id=484> Europe and other parts of the world are divided in the same way.</seg>
<seg id=485> Without doubt personality, and under the obvious political differences are also questions of values that have not yet been highlighted.</seg>
<seg id=486> However, differences traditional policies based on the disagreement about fundamental values play an increasingly important role in the elections.</seg>
<seg id=487> Prime Minister Tony Blair, for example, another leading facing an election in his country, plays the map of personality and speaks of policies, but is primarily a set of values of middle class.</seg>
<seg id=488> When he speaks of the "modernisation" or "to enter the twenty-first century ’, it achieves suggest a strange mixture but attractive change and stability.</seg>
<seg id=489> This leaves the opposition Conservative without any effective response.</seg>
<seg id=490> Even for the tax cuts and stricter asylum fail to make fly on the strings of the melody values that the Republican Party has managed to make the United States.</seg>
<seg id=491> The situation is the same in Germany, where the influence of the politics of values is even less.</seg>
<seg id=492> The debate, Germany, is still in its majority a political debate.</seg>
<seg id=493> If the opposition offers the government to negotiate the reform of social protection or, more recently, to combat unemployment, underlying the challenge is not in terms of values, but rather of competence.</seg>
<seg id=494> Yet, in the fields of traditional battles of the political debate English or German, or elsewhere in Europe, the clashs values threaten.</seg>
<seg id=495> The parties are fighting for those who can 'feel comfortable to their own place ’, but they do not might understand very well that this is only partly a question of policy.</seg>
<seg id=496> Religion will never be an important factor in European politics: the opinion polls show that religious practice remains one of the few main differences between Americans and Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=497> The weapons also occupy a different place in the minds of Europe: it is their absence that Europeans see as important.</seg>
<seg id=498> Europe is also undoubtedly a course of pacifist values.</seg>
<seg id=499> And the question of political correctness ("gay") also plays a far lesser role in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=500> Above all, Europe itself divides Europeans, as the 'national' question is present in all European States.</seg>
<seg id=501> It is a question of values inspired by fear.</seg>
<seg id=502> The citizens want to know where they stand and, in the wake, directed against the United States and Europe or against Europe and to their own countries.</seg>
<seg id=503> In any case, we leave the Kingdom of policies and even politics and are entering the area marécageux of symbols and myths.</seg>
<seg id=504> What, in any case, is the main danger that democracies face, because the politics of values is a dangerous development.</seg>
<seg id=505> It reintroduces the fundamental divisions of a society which the most beautiful democratic success was precisely to banish the fundamentalism of political life.</seg>
<seg id=506> A public debate must be a debate on the enlightened policies contained by a community of values.</seg>
<seg id=507> It is therefore essential to insist on this prime objective of the policy of freedom.</seg>
<seg id=508> The advent of the interest</seg>
<seg id=509> One swallow does not make a summer a single month normal growth and employment and price increases in the US does not mean that the Federal Reserve do fear more unease and economic deflation.</seg>
<seg id=510> But the time will come when interest rates as world will begin to increase the central bankers are preparing to resist the wave of rising inflation.</seg>
<seg id=511> When the time comes, whether this autumn, in 2005 or 2006, or in 2007, America and the world economy will face financial vulnerabilities of conducting the success of the last three years of monetary stimulation arresting the decline of production and shares unemployment.</seg>
<seg id=512> The short-term interest rates are surprisingly low: only 2% in the euro zone, zero just 1% in the US and Japan.</seg>
<seg id=513> Expansionary monetary policy has proved to be a success, but only after having led interest rates low levels historical and have convinced investors that borrowing costs remain at their current levels for a long time.</seg>
<seg id=514> The monetary stimulus has mainly been to increase asset prices: everything which produced a benefit dividends or rent becomes much more attractive, and therefore much more valuable in financial terms, when interest rates are very low and should remain so.</seg>
<seg id=515> This explains the considerable differences between the current real estate prices in the United States, the ordinary shares in New York, London and Frankfurt, and the obligations in the long term throughout the world and what should be conventionally, their fundamental values.</seg>
<seg id=516> What will happen when the central banks will begin to increase their interest rates?</seg>
<seg id=517> In 1994, the increase in interest rates in the short term has led to increased interest rates on the long term (and lower prices obligations in the long term) of at least twice the planned by the standard models that year.</seg>
<seg id=518> Interest rates peripheral economies of developing have also increased far more than the rate of the main advanced industrial countries.</seg>
<seg id=519> The first danger for 2005 and for the coming years, when the global interest rates rise, as is likely, is another wave of financial crises of emerging markets.</seg>
<seg id=520> For countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the record of the 1990s shows that the differences of interest rates can grow and capital flows reversed remarkably quickly, whatever the level of goodwill with which the representatives of the IMF and the analyses carried out by large banks see the policies of a country.</seg>
<seg id=521> The differences of interest rates of emerging markets are currently abnormally low.</seg>
<seg id=522> The international monetary influx of capital flows, the US aside, are not yet levels associated with a "irrational exuberance", but there is unlikely to happen before interest rates begin to rise.</seg>
<seg id=523> This perspective is alarming because if there is one lesson of the 1990s, is that nobody should overestimate the stability of international financial flows.</seg>
<seg id=524> The second danger stems from the higher values of the active in the main advanced industrial countries.</seg>
<seg id=525> The dominant mode of thought in the Federal Reserve, which I fully endorse, argues that the information technology revolution continues, that potential output in the US is growing always very quickly and that the output gap is relatively high.</seg>
<seg id=526> This means that interest rates will certainly remain low for a relatively long time.</seg>
<seg id=527> Moreover, confidence in the Federal Reserve is large, and the last remnants of the risk premium inflation of the 1970s leave no interest rates.</seg>
<seg id=528> Consequently, even after the levels of production are income to their potential level, will remain low interest rates according to the standards of the 1980's and 1990.</seg>
<seg id=529> All this is, of course, good news for those who hold assets such as obligations in the long term, actions and property.</seg>
<seg id=530> Indeed, the increase prices active in the long term was precisely what aspired lowering interest rates: make the bond, and particularly property owners, richer does, after all, a boost to expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=531> But the bad news is that, even if interest rates are supposed to remain low for some time, they will not remain so low indefinitely.</seg>
<seg id=532> The most important thing is that when interest rates go up, the values of the active fall.</seg>
<seg id=533> During these periods, and especially when the values of the active fall considerably quickly and that we discover fully the degree of competence of our central bankers in their main task: to reduce the financial volatility and promote economic stability.</seg>
<seg id=534> It is also during these periods that we discover how individuals who have obligations in the long term, of property or actions have not because they believe that the current prices are interesting with prices, but because their prices have increased over recent years.</seg>
<seg id=535> It is a crucial issue for political decision-makers because individuals who have bought long-term assets because prices increase indefinitely seemed are also those who sell as soon as the trend will be reversed.</seg>
<seg id=536> Above all, the US trade deficit foreshadows a mass instability in cases where asset prices in the long term should cut considerably.</seg>
<seg id=537> It is certain that the challenges arising decision-making of the economic policies of the world over the coming years diffèreront of those to whom they have faced since the collapse of the illusion of NASDAQ.</seg>
<seg id=538> The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous as those generated by a fall in production and the threat of deflation.</seg>
<seg id=539> But, as we have heard during the 1990's, this does not mean that the challenges ahead will be easier to resolve.</seg>
<seg id=540> The futures opposed America</seg>
<seg id=541> I recently discovered a fact interesting: American economists who take care of international finance and the macroéconomistes Americans who handle the domestic economy have very different points of view -- indeed opposed, -- on the possible consequences of American deficit.</seg>
<seg id=542> International finance economists believe that a financial crisis is possible, followed by a painful and perhaps prolonged recession in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=543> The macroéconomistes concerning the domestic economy instead see a next fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis but as an opportunity to accelerate growth.</seg>
<seg id=544> The macroéconomistes who examined the domestic economy generally consider the situation as follows: at some time in the future, foreign central banks will be less inclined to continue their purchases dollar massive security to support the Green ticket.</seg>
<seg id=545> When they will end to their dollar purchasing large-scale programmes, the value of the dollar will fall, and it will drop sharply.</seg>
<seg id=546> And, from this point of view, if the value of the dollar declines, the American exports will become much more attractive to foreign markets and the labour market will resume American Labor being redirigée towards the new export sectors in full boom.</seg>
<seg id=547> The situation is comparable to that of Britain when it turned its exchange rate and laissa indexation of the pound sterling depreciate against the German mark, or what happened in the United States in the late 1980s when the dollar is déprécia compared to the book, the mark and -- particularly -- compared the Japanese yen.</seg>
<seg id=548> Economists of international finance describe a future worse.</seg>
<seg id=549> They see that the end of the dollar purchasing large-scale programmes by the central banks will not only the decline in the dollar but also in spiralling interest rates long-term Americans, which will fall immediately household consumption, and will regulate investment expenditure after a short period of time.</seg>
<seg id=550> Certainly, the economists of international finance also consider that American exports will benefit from the falling dollar but the differences demand are such that the outbreak of exports cannot happen that one or two years after the decline in consumption and investment spending.</seg>
<seg id=551> Eight to ten million people will have to move the services sector and construction sector of the import and export of goods, which means that structural unemployment will increase.</seg>
<seg id=552> Moreover, perhaps financial panic: the large financial institutions with obligations short-term and long-term assets encounter difficulties to bear a sharp increase in long-term interest rates denominated in dollars.</seg>
<seg id=553> This factor of inequality can lead to a certain tension financial and bankruptcy just as easily as those caused crises in Mexico and East Asia in the 1990s or Argentina's crisis of this decade of assets in local currency and obligations in dollar that held banks.</seg>
<seg id=554> When economists of international finance put forward this scenario, the macroéconomistes specialising in the domestic economy their claim that it is a case of incompetence in matters of monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=555> Why the Federal Reserve should enable the rise of long-term interest rates when foreign central banks will end their purchasing programmes dollar?</seg>
<seg id=556> Then should not intervene and take over by purchases of US Treasury obligation long-term, maintaining and long-term interest rates at a satisfactory level to encourage full employment?</seg>
<seg id=557> Economists of international finance usually respond to this that the Federal Reserve has not the ability to do so.</seg>
<seg id=558> Obliged to choose between full employment and price stability, according to them, the Federal Reserve chooses price stability, because its institutional memory of the 1970's and the escalation of inflation remains very powerful.</seg>
<seg id=559> Thus, since the fall in the value of the dollar is raising import prices and thus functions as a negative shock from the supply side in the economic sector, the Federal Reserve will increase rather than reduce its interest rates and therefore sell rather than buy Treasury bonds.</seg>
<seg id=560> Economists serious that I have great respect find themselves to take a position on opposing sides of this debate.</seg>
<seg id=561> I am not enough to give reason to one side or the other, but I know undoubtedly where I hope to see wrong.</seg>
<seg id=562> The bad pupils of Europe</seg>
<seg id=563> In the United States, the States that continuing misguided fiscal policies are penalised.</seg>
<seg id=564> Selling their obligations cut-price compared to other States managed.</seg>
<seg id=565> Debt servicing higher they must pay serves, to a degree, disciplinary action against the temptation to spend today and pay later.</seg>
<seg id=566> Of course, market discipline is not perfect: the bond market does not really "" the implicit (as passive future pension payments promised).</seg>
<seg id=567> However, the application of this fiscal discipline, coupled with internal budgetary process of each State, prevented the occurrence of large fiscal crisis in the United States since the great depression.</seg>
<seg id=568> Consider the case of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=569> Before the advent of the euro, many countries in southern Europe were tax crises, producing inflationary vague high.</seg>
<seg id=570> But with the introduction of the single currency, the road to resolve a fiscal crisis by inflation has been closed, since the European Central Bank (ECB) monitors monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=571> However, even if the nations can no longer rely on inflation to resolve the imbalance of their finances, the single currency allows them to use the ability of indebtedness which belongs to other members of the European Union to extend their madness wasteful and repel their political responsibility for good time periods let the wool [1] [sic].</seg>
<seg id=572> It is in order to avoid the possibility that the EU has created the Stability and Growth Pact: the government budget deficit must not exceed 3% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=573> Last week, the German Government, once the European countries, the most prudent and disciplined in the fiscal, broke the rules of the Pact for the fifth consecutive year, without really (a) of excuses.</seg>
<seg id=574> Peer steinbrueck Finance Minister has indicated that it expected that the European Commission uses sanctions against Germany: the credibility of the Pact, he would be in jeopardy if no gesture was done.</seg>
<seg id=575> Germany would not obstacle to sanctions this time, as was the case there are two and a half years ago.</seg>
<seg id=576> But steinbrueck has also expressed clear that this is waiting to sanctions purely symbolic in response to the budget deficit representative 3.4% of GDP, and not to penalties that would have a true cost for his government or its economy.</seg>
<seg id=577> The Stability and Growth Pact is not, or not yet, to work as originally planned.</seg>
<seg id=578> What about the discipline of the market?</seg>
<seg id=579> The will of the German Government to increase its debt and dig its deficits is limited by the fact that the market recognises and penalises of nations which leave their fiscal position shrink?</seg>
<seg id=580> In a word, not.</seg>
<seg id=581> Interest rates on the euro in the twelve sovereign debt euro area governments are very similar.</seg>
<seg id=582> The market is not care that countries have different possible to generate financial flows exports financing the necessary to repay debts or differents deficit / GDP automatically current or planned.</seg>
<seg id=583> Buiter Willem University of Amsterdam and Anne sibert of the University of London, believe that it is the acceptance of the ECB for all the euro-zone deficit as a guarantee that undermined the will of the market to become the controller of the tax moderation.</seg>
<seg id=584> As long as the marginal part of the German debt is used as a loan guarantee for short-term or as a centrepiece pension fought to acquire liquidity, its value is more likely to be determined by the terms on which the ECB accepted as guaranteed by its fundamental.</seg>
<seg id=585> The treatment by the ECB to any debt so as source as important liquidity reserve false now differential analysis of sovereign risk long-term.</seg>
<seg id=586> It is dangerous in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=587> It is necessary to have both market discipline and sound fiscal management for a reasonable chance to benefit from a price stability in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=588> Today omettez punished by the market behaviour which can become casse-cou or to activate the institutional levers which give a voice to future generations, and you are exposing suffer serious consequences -- not today, not tomorrow, but one day, and for the rest of your life.</seg>
<seg id=589> As time passes, the arrival of the single currency, and how the euro was introduced generates more and more malaise.</seg>
<seg id=590> The euro area-wide policy in general is by deflationary too.</seg>
<seg id=591> Currency transfers to render the current bearable to regions which slow down or are already in recession when the ECB applies a tougher policy are not facts.</seg>
<seg id=592> The institutional foundations of a stable fiscal policy are long-run in full eroded.</seg>
<seg id=593> Now, and sibert Buiter convince us that the ECB gives the market less possibility reward more economical and penalise spenders than it should.</seg>
<seg id=594> The earth does not move, and it doesn't happen before a moment.</seg>
<seg id=595> But the soil under the euro could well become ice if things do not change.</seg>
<seg id=596> Milosevic and Hussein even trial, even farce:</seg>
<seg id=597> The trial of war criminals were once serious affairs.</seg>
<seg id=598> Remember photographs of Herman goering and Rudolf Hess claims, and, in the dock in Nuremberg.</seg>
<seg id=599> Some Nazi leaders have even been hanged after relatively short but fair trial.</seg>
<seg id=600> Nowadays, the trial of the most ignoble pages of the world leaders have become sham.</seg>
<seg id=601> The trial of Saddam Hussein and his friends Ba'ath are a series uninterrupted moments troublesome.</seg>
<seg id=602> The defendants seek a singerie after another and Hussein shown all forms of contempt possible. The only thing that it has not yet made, is to show its fesses the judge.</seg>
<seg id=603> It is difficult to expect an outcome that could seem legitimate in the eyes of Iraqis or of the world.</seg>
<seg id=604> Meanwhile, Slobodan Milosevic's trial has changed funeral boring after four years of testimonies and $200 million spent unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg id=605> In Cambodia, the UN and the government have procrastinated for almost ten years to get the Khmer Rouge how personalities surviving before the courts.</seg>
<seg id=606> The mass murderers who came to power in the twentieth century were sentenced to be killed in popular revolts or trial for their crimes -- at least, if they do not die during their mandate.</seg>
<seg id=607> Who can feel proud that the last Communist leader in Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, was shot with his wife without even a fair trial?</seg>
<seg id=608> A genuine Court formal traps are always better than an instant justice, even if the final result is also death.</seg>
<seg id=609> Today there are two ways plausible to undertake a tyrant deposed.</seg>
<seg id=610> A nation can send its former leaders before the courts, as Argentines in the 1980s with generals responsible for the disappearance of more than 5 000 of their citizens.</seg>
<seg id=611> At international level, the model of Nuremberg remains valid to serve as an example for other trial, albeit under the conditions equivocal demand that the powers victorieuses sometimes accounts for certain crimes, such as the 'crimes against humanity, "which are not properly defined at a time when they are committed.</seg>
<seg id=612> There was a time when we could see the benefits of both national and international trial.</seg>
<seg id=613> The trial in the national territory allowed to the local community to give vent to his regret participating closely to the procedure.</seg>
<seg id=614> As judges and juries, the compatriots defendants, could also bring greater sensitivity to the estimate of guilt as they can appreciate the harsh conditions under which a dictator deposed takes its decisions.</seg>
<seg id=615> The trial generals in Argentina has been a ritual successful in the framework of the military junta painful transition to democracy, but this experience ended in a larmoyante called into question.</seg>
<seg id=616> Even after their condemnation, generals have been strong enough to demand a denunciation of their trials can Amnesty following the President.</seg>
<seg id=617> Argentina is still enchevêtrée policy in the legal consequences of these trials of twenty years.</seg>
<seg id=618> At international level, the decision of the UN Security Council to establish the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has also been welcomed with great confidence.</seg>
<seg id=619> The ICTY has taken several founding decisions under the leadership of Antonio Cassese.</seg>
<seg id=620> But then judges had the misfortune to achieve their dream the more expensive: judge the chief spells disaster, Slobodan Milosevic.</seg>
<seg id=621> We cannot be a clear idea of how the Serbs would have judged Milosevic in the context of a local trial.</seg>
<seg id=622> Many would have been dependent on the political party that would have controlled the Court.</seg>
<seg id=623> At international level, fears were not about excessive policy but in an excess of law.</seg>
<seg id=624> The trial of Milosevic had to be more than just, it must be the flagship of Justice of the UN.</seg>
<seg id=625> And Milosevic has been allowed to defend itself -- serious mistake in terms of the length and efficiency of the trial.</seg>
<seg id=626> There has been no limits to the number of people that the charge has called to testify on the same appalling history of the aggression and the brutality Serbs.</seg>
<seg id=627> It will take many months to determine the problem and know why this scandal of a four-year trial.</seg>
<seg id=628> My intuition is that the well-meaning officials of the Court were too influenced by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission builder, model sold in schools of law as an alternative desirable to the distributive justice.</seg>
<seg id=629> During the trial South Africans, the most important issue was not the future of the past warned of the victims.</seg>
<seg id=630> Every victim was encouraged to tell its history and warned respected.</seg>
<seg id=631> In the case of massacres perpetrated in the twentieth century, such narratives can last decades.</seg>
<seg id=632> Encourage the victims to speak can give the warned the right to monopolise the floor and block the trial in flaunting its merits of political leader are the ingredients of a session interminable.</seg>
<seg id=633> One of the lessons learned from the trial of Milosevic and Hussein is not judge of men or women for them lose their attractiveness charismatic.</seg>
<seg id=634> They will overturn the trial, particularly if they are allowed to defend themselves, and use the courtroom to justify their way.</seg>
<seg id=635> Tyrants should be judged that having been clearly routed.</seg>
<seg id=636> Irony of history, the fact that the Nuremberg Tribunal has been gripped by representatives of the victors and powerful was an advantage.</seg>
<seg id=637> They are a constant reminder to goering Hess, and their minions that allies where that the Nazis were irrevocably defeated.</seg>
<seg id=638> Punishing the guilty, rather than forming how history is written, has always been the clear objective of the trial.</seg>
<seg id=639> The tragedy of the trial of Milosevic and Hussein is that aspect of history are still missing and that history itself is on trial.</seg>
<seg id=640> The consistent hesitancy responsible has given rise to procedures, both national and international, which have helped the ghosts of justification and return.</seg>
<seg id=641> In the case of Saddam Hussein, the fantasy could still be achieved.</seg>
<seg id=642> The dividing line the Iraqi economy</seg>
<seg id=643> All those who analyse Iraq see a divided nation between communities Shia, Sunnis and the Kurds.</seg>
<seg id=644> But there is another division equally fundamental, a division which contributes equally at the insurgency continues that sectarian conflict and opposition to military occupation led by the Americans, the widening gap between rich and poor in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=645> When Iraq was released, populations, particularly the poor people have taken to hope that a charismatic leader would save the harsh realities of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id=646> High in fear, they had no idea how democracy could apply to their society or how the groups of defence of human rights and other organisations civil rights could help to shape their future.</seg>
<seg id=647> Iraq has confronted by a new social divide.</seg>
<seg id=648> On the one hand were those who understand how function in a democracy, come to power and achieve ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=649> They have learned to speak the language of democracy to gain at the same time, money and influence, and to ensure the independent organizations to defend their rights and privileges.</seg>
<seg id=650> On the other hand, however, there is a large population of Iraqis without power, particularly women widows, divorced or abandoned without person to bear them, they and their children.</seg>
<seg id=651> For them, democracy and human rights does not mean a lot.</seg>
<seg id=652> They are poor, sick and uncultivated.</seg>
<seg id=653> Victims of an education system which collapsed more than ten years ago, they are poorly trained to find a job in the Iraqi economy withering away.</seg>
<seg id=654> Under the yoke of Saddam, no effort was made to raise the standard of living of disadvantaged.</seg>
<seg id=655> I visited the big slums Iraqis and discovered families living in homes barely covered homeless, infested insects everywhere, with open sewers lag in their doors.</seg>
<seg id=656> Day and night, they live in the black.</seg>
<seg id=657> Who need do nothing less than food, decent housing and perspectives jobs, these families are waiting death, accounts for the cries of their starving children.</seg>
<seg id=658> When I met women who live in these homes, they have bombarded with issues: democracy allait-elle give them food and homes?</seg>
<seg id=659> Democracy empêcherait-elle men to fight their wives?</seg>
<seg id=660> Democracy place citizenship to their children?</seg>
<seg id=661> Their donnerait-elle divorce law spouses who would have abandoned?</seg>
<seg id=662> To all these questions, I said ‘ yes ’.</seg>
<seg id=663> Yes, democracy give you the right to live in a decent home, the right to learn and work, and it will give citizenship to children and equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id=664> But you must work hard and make every effort to demand these rights.</seg>
<seg id=665> What they replied: ‘ Saddam has taught us to be unemployed, silent and apprehensive for 35 years.</seg>
<seg id=666> What can we now? "</seg>
<seg id=667> Indigentes live in these areas where most Iraqis, people are prey to the bitter temptations.</seg>
<seg id=668> Many people who are not on the scope of political leaders and government.</seg>
<seg id=669> They are easily into violence, theft and sabotage.</seg>
<seg id=670> Poverty led some to accept money in exchange for terrorist acts, accomplices made by the promise of a heroism false that they could not exploit during the long reign of Saddam.</seg>
<seg id=671> Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of violent history wars and atrocities of Iraq, which has destroyed the sensitivity of the people against the murder.</seg>
<seg id=672> Although the living conditions in Iraq today lead many young men towards violence, I am convinced that it is simply provide jobs and decent housing to save them.</seg>
<seg id=673> The jobs, in particular, would help young people to forge new lives in jobs serious.</seg>
<seg id=674> We must not use bogus jobs to disguise the army of unemployed.</seg>
<seg id=675> We must give people jobs which allow them to contribute positively to the reconstruction of the country.</seg>
<seg id=676> By nature, each individual seeks to be useful for its own society.</seg>
<seg id=677> But culture that Saddam has created has convinced the Iraqis political links represent the only way to acquire authority, money and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=678> Such sentiments exceed take time and will require a flourishing economy, which means that the new Iraqi Government must have limited powers in order to facilitate the growth of private sector while encouraging the widespread understanding of democracy and human rights.</seg>
<seg id=679> The religious groups are prepared to participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id=680> We can also rehabilitate technocrats who served under Saddam, so that they have a chance to serve their country.</seg>
<seg id=681> Last but not least, we must provide loans to impoverished families to help build a respectable life.</seg>
<seg id=682> The government must above all make every effort to convince the Iraqi people poor value of democracy and freedom and the importance of the Constitution in the achievement of their aspirations for a better life.</seg>
<seg id=683> This will not be easy to achieve in a country where many people consider that break the law is an act of heroism.</seg>
<seg id=684> We have yet we, the Iraqis and learned that power must not be concentrated in the hands of a minority, and that the establishment of justice requires combat corruption in all its forms.</seg>
<seg id=685> If the Constitution must operate as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, Iraqis deprived must learn to make their this fight.</seg>
<seg id=686> Islamic identity</seg>
<seg id=687> Wherever you chairing your gaze at present, Islam is used (and misused) as a political force.</seg>
<seg id=688> Some Muslims in serve as an incentive to action; many Muslims in the West (and in other countries the perceive as a "other" containment and 'another' astreignants exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=689> As a Turk, I feel directly these two sides of the debate.</seg>
<seg id=690> Why Islam is a religion "other" to Western eyes is that the West has been a systematic de-institutionalisation religion.</seg>
<seg id=691> This is not the religion that has disappeared from the modern western life, of course, but rather the claims that the religious institutions may have on the individual behaviour.</seg>
<seg id=692> Religion in the modern world is more than ever personal experience and spiritual.</seg>
<seg id=693> However, a process of de-institutionalisation of religious experience is also happening within Islam.</seg>
<seg id=694> The politicisation of Islam displace the authority of the religious classes of Islam, the ulema.</seg>
<seg id=695> As in the West, Islamic religious becomes more personal experience.</seg>
<seg id=696> The interpretation of religious texts by individual Muslims, including political activists, intellectuals and women, is a consequence among many.</seg>
<seg id=697> We also popularisation of religious knowledge, the lessons of the Koran being beaten and out of context to support political objectives.</seg>
<seg id=698> Now who decides what is right and what is illegal in Islam?</seg>
<seg id=699> Which has sufficient authority to interpret the religious texts?</seg>
<seg id=700> Who can make a fatwa declare the "or" Jihad?</seg>
<seg id=701> Nowadays, the activism and terrorism offer, or rather, a source of legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id=702> That is how the uninitiated decide what means, or does not mean Islam, without the authority of the religious schools and without specialised training.</seg>
<seg id=703> Indeed, Islam today is essentially interpreted by politicians and cultural movements, and not by religious institutions.</seg>
<seg id=704> This de-institutionalisation enabled Islam to move the status of local and national social link to creator imaginary links between all Muslims around the world who feel oppressed or displaced.</seg>
<seg id=705> Islam can unite and Members who were deeply divided: Muslims intellectuals Sufis and Muslims canonisés of origin shariat; the Shiite Muslims and Sunni; Conservative Saudi Arabia and Iran revolutionary.</seg>
<seg id=706> Islam is also dynamic, its believers leaving rural areas for cities, including the western cities.</seg>
<seg id=707> Many regard this as negative and stress that these individuals are socially uprooted and they falling into alienation and, for some, terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=708> But social mobility is also a precondition for creating a modern perspective.</seg>
<seg id=709> Of course, migration creates a sense of distance Muslims, if it is a complete break with their origins, social.</seg>
<seg id=710> Their experience is therefore new religious theological, Community institutions, private or public.</seg>
<seg id=711> Religious experience becomes a form of social imagination within which they rebuilding a sense of belonging to Islam in an environment both new and strange.</seg>
<seg id=712> This is not the distance of modern life, but with the proximity life triggers a return to the religious identity.</seg>
<seg id=713> Indeed, the great majority of radicalism manifests itself in the groups which, by their experience of mobility and travel are familiar with the secular western modes of political thinking and urban life.</seg>
<seg id=714> Perturbed by an environment unknown, these individuals cling to Islam that is their only support.</seg>
<seg id=715> But for that support works, Islam must break out of its attitude, traditionally obséquieuse passive and submissive faced with modernity.</seg>
<seg id=716> With a veil or a beard in claiming the right of obtaining prayer places at work and at school and requiring special food, Muslims identify openly as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id=717> They inform the world that they are most zealous and more meticulous in their religious observance that individuals who keep their religion to privacy.</seg>
<seg id=718> For example, non-Muslims have traditionally treated of the veil as a sign of the inferiority degradation and Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id=719> Ashamed, but it had become for Muslims a sign of their positive statement of an Islamic identity.</seg>
<seg id=720> Muslim young women in Europe are perfection this transformation.</seg>
<seg id=721> Young girls who take the headscarf in the French and German schools are closer, in many respects (i.e., the youth culture, awareness of fashion and the language), their classmates their mothers uneducated who are forced to stay at home.</seg>
<seg id=722> By adopting the headscarf for the European public sphere, these young girls to change the symbol and the role of women Muslim.</seg>
<seg id=723> This trend goes well beyond simple scarves.</seg>
<seg id=724> Western all Muslims have a dual sense of belonging, cultural capital a twofold.</seg>
<seg id=725> They define themselves by their religion, but they have also acquired knowledge secular universal.</seg>
<seg id=726> The fact that they have this dual cultural capital, they can move freely between the various activities and relatively spaces (home, school, houses of young and space for leisure urban).</seg>
<seg id=727> To be Muslim and Islamic are two different things.</seg>
<seg id=728> We are witnessing today to change a Muslim identity for an Islamic identity.</seg>
<seg id=729> The religious me for Muslims of individual private Kingdom Kingdom public.</seg>
<seg id=730> The question that remains for each is whether this quest for identity can be satisfied with scarves and with a broad public acceptance of the Islamic religion or if a positive statement of Islam requires a more fundamental renunciation of modernity.</seg>
<seg id=731> A new era for Islamic science?</seg>
<seg id=732> For hundreds of years, while science and mathematics knew a period of great inventiveness, a region of the world was full of others.</seg>
<seg id=733> The masters of these disciplines were révérés declined, medicine and people are wondering about the functioning of nature.</seg>
<seg id=734> It is no surprise that this region has been globally respected.</seg>
<seg id=735> The other half of the world known, scientists were punished even killed.</seg>
<seg id=736> Mathematics considered irréligieuses and foreign, were outlawed, and were later subjugated religion.</seg>
<seg id=737> The standard of living is low.</seg>
<seg id=738> The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, whereas a Europe illiterate remained poor.</seg>
<seg id=739> The two regions were governed religiously (historians agree on the role and the nature of religions in this context), but science does épanouissait in one of them.</seg>
<seg id=740> Today, of course, the roles of the Islamic Middle East and West are reversed.</seg>
<seg id=741> Since the Second World War, the US is the world leaders of indiscutés in science.</seg>
<seg id=742> Throughout this period, the brightest students were drawn outside their country of origin by the prospect of greater opportunities for career and research.</seg>
<seg id=743> Until recently, more than half of students graduates of engineering higher mathematics, science and the United States were born abroad.</seg>
<seg id=744> Many of these young talents stayed after receiving their qualifications, and both the industrial world that the government have benefited.</seg>
<seg id=745> Meanwhile, Islamic culture walked into a historic phase in which science was equated with the influence of the West declaration, and for this very reason.</seg>
<seg id=746> Even in countries where oil revenues could create a significant proportion of research, Arab rulers have not encouraged such investments, and the consequence is that their societies have not shaped extent they could.</seg>
<seg id=747> Recently, a desire for greater respect policy has pushed the Islamic nations to invest in the area of technology, which is particularly visible in the Pakistani nuclear ambitions and Iran.</seg>
<seg id=748> But, while such weapons have a political weight, science on which they are based is trivial and old.</seg>
<seg id=749> Respect from well-considered visions, rather than born of past discoveries, is much more significant.</seg>
<seg id=750> Imagine the influence that a Pakistani institute at the top of global research on cancer.</seg>
<seg id=751> Political rhetoric and Oman changerait-elle if researchers to find a way to remove aids?</seg>
<seg id=752> This opportunity is not present at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=753> But there is another, which is not limited to Islamic societies.</seg>
<seg id=754> The United States have committed serious blunder recently.</seg>
<seg id=755> "questions of faith" have substituted for science in the government, on the basis of the Presidency.</seg>
<seg id=756> Eminent researchers have seen their reports modified by members of staff policy when the facts contradicted the official.</seg>
<seg id=757> Encouraged by an administration influenced by religion, the school systems are turning their teaching of science towards the "values."</seg>
<seg id=758> Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entrance visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, which hinders the flow of young talent to American universities.</seg>
<seg id=759> Large organisations scientists have protested inconclusively.</seg>
<seg id=760> At the same time, fiscal laws have been revised to make investors richest in the short term, discouraging long-term investment in research.</seg>
<seg id=761> Demi-billion a $was devoted to the war in Iraq, a sum roughly equal to finance any basic research of thousand years.</seg>
<seg id=762> Even if the United States avoid a dark age of fundamentalism clearly, they risk losing their world domination in terms of research.</seg>
<seg id=763> Japan has recognised the link between political weight and science in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id=764> The main industrial Japanese CEO akio morita Sony, and the shintaro ishihara right-wing politician, have made a series of what has been compiled and published in 1986, under the Japan that can say no [Japan which can say no].</seg>
<seg id=765> They have outlined a national strategy in which global influence immaturity scientific power.</seg>
<seg id=766> The main idea is that the military power could be made obsolete if the "food chain" of military technology was controlled by other nations.</seg>
<seg id=767> The title of a book refers to the draft Japan say "no" to the American military influence once that Japan will master the main military technology.</seg>
<seg id=768> Building a knowledge-based economy through the oil wealth is quite possible.</seg>
<seg id=769> Texas, for example, as most of the southern states of the United States, was formerly economically poor and in decline.</seg>
<seg id=770> Even with oil revenues, the flow of dollars in the economy is not in itself enough to boost prosperity as much.</seg>
<seg id=771> Texas has therefore decided to devote the oil money to a allocation for education.</seg>
<seg id=772> Today, this allocation is roughly equal to that of Harvard University, and it extends to 15 universities.</seg>
<seg id=773> It has had a staggering: the aerospace industry has virtually disappeared from California, but it explodes in Texas.</seg>
<seg id=774> The centres of research and the consortia telecommunications are happening in Texas, until the Canadian giant telecommunications nortel.</seg>
<seg id=775> Although industry is experiencing a crisis in the United States, Texas one of the most solid industrial economies of the world.</seg>
<seg id=776> There is no reason why the same results cannot be achieved in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=777> But above all, the Islamic world must rediscover and reconcile itself with its proud legacy.</seg>
<seg id=778> The Iranian debate on Iraq</seg>
<seg id=779> No country in the Middle East is following the events of the post-war Iraq as closely as Iran.</seg>
<seg id=780> The geographic proximity, history intense and violent war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, religious and emotional connections with the Shia Iraq, a degree of concern about America and its policy in the region: these are the son between Iran to Western its neighbour.</seg>
<seg id=781> Given the endless tensions with America, Iran is particularly affected by the possibility of an American presence continues in its neighbour, and by the dominant role of America in building the future from post-Saddam Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=782> Foreign observers can find it hard to follow the internal discussions Iranians, yet they exist, they are intense, even if they are not always international visible to the public in general.</seg>
<seg id=783> We can find three general approaches in the debate on the Iranian evolving post-Saddam Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=784> The Iranian pragmatists argue that Iran must inevitably cooperate with the USA in post-Saddam Iraq --, even if only to ensure that the rights of the Shiite population of Iraq are respected.</seg>
<seg id=785> For this reason, Iran should gain an assurance that the new Iraqi leader not not hostile and will seek to gain bilateral friendships.</seg>
<seg id=786> Other key considerations for the pragmatists concern the preservation of Iraq's territorial integrity and repatriation tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.</seg>
<seg id=787> They are moderates who believe that the Iranian Government should urge the United States to obtain the extradition of members of the organization of moudjahidins Khalq (MKO) based in Iraq, and that the total dismantling of the organization.</seg>
<seg id=788> In exchange, the Iranian Government should offer its support for peace, stability and security in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=789> In short, the pragmatists would limit the relationship between Iran, focusing on a programme which greatly concerns reflected the home of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=790> In general, the conservative forces in Iran support this approach.</seg>
<seg id=791> Another approach proposes a more active role and cooperative for Iran in the reconstruction of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=792> Advocates of this position argue that Iran is well placed to facilitate the reconstruction, owing to its infrastructure well-established personal and institutional ties with Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=793> Finally, is the United States and the international community will recognize the value of Iranian cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=794> Iranian cooperation should be rewarded by the dismantling of infrastructures in the MKO in Iraq, perhaps in exchange for an Iranian promise to tackle the activities of Al Qaeda, and Al Qaeda expel members of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=795> Above all, Iran should invite the Americans to respond to its cooperation with the assurance of a guarantee in return that Iran does not become the target of US military actions.</seg>
<seg id=796> In short, the defenders of cooperation are calling for an open market and explicit: the support of Iran to ensure stability during the current transitional phase and its commitment to maintain relations of cooperation with all permanent government will emerge in Iraq in exchange for improving the position of regional and international Iran.</seg>
<seg id=797> This position is widely shared within the reform movements in Iran, within and outside the government, as well as by the technocratic class affairs and which is more international.</seg>
<seg id=798> Finally, the Radicals Iranians, the possibility of cooperation with the United States is pure fantasy.</seg>
<seg id=799> They are convinced that America is trying to undermine the Iranian security and jeopardise its national interests.</seg>
<seg id=800> According to the radicals, the United States for the least seek to impose significant changes to the Iranian foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id=801> At worst, they say, America will seek to impose a change of regime in Iran actively.</seg>
<seg id=802> It militera enthusiastically against the acquisition of knowledge and nuclear energy by Iran and could even try to weaken the military capability of Iran as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=803> Radicals perceive the American invasion of Iraq as a reflection of the United States wishes to seal off Iran.</seg>
<seg id=804> In return, they believe that Iran must adopt an aggressive stance in defence of its own interests, in strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers and use the Iranian influence in Iraq to prevent the formation of a government pro-American and anti-iranien in Baghdad.</seg>
<seg id=805> The hard-liners of all sides support this approach.</seg>
<seg id=806> The overthrow of Saddam Hussein and his regime was that the most easy to the Iraqi crisis.</seg>
<seg id=807> Now the hardest remains to be done: to establish peace and security, win the war against terrorism and convince the Muslim masses that America does not intend to occupy Iraq but siphoning for all its oil resources and redesign the Middle East to its image.</seg>
<seg id=808> Meanwhile, opposition to the United States, under the expression of suicide bomb or other forms of terrorism, will probably only grow.</seg>
<seg id=809> Iran is intended to keep its dominant position in the region through its dynamism and its Muslim identity policy which rings ECHO throughout the Muslim world.</seg>
<seg id=810> What happens in Iraq has major implications in Iran and the United States would do well to find a way to recognise this state of affairs.</seg>
<seg id=811> American threats, or the discussions on another war, feeds the fire of resentment and frustration in Iran, strengthening the most radical movements.</seg>
<seg id=812> If the United States wish to avoid such effects, they must accept to limit their influence of its own radicals, assuming that American interests in Iraq are best defended through cooperation with Iran.</seg>
<seg id=813> A way for Iraq</seg>
<seg id=814> The situation in Iraq has got to the point where everybody wants conspicuously the same thing: the departure of the coalition forces.</seg>
<seg id=815> The recent disclosure of a confidential memorandum of the Ministry of Defence British on the withdrawal of troops underlines this aspiration.</seg>
<seg id=816> The only question is how the meet.</seg>
<seg id=817> As the coalition forces remain violence will only increase.</seg>
<seg id=818> However, if they are based, the escalation of violence will take place when even, and even more quickly.</seg>
<seg id=819> The real question is how arrive in Iraq to organise an army and police to which we can trust to uphold law and order.</seg>
<seg id=820> Much remains way to approach this goal.</seg>
<seg id=821> Despite the courage many Iraqis who join the ranks of the police and the army, it is not surprising that some people have no less than pure motives.</seg>
<seg id=822> In northern Iraq to settle old scores and ethnic segregation is introduced in certain areas, as irbil traditionally mingled.</seg>
<seg id=823> In other areas, the sharia is imposed.</seg>
<seg id=824> How can create Iraq body likely to enforce the law with efficiency and impartiality, regardless of race, religion or kind?</seg>
<seg id=825> The traditional response is to recruit and train inculcate, the values. "</seg>
<seg id=826> But there is insufficient time.</seg>
<seg id=827> We must find other ways.</seg>
<seg id=828> In the absence of a system of value deeply rooted, Iraq needs associations embedded in civil society, which the police and the army must accountable.</seg>
<seg id=829> They may take various forms, but the most important thing is that they are very far-reaching at local level, and that they have the support of the district authorities, the region and the countries when they are abuses.</seg>
<seg id=830> If a local monitoring is put in place, supplemented and recognised at national level, then most of the members of the military and police forces behave probably adequately, and otherwise, it will be easier to identify them and manage them.</seg>
<seg id=831> Such measures appear excessively optimistic, and yet in Afghanistan, a country which looks to Iraq in many ways, many groups work.</seg>
<seg id=832> The cooperation for peace and unity (cpau gives a model of the way to operate.</seg>
<seg id=833> In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, the priority of ordinary people was to reduce violence.</seg>
<seg id=834> The cpau has worked throughout the country over the last three years to implement committees of peace in the level of districts, supported by the advice of peace satellites in the villages.</seg>
<seg id=835> This initiative addresses a culture in which violence is so deeply rooted that children, at a time, learned arithmetic after the Soviet soldiers dead.</seg>
<seg id=836> The committees have therefore tried to bring together all sections of the Community, including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, the police, judges and businessmen, to devise ways of resolving conflicts without violence.</seg>
<seg id=837> Even if the committees do not officially play a role in monitoring hitherto (it is included in the future), the simple fact that the police, the army, and justice in part brings them with the rest of the Community, allows a return of information, and will contribute to the establishment of trust.</seg>
<seg id=838> Some results.</seg>
<seg id=839> In a workshops local military commander has come through a few hours per courtesy, and eventually remain the whole week.</seg>
<seg id=840> It is party in apologizing for his past violent and undertook to disarm its private army of 2 000 men.</seg>
<seg id=841> It makes today regularly visit to the offices of the Committee.</seg>
<seg id=842> In Iraq, projects such as the humanitarian link Center of Kirkuk are beginning to perform a monitoring function by offering the people in the various ethnic groups the opportunity to set out its complaints and can get help to resolve its problems.</seg>
<seg id=843> But too often, even in the case of a trial, the judgment is not implemented because the victims succumb to the threat.</seg>
<seg id=844> The US and British forces have already worked to strengthen civil society.</seg>
<seg id=845> However, we do not intend to speak workshops emancipation of women, or of the success of the organization of small-scale local elections in the country.</seg>
<seg id=846> Mobilising civil society represents an enormous challenge, especially when, as in Iraq, it must be done quickly and on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id=847> The military forces still needed but, as well as the encouragement to disarmament, who can take the form of prospects for economic opportunities more fruitful that crime and theft.</seg>
<seg id=848> Fortunately, such an organisation of civil society is also inexpensive that important.</seg>
<seg id=849> The association humanitarian link Center treats all Kirkuk for an annual cost of $75 000 us.</seg>
<seg id=850> With 10 million dollars, we could establish a hundred centres of this kind, and it will remain a currency.</seg>
<seg id=851> It is now to engage in this direction, to support the elk brave people who is the challenge to demand accountability on power.</seg>
<seg id=852> Otherwise, the Iraqi people may not be secure he desperately needs, after years of suffering.</seg>
<seg id=853> Democracy on the Upper Nile?</seg>
<seg id=854> The decision surprise the Egyptian President Mubarak hosni to propose a constitutional amendment allowing direct presidential elections and competitive could well be a giant step for democracy in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id=855> The West accustomed to a pluralist democracy can be difficult to understand what change considerable potentially this decision will result in a country used to military rule for over 50 years.</seg>
<seg id=856> Under the current system, the Egyptian citizens can only be demonstrate the day of a presidential referendum organised every six years to say yes or no to the only name on the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id=857> This explains why an individual as Mubarak has always received more than 90% of the vote, albeit in the middle of a turnout indifferent.</seg>
<seg id=858> The strong men Syrian and Iraqis have been even better with this system, perhaps because they demanded that the names and addresses of voters are placed at the bottom of each elections.</seg>
<seg id=859> Many support for a long time that democratisation in the Middle East cannot progress while Egypt does not fully involved in the process.</seg>
<seg id=860> Egypt could not to engage on a path of democratisation without first amending its constitution, this to reduce the phenomenal powers of its President and limit the duration of its mandate.</seg>
<seg id=861> Mubarak, after all, is already its 24ème year as President.</seg>
<seg id=862> Thus, his announcement of presidential elections competitive constitutes a first major step.</seg>
<seg id=863> The regime can assume it will be able to use the process to its advantage, but the events could be more difficult to monitor than expected once the people will begin to feel responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=864> Democratic the genie out of the bottle.</seg>
<seg id=865> In any case, Egypt is not alone in this troubled region embarking on the road to democracy.</seg>
<seg id=866> Turkey on one side of the Middle East and Morocco of the other are already engaged in this process.</seg>
<seg id=867> The real groundswell seems this time result from the vicinity of time and results of the recent elections held in Iraq, Palestine and, to a lesser degree, Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=868> Unprecedented protests against the occupation of Lebanon by Syria following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq al-hariri, do not seem to be alleviated.</seg>
<seg id=869> The opposition groups Egyptians have also held the marches increasingly courageous and other forms of civil disobedience in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id=870> The catalyst for their anger was the arrest and detention of the opposition leader ill, Ayman Nour, end of January.</seg>
<seg id=871> The arbitrary treatment of government has reinvigorated the national movement kifaya (meaning ‘ enough ’), which demanded the end of the regime of Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id=872> Suddenly, the conventional wisdom that the Egyptians are passive and fear of act has not appeared to verify.</seg>
<seg id=873> An alliance of local, regional and international forces against the tyranny unites permanent exerted on the shores Nile.</seg>
<seg id=874> The recent wave of popular pressure seems to have shaken the regime.</seg>
<seg id=875> Only a month before, muybarak applications of constitutional reform disrupted were "futile."</seg>
<seg id=876> But, whatever the combination of events which led this about-turn, the initiative on the elections must be welcomed.</seg>
<seg id=877> This is a first necessary step, although it is not enough to rewrite the stagnant political system of Egypt.</seg>
<seg id=878> The Egyptians distrust already symbolic reforms to Tunisia, the country in which President Zine El abidin bin Ali, holding office for a long time, has created a caricature of constitutional amendment seemed pave the way for presidential elections competitive, but which has subsequently led a mockery of competition with a few "opponents' handpicked.</seg>
<seg id=879> In previous presidential referenda Tunisians, bin Ali récoltait systematically 99% of votes; it has now achieved 96%.</seg>
<seg id=880> Let us hope that Mubarak is more serious about electoral reform.</seg>
<seg id=881> To prove his sincerity, it must order the immediate release of Ayman Nour and take measures to put an end to the state of emergency of 24 years, which prevents successfully the organization of political campaigns.</seg>
<seg id=882> Mubarak must also approve a limit of two mandates each successive five years for President.</seg>
<seg id=883> Equally necessary measures to gain the trust of citizens, particularly open and equal access to the media, which are currently controlled by the state.</seg>
<seg id=884> I announced that I had intended to contest this coming presidential election to open up the debate on these essential reforms.</seg>
<seg id=885> But I return with pleasure in my life of private citizen when I have the assurance of a free and open elections next autumn.</seg>
<seg id=886> If they are seriously implemented, these steps attacked the legacy of Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id=887> With the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine, they may well open a spring Arab freedom, waited for a long time.</seg>
<seg id=888> Historic elections for Egypt?</seg>
<seg id=889> The Egyptians will go to the polls on 7 September to elect a president of ten candidates, whose hosni Mubarak, in power for 24 years.</seg>
<seg id=890> So little doubt that it will be re-elected to the election's outcome, much in follow the stages with passion.</seg>
<seg id=891> Some 6,000 national election observers were trained for the opportunity, and hundreds of international observers will arrive in the country this week.</seg>
<seg id=892> Although the trappings of a genuine electoral competition are established, it is striking that several signs of authenticity bombs.</seg>
<seg id=893> Despite the promises of the contrary, the conditions of game are far from being fair.</seg>
<seg id=894> Mubarak has a disproportionate number of benefits: the recognition of the name, a near-monopoly electronic media controlled by the state and nothing less than 85% of print media.</seg>
<seg id=895> A week before the vote, some opposition candidates have not yet had the opportunity to disseminate a single campaign Egyptian on television.</seg>
<seg id=896> All the members of the Commission are appointed by Mubarak presidential election, and the new electoral rules eliminated all independent competitors.</seg>
<seg id=897> Since 2000, a decision by the Supreme Court states that the 8 000 judges Egyptians must supervise the elections and certify the results.</seg>
<seg id=898> It is a major step towards fairer elections, because the Union has been quite independent professional judges during the last half-century of stranglehold on the executive.</seg>
<seg id=899> The regime of Mubarak has therefore had to use various subterfuge to neutralise the Union of judges.</seg>
<seg id=900> One of them was to push the definition of "judicial" to include thousands of employees graduates in law, without experience in the Court but loyal to the government. It leaves little room for real judges, because if they are protesting in boycotting their observation work, the task is to return once again to the police to the infamous Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
<seg id=901> Thus, in the past, the Union of judges has performed its task, with results predictable.</seg>
<seg id=902> During the parliamentary elections in 2000, while the party in power of Mubarak has not received that approximately 38% of the votes in the areas monitored by the real judges, the results have managed to culminate to 86% when the presque-juges were observation.</seg>
<seg id=903> This year promises to be very different.</seg>
<seg id=904> In the spring, the justices were held a national assembly and resolved unless the government gives them a complete independence and the exclusive control of the process of elections, they do not being the presidential elections (or parliamentary) to come.</seg>
<seg id=905> On 2 September, they have explained their ultimate demand: the regime must allow groups civil to observe the elections, stop change the definition of legitimate judges in a purpose and accept that no box leaves the presence of a judge legitimate without that its content is short, certified and postponed.</seg>
<seg id=906> For the moment it seems that the situation is hopeless, because the head of the presidential election Commission announced publicly Egyptian on television that he refused any comment by the citizens of elections.</seg>
<seg id=907> Among the exciting developments, on the eve of the elections is a public debate on the subject of heated should boycott the election or vote?</seg>
<seg id=908> Many opposition parties have called their members to abstain in protest against the restrictive electoral rules which promote strongly Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id=909> Moreover, the Muslim Brotherhood, considered as the only group of opposition has weight in Egypt, pushing their supporters to vote according to their conscience but not to support any "governing despotic and corrupt."</seg>
<seg id=910> This is an implicit but clear repudiation of Mubarak, only Head of State for 24 years.</seg>
<seg id=911> Some 34 civil society organisations preparing thousands of young Egyptians to monitor the elections despite the objections repeated government.</seg>
<seg id=912> These groups argue that if the regime has no intention of rigging elections, then the presence of national and international observers should not pose any problems.</seg>
<seg id=913> The response from the regime is to say that any external monitoring is interference in Egyptian sovereignty and national observers would be an affront to the integrity of judges.</seg>
<seg id=914> The last point is quickly fell when the Union of judges came out in favour observers of civil society.</seg>
<seg id=915> That the regime of Mubarak is frighten the voices of inside and outside that the challenge to hold free and fair elections, or that it is simply unable to remove cheating within the party, as it has become inherent in its operation, the current signs do not bode well for the elections next Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id=916> Meanwhile, for the first time the Egyptians are exciting experience of the challenge to the tyranny and benefits of a whole new area of freedom.</seg>
<seg id=917> European envy dollar</seg>
<seg id=918> The currencies can play an essential role not only in commercial transactions, but also in the diplomatic and political wrangling.</seg>
<seg id=919> When this happens, commercial transactions will become more difficult and subject to greater uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id=920> The politicisation of the money in the interwar depression proved devastating economically.</seg>
<seg id=921> But violent wars currencies were more recently.</seg>
<seg id=922> In the 1960's, the international monetary order has become the subject of a political tug-of-war.</seg>
<seg id=923> Every originator had theories and explanations appreciably different on the situation.</seg>
<seg id=924> Europeans, and particularly the French, complained that the General Charles de Gaulle described as ‘ extraordinary privilege 'of the US dollar.</seg>
<seg id=925> The general and its monetary guru, Jacques rueff, argued that the US used the status of the dollar as a major reserve currency fixed exchange rate regime of the Bretton Woods to manage deficits and to pay their military adventurism abroad (at that time in Vietnam).</seg>
<seg id=926> France has responded by calling for a monetary reform which would put an end to the special role of the dollar and has tried to resurrect the gold standard largely discredited.</seg>
<seg id=927> Europeans have begun a long discussion on the advantages of monetary union, the realisation of which would allow them to compete with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id=928> But the American point of view, the international role of the dollar was a trap.</seg>
<seg id=929> Other countries could change their exchange rate and could preserve greater competition at the level of exports.</seg>
<seg id=930> The US Government has revealed powerless at a yen undervalued, fueling the belief that the rest of the world used the dollar to attack the basis of manufacture of America.</seg>
<seg id=931> Richard Nixon's administration has concluded that the only way to save the American economy was to engage in a unilateralism monetary (a monetary expansion so spectacular than other countries would be forced to adjust their exchange rate).</seg>
<seg id=932> These battles long forgotten suddenly seem very present again.</seg>
<seg id=933> The world does have a fixed exchange rate regime, but the dollar remains the major reserve currency, a kind of floating Bretton Woods.</seg>
<seg id=934> For Americans, the role of the dollar is a potential threat not while the Americans, it would be rather another example of American néo-impériale quest for hegemony.</seg>
<seg id=935> During this decade, China has taken Japan's place of the 1960's, preventing its exchange rate to rise to push export growth.</seg>
<seg id=936> This has made it the target of American gripes about unfair competition and efforts to impose an adjustment of the exchange rate likely to deter the Americans to buy toys, equipment and Chinese garments.</seg>
<seg id=937> American manufacturers have found that the bras manufactured in China threatened the American way of life.</seg>
<seg id=938> Meanwhile, Europeans (and particularly the French) complain of the huge deficits Americans and the argument de Gaulle saying that the rest of the world pays for America's wars is back in fashion.</seg>
<seg id=939> Some Europeans suggest that Asian central banks should play a larger proportion of their euro reserves, an echo of the failed attempt of general for America capitulation by selling dollars against gold.</seg>
<seg id=940> The 1960s have ended in a collapse of the system ’ and ‘ by a major financial turmoil, accompanied by a wave inflationary prices of goods.</seg>
<seg id=941> Everyone has been struck and America's role on the world stage has been shaken.</seg>
<seg id=942> A similar collapse at the moment should have a slightly different.</seg>
<seg id=943> The system of current floating rates is more stable and adjustment costs distributed differently.</seg>
<seg id=944> The majority of Americans do not suffer many marked the fall of the dollar because sellers foreigners must make adjustments prices for the American market.</seg>
<seg id=945> The Asian economies developing vigorously and their central banks their rely on the US.</seg>
<seg id=946> They should continue this policy not to see their export sectors suffer a sudden failure on the American market capital.</seg>
<seg id=947> The US and more time to deal with a current account deficit will prove that do not viable in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=948> The economically dynamic regions of the world (North America and Asia) is bound by a Pact that will ensure the continuity of the centrality of the US dollar.</seg>
<seg id=949> The Americans accumulate debts because Asians encourage them.</seg>
<seg id=950> The repeal of the Pact would be contrary to the interests of both parties.</seg>
<seg id=951> It is not an American unilateralism because the Pact means cooperation with Asia.</seg>
<seg id=952> But for Europeans, who are excluded from Pact, this Pact resembles a unilateralism monetary and economic.</seg>
<seg id=953> Meanwhile, the supremacy of the euro on the dollar suffer European industrial exporters.</seg>
<seg id=954> Europe is not, however, able to alleviate them.</seg>
<seg id=955> Europe will indeed the greatest clashes victim of the new currency.</seg>
<seg id=956> The answers pronostiquées in the 1960's (restoration of the gold standard or invention of a common European currency) no longer seem very useful.</seg>
<seg id=957> A single currency did not yield substantial protection.</seg>
<seg id=958> The old version of the European reaction (what psychologists call "the envy of the dollar ') will only more pervasive.</seg>
<seg id=959> The European Central Bank will be invited to extend the monetary base, as if the imitation of the dollar was the answer to all the structural and demographic industrial problems, which are invading Europe.</seg>
<seg id=960> But we should remember that Europe's problems are not manipulation of currencies.</seg>
<seg id=961> Protests against the new version of the exorbitant monetary privilege of America, must be seen for what they are: a means to compensate for a real European powerlessness.</seg>
<seg id=962> The envy of the dollar is therefore prepared to disappear and it is international, the value of the dollar will disappear without causing adverse effects on the people who clearly print and use it.</seg>
<seg id=963> An epidemic of policy</seg>
<seg id=964> The Americans, as the citizens of all the countries of the world, came to accept the fact that the policy plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public representatives.</seg>
<seg id=965> Few of us are surprised (although some can be disappointed) when a federal judge or a diplomat senior is appointed because he has managed a crucial test of fidelity to an important principle in the eyes of the Party of the President or the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id=966> But science, in the view of all, occupies a place and on this point, the US are beginning to serve as an example of warning to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=967> Scientific appointments must be based on objective criteria training, competence and performance.</seg>
<seg id=968> Clearly, it is legitimate to ask a future Secretary health services and human ssh () on its views on abortion.</seg>
<seg id=969> But it is totally inappropriate to submit the shortlisted candidates to meet in scientific advisory committees tests political loyalty.</seg>
<seg id=970> Similarly, membership of bodies examining the scientific proposals, a crucial process for scientific progress, should undoubtedly be shedding all barriers that are unrelated to the professional qualifications.</seg>
<seg id=971> Unfortunately, scientists in the US is increasingly often these barriers.</seg>
<seg id=972> During the autumn of last year, the Journal science published several reports on the issue.</seg>
<seg id=973> One of these was massive reports on replacing Member of the Advisory Committee of the National Centre for environmental health, which is part of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), without prior consultation of the director of the centre.</seg>
<seg id=974> Similar cases have also been observed in the British Advisory Committee we lead poisoning and prevention, the British Advisory Committee we CDC national human research protections and the British Advisory Committee we genetic testing.</seg>
<seg id=975> The current epidemic ideology, in which the advisory committees are dissolved can retrained with new members, and where the candidates are subject to strict tests of loyalty, seems outdated some observers.</seg>
<seg id=976> The representatives of the ssh referred to as a 'common practice fairly. "</seg>
<seg id=977> It is not a practice in America, or at least not until today.</seg>
<seg id=978> In any case, the fact that the Bush administration pragmatically move tests to candidates in key positions in order to determine their compatibility with its "values" is not really worrying.</seg>
<seg id=979> The most alarming development concerns the degree of importance ideological investigations, which interfering in areas until then unaffected against such manipulation.</seg>
<seg id=980> Indeed, the most revealing in this epidemic growing policy may have concerned the revision of belonging to the section of study of the National Institute of occupational safety and health, assessing the subsidies to the study of the wounds that occurred in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=981> The advisory committees could be vulnerable to an occasional overhaul of this kind in the past.</seg>
<seg id=982> After all, they recommend the policies that politicians will take into account.</seg>
<seg id=983> But the sections of study?</seg>
<seg id=984> In October 2002, science published an editorial David michaels and many of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id=985> Several of them were distinguished former officials who participated in some of the relevant committees and they have made a valuable point of view, based on their personal experience.</seg>
<seg id=986> Article was a matter itself, but the consequences it had were even more interesting.</seg>
<seg id=987> It has triggered a stolen in letters which scientists mentioned similar experiences.</seg>
<seg id=988> A candidate for muscular dystrophy research coordinating committee of the National Institute of Health has told me that an inquiry was carried out on it by a Member of the White House.</seg>
<seg id=989> Having been invited to raise his views on the various policies of the Bush administration, which no one she had no connection with the work of the Committee, she had to indicate whether it supported the policy of President on embryonic stem cells.</seg>
<seg id=990> Another person to be shown, a Professor distinguished psychiatry and psychology has told have received a call for the White House regarding his nomination to national Council on drug abuse.</seg>
<seg id=991> His interlocutor has said that we should make an inquiry on him to "whether his views could embarrass President".</seg>
<seg id=992> According to Professor, a series of issues was ensuivie, the representative of the White House taking a wage rating.</seg>
<seg id=993> Example: "you have achieved two to three; the President is opposed to the exchange needles intravenous drug users [to] for moral reasons, whatever the result."</seg>
<seg id=994> Then the conversation took a more frightening.</seg>
<seg id=995> The representative asked the candidate if it had voted for Bush and, after having received a negative reply, he asked: 'why do you not supported President? "</seg>
<seg id=996> This attitude resembles a dictatorship, and not a democracy.</seg>
<seg id=997> The objective of scientific advisory committees is to advise impartial and thoughtful in the political process.</seg>
<seg id=998> There is nothing to gain and much to lose, when a result desired policy is highlighted.</seg>
<seg id=999> That is why the determination of research projects to support has always been a matter to be considered objectively peer, and not by politicians.</seg>
<seg id=1000> In fact, the law that applies here (the law on the federal advisory committees, the Federal Advisory Committee act) requires explicitly that the committees are impartial and "inappropriately uninfluenced by the authority with the power to appoint."</seg>
<seg id=1001> The American Secretary for health services and human Tommy Thompson and the office of the staff of the White House should set an example to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1002> They can achieve very easily: within the law.</seg>
<seg id=1003> Killing to Moscow</seg>
<seg id=1004> It is time to put an end to the myth that the "dictatorship of law" of Vladimir Putin has made the Postcommunist Russia a little more law-abiding.</seg>
<seg id=1005> The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one journalists among the best and most courageous Russia, a woman who dared to uncover the brutal murder committed by the Russian soldiers in Chechnya, is the ultimate proof that President Putin does runs a dictatorship trivial ordinary showing contempt for the law.</seg>
<seg id=1006> It is time for the rest of the world to recognise this, particularly for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1007> The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing a policy on relations between Russia and Germany, which should ratify indifference to the lack of respect for the law shown by Putin as national interest of the most powerful Member of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1008> But indifference is becoming the conciliation when it encourages Putin to continue on this path in the international arena, as demonstrated by its current campaign to strangle economically Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1009> The murder of Politkovskaya has a sinister taste of déjà vu: just as in the days of the kbg glory in Putin's Russia people disappear, simply.</seg>
<seg id=1010> The murder of Politkovskaya is the third murder apparently policy three week.</seg>
<seg id=1011> Ziganshin Enver, chief engineer BP Russia, was killed by the ball irkoutsk 30 September.</seg>
<seg id=1012> Andrei Kozlov, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Russia who led a campaign against financial fraud, was murdered on 14 September.</seg>
<seg id=1013> The fact that the Prosecutor General Yuri tchaïka Russia takes the investigation into the murder of Politkovskaya, as it did for the Kozlov, is not source of hope, as would be the case in a real democracy if such a high official was in an investigation.</seg>
<seg id=1014> In fact, the involvement of the highest levels of government in Russia is virtually an assurance that the murderer will never be found.</seg>
<seg id=1015> The murder of Politkovskaya is a particularly sinister omen when one considers the fact that it had strong criticism to the Russian President.</seg>
<seg id=1016> In its articles for one of the few newspapers still independent of Moscow, novaïa gazeta, and in his books "Putin's Russia: life in a democracy faulty" and "a dirty war: a Russian journalist commented on in Chechnya ’ Politkovskaya suppressing liberties which sign the presidency of Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1017> As the fate of the old businessmen and Vladimir gusinki Boris berezovski exiles, and the imprisoned oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the fate of the enemies of Putin can take three forms: exile, the prison or the grave.</seg>
<seg id=1018> I am not accuse Putin's government to have ordered the murder of Politkovskaya.</seg>
<seg id=1019> After all, as investigative journalists in campaign, it has also Putin sum-total many other people, including the current Prime Minister Chechen Ramzan Kadyrov is not least, she accused of pursuing a policy of kidnappings against ransoms.</seg>
<seg id=1020> But even if the associated Vladimir Putin had nothing to do with the murder by ball of Politkovskaya in a lift his office of central Moscow, its disregard for the law has created a climate in which the murder was carried out.</seg>
<seg id=1021> The image of the murder of Thomas Beckett in its Cathedral of Canterbury there are many centuries, the crime was committed with the clear conviction that King would be satisfied.</seg>
<seg id=1022> Given what was Politkovskaya -- the responsibility of a democratic press questioning the Kremlin and its policies — the government should ensure that he would nothing.</seg>
<seg id=1023> Putin's Russia has already lost 12 prominent journalists, murdered during the past six years.</seg>
<seg id=1024> None of these crimes has been cleared up, which would not be the case if the "dictatorship of law" Putin was something other than a simple public relations strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1025> The six years that have passed since the arrival of Vladimir Putin was marked by the Kremlin signals deeply contradictory.</seg>
<seg id=1026> On the one hand, the world is a young leader graduate undertake to modernize Russia, and particularly to align law enforcement and judicial practices on international standards.</seg>
<seg id=1027> On the other hand, President merely look silent when its former colleagues Russian security services FSB (the former KGB) do not protect those who are being murdered, and even launch a series of espionage Affairs notorious against journalists, scientists and environmental activists.</seg>
<seg id=1028> Among these "néo-espions" are the journalist Gregori Pasko, the expert on arms control Igor soutiagine, the diplomat Valentin moiseïev Valentin danilov physicist, and others.</seg>
<seg id=1029> That means rely civilising influence being a Western partner, chairing a G8 summit in St. Petersburg, for example, seems to count for nothing in the Kremlin Cabal Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1030> Once again, the contact with the values of the West gave birth to another Potemkin village; Russia is a facade of laws and democratic rules, but behind this stage of the same butes carton-pâte arbitrary making the law.</seg>
<seg id=1031> At world level, the danger is that lawlessness shown by Putin exports.</seg>
<seg id=1032> Near the Russian border, a form of diplomacy criminalised is to take root.</seg>
<seg id=1033> Think of how Putin tried to rigging elections in Ukraine, and the allegations leveled and removed without cesses against the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko.</seg>
<seg id=1034> Consider the francs-tireurs secessionist regions in Moldova and Georgia, who only exist because they have the support of the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1035> Look as the Kremlin tries to sing its neighbours in threatening their energy supplies.</seg>
<seg id=1036> We all know that when police ignores the behaviour of criminals, they only become more audacious.</seg>
<seg id=1037> It is high time that the world to recognise Vladimir Putin for what it is: a man who back Russia to countries of the shadows.</seg>
<seg id=1038> The world must now consider this old Latin saying that tacet consentere videtur: who says nothing agrees, and whether it is really wise to make peace to the construction by Putin a superpower energy where the law does not matter.</seg>
<seg id=1039> A pipeline to strengthen the empire of Russia</seg>
<seg id=1040> Gerhard Schröder, there is less than a month, was still German Chancellor has agreed to become President of the company responsible for the construction of ‘ a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea and Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1041> In many countries, Schröder would be easily accused of crime of conflict of interest.</seg>
<seg id=1042> Its apparent failure morality is amplified by the fact that, at the same time, Russia threat to stop the gas supplies to Ukraine if it does not give in to tariff requirements Gazprom, the gas giant state property of the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1043> The strategic goal of Russia is obvious. Currently no longer distribute gas Ukraine also means that a good part of Europe will not nitrate directive, because most of the major pipelines cross the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id=1044> Bypassing Ukraine, Poland and, of course, the Baltic States, the new pipeline will strengthen the influence of the Kremlin who sought to impose new in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1045> President Vladimir Putin and his government of clones of the former KGB will no longer to care reactions of Western Europe when they decide how firmness put pressure on the Postcommunist neighbors Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1046> Europe really should provide Putin of such a weapon imperialist?</seg>
<seg id=1047> Worse still, Russia should use this weapon for the EU to its boot energy?</seg>
<seg id=1048> That a former German Chancellor takes the leadership of the company that will provide Russia the way to manipulate the European economy demonstrates the dangerous adequacy of Europe in tackling ambitions néo-impérialistes Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1049> Of course, the Russian media are aware of the growing dependence of Europe by reports to Russia ’ s energy resources.</seg>
<seg id=1050> They are so to délecter. éditorialistes Russians have written ‘ when we have integrated and extended our energy trade with Europe, it must remain silent on the issue of human rights. '</seg>
<seg id=1051> Putin expresses this position more indirect undertaking to continue what he calls a "independence" policy.</seg>
<seg id=1052> Thus, want simply say that Russia should remain 'independent' concerns of Western democracies on the ethics and human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1053> It may be that some European leaders really believe that maintaining the soft prosperity for the EU to be silent about human rights and other issues which niggling the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1054> Of course, we must briefly comment on the issues trade "," as expropriation YUKOS. If the Kremlin were to pay our values and our critical towards it -- as over Chechnya bloodstained -- it seems that Europeans silent would rather than to confront a potential energy prices, or even a blockade, such as that which Ukraine is currently facing.</seg>
<seg id=1055> Even though Putin reorganize its court, by putting the Duma to its will, the hopes of the EU that Russia become increasingly 'European' should be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=1056> Russia that Putin is building has gradually transformed. It has changed its hopes of freedom post-Soviet to become a bulwark oil and gas in favour of the new elite of the former KGB.</seg>
<seg id=1057> Indeed, warnig Matthias, the director of the gas pipeline consortium chaired by Schröder, is a longstanding friend Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1058> Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal revealed that warnig arm, the director of the Russian Dresdner Bank, is a ex-officier the Stasi, the former secret police of East Germany, and that he met Putin in the late 1980s when the Russian President was KGB spy in the GDR.</seg>
<seg id=1059> That Russians accept a government formed former KGB men, where the lack of compassion and the refusal to dissent are the rule, reflects exhaustion towards the uproar the last twenty years.</seg>
<seg id=1060> Now, the Kremlin thinks that what is good for the Russians basic is also for citizens of independent nations. No mercy will only be granted to the smaller countries weak once Russia will the means to intimidate, to isolate and threatening them with energy blockade.</seg>
<seg id=1061> As a former head of state of the new independent Lithuania, I have often had such threats.</seg>
<seg id=1062> The European Union signed many agreements with Russia, including on a common '"area of freedom and justice.</seg>
<seg id=1063> The Kremlin is very strong to pretend that idealism.</seg>
<seg id=1064> Its control of Eastern Europe has always been imposed on the basis of ‘ treaties of friendship ’ and the Soviet invasions in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were missions fraternal '. "</seg>
<seg id=1065> But look how Putin flouts this area 'common': a barbarous treatment of Chechens, imprisonment business Mikhail Khodorkovsky, harassment of foreign NGOs and the accusation of yuliya Tymoshenko, one of égéries the Orange Revolution, by the Russian military judges burden completely invented.</seg>
<seg id=1066> If Europeans believe sincerely in their common area of human rights and freedoms, they must nevertheless acknowledge that these values are not shared by the henchmen calculating Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1067> The same applies with regard to regard Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=1068> Is it really possible that the homeland of the ‘ red terror unpunished the crimes of the Soviet era and hands dirty still blood of the Lithuanians the Caucasians really can help combat the global threat wielded by Iran and North Korea?</seg>
<seg id=1069> It seems more likely that the Kremlin cold minds will exploit every crisis to increase their power of destruction and influence.</seg>
<seg id=1070> For decades, the region of Europe, where I come from, has been left at the mercy of evil.</seg>
<seg id=1071> This is why I cannot remain silent when Europe blindly in a new ass falls appeasement.</seg>
<seg id=1072> We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have learned from our history that behind every act hides a diplomatic Russia imperialist ambition.</seg>
<seg id=1073> Western Europeans, who have forgotten this history, should heed our warnings.</seg>
<seg id=1074> The dependence on Russia -- even if it takes the face of the so-called "charismatic 'Gerhard Schröder -- can only lead law in the wall.</seg>
<seg id=1075> Iraq: shots against the ballots</seg>
<seg id=1076> When the Iraq war began in 2003, the Bush administration caressait ambitious projects: the image of the post-1945 Germany and Japan, a long and peaceful occupation was envisaged, during which the increase in oil production would ensure a growing prosperity at the same time as the democratic structures bureaucracies would piece by piece.</seg>
<seg id=1077> The Foundation should be a constitution liberal or premium post-modern, with the guarantee of 25% of parliamentary seats assured women.</seg>
<seg id=1078> Current Iraq has no peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1079> The Constitution must be voted on 15 October includes this rule of 25%, but has nothing Liberal.</seg>
<seg id=1080> The disposition-clé (Article 2) stating that no law cannot contradict unchallenged "laws of Islam 'violates the basic principles of parliamentary sovereignty, and block the legislation to correspond to the international standards.</seg>
<seg id=1081> For example, the age of consent to sex for girls cannot be high above nine years, because Mohammed itself was a wife nine years.</seg>
<seg id=1082> It follows that girls nine years are also adults in terms of the criminal law, and reasonable of the death penalty, for example, conversion to another religion.</seg>
<seg id=1083> The Shia can use this clause put their ayatollahs above the elected Parliament, as in Iran, because they alone are allowed to determine the "laws," of Islam.</seg>
<seg id=1084> Foreigners and the few Liberals Iraqis worry above all of this of Islamic clause, but opposition to the Constitution, widespread among Sunnis, seeks other provisions: exclusion of 'Baath Party saddamiste "of political life and the government, and the federalists who 18 provinces autonomy to the Iraqi and allow them to join in regional governments.</seg>
<seg id=1085> The law of exclusion is a personal problem for the elites Sunni, which include thousands of businessmen, Liberals, even of artists who, with a few exceptions, were all Members of the Baath.</seg>
<seg id=1086> In theory, the constitutional ban may not be retroactively.</seg>
<seg id=1087> In practice, however, the administrative laws are now implemented to exclude the members of the so-called "Baath high-ranking" of any form of employment the government, which affects thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id=1088> Sunnis would without doubt the federalists provisions if they were applied to the Kurds.</seg>
<seg id=1089> They know that the alternative is not a return to centralism but the secession of the three Kurdish provinces majority of dahuk Arbil and, as sulaymaniyah to form an independent Kurdistan, with its own treasury, its army (the pesh merga), and its oil production around Kirkuk, second largest reserve of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=1090> Sunnis reject the same federalism Shiite because they see them as fellow Arabs who have always accepted the Sunni law in the past and will do so again, unless they have their own government.</seg>
<seg id=1091> That is what would the new Constitution, because the southern provinces - who have the main Iraqi oil supplies - Shiite majority could form their own regional government.</seg>
<seg id=1092> In the usual style of the Middle East, leaders Sunnis disappointed and unhappy with the Constitution now threaten to use violence.</seg>
<seg id=1093> But federalism is not the only reason why the supporters of the Sunni supremacy and Islamists administer the lethal attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1094> Their opposition is more fundamental: they do not accept the principle of democratic government by the majority.</seg>
<seg id=1095> Instead, they seek to restore the rule of the Sunni minority.</seg>
<seg id=1096> For the Islamists, all the Shia deserve death anyway, as apostates.</seg>
<seg id=1097> A Shi'ite leader, moqtada Sadr, also vehemently opposed to federalism.</seg>
<seg id=1098> His supporters, largely illiterate, are the poorest and violent Shiites slums in Baghdad and beyond 'militia, whose "mahdi fought American troops in 2004, even while the Americans protected Shia, Sunnis attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1099> As a young priest draws its authority of his father, a populist itself, Ayatollah died Sadr faces the ayatollahs live Iraqi opposition which hold ignorance and its violence.</seg>
<seg id=1100> Sadr absolutely cannot compete with them in terms of religious authority, thus chooses to take a party arabe-nationaliste against them, recalling often that the highest Shiite cleric Ayatollah sistani, Arab is not but Persia.</seg>
<seg id=1101> Similarly, it reminds his followers that the El, Mr Hakim, who lead the Supreme Council of the Islamic revolution in Iraq (sciri) and their 'militia badr "were subsidized exiles in Iran, which many fought the Iranian side during the long and bitter Iran-Iraq war, until the Americans' bring them back."</seg>
<seg id=1102> Sadr opposes the federalism because a Shiite obéirait regional government of its enemies, and the sciri sistani, he says, and would fall under the aegis of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=1103> To highlight his message, Sadr sent its militia men combat the badr successfully in Baghdad, where the mahdis many, but not in Najaf, where Sadr loathed is following the destruction he has caused last year until its men were massacred by the Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1104> It was difficult enough to confront Sadr the villain. Now, a political calculation simple suggests that it will probably be the main character to decide the outcome of the vote of the Constitution in October.</seg>
<seg id=1105> For rejecting the Constitution and cause of new elections a constitutional assembly, opponents need a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces.</seg>
<seg id=1106> The Sunnis are likely to win that in two provinces, but if Sadr ordered his supporters of slums of Baghdad to vote no with local Sunnis, it will probably fall the capital in the hands of the opponents of the Constitution and ensure his defeat.</seg>
<seg id=1107> As rogue all political Sadr is naturally to sell.</seg>
<seg id=1108> Last year it was sought for murder.</seg>
<seg id=1109> Today it seeks recognition as a statesman, he wants money, and, at least implicitly sistani, humiliating and the sciri.</seg>
<seg id=1110> It may well be proposals and negotiations might even have already begun.</seg>
<seg id=1111> But some Shia it attack with words and bullets have thousands of armed men available to them and for them, it deserves bullets that in return.</seg>
<seg id=1112> The end of secrecy</seg>
<seg id=1113> Transparency is not always an easy in the new democracies of Eastern Europe. This is what discovered the Prime Minister Ferenc gyurcsany, when a registration in which he had the lies of his government has triggered riots.</seg>
<seg id=1114> Post-Communist such as Hungary, Romania has endeavoured to encourage openness and honesty in a society that used among the most closed in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1115> But the persistence of a culture of secrecy has bombed corruption and abuses of power.</seg>
<seg id=1116> It is, however, a real development towards greater transparency, recognised by the European Union which gave the green light to Romania for membership at the beginning of the year 2007.</seg>
<seg id=1117> In addition to the establishment of what the EU is today for a "functioning market economy", the essential reforms in the political field and legal, for which I am responsible, will strengthen the transparency and control of the funding of political parties to the reorganisation of the judicial system.</seg>
<seg id=1118> Judicial reform contribute to eradicate corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1119> The ministers and the former ministers, members of Parliament, magistrates, lawyers, and the members of the police, customs and other public bodies and private entrepreneurs, have been indicted.</seg>
<seg id=1120> Furthermore, new forms have been developed for the declaration of assets and financial interests by people in official duties in government, Parliament, in public administration and local and in the judicial system.</seg>
<seg id=1121> The new ways of declaration are the more detailed in Europe and, above all, they are made public.</seg>
<seg id=1122> Romania's progress are confirmed by a report published this month, according to which the people of Eastern Europe now have access to information government as well as those of long established democracies.</seg>
<seg id=1123> The report transparency and silence, the open society justice initiative (available on www.justiceinitiative.org), even says that the new democracies are sometimes better than the former Romanian government bodies: some are more to requests for information of citizens that their French counterparts or Spanish.</seg>
<seg id=1124> More precisely, 60% of applications are met in Romania, against 31% in France and 24% in Spain.</seg>
<seg id=1125> Among the other good pupils might include Peru and Mexico, two countries that adopted legislation on freedom of information in 2002, shortly after Romania.</seg>
<seg id=1126> However, it is not always easier to access to sensitive information in democracies in transition.</seg>
<seg id=1127> As a lawyer I worked for the defence of human rights in the Helsinki Committee of Romania, and we have often had to seize the courts to demand information, under the Romanian law of 2001 for freedom of information.</seg>
<seg id=1128> For example, when we officially obtained access to data on telephone tapping permitted by the Prosecutor General, it has simply ignored this decision.</seg>
<seg id=1129> We have attacked the civil and the judge has set a fine for each day late in the communication of information.</seg>
<seg id=1130> It is only when the media were interested in the case that data – number of interceptions permitted during the previous ten years, persons and duration of operations - have been made public.</seg>
<seg id=1131> Romania has finally started to turn our backs on a past marked by the omnipresence of the securitate.</seg>
<seg id=1132> I am now part of the government, and I realize that it is not always evident share some information with the public.</seg>
<seg id=1133> But sometimes painful reforms are needed.</seg>
<seg id=1134> We would not have carried out the economic and political reforms that will enable us to join the EU without our policies to the public and without accepting the greater participation of citizens in the decision-making process which accompanies inevitably such openness.</seg>
<seg id=1135> In fact, access to information has become a sine qua non of democracy throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id=1136> When the US have adopted the Freedom of Information Act in 1966, they were the only, with Sweden and Finland.</seg>
<seg id=1137> Today, 65 countries have acquired for such legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1138> In Romania, those who fought for the adoption of a law on freedom of information take full advantage.</seg>
<seg id=1139> According to the study of justice initiative, the people who come to the Romanian Government receive without any great difficulty of the information he would have been unthinkable to communicate years ago.</seg>
<seg id=1140> Thus, the Romanian Ministry of Defence has leaked the number of soldiers who died in 2003, and the circumstances (including 13 suicides, two deaths shot dead, and two in Afghanistan).</seg>
<seg id=1141> Another example, the Court of Bucharest has received a request concerning the number of judges have been the subject of a disciplinary procedure since the beginning of the year 2000, and the motives of the sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=1142> The tribunal sent this request to the Board of Governors of the courts, which has given a full reply: four pages listing all the magistrates punished, motives and measures taken.</seg>
<seg id=1143> This process is both the fruit and the motor of the pursuit of reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1144> The rulers have not always been very comfortable with openness, and the battle continues for the most sensitive documents.</seg>
<seg id=1145> But in the Postcommunist countries, the benefits of transparency are undeniable.</seg>
<seg id=1146> However, the experience of Romania shows that the official secrecy is always a threat, no country is immune, and only a vigilance can prevent it undermine the very foundations of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1147> Save trees of life</seg>
<seg id=1148> No one can conclude its day without using a derivative of forests.</seg>
<seg id=1149> In a far more important than we normally believes, the paper on which it is written, water flowing of our taps, medicines that treating us, wood which our homes and our furniture are made all of forests.</seg>
<seg id=1150> Forests we give fresh air that we breathe and where endangered species.</seg>
<seg id=1151> They also offer places leisure, which is becoming increasingly important in the complexity of our world.</seg>
<seg id=1152> Approximately 1.5 billion people living in rural areas poor depend directly forests to their basic needs in food and firewood.</seg>
<seg id=1153> However, deforestation is continuing.</seg>
<seg id=1154> Every year, we lose 14.6 million hectares of forest, is an area nearly as much as four times Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id=1155> The irresponsible management of forests, exacerbated by regulations and government too weak, and the markets which reward slaughter all illegal conspire to deprive the world's most precious its forests and the greatest risk.</seg>
<seg id=1156> When forests are beginning to disappear, a whole environmental, social and economic problems are generally, which affect us all in one way or another.</seg>
<seg id=1157> The island Sumatra in Indonesia is a good example.</seg>
<seg id=1158> Companies of pasta and papers are an endemic and illegal destruction of forests that contain greater diversity of plants in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1159> It is likely that plants unknown will disappear in the process as the endangered species such as the elephant rhino and Sumatra, as orang-outang.</seg>
<seg id=1160> When the forest Sumatra will have disappeared, whole communities will also places of life without appropriate means or decent earn their living.</seg>
<seg id=1161> Moreover, the distortion that trade in illegal products and cheap products imposes upon world markets is cause difficulties for people responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1162> The developing countries are losing $15 billion tax revenue every year to slaughter illegal.</seg>
<seg id=1163> Complicating the wood all, the demand for reconstruction following the tsunami last year, has intensified a request already unsustainable towards the forests Sumatra.</seg>
<seg id=1164> The Amazon dams and the Congo are subject to similar threats.</seg>
<seg id=1165> A recent study of the United Nations, the Millennium assessment of ecosystems (em), shows that forests and other important areas have a serious decline in their poor management and will continue to disappear if serious protective measures are not put in place.</seg>
<seg id=1166> The information published by the Brazilian Government show that deforestation of forests irreplaceable in the Amazon, because of the agricultural conversion, has reached 2.6 million hectares last year, which is the total area of deforestation of the Amazon 17%.</seg>
<seg id=1167> But the battle against deforestation is not yet lost.</seg>
<seg id=1168> Various organisations, movements defence and businesses concerned about the state of global forests are working together to overturn the phenomenon of deforestation and improve the management of forests.</seg>
<seg id=1169> Thus, for example, the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) and the World Bank have helped the Brazilian Government to launch an initiative to establish new areas of forest protection over 17 million hectares in the form of national parks.</seg>
<seg id=1170> The cooperation of the WWF and the World Bank has also motivated other partners to establish a trust fund to manage these protected areas in perpetuity.</seg>
<seg id=1171> Similarly, a summit meeting of the leaders of the countries of the Congo Basin enabled cross-border cooperation for the conservation of forests and their proper management.</seg>
<seg id=1172> All this has led by the following the release of USD 53 million from the US State Department to promote the conservation of forests of Congo.</seg>
<seg id=1173> Since the first meeting of leaders in 1999, 3.5 million hectares of protected areas have recently been organised in the Congo Basin.</seg>
<seg id=1174> However, given the consequences of the Asian tsunami last December, the weight of arguments provided by the em and statistics on deforestation of the most critical, we must continue our efforts.</seg>
<seg id=1175> The World Bank and the WWF have recently promised to work towards the reduction of 10% of global deforestation rate for 2010 and to work with the institutions of the public and private sectors to allow ambitious achievements in the conservation of forests.</seg>
<seg id=1176> The WWF studies show that if global forests are shared between various uses, including the protection of certain areas, the commercial management responsible and the restoration of forest landscape, we can provide for the world needs forest products while retaining the environmental and social values essential to our near future.</seg>
<seg id=1177> The business leaders, governments, civil society organisations must play their role in achieving this vision.</seg>
<seg id=1178> The Saudis fanatics are?</seg>
<seg id=1179> The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have led many to question the prospects for survival of the House of Saud ruling and to consider the question of whether the Kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive or not.</seg>
<seg id=1180> For one reason or another, it seems that the Saudi society has led to a course of violent fanaticism inspired in extreme religious orthodoxy.</seg>
<seg id=1181> The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers who participated in the attacks of September 11, 2001 were Saudis against the US has crystallised a deep-rooted perception of the Kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.</seg>
<seg id=1182> In some ways, this perception is right, but it cannot be applied to the Saudi people as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=1183> On the contrary, it would be a mistake to assume that Islam fanatic defines entirely Saudi attitudes towards religion.</seg>
<seg id=1184> Between 2001 and 2003, I was part of a team of a study on a large scale of values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, Iran.</seg>
<seg id=1185> Our results produced a image remarkably nuanced Saudi attitudes.</seg>
<seg id=1186> Respondents capita compared with other countries in the Middle East, the Saudis were the less religious of all in general, and their attitudes towards democracy and the underlying feeling marriages show a moderate.</seg>
<seg id=1187> It is true that in the four countries, religiosity is widespread, more than 90% of respondents indicating collectively they believe in God, in a life after death, and heaven and hell.</seg>
<seg id=1188> But the Saudis seem less religious that their cohorts Muslims.</seg>
<seg id=1189> 62% of the Saudis are described as individuals against religious 82% of Iranians, 85% of Jordanians and 98% of Egyptians.</seg>
<seg id=1190> The Americans also appear to be more religious than the Saudis, with 81%.</seg>
<seg id=1191> This variation can be explained in part by transnational differences on the meaning of the term "Religion."</seg>
<seg id=1192> For example, the Americans can define religiosity differently from inhabitants of the countries of the Middle East, with perhaps a commitment less pronounced religious beliefs in Islamic countries.</seg>
<seg id=1193> This could also see in part of the differences between the Muslim countries.</seg>
<seg id=1194> But the gap between the Saudis and the Iranians, Jordanians and the Egyptians of the other autodéfinie religion, is so great that it challenge the widespread perception of an extremely conservative Saudi Arabia and religious.</seg>
<seg id=1195> Indeed, the actions are more parlantes that the words: only 28% of the Saudis said that they were sitting religious services weekly against 27% of Iranians, 44% of Jordanians, 42% of Egyptians and 45% of Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1196> These conclusions, though contrary to perceptions Saudi popular culture, are less surprising that they do appear.</seg>
<seg id=1197> Sociologists religion are longstanding supporters in an environment religious monolithic, or when the religious institutions are closely linked to the state, religiosity global population decline.</seg>
<seg id=1198> It is sensible to believe that when the state authorities apply rigid behavioural codes, individuals tend to rebel and from religious institutions officially established.</seg>
<seg id=1199> So it is hardly surprising that the Egyptians and Jordanians, who live in countries in which the State does not apply religiosity, that the Iranians are more religious or the Saudis, which must deal with the police in the local "virtuous" supported by the state.</seg>
<seg id=1200> Even on the issue of marriage, many Saudis have expressed opinions surprisingly liberal.</seg>
<seg id=1201> The respondents were shared almost equally on the issue of marriages, half supporting the idea that marriage must be based on consent mothers, against 48% who love as basis marriage.</seg>
<seg id=1202> Given the gender segregation and the dominance paternal firmly, this looks reveal a strong desire to individual choice more marked in what has always been traditionally family a decision.</seg>
<seg id=1203> Finally, the Saudis reveal the supporters of democracy, contradicting once again the image of conservatism widespread Saudi.</seg>
<seg id=1204> On all the Saudis interviewed, 58% saw democracy as the best form of government that is, 23% were in disagreement and 18% have not.</seg>
<seg id=1205> The massive support for democracy in a country without history seems contre-intuitif secular and nationalist.</seg>
<seg id=1206> In fact, support for democracy corresponds to several other liberal attitudes that we noticed in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=1207> Advocates of democracy tend to be less religious, more age-old more tolerant towards others, more critical of the actions of the public sector, and more worried by the western cultural invasion.</seg>
<seg id=1208> Data beyond the study, history has shown that the liberal ideas are becoming more widespread when a despotic monarch governs, with the support of a religious institution.</seg>
<seg id=1209> There is a strong movement of liberalism arose at the end of the nineteenth century in Syria's religious despotism Ottoman in response to the Sultan abdulhamid.</seg>
<seg id=1210> At the same time, a secular movement on behalf of anti-clérical constitutionalism appeared in Iran, in reaction to the absolutist alliance between the shahs quajar and religious institution.</seg>
<seg id=1211> In the light of the similarities between these precedents historical and current conditions in Saudi Arabia, we should not rule out the possibility of reform.</seg>
<seg id=1212> The data study also suggest that the Saudis could very well demand a policy more transparent and less interventionist a religion.</seg>
<seg id=1213> The European museum</seg>
<seg id=1214> By the end of the nineteenth century, Asia accounted for Europeans a source of inspiration art or the target of imperialist ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1215> Conversely, Europe was a symbol of modernity - for the Japanese meiji -- or decadence -- for the Chinese.</seg>
<seg id=1216> A century later, thanks to the Japanese economic miracle, Europeans considered at least a small part of Asia as a centre for rapid industrial and technological progress.</seg>
<seg id=1217> Today, at the dawn of the 21st century, the mutual perceptions of Europe and Asia are changing radically, with the Asian economies flourishing and a European Union in full identity crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1218> Some important Asian personalities, such as former Prime Minister singapourien Lee Kuan Yew, issue warnings Europeans: if they continue along this path, their continent will soon have no interest for tourism and real estate high-end.</seg>
<seg id=1219> A businessman Chinese influential, who share his time between Hong Kong and London, was even more precise.</seg>
<seg id=1220> He said a few weeks ago, during a demonstration in Paris private gathering political leaders and big businessmen: "You are becoming the countries of the developing world: you are wasting your time with the Constitution, the welfare state, the crisis in the funding of pensions, and you give systematically bad answers to the questions you have raised."</seg>
<seg id=1221> The idea that Europeans are Asia in general, and China in particular, is more complex. It is adapting lucid to a new competitor to the rejection respectable ideological pure and simple.</seg>
<seg id=1222> In mai1968, some French students took to the streets to invent a new world dreamt of Mao's China, a country yet plunged into a brutal cultural revolution and unreasonable.</seg>
<seg id=1223> This infatuation absurd was the result of both the ignorance of the crimes of the Maoist regime, that of slackness felt in a prosperous society close to full employment.</seg>
<seg id=1224> Today, their heirs openly criticise the Asian capitalist model.</seg>
<seg id=1225> China, once star anti-capitalist utopian revolutionary, has become the enemy ultra-liberal feared by a new generation of utopian reactionary who defend the status quo in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1226> Students who demonstrated recently in the streets of Paris do not want to emulate the Chinese and the Indians; they reject the logic of globalisation and the abandonment of hard-won social achievements.</seg>
<seg id=1227> The European economic elites attitude is very different.</seg>
<seg id=1228> They have understood that always intentionally post-colonial views of nostalgia, that China and India are large export markets and huge reservoirs of cheap Labor, are obsolete.</seg>
<seg id=1229> These countries have become real competitors worthy of respect and admiration.</seg>
<seg id=1230> The quality, the costs and the deadlines of delivery – in the car industry for example - are reaching the European level.</seg>
<seg id=1231> Europe retains an advantage in scientific disciplines, as in the pharmaceutical industry, but new businesses very efficient, especially in India, are increasingly to recruit of graduates mit and Harvard, -- and with still lower wage costs -- to remain competitive at world level.</seg>
<seg id=1232> Unfortunately, if European leaders have realised Asian challenge, they have not managed to translate it into a lesson of realism in a globalised world irresistible, or a call to arms in the social field and economic.</seg>
<seg id=1233> In fact, the European politicians, with a few exceptions as Tony Blair, have too late to adapt to fulgurantes developments in Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1234> Without long-term strategy, and obsessed with short-term interests, Europe's politicians - unlike the heads of undertakings - have not won respect their Asian counterparts.</seg>
<seg id=1235> Is that, on a continent which has failed to bury the past and to end the spectre of nationalism, the EU is also a model for reconciliation, peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1236> But this image further decline can survive?</seg>
<seg id=1237> For Asians, the European model could become a political version of Venice: a place that visit with nostalgia for a last grandeur as an admirable museum.</seg>
<seg id=1238> Blue red and</seg>
<seg id=1239> The appointment of Condoleezza Rice as replacing US Secretary of State Colin Powell shows that the recent presidential elections have still powerful repercussions.</seg>
<seg id=1240> It is important that the Americans but also above all the rest of the world understand what these elections showed of America.</seg>
<seg id=1241> The presidential election of this year démocracie shows that the US is healthy, and that some things beneficial to be improved.</seg>
<seg id=1242> Unlike the election of 2000, where President Bush had not received the support of the popular vote and barely won the vote of the electoral college, Bush has prevailed 3.5 million votes this time.</seg>
<seg id=1243> While some Democrats remain bitter, the legitimacy of the victory of Mr Bush cannot be called into question.</seg>
<seg id=1244> America is strongly divided between the Khmer States, and the blue States Republicans, democrats.</seg>
<seg id=1245> If 100 000 votes had stumbled into the red state Ohio, John Kerry would become President (despite a popular vote minority).</seg>
<seg id=1246> The electoral college was incorporated in the US Constitution to protect small States in the federal system and this means today that the election campaign focuses now very largely on a dozen States at most, battlefields when public opinion is closely divided.</seg>
<seg id=1247> Basically, there is something implausible in the election of Presidents without popular majority.</seg>
<seg id=1248> It is therefore time to discuss amendments to the Constitution to abolish the electoral college.</seg>
<seg id=1249> Some observers complain rhetoric and advertisements negative good to sow discord which have characterised this campaign.</seg>
<seg id=1250> This must be assessed in a historical perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1251> At the time of the founding fathers, newspapers were easily party and George wahsington was dismayed by the severity of the language policy.</seg>
<seg id=1252> For the bulk of its premium history, not to mention the civil war and the period of reconstruction, the country was also closely divided as they are today and rhetoric has always reflected this bitter campaigns close competition.</seg>
<seg id=1253> Nevertheless, despite the negative advertisements on both sides, the three national debates television raised important questions in a format serious and were largely followed.</seg>
<seg id=1254> In general, President-in-Office benefiting economic growth has every chance to be re-elected.</seg>
<seg id=1255> In this sense, the real surprise of Bush's re-election was the narrow margin for its majority.</seg>
<seg id=1256> This is largely due to the unpopularity of the war in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=1257> Kerry has tried to transform the war, the low rate of employment, the medical cover inadequate and Bush tax credits for favoured of the central issues in the campaign but some observers have felt that it fails to send a clear message.</seg>
<seg id=1258> Mr Bush has been drawn up with the issue of security against terrorism and a cultural populism on issues such as gay marriage and abortion.</seg>
<seg id=1259> Finally, the cultural populism and security won against economic populism.</seg>
<seg id=1260> The interpretation of the elections was influenced by polls exit polls where voters should decide (having voted) on the issues that ontle more counted for them.</seg>
<seg id=1261> Most (22%) has answered, ‘ moral values ’, only 20% by comparison quoted the economy and 19% terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=1262> Social Conservatives have interpreted this as meaning that they had won the election of Mr Bush and that their programme should dominate his second term.</seg>
<seg id=1263> However, a Pew poll conducted a week after the election was that the category of ‘ moral values' embrace a large variety of issues and more rights to abortion and gay marriage.</seg>
<seg id=1264> In fact, polls show that 25% of public defends gay marriage and 35% are in favour of legal civil unions gay couples (position defended Kerry).</seg>
<seg id=1265> However, for the 37% who oppose gay marriage, particularly in the Khmer States at the centre of the country, the question has allowed to win the supporters of Mr Bush to come to the polls.</seg>
<seg id=1266> It remains to be seen, overall, if the US are divided beyond all hope.</seg>
<seg id=1267> The election of red card states and blue gave rise on the Internet to humoristiques jokes and designs on the secession of the two shores of blue with central theme of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1268> Some appelent it ‘ côtopie. "</seg>
<seg id=1269> But the divisions are no net if.</seg>
<seg id=1270> In the two camps, many states have been won by a narrow margin and if we colore cards by county rather than by state, most of the countries to violet.</seg>
<seg id=1271> Against suburbs towns and rural areas would be a better description of the situation instead of coastline against heart of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1272> Indeed, the public opinion polls show that the majority of Americans are concentrated in the centre of the political spectrum moderate rather than two extremes.</seg>
<seg id=1273> But the political elites such as the political activists and the members of Congress tend to be more extremist than the public.</seg>
<seg id=1274> At first, this seems surprising, since they should feel attracted by the Centre, rich in voice.</seg>
<seg id=1275> However, many members of Congress represent districts which are taken their party and the real threat to their re-election primary is dominated by the wings of parties, the most active and extreme of parties.</seg>
<seg id=1276> This trend is reinforced by the rise of cable television, which draws viewers through programmes controversial of info-divertissement, and the authors of chronic Internet called blogs, starting in polemics persistent no filter editorial.</seg>
<seg id=1277> A reform which would change the borders of districts of Congress to make them more competitive permettrer to respond to this problem, but few elected vote such changes that could increase the risk of their defeat.</seg>
<seg id=1278> The narrow margin results suggest that Mr Bush does not really the mandate of change that we believe have won.</seg>
<seg id=1279> Faced with the difficult issues in foreign policy, fiscal and dociale, it would be wise to look at the centre rather than to reconcile its conservative basis, but politics prevails between the political conviction or the pragmatic policy remains uncertain.</seg>
<seg id=1280> Oil décrochons!</seg>
<seg id=1281> The Chancellor Angela Merkel has made the fight against global warming the main priority of the German Presidency of the European Union and the G8 which began in January.</seg>
<seg id=1282> Its concrete proposal is fairly general for leaders into account and clear enough to accept this, and that the other governments and businesses understands: at the next G8 summit, we must simply set a date from which diesel-driven vehicles will no longer be registered in the major industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg id=1283> This decision will be a considerable positive impact geopolitical and economic levels.</seg>
<seg id=1284> Today, the real concern energy is not related to the reduction of world oil reserves, but rather the decline of internal production of the largest consumers -- Europe, the US and China -- at a time when the growing demand of Asia strike the market.</seg>
<seg id=1285> The available reserves will focus more in the Middle East, because those of other regions in the world will soon be dry.</seg>
<seg id=1286> What is more, the large oil exporters are not prepared to submit their investment policies to market conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1287> Saudi Arabia wants to manage only its oil production and, for its part, Iran scares potential investors with its bureaucratic obstacles and its corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1288> Iraq is a lack of safety, whereas foreigners are fail every attempt investment in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1289> These four States contain half of world oil reserves, of which two thirds could potentially be exported.</seg>
<seg id=1290> These factors, apart from the production costs, are at the origin of high oil prices and the race for contracts in Africa and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1291> To believe that rising oil prices is good for the environment does not take account of data basic international politics.</seg>
<seg id=1292> Firstly, in most of the poor countries of Africa and Asia, import oil represents a larger proportion of national expenditure in industrialised countries, which means that economic growth and social development are compromise, and new crises that threaten debt.</seg>
<seg id=1293> The rents in oil production hamper reforms in the main exporters.</seg>
<seg id=1294> With the strengthening of their financial power regimes such as those in Venezuela and Iran feel less and less constrained by the international rules.</seg>
<seg id=1295> The latest entrants among the big countries consumer of energy, such as China, from the old habits of the West industrialised and their long tradition of a blind eye to violations of human rights, in order to guarantee lucrative contracts with authoritarian regimes and rich in oil.</seg>
<seg id=1296> Only the political and economic lorries, the industrialized countries which are by far the largest consumers of oil can start a change in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1297> It is important to start by the transport sector, which currently accounts for more than half of oil consumption -- proportion who will certainly in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1298> Therefore, the G8 countries must do more to register of new vehicles travelling at petrol in 2025.</seg>
<seg id=1299> This decision is not directed against individual mobility, but against the waste of a scarce resource as a priority to produce synthetically-produced.</seg>
<seg id=1300> Politicians must not favour this or that technology.</seg>
<seg id=1301> Rather, they should encourage the motor industry to develop alternative technologies which use biofuels, the éthylène hydrogen, and even natural gas, for a period of transition.</seg>
<seg id=1302> The countries that have opened the way for the political will, as collateral benefit, the national industries in first place in technology energy markets for the future.</seg>
<seg id=1303> The significant reduction expected CO2 emissions may eventually lead to the necessary political progress international climate.</seg>
<seg id=1304> Economic development is also at stake: if we soignons "" our dependence on oil, the poor and less developed countries and the newly industrialised countries, could be more, which would bring down prices and calmerait energy competition.</seg>
<seg id=1305> The geopolitical and the benefits would be equally clear, particularly the large oil exporting countries would be less able to sing the industrialised countries.</seg>
<seg id=1306> This change would increase the strength of negotiation of the international community in the Middle East and would consolidate the social forces countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia, which seriously want to promote the economic and political reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1307> Producer countries to the great car and advanced technology, Germany is well placed to launch such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id=1308> Angela Merkel, who is the holder of a PhD in physical and began his political career in the post of minister for the environment -- chairing in 1995 the first conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change -- would be more credible if any of his colleagues in the European Union and G8 to confront the problem.</seg>
<seg id=1309> It is high time to make an act of bravery policy.</seg>
<seg id=1310> The myth of humanitarian aid and trade</seg>
<seg id=1311> Humanitarian aid and trade became fashionable words international.</seg>
<seg id=1312> Humanitarian aid increased (accompanied by a debt relief) and improved access to the markets of rich countries for products from poor countries: it now appears to have taken the top of the international agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1313> In fact, the debate today is no longer on the measures to be taken, but on the quantity of measures to be taken and how quickly.</seg>
<seg id=1314> Lost in all of this: the clear lessons to be learned from the past five decades of economic development.</seg>
<seg id=1315> At the forefront of these lessons we find that economic development is left largely in the hands of poor nations themselves.</seg>
<seg id=1316> Countries that are well débrouillés in the recent past have managed through their own efforts.</seg>
<seg id=1317> Humanitarian aid and the markets have played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id=1318> Take the example of a developing country which has a free and preferential access to the market of its largest neighbour, which is also the most powerful economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1319> Suppose that this country is able to send millions of its citizens work on the other side of the border, receives a huge volume of foreign investment and is fully integrated into the international production chains.</seg>
<seg id=1320> Moreover, the country's banking system is supported by its rich neighbour and its willingness to intervene as lender of last resort.</seg>
<seg id=1321> Globalisation could not present themselves in better auspices, is it not?</seg>
<seg id=1322> Consider a second countries now.</seg>
<seg id=1323> It must face a trade embargo on the greatest world market, receives or foreign aid nor any form of support from the Western world is excluded from international organisations such as the WTO and cannot borrow at the IMF and the World Bank.</seg>
<seg id=1324> If these were not sufficiently debilitating external handicaps, can be added an economy which interview itself barriers against international trade (in the form of state, trade barriers import and quantitative restrictions).</seg>
<seg id=1325> As the reader guess, these countries actually exist: it is the Mexico and Vietnam.</seg>
<seg id=1326> Mexico shares a border 3 200 kilometres long with the United States, which offers not only privileged access to a market of goods and Labor, but also to a part of the resources of the US Treasury (as the experience of the peso crisis in 1995 has demonstrated).</seg>
<seg id=1327> By contrast, America has maintained its trade embargo against Vietnam until 1994, has not restored diplomatic relations before 1995 and has not granted the status of the most-favoured-nation imports to the Vietnamese that many years later.</seg>
<seg id=1328> Vietnam has not yet started at the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1329> Now consider their economic performance.</seg>
<seg id=1330> Since NAFTA in December 1992, the Mexican economy has grown at an average annual increase of just over 1% per capita.</seg>
<seg id=1331> Not only is lower than the rate of champions of the Asian economy, but it is also only a fraction of growth performance own Mexico decades before the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).</seg>
<seg id=1332> Vietnam, however, has experienced an annual increase of 5.6% per capita since the early stages of its economic reforms in 1988 and the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States in 1995, and had a constant rapid growth at a rate of 4.5% since.</seg>
<seg id=1333> Vietnam has witnessed a dramatic decline of poverty while Mexico has experienced a fall in real wages.</seg>
<seg id=1334> These two countries have experienced a take-off pronounced international trade and foreign investment, but the picture is very uneven where it matters most: in improving living standards, particularly among the poor.</seg>
<seg id=1335> What these examples show is that the internal efforts push all the other elements in the determination of economic fortunes of a country.</seg>
<seg id=1336> Everything that the American market had to offer in Mexico has not been able to offset the consequences of political errors on the internal market, particularly the inability to reverse the real appreciation of the exchange rate of the peso or extended productivity gains achieved in a sector export activities close to the rest of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1337> What matters most is the adoption by a country a strategy for growth appropriate.</seg>
<seg id=1338> Without any of the benefits which many Mexico, Vietnam has pursued a strategy counteracted on the diversification of its economy and improving the productive capacity of local suppliers.</seg>
<seg id=1339> Global experience post-war underpins proof that the domestic policies are what is most important.</seg>
<seg id=1340> South Korea soared early 1960's, not when foreign subsidies were at their head, but when they began to dry up.</seg>
<seg id=1341> Taiwan has not benefited from foreign subsidies or privileged access to certain markets.</seg>
<seg id=1342> China and India, the economic superstar, have been very successful through their own efforts of economic reform.</seg>
<seg id=1343> It is tempting to account of the foreign demand for their export products the few African success, Botswana and Mauritius (respectively diamonds and clothing), but this cannot go very far.</seg>
<seg id=1344> Of course, these two countries would be much poorer without access to foreign markets.</seg>
<seg id=1345> But, as in all cases of successful development, which the distinction is not the external benefits they enjoy but their ability to exploit these benefits.</seg>
<seg id=1346> It is enough to see how other countries have wasted the advantage that their purchase their natural wealth.</seg>
<seg id=1347> The word ‘ diamonds' does not particularly rise in mind an image of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.</seg>
<seg id=1348> Similarly, little processing zones of exports proliférant around the world have only known the level of development observed Mauritius.</seg>
<seg id=1349> This does not, however, rich countries emerging from their obligation to help.</seg>
<seg id=1350> They can make life difficult for corrupt dictators, sharing best financial information and refusing to recognise the international contracts that they sign.</seg>
<seg id=1351> Similarly, the increase in the number of workers in poor countries allowed to work in the rich countries and a wider range of policies growth-driven thanks to the relaxation of WTO rules and conditions imposed by the United States would produce a greater impact on long-term development.</seg>
<seg id=1352> It is not proven that enlargement of market access and subsidies represents the best use to make political capital of the northern hemisphere.</seg>
<seg id=1353> The development should focus on improving the political environment in poor countries, rather than on aid and trade.</seg>
<seg id=1354> Interdependence</seg>
<seg id=1355> If the great economist Argentine Raul prebisch was living today, there is no doubt that it would be if the world began to turn round.</seg>
<seg id=1356> His theory largely influential dependency argued that if the poor countries were too on exports of raw materials, they could never happen industrial level the necessary to support rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id=1357> They are embourberaient in place in a round of world prices decline of raw materials and reduction of the income.</seg>
<seg id=1358> The answer prebisch favorite of protectionism, has been a disaster for many countries of Latin America and Africa that have followed.</seg>
<seg id=1359> But the fact is that for years, prebisch seems to have had the reaction just about trends in raw material prices in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=1360> The permanent efficiency gains in the agriculture and the extraction of natural resources have lowers prices of raw materials, especially in the 1980's and 1990.</seg>
<seg id=1361> With few exceptions, the countries that have focused on exports of raw materials have achieved only of paltry results, while the Asian countries do with few resources made rapid progress.</seg>
<seg id=1362> Today, however, with the Asian giants, India and China, which are the world economy, the price of petrol, gold, wheat and virtually all the other raw materials soar.</seg>
<seg id=1363> Admittedly, there will always be rounds (the price of oil, for example, into a tailspin probably again before its rise again) but the long-term trend many raw materials will clearly rising for some time yet.</seg>
<seg id=1364> What many trade negotiators and other decision-makers were not recognise yet, while prebisch would have understood immediately is that this sudden U-turn has enormous implications for the global balance of powers.</seg>
<seg id=1365> Indeed, no other aspect of economic globalisation does launch of greatest challenges to the leaders of the world over the coming decades.</seg>
<seg id=1366> There are many questions.</seg>
<seg id=1367> Today's rich countries are prepared to enter a period of co-dépendance, in which they will be equally desperately seeking raw materials that developing countries are industrialised products and technologies?</seg>
<seg id=1368> Are prepared to the inevitable flow of power and influence to the commodity-dependent countries as they enrich?</seg>
<seg id=1369> How the two superpowers of the world, China and the United States, will manage the fact that important exporting areas of raw materials of Africa and the Middle East into Central Asia are covered of nation States poorly trained?</seg>
<seg id=1370> Some self-appointed prophets expose the problem as the limits of nature reserves and claim that the most critical raw materials decreasing at an alarming rate.</seg>
<seg id=1371> Nowadays, many adherents of the theory "the peak of hubbert" of oil production, which supports that we have reached the limits of our production capacity, that is assèchent sinks and that the situation will deteriorate.</seg>
<seg id=1372> However, as indicated the eminent oil historian Dan yergin birds, ominous turned out that the resources in black gold were on the verge of dry up at least four times already.</seg>
<seg id=1373> Each time, radical technological progress made slip these threats.</seg>
<seg id=1374> In the late 1800, oil extraction of draguer involved with mulets.</seg>
<seg id=1375> Today, forer to 3 000 m under the oceans seems obvious to everyone.</seg>
<seg id=1376> Such progress has also been made in the areas of the extraction metals and agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=1377> No, the world is not facing a next shortage of raw materials.</seg>
<seg id=1378> In reality, it happens that the integration of 2.5 billion people (China and India) in the world economy produced a shift of the request that could put more pressure on the increase in the price of raw materials that no technological gains will probably able to counterbalance.</seg>
<seg id=1379> Consequently, and at least 50 to 75 years, and perhaps even until humans are forer on March over centuries to come, the price of many natural resources will rise.</seg>
<seg id=1380> The new balance of economic powers will destabilise the situation resulting world policy?</seg>
<seg id=1381> The first world war was partly caused by the concern Germany before the monopolising by the other colonial powers of too much of the world's oil and raw materials.</seg>
<seg id=1382> Similarly, during the Second World War, Japan has fears for the stability of its supplies oil and other natural resources from abroad.</seg>
<seg id=1383> Will such tensions arise between China to resources uncertain (even the water scarcity is problematic) and the West?</seg>
<seg id=1384> Fortunately, this does not seem likely for the moment, especially in view of the problems that pragmatic approach also sober resources of their country displayed by the Chinese leaders.</seg>
<seg id=1385> The Chinese turn to regions such as Africa in the hope of finding trading partners stable.</seg>
<seg id=1386> They do not share the évangélisme policy of the Americans, who do not want only to trade with exporters of raw materials, but also want the convert.</seg>
<seg id=1387> Then there are those American leaders who still talk about making the United States self-sufficient in terms of energy resources.</seg>
<seg id=1388> It is a joke: sufficient, perhaps, but auto-suffisants, never.</seg>
<seg id=1389> A large part of the Arab world believe, and this is understandable, that the invasion of Iraq is the cornerstone of the US strategy to obtain stable energy resources.</seg>
<seg id=1390> If they are right, one can only hope that America has a fallback.</seg>
<seg id=1391> In the meantime, the prices of raw materials will continue to grow, and exporters of oil be the largest contributors to the yawning trade deficit of the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1392> Perhaps the real American strategy seek to try to duty to oil exporting countries so much money that they will become dependent on the happiness they provide to America!</seg>
<seg id=1393> This is a turning point that prebisch should never expected.</seg>
<seg id=1394> The radical change Iran</seg>
<seg id=1395> The choice of Iranians to wear in power the mayor radical in Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, risk of worsen relations with the West and sharpen the isolation of countries at international level.</seg>
<seg id=1396> Yet, in terms of national policy, the Islamic regime will probably better than if a candidate more moderate had prevailed.</seg>
<seg id=1397> It is clear that Ahmadinejad has a real basis for support.</seg>
<seg id=1398> The fact that it has presented as a populist, he has talked to help the poor, condemned the government and acted almost as an opposition candidate does not: embody the choice of the regime, and eventually receive an official aid including against rivals radical.</seg>
<seg id=1399> The regime has shown great skill.</seg>
<seg id=1400> It has changed the candidate a little more pragmatic hashemi-rafsanjani -- at odds with some government policies, in person in harmony with the established order, and its own candidate in rebel.</seg>
<seg id=1401> The government has used and resentment against the establishment to consolidate its own power.</seg>
<seg id=1402> Given that the former President Khatami, supported the Mohammad reformist movement, at if there was little rashly and that it has not done in the end, it does nothing to stress how leaders have returned to their advantage the political situation.</seg>
<seg id=1403> Ahmadinejad is a representative of activists youngsters anti-shah of the revolution of 25 years ago.</seg>
<seg id=1404> It is directly involved in the hostage-taking Americans in Iran, but we do not really know how to.</seg>
<seg id=1405> The most worrying is that it is close to the two main groups who represent the most extremist elements of Iran: the body of the Islamic revolution and the organization basij.</seg>
<seg id=1406> The first is an army parall to the pro-régime; the second is an organization which will intimidate opponents and everyone in the search for a more open society.</seg>
<seg id=1407> However, this concern that Iran in the hands of leaders still more radical is half-hearted by two factors.</seg>
<seg id=1408> Firstly, Ahmadinejad will undoubtedly focus on probl to my national, and try - without it being reflected its chances of succ to - of improving the living conditions of the poorest Iranians.</seg>
<seg id=1409> Second decentralized, the group in power since the revolution will continue to pursue the policies to ideological and étrang.</seg>
<seg id=1410> The President has fewer powers than it seems, and it is particuli failure to overshadowed by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</seg>
<seg id=1411> Nonetheless, the election of Ahmadinejad clarifies cr lied to the challenge that Iran represents for western policy and the stability of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1412> Firstly, send the signal to the most extremist elements of Iran, and customers terrorists to this country -- the Lebanese Hezbollah, Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and several small groups acting against Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Arab countries -- they have the green light to launch their attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1413> They will argue that Iran will support them, although they do.</seg>
<seg id=1414> On the surface, Iran has often shown relatively cautious, while playing provider of funds to cover the role of world of terror.</seg>
<seg id=1415> Iranian officials who have been able to command and coordinate act individually, specific operations now feel freer to do so.</seg>
<seg id=1416> Moreover, Ahmadinejad openly advocates an intensive programme for obtaining nuclear weapons.</seg>
<seg id=1417> Most of the Iranian politicians, at least those that allows the government to act, supports this programme and promotes a more cautious approach to and discr thee.</seg>
<seg id=1418> Rafsanjani, for example, obscures the establishment of better relations with the West before progress on the nuclear front.</seg>
<seg id=1419> If Ahmadinejad is President of a nuclear Iran, it is more likely to use weapons of a risky.</seg>
<seg id=1420> This does not mean that he would use, but rather that it will serve for diplomatic blackmail, threats to set the levels of crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1421> Since the Iranian leaders proclaim daily their desire to wipe Israel off the map and combat the United States (Ahmadinejad market on the image of an American flag going vote), the risk of confrontation has increased.</seg>
<seg id=1422> Finally, Ahmadinejad is likely to enhardir to endanger the stability of Iraq, and his victory will encourage Iranian officials radicals and extremists Iraqis.</seg>
<seg id=1423> Iran sends already many agents in Iraq and supports clients who seek to turn it into clone.</seg>
<seg id=1424> The Iraqis, including the Shiite Muslims, following the at version of Islam that the Iranians, reject generally such interference.</seg>
<seg id=1425> A more militant Iranian position will increase the friction with Iraq, and inspire more anti-US violence.</seg>
<seg id=1426> In short, the election result is dangerous, Iranian at if its potential acts of Ahmadinejad and destabilising will depend on the degree of power that will Khamenei.</seg>
<seg id=1427> Moreover, also have a Iran openly extremist radical - at crit according to res a regime already hard -- will be a challenge not only for the United States, but also for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1428> The European countries continue to pretend that the militant rhetoric and the provocations of Ahmadinejad are not and that it is possible to find diplomatic solutions to Iran's nuclear ambitions?</seg>
<seg id=1429> With Rafsanjani, a true agreement or at least appearances cooperation would have been easy to maintain.</seg>
<seg id=1430> But, with Ahmadinejad, there will be an immense dose of conciliation to maintain even the most minimal diplomatic procedure.</seg>
<seg id=1431> Some reformists and Iranian exiles welcome the election of Ahmadinejad, because they believe that his administration is more likely to show the true face of the regime and détromper compromise any hope of the West.</seg>
<seg id=1432> But it can also be the symbol succ to take advantage of the regime to return to its dissatisfaction caused by a quarter of a century of gne if to radical Islamist.</seg>
<seg id=1433> Whatever the consequences, the victory of Ahmadinejad means for the West that everything to Iran will become even more difficult.</seg>
<seg id=1434> Take the poor, give the rich</seg>
<seg id=1435> President Bush seems poised to destroy the American budget for years to come.</seg>
<seg id=1436> When President Bush took office, forecasts anticipated budget surpluses as long as we could imagine.</seg>
<seg id=1437> Today, thanks to a mixture of irresponsible tax cuts launched by republicans, an economic downturn, the bursting of the stock market bubble and a massive increase in military spending, the horizon is dominated by large fiscal deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1438> The worst is still to come, because the Bush administration and the Congress Republican majority prepare worsen the fiscal mess.</seg>
<seg id=1439> The ravages that they will probably will weaken the United States and increase instability of the international economy.</seg>
<seg id=1440> Usually, America's Republican Party defended balanced budgets.</seg>
<seg id=1441> This changed with the Reagan administration, when the republicans Conservatives proved favourable to tax reductions, even if it was through important budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1442> President Reagan announced the American people that it can enjoy both tax cuts, the strengthening of the army and the continuation of their favourite spending programmes.</seg>
<seg id=1443> The result, unsurprisingly, was a number of large budget deficits and whose disposal took several years.</seg>
<seg id=1444> President George Bush senior as President Bill Clinton last raise taxes to bring order to the chaos of Reagan era.</seg>
<seg id=1445> These increases taxes probably have contributed to the defeat of President Bush senior by Bill Clinton in 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1446> However, bravely Clinton decided to complete the process initiated to restore fiscal equilibrium, in part to protect long-term funding programmes of pensions of social security.</seg>
<seg id=1447> When the Clinton quitta presidency in 2000, the budgetary situation was the best for decades.</seg>
<seg id=1448> We then came to President George Bush son, ready to play the Reagan with significant tax reductions, a considerable increase in military spending and the continuation and even the development of spending programmes popular.</seg>
<seg id=1449> The result was predictable.</seg>
<seg id=1450> In January 2001, the cumulative budgetary forecasts for the years 2002 to 2011 anticipated a budget surplus of 5.6 trillion.</seg>
<seg id=1451> These anticipated surplus mid-2002, had evaporated.</seg>
<seg id=1452> In the light of these new economic conditions, and the shadow of the war against Iraq, we might expect that the Bush administration and the Republican Congress to be careful in the defence of new tax cuts.</seg>
<seg id=1453> Far from it, but the main priority is to put in place more tax cuts, where only the wealthy will largely.</seg>
<seg id=1454> At the same time, the government calls for large increases military expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1455> With the approach of the presidential election of November 2004, you can be certain that no significant reduction of expenditure will in the non-military programmes.</seg>
<seg id=1456> So it appears that the massive budget deficits be destined to continue.</seg>
<seg id=1457> If the domestic spending simply remain constant in terms of a fraction of national income, the budgetary forecasts cumulative the next ten years anticipate a total deficit 1.5 trillion.</seg>
<seg id=1458> But this figure could be very optimistic, because it does not probably account of the likely cost for a war against Iraq, or another package of tax reductions or the risk of increasing interest rates for years to come.</seg>
<seg id=1459> Why republicans are montrent-ils so little affected by this hodge-podge?</seg>
<seg id=1460> Some republicans are more concerned tax cuts for the wealthy than anything else.</seg>
<seg id=1461> Others think that deficits by force will lead to significant reductions government spending, thus reducing the home state participation, which is their wish the more expensive.</seg>
<seg id=1462> The problem of this last analysis is that most of the taxpayers are attached to the social programmes and will not support easily large expenditure cuts.</seg>
<seg id=1463> The most intrigante remains: why the Americans vote for such policies when they should know that it will probably problems.</seg>
<seg id=1464> One of the possible answers is that many voters do not come the budgetary problems.</seg>
<seg id=1465> A better answer is that most of the Americans did not actually voted for these policies.</seg>
<seg id=1466> The turnout of the election of 2002 was only 40% of voters, and only about half of the 40% voted for the Republicans, approximately 20% of people entitled to vote.</seg>
<seg id=1467> Of course, the prospects should not necessarily be so bleak.</seg>
<seg id=1468> The war against Iraq may be avoided.</seg>
<seg id=1469> Tax reductions afoot could be moderate or abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=1470> But I predict large budget deficits for the coming years and a growing sense of unease within the United States and abroad about America's macroeconomic situation.</seg>
<seg id=1471> Foreign investors could decide to reduce their government and the financing of the budget deficit course of America favourably.</seg>
<seg id=1472> The dollar could weakened, and fear of inflation could become even more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id=1473> All this will lose confidence in the political decision-makers of the United States which will then be less flexible in their responses to economic shocks.</seg>
<seg id=1474> The poor, the United States and abroad, could suffer most, since President Bush and Congress claim the American people and the world that there is no money available for dealing with the issue of poverty, health and education, because of the important budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1475> If the American way does not pave the eye on these risks and taxation wealthy could have another gift of billions of dollars while the country and the world will bear the harsh consequences for years to come.</seg>
<seg id=1476> Lessons to be learned from the fiscal America</seg>
<seg id=1477> George W. Bush has made much more to destroy the economic policy of the United States that all the other presidents in American history, even exceeding its mentors, Ronald Reagan.</seg>
<seg id=1478> In just three years in office, he has destroyed a fragile political consensus which requested ten years of effort and might require another decade to be reconstructed.</seg>
<seg id=1479> In so doing, Bush has risky economic health and social stability in the long term of America.</seg>
<seg id=1480> Since the budgetary challenges in the long term that administer the us very clumsy are not the only existing challenges, America's fiscal blunders offering important lessons to other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1481> The main problem with fiscal policy is that politicians can easily be provisionally popular in cutting taxes and increasing public expenditure while accumulation of public debt repayment to the massive and leaving their future elected.</seg>
<seg id=1482> This stratagem could last a few years, but the budget deficits and public debt growing impose earlier than expected a change of policy.</seg>
<seg id=1483> A cynic might nonetheless buy his re-election and perhaps be party to retirement when the crisis is.</seg>
<seg id=1484> You might think that after decades of similar episodes of political irresponsibility in the countries of the world, the voters would be allergic to this kind of tricks.</seg>
<seg id=1485> However, the new Bush applies in buying off today popularity distributing massive tax cuts but simultaneously increased military spending and spending on education and health.</seg>
<seg id=1486> The budget deficit obtained amounts to more than 5% of GNP.</seg>
<seg id=1487> Worse still, the long-term budgetary outlook of America were already worrying before Bush begins to implement its policies careless.</seg>
<seg id=1488> The American population is ageing, so that the costs of pension systems and health care financed by public funds will increase dramatically.</seg>
<seg id=1489> In-depth calculations show that the income freed thanks to the fiscal policies advocated by Bush may not achieve the tens of trillion dollars which represent the costs of state pensions, health care and other fiscal spending expected by the population.</seg>
<seg id=1490> At some time in the future, it will greatly increase recoveries taxes, drastically reduce public spending, or both, to alleviate the actions of Bush.</seg>
<seg id=1491> So why the population support its policies?</seg>
<seg id=1492> Because it contains little these consequences in the long term, or that it is no respecter, even if these consequences will eventually have an impact on the majority of Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1493> The richest taxpayers are of course pleased because they have benefited from the bulk of the tax cuts.</seg>
<seg id=1494> Strangely enough, the 5% of the richest Americans taxpayers have been roughly half of tax cuts and these rich taxpayers expect clear that the other 95% (the middle class and the poor) bear the majority of future spending cuts and tax increases.</seg>
<seg id=1495> Meanwhile, Bush has convinced a large number of voters poor and voters of the middle classes that they should also be satisfied with their fate without tell them that they will have to pay their small tax cuts reductions far larger of future government services if politicians in his administration prevail over the long term.</seg>
<seg id=1496> If the Americans had a political memory, they would realize that they have already gravi roller coaster this ‘ tax ’ over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=1497> Ronald Reagan also took office promising massive tax cuts and large increases military expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1498> This ended by an enormous budget deficit in the mid-1980's.</seg>
<seg id=1499> The tax cuts made extremely popular Reagan and have allowed him to be re-elected in 1984.</seg>
<seg id=1500> It has been a decade (from second-term Reagan until the mandates of George Bush, Sr. and Bill Clinton) to return to a budget surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1501> Of course, this result has need the approval of new tax increases, which has cost his re-election for George Bush, Sr. policy polarised and resulted in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id=1502> History has a great opportunity to repeat itself.</seg>
<seg id=1503> Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush administration believe that the current budget deficits will ultimately a drastic reduction of social expenditure of government.</seg>
<seg id=1504> They hope to dismantle programmes such as social security and medicare.</seg>
<seg id=1505> But the American population strongly supports these social programmes.</seg>
<seg id=1506> The strategy is to reduce taxes to lead necessarily subsequently cuts in social programs is doomed to failure and must inevitably lead to increasing taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1507> Other ideologists of the Bush administration argue that the tax cuts play a crucial role for the US recession.</seg>
<seg id=1508> This argument is also wrong.</seg>
<seg id=1509> America's economy could recover without the tax cuts, and perhaps even more firmly.</seg>
<seg id=1510> In any case, it is a monumental mistake that long-term fiscal policies based on the economic cycle in the short term.</seg>
<seg id=1511> Other countries have two main lessons to be learned from this situation.</seg>
<seg id=1512> The first is that the US will limit budget deficits imminent sooner or later the international power of America.</seg>
<seg id=1513> The Americans supported the war in Iraq because they had not to subsidise by higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1514> When Americans will be forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be less inclined to support military operations expensive abroad.</seg>
<seg id=1515> Indeed, the United States will deeply divided internally when the population will be grappling with the fiscal mess left by Bush.</seg>
<seg id=1516> The second lesson is that countries must plan their budgets according to the increasing tax costs resulting from an ageing population.</seg>
<seg id=1517> The long-term budgetary conditions are rarely taken into account by the taxpayers or Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1518> Governments must be persuaded to submit long-term budgetary assessments at the same time their annual budget proposals to reduce the trend towards a short-term political manipulation of the budget.</seg>
<seg id=1519> The US can play the role of a warning for other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1520> The White House should give the other countries the same Council that the magicians to give their television viewers: 'Do not try to do likewise among you.</seg>
<seg id=1521> Politicization of the securities markets</seg>
<seg id=1522> Many economic and financial analysts complain that the securities markets of emerging countries are often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political and economic.</seg>
<seg id=1523> By contrast, a force primitive economic governs the securities markets in advanced countries and predict their performance is in fact to predict the growth of trees.</seg>
<seg id=1524> This description of securities markets in the emerging countries is not false, just one-sided, because the same description applies to securities markets in advanced countries.</seg>
<seg id=1525> Indeed, the best analysts know that predict the performance of the securities market of any country is basically to predict the extent to which the government wishes that investors securities markets are involved in the current political environment.</seg>
<seg id=1526> Take the securities market of the US, by far the most important in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1527> The government leaves the companies calm and the return on the investment in the securities market forces us reflect the fundamental a capitalist economy solid.</seg>
<seg id=1528> This partly explains why the United States attract portfolio investors throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id=1529> But the returns which make the American securities markets if attractive reflect a fragile political balance.</seg>
<seg id=1530> In particular, tax rates affecting securities varied over time with the change political pressures.</seg>
<seg id=1531> During the second world war, for example, the political support for large fortunes has fallen and the government has risen taxes on capital gains, the dividends and high incomes in general.</seg>
<seg id=1532> When the second world war has helped considerably to redress the weak economy by the great depression of the 1930's, President Roosevelt and Congress introduced a tax on the profits to ensure that shareholders do not bring a benefit too.</seg>
<seg id=1533> By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but that the securities market was low, American voters elected Ronald Reagan, a man judged by many as too right for be President.</seg>
<seg id=1534> It has asked for, and obtained tax cuts on the capital gains, the revenue and incomes.</seg>
<seg id=1535> Political interference in the securities market not only deal with taxes on capital gains, the revenue and incomes.</seg>
<seg id=1536> Corporate taxes, indirect taxes, the import duties and taxes on sales, which are all paid directly or indirectly by companies, may have an extended impact on company profits and therefore on the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1537> It is no coincidence that wherever develop securities markets, governments should ensure that these lowering taxes maximum after-tax corporate profits.</seg>
<seg id=1538> Indeed, the policies of the securities markets do not stop at taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1539> On the contrary, almost every government affects corporate profits and, subsequently, the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1540> After the collapse of the securities markets of 1929, the US Government has suspended a large part of the anti-trust activity which allows companies to acquire a monopoly which would increase their value.</seg>
<seg id=1541> This policy has delayed reducing the rate of unemployment, but was not enough to control the political forces deployed to support the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1542> Similarly, one of the most important actions taken by President Reagan was to destroy a large part of the rest of the unions power of America, fighting for their share of the pie industrial.</seg>
<seg id=1543> Reagan's election victory during the strike of air traffic controllers in 1981 was a major turning point for the American trade union movement, and also for the securities market which launched its market to the spectacular increase in 1982.</seg>
<seg id=1544> The US Government has shown particularly hard to support the securities market since the culmination of the illusion stock price in 2000, and especially to reduce interest rates on many occasions.</seg>
<seg id=1545> Of course, this measure was publicly justified in terms of boosting the economy, and not in terms of support for the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1546> But it is very revealing of the scale of the American market securities that one of the most important factors affecting the economy is falling prices actions.</seg>
<seg id=1547> Indeed, the authorities is not limited to a monetary stimulus.</seg>
<seg id=1548> The national accounts of products and incomes of us show that the actual rate of tax on company profits (the percentage of really benefits paid to the government in the form of taxes) has risen in Crete to 33,7% in the first quarter 2000 (the record of the securities market and the economy in general) and has fallen to 20,2% von during the fourth quarter of 2003, when the market was low.</seg>
<seg id=1549> A large part of this decline reflects the tax-relief package of measures adopted by Congress and the perception among companies, that in the current political and economic environment, they can be more combatives for avoiding taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1550> In addition, after the collapse of the securities market, the maximum tax on the dividends on securities is increased from 35% to 15%, providing a new substantial advantage investors in the long term and intensify the combined effect of reinvesting dividends after tax.</seg>
<seg id=1551> Again, this tax cut was justified to stimulate the economy which can, of course, apply to almost any measure intended to support the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1552> But it is the balance of political forces which determines the credibility of this kind of justification.</seg>
<seg id=1553> It could be argued that the same variables, including the hostility to high taxes and a weak trade union movement, have worked in the US over the past 200 years and that they should continue to operate in the future, producing high returns on the securities markets and attractive influxes of foreign capital considerable.</seg>
<seg id=1554> Those who believe that investments on the American market securities will follow the same trend of higher growth for decades could well be right.</seg>
<seg id=1555> But it is important to be clear on what we predicted.</seg>
<seg id=1556> Above all forecasts are not only the economy, but also on politics, even on the cultural values, which shape the political and economic performance.</seg>
<seg id=1557> The property market to global scale</seg>
<seg id=1558> There is no more local investment that property investment. Residence bought is rooted in a fixed location, as a tree, and is rife or languishes in the local economic conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1559> The world has on our TV screens, but the real estate market comprises almost solely on local amateur, rarely crosses the local geographical borders.</seg>
<seg id=1560> Soon, however, this could change.</seg>
<seg id=1561> In a month, the Chicago mercantile exchange (CME), together with my firm macromarkets, and with fiserv Standard & poor' and, on futures contracts to launch options on home prices in ten cities in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1562> The contracts will be based on home prices are P / case-shiller, established according to the speculative research that my colleague Karl case and I have conducted, almost twenty years.</seg>
<seg id=1563> For a long time, we démarchons for a real estate market, but no stock market, until now, wanted to use these figures to create such a market.</seg>
<seg id=1564> The futures markets on home prices will allow investors to invest in the world indirectly us home, via these markets.</seg>
<seg id=1565> A buyer in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo will have the opportunity to invest in housing occupied by their owners in New York, Los Angeles and las vegas, among others.</seg>
<seg id=1566> One of the fundamental principles of the financial theory -- diversification or risk-spreading -- implies that interest in these new contracts will be.</seg>
<seg id=1567> Companies and the people of New York, for example, are surexposés risks to the local. But by selling their homes in the long term, they should be able to reduce these risks.</seg>
<seg id=1568> Investors in Tokyo will bear a proportion of risks by buying long-term housing in New York, if the price is right.</seg>
<seg id=1569> The new yorker will continue to live in their homes, while being shared out the risks of investment throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id=1570> The experience of a genuine futures market on the uni-familiales second-home has not been retentée since 1991, when the London future options and exchange (called now euronext.liffe) has missed the launch of such a market.</seg>
<seg id=1571> It has never generated large volumes of transactions.</seg>
<seg id=1572> The stock market has launched a concept which has convinced person.</seg>
<seg id=1573> The British markets Paris diversified on home prices, like some retail markets online, have never much reported either.</seg>
<seg id=1574> Different occurring this time?</seg>
<seg id=1575> Of course, the launch of a new market is still uncertain. People are interested in an idea if it enticed already many others; if nobody is keen, it does not attract more.</seg>
<seg id=1576> The same applies to the markets. If there are no investors interested, it will not be enough to generate profits transactions to attract others.</seg>
<seg id=1577> However, as is the case for all the brilliant ideas, we never know very well why they séduisent and we cannot predict the start of this new market, but we know that, sometimes, the success is present.</seg>
<seg id=1578> The original indicators suggest that the growing interest in the long-term transactions on home prices, particularly as the ambient speech on the 'bubble', underlines the importance of risk diversification.</seg>
<seg id=1579> After the announcement of the CME, one of its competitors, the Chicago board options exchange, has declared its draft create options on futures contracts to in the largest American regions, based on home prices means published by the national association of realtors (National Association estate agents).</seg>
<seg id=1580> However, in addition to the great public interest property investment and risk coverage, another thorny issue must be resolved for the futures markets function well: prices must be openly revealed and investors must understand the meaning.</seg>
<seg id=1581> I believe that ‘ there are great opportunities for these futures markets are soon falling prices in some American cities.</seg>
<seg id=1582> It is a matter of "déport, traders'. Today, the price to end on the market is lower than the price of a property.</seg>
<seg id=1583> Probably, the déport does not appear from the first day of property transactions, but it should happen within a few months.</seg>
<seg id=1584> We may need déport if some of these markets fulfill their functions.</seg>
<seg id=1585> Everyone knows that these cities have experienced a huge real estate boom in recent years (that is a global phenomenon widespread).</seg>
<seg id=1586> International investors do not appear to be very willing to invest in these cities, without the prospect of lower prices based on the futures markets. The Tokyo people have learned at their expense.</seg>
<seg id=1587> However, while the déport is important enough, even investors who believe that the US home market is declining can always expect a good return home prices in the long term, because they already benefit from a single market prices.</seg>
<seg id=1588> Nevertheless, the new yorker will need to make adjustments to cover their own property investments if they want to sell futures contracts to leading naturally lowering prices.</seg>
<seg id=1589> They will be to the idea that the market has already anticipated this decline and cannot protect small margin of the potential which goes beyond this expectation.</seg>
<seg id=1590> In fact, such adjustments in our way of thinking occur without doubt looking at the future prices of the market.</seg>
<seg id=1591> Until now, the real estate prices has essentially been the result of various opinions.</seg>
<seg id=1592> When the market to create an international consensus on home prices in all the major cities around the world, it will be easier to manage the risks they encounter by stabilising on the one hand, their economies and on the other hand, our own living standards.</seg>
<seg id=1593> But what moves markets?</seg>
<seg id=1594> Since the 10 May around, most of the world markets have accused of strong cumulative declines, particularly in the two weeks on of 23 May, averaging courses persist downwards.</seg>
<seg id=1595> The concerns on the global stock markets are synonymous with concern for the economy of the world?</seg>
<seg id=1596> Consider the most marked reductions.</seg>
<seg id=1597> Among the major countries, the most impressive crash is India, where prices have fallen 16.9% revaluation of between 10 May and on 22 May.</seg>
<seg id=1598> The collapse of the other side of the world has taken nearly all scale. There, the ups and downs have had only a few days of gap with those of India: in Argentina, prices have fallen from 16.1%, Brazil of FF 14.7% and Mexico to 13.8%.</seg>
<seg id=1599> The European markets have also suffered heavy losses.</seg>
<seg id=1600> In Sweden, prices have plummeted 15.2% between the 9 May and 22 May; almost over the same period, they have fallen 9.7% in Germany, 9.4% in France and the United Kingdom and 9.3% in Italy.</seg>
<seg id=1601> In Asia, prices fell to 11.5% in Korea, 9.3% in Hong Kong and 8% in Japan roughly over the same period.</seg>
<seg id=1602> Many commentators try to link these events in the situation in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1603> However, the Americans have accused that lower 5.2% between 9 and on 24 May.</seg>
<seg id=1604> China does not seem to be behind this world decline because prices have increased there during this period.</seg>
<seg id=1605> The standard explanations economists concern the monetary policies.</seg>
<seg id=1606> In the wake of the great fear of deflation of 2003, central banks in the world have cut interest rates, causing speculative explosions on the estate markets and the stock market.</seg>
<seg id=1607> But today, according to this point of view, interest rates in start to increase, which foreshadows new declines in the markets.</seg>
<seg id=1608> Without doubt, there is an important element of truth in this argument.</seg>
<seg id=1609> The US Federal Reserve has increased its interest-rate 10 and its President, Ben bernanke, has indicated that other increases may take place in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1610> On 17 May, a worsening of American data has been found, which suggests future durcissements monetary.</seg>
<seg id=1611> Economists like to think that the world is logical and manageable, which means that they understand what is happening there.</seg>
<seg id=1612> But in so doing, they often overstate the role of the central banks.</seg>
<seg id=1613> Indeed, the increase in American rates was a number of rate increases -- the 16th running.</seg>
<seg id=1614> No other major central bank has increased rates after the beginning of the stock market decline in May 7-8 until June, when several are put (the European Central Bank, India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).</seg>
<seg id=1615> Another factor: the price of oil, which increased by 24% between 22 March and on 2 May, flying all its records.</seg>
<seg id=1616> That would undoubtedly be a major event capable of influencing the markets worldwide.</seg>
<seg id=1617> The oil price rises play the role of the culprit in practically all economic downturns since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id=1618> And yet the sky high oil prices do not correspond at a time when the most fallen stock, in mid-May.</seg>
<seg id=1619> Argue that these increases caused the markets means declines in several weeks.</seg>
<seg id=1620> But the stock markets are not very logical, and a reply out the oil price shock might be possible.</seg>
<seg id=1621> As for all the way in any financial market, increasing always attracts attention.</seg>
<seg id=1622> When oil prices rise quickly, people watch the information who speak and discuss them of these increases, creating a greater sensitivity by themselves to these new.</seg>
<seg id=1623> The Middle East crisis is linked to the price of oil, and it has been the dominant information in May.</seg>
<seg id=1624> Signs of doom and the strong language used by various political personalities have been amplified in the spirit of investors by increases in oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1625> On 8 May, the Israeli premier vice Shimon Peres, in response to the hostile statements by the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, told that "the Iranian President should remember that Iran could also be wiped off the map."</seg>
<seg id=1626> Similarly, around the beginning of the stock market collapse of May, Ahmadinejad has visited Indonesia, the country with the largest number of Muslims in the world, and newspapers have reported on 13 May that he had received a genuine ovation from students of two of the best universities of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1627> This history may have been interpreted as proof that the strategy of brinkmanship of Ahmadinejad in the nuclear field brings it political dividends, fueling the perception that the tense situation in the Middle East could lead to other oil price rises.</seg>
<seg id=1628> These newspaper articles may seem far more remote stock markets that monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=1629> But the public reaction that they, and the recent price increases for oil, could be a good measure in changing the market psychology.</seg>
<seg id=1630> Given the risk attitudes change with time, and with the events as the remarks of ahmedinejad and Peres can rush these changes.</seg>
<seg id=1631> So, although these events are difficult to quantify analysts, perhaps should also pay attention to the words of Ahmadinejad as bernanke when they try to understand the direction of the global stock markets.</seg>
<seg id=1632> Economists like perhaps not focus on the mentality of the public and about how it interacts with the price fluctuations, the new dynamic world and the speculative.</seg>
<seg id=1633> This would mean that the economic events are less predictable (and economists less omniscients) that they would like to imagine.</seg>
<seg id=1634> Yet, a point of view intuitif it would be logical to do so.</seg>
<seg id=1635> That there really in the minds of investors?</seg>
<seg id=1636> Ahmadinejad is a figure charismatic, not bernanke.</seg>
<seg id=1637> Ahmadinejad are embarking on an adventure, not bernanke.</seg>
<seg id=1638> And, perhaps the most important, Ahmadinejad destabilising influence, not bernanke.</seg>
<seg id=1639> Whatever their cause in the end, the world stock falls in mid-May indicate a market psychology unstable.</seg>
<seg id=1640> Difficult to believe that they were linked to views on possible monetary policies, and not to broader questions and deeper, in particular on energy and political tension, which are the foundations of the performance of the world economy.</seg>
<seg id=1641> Why pay more for fair trade?</seg>
<seg id=1642> Marks & Spencer, the supermarket chain and clothes owner 400 shops through Britain, has just announced that it will convert its range of cafés and thés including 38 different products to the ‘ fair trade ’ label, the symbol of the production marketing 'ethical'.</seg>
<seg id=1643> The chain sells only already tea and coffee designated as such in these 200 coffee resume ‘ coffee shops ’.</seg>
<seg id=1644> It also encourages the purchase of shirts and other goods produced from cotton fair trade.</seg>
<seg id=1645> This announcement has taken place during the ‘ fair trade ’ fortnight. During these two weeks of promotion of labelled products meetings were held with presentation of producers in developing countries to explain the British how this form of commerce has helped their communities.</seg>
<seg id=1646> The movement towards a more ethical consumption is also a significant step forward in the United States. Consumers are increasingly towards organic food or products locally, such as the free-range eggs in freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1647> In the United Kingdom, a study has shown that over 50% of respondents recognized the symbol of fair trade and understand that products which were more this label the working conditions of third-world producers.</seg>
<seg id=1648> There is currently no study comparable to the US, but the data reported and from my discussions with my own students suggests that the figure is less high for the Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1649> Traders wants to obtain certification fair trade must pay the producers a price covering the costs of sustainable production and a living wage.</seg>
<seg id=1650> For example, the minimum for over a pound of coffee is · 1.26, regardless of the reduction in the level of the market.</seg>
<seg id=1651> If the market price goes beyond this figure, tariff on fair trade will increase in order to remain higher 5 cent / book.</seg>
<seg id=1652> As regards the small producers, they must be cooperatives or other types of groups for democratic participation.</seg>
<seg id=1653> The plantations and factories can claim of fair trade label if they offer a decent wage their workers, if they comply with the health standards, environmental and safety, if they allow the trade unions or any other form of workers' associations, if they provide a decent accommodation workers who work far from home and use or forced labour, child labour.</seg>
<seg id=1654> Everybody does not approve of fair trade.</seg>
<seg id=1655> Lindsey brink, Director of the Centre for trade policies of the cato Institute, pro-marché body, believes that the campaign for coffee labellisé "fair trade is a deadlock paved with good intentions'.</seg>
<seg id=1656> It is in justifying that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices is not unreasonable profit-taking to by the multinationals, but in the considerable increase of coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with the new technical culture caféière by working less and therefore cheaply.</seg>
<seg id=1657> In the prospect of Lindsey, if we want to help the coffee growers, we must encourage them to abandon coffee and turn to cultures most profitable -- it insists here, rightly, on trade restrictions imposed by the rich countries and on subsidies which are obstacles should be abolished -- or products of high added value, such as the special cafés that can be paid more expensive.</seg>
<seg id=1658> What is odd in the arguments of Lindsey, however, is that the campaign for fair coffee seems to do exactly what it recommends, that is to say encourage the coffee growers to produce special cafés can be paid more expensive.</seg>
<seg id=1659> Economists pro-marché not contradictory businesses that use openly the attraction of luxury to promote their products.</seg>
<seg id=1660> If people are prepared to spend $48 for a book of coffee Jamaican mountain blue, because it is coffee preferred of James Bond, economists believe not, in this case, that the market is distorted.</seg>
<seg id=1661> Why, then, be so critical of consumers who want to pay $12 for a book of coffee which they know that he was cultivated pesticide-free, under trees ombrageux favourable to the survival of birds, for producers who can now feed decently and educate their children?</seg>
<seg id=1662> Economists could reply to that if you want to help people to feed and educate their children, it is possible to buy a book of coffee non-équitable identical to the taste for $10 and pay the remaining a $2 charity that distributes food and scolarise poor children.</seg>
<seg id=1663> It is in fact a possible strategy. But fair trade is real benefits.</seg>
<seg id=1664> Producers know that they will make a coffee appreciated consumers not only for his taste, but also for the way in which it is cultivated.</seg>
<seg id=1665> If their coffee sold well, they are proud to have produced a product sought in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1666> From the point of view of farmers, receive a premium by selling a product labellisé fair trade is preferable to an charity that they receive anyway, workers or not, and whatever the quality of their production.</seg>
<seg id=1667> Pay more for a product labellisé fair trade is not more "anti-marché 'that spending more to buy a product of marks positions.</seg>
<seg id=1668> Moreover, this label reflects better ethical priorities.</seg>
<seg id=1669> It is not only a subsidy granted by governments, its success dependent on the request of the market and not the lobbysme policy.</seg>
<seg id=1670> Fortunately, in Europe, this request is growing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id=1671> Let us hope that it will soon such levels everywhere in developed countries, where consumers can decide on their own how to spend their money.</seg>
<seg id=1672> Pigs and calves, American democracy</seg>
<seg id=1673> Among the flood of securities on the return of the democratic majority in Congress after the elections in November, the result of an important ballot largely gone unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id=1674> Although he has highlighted the shortcomings of the American political system, he has also allowed to think again compassion ordinary American citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1675> In Arizona, citizens can, if they have produced a sufficient number of signatures, submit a draft law direct to the popular vote.</seg>
<seg id=1676> This year, one of the questions put to the universal suffrage was a law to ban that sows gestantes calves, or high for meat, are sanglés or locked in a way which prevents them to move freely, lie or to extend their members.</seg>
<seg id=1677> Those who do not know the intensive farming methods will be astonished perhaps the need for such legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1678> Traditional farming, as applied throughout the world fifty years ago, and in some countries even today allows animals move and stretch.</seg>
<seg id=1679> But today, almost 90% of reproductive sows -- mothers pigs reared and slaughtered for meat, bacon and ham -- spend most of their lives in pens measuring around 60 centimeters by 2.2 metres.</seg>
<seg id=1680> They cannot turn or extend their legs once lying or or move forward more a step.</seg>
<seg id=1681> They are also sometimes sanglées to limit their movements.</seg>
<seg id=1682> Similarly, the calves are confined their lives in individual boxes where they cannot go to bed, or stretch.</seg>
<seg id=1683> In essence, these methods aim to save the Labor costs. They facilitate the management of animals and allow employ fewer workers, and less qualified.</seg>
<seg id=1684> They also prevents animals wasting energy on déplaçdant or fighting between them.</seg>
<seg id=1685> A few years ago, following protests of animal welfare organisations, the European Commission has called for a report to the Standing Veterinary Committee of the EU on the intensive farming methods.</seg>
<seg id=1686> The report's conclusions indicate that animals suffer cannot move slackness and have nothing to do days.</seg>
<seg id=1687> Of course, the simple good sense allows us to reach the same conclusions.</seg>
<seg id=1688> As a follow-up to the report, the EU has set the dates from which the confinement of animals will be banned.</seg>
<seg id=1689> For calves, 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id=1690> The individual sow stalls, already banned in the United Kingdom and Sweden, will be banned from 2013 onwards throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1691> Measures to improve the welfare of laying hens, high in battery cages in treillis without enough room to extend their wings, are also applied progressively.</seg>
<seg id=1692> In the US, nothing of the sort.</seg>
<seg id=1693> My European friends ago, when I was asked why the US samples such a delay in the welfare of animals in Europe, I knew that answer.</seg>
<seg id=1694> If they insisted, I had to admit that a possible explanation was that the Americans did not least animals that Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1695> Then, in 2002, the animal welfare associations parvinrent popular vote to submit a proposal for a ban of individual sow stalls Florida.</seg>
<seg id=1696> To the surprise, the proposal was accepted by 55% of voters.</seg>
<seg id=1697> Last month in Arizona, despite a opposition generously funded by the agri-food industry, the ban on containment boxes for calves and pigs has also been approved by 62% of voters.</seg>
<seg id=1698> Neither the Florida or Arizona are particularly progressive States -- both voted for George W. Bush against John Kerry in 2004.</seg>
<seg id=1699> The results of the two referenda suggest that if all Americans should decide on maintaining sows gestantes and calves in containment, a large majority opposed.</seg>
<seg id=1700> Ultimately, it seems that the Americans are equally that Europeans living conditions for animals.</seg>
<seg id=1701> To explain the difference between the welfare of animals in Europe and America, it must undoubtedly compare political systems.</seg>
<seg id=1702> In Europe, the concerns of voters on the living conditions of animals have found an echo among members of the national parliaments and the European Parliament, with the adoption of national laws and EU directives to improve their fate.</seg>
<seg id=1703> In the US, however, these same concerns have not had any visible effect on the Members of Congress.</seg>
<seg id=1704> There is no federal law on the welfare of animals and practically no legislation at Member State level.</seg>
<seg id=1705> àb my opinion, tens of millions of dollars in the agri-food industry enjoyed by the representatives seeking to be re-elected is for something.</seg>
<seg id=1706> The movement of animals, despite strong popular support, is not the weight in the political arena of lobbying and electoral donations.</seg>
<seg id=1707> In the American electoral races, money is more important that the opinion of the electorate.</seg>
<seg id=1708> The party discipline is weak and congressmen themselves must meet the bulk of the funds needed to re-election -- in this case, every two years for the Members of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id=1709> In Europe, where the discipline of parties is respected and where the parties, and not the candidates, fund electoral campaigns, less money plays an important role.</seg>
<seg id=1710> In the US, a country that is proud of its democratic tradition, calves and pigs are far not only losers.</seg>
<seg id=1711> What nine on the new army composed entirely of Afghans?</seg>
<seg id=1712> The assassination of the Afghan Minister aviation by a host (perhaps led by members of the own interim administration of Afghanistan) shows that Afghan society remains deeply showing cracks.</seg>
<seg id=1713> The first reforms on the Afghan army will only exacerbate these divisions.</seg>
<seg id=1714> Secretary of Defense temporary administration of Hamid Karzai in Kabul has already nominated the senior officers of this new army.</seg>
<seg id=1715> The Secretary General Mohammed fahim Tajikistan, is a district of Panjshir in the north, which has become three months earlier the head of the Northern Alliance forces have seized Kabul after the bombers Americans their have cleared the way.</seg>
<seg id=1716> As a group, its allocation is a direct challenge to the objective of reunification of the country of Mr. Karzai.</seg>
<seg id=1717> Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic nation, the most important being the pashtounes group, which represent the two-fifths of the total population.</seg>
<seg id=1718> The Hazars and Tajiks respectively are one-fifth of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1719> On the officers to general 38 idolised by Mr. fahim, thirty-seven are Tajiks, the trente-huitième as a Uzbek.</seg>
<seg id=1720> If, on the 15 to 17 million pashtounes of the country, some are recruited as soldiers, they will serve as a command structure consisting of Tajiks almost entirely.</seg>
<seg id=1721> The language of pashtounes tajik differ, however, as the Spanish and English, and millions of pashtounes reaching the age of military service have at best only a few concepts of tajik.</seg>
<seg id=1722> The geographical profile of the new military authority is also restricted that its ethnic composition.</seg>
<seg id=1723> Thirty-five on the 38 senior officers are from a small area north of Kabul with the province of parwan (where is the airport at Bagram) and near the Panjshir Valley, along the bastion of the Northern Alliance.</seg>
<seg id=1724> In other words, the potential leaders from twenty-seven of the 29 Afghan provinces have been excluded from the new military elite of their country.</seg>
<seg id=1725> A small group if could perhaps overcome the impression that its members are a clique closed if they represented a broad cross-section of the dozen political parties of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1726> But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id=1727> Eighteen 38 senior officers have just one party, the jamiat-e-islami, the Islamic faction that has long been led by Mullah and former lecturer theology burhanuddin Rabbani.</seg>
<seg id=1728> This was the party which gouverna Kabul a short time in the mid-1990s, creating the carnage and chaos which led most Afghans to welcome the arrival of the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id=1729> The Communists equalled almost the number of Members of the jamiat in the military.</seg>
<seg id=1730> Sixteen 38 officers have long line on this party whose tricks in the late 1970's led to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89 which has cost two and a half million Afghan lives.</seg>
<seg id=1731> Most of the Afghans believe today the Communists with the same degree of sympathy that the Czechs or Poles earmark the National Socialists Hitler.</seg>
<seg id=1732> It is true that the Afghans, as elsewhere, joined the Communist Party for various reasons and that they were by no means all hardened ideologues.</seg>
<seg id=1733> But in the case of General Marshall fahim, six were professional workers of the Communist Party and continued to serve the party after the invasion of the Red Army.</seg>
<seg id=1734> These six men, plus three communists who served as officers in the Afghan army, have actively cooperated during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which lasted for a decade.</seg>
<seg id=1735> Imagine how the French have reacted if a quarter of the French officers of the après-deuxième World War were joined the Wehrmacht during that it was their country.</seg>
<seg id=1736> In Afghanistan, the new travel quickly by the mouth ear.</seg>
<seg id=1737> The Nationalists Afghans (i.e. almost all Afghans) soon find the political reasons Members of the innermost circle Marshall fahim, if this has not already happened.</seg>
<seg id=1738> Even this overwhelming evidence of partiality and prejudice in the formation of high command of the new army could be outvoted if the generals professionalism and included a commitment to patriotic values of national really armed forces in their task.</seg>
<seg id=1739> Unfortunately, only ten 38 promoted by fahim officers have received a trained military officers professionals.</seg>
<seg id=1740> A eleventh served as a pilot.</seg>
<seg id=1741> By contrast, 24 on the general 38 (training of general four remaining remain unknown) are civilians, who had a profession, which come from the offices of the Communist Party or, in some cases, which have been Mullah.</seg>
<seg id=1742> That means all these statistics in terms of everyday reality?</seg>
<seg id=1743> It means that when the Heads of international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, as the official military and diplomatic Americans, face the Afghan sous-ministre defence, they will Abdul Rashid dostum warlord, a war and a Communist notoriously brutal and corrupt which remains in contact with old friends of the Red Army, which are still in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id=1744> This means that the head of the Afghan armed forces and the operation commander and the leader of the intelligence service of the army are also Communists, men whose loyalty remain uncertain and which many Afghans distrust.</seg>
<seg id=1745> This team has opportunities to unify a Afghanistan torn apart by war?</seg>
<seg id=1746> The presence in Kabul a dubious team if has opportunities to instil confidence among three-quarters of the Afghan people, who are excluded from military high command?</seg>
<seg id=1747> This list is or rather the harvest of a "approach 'everything for the winner of government is obliged (at some point in the future) to unleash another national bloody reaction by those whose legitimate interests were cynically trampled underfoot?</seg>
<seg id=1748> The UN and the European and American politicians must reflect on these issues before agreeing to a relentless power by a small minority unpopular.</seg>
<seg id=1749> Celebration of the irrational</seg>
<seg id=1750> Hurra Nobel Prize winners for the new economy: Daniel kahneman princeton university and Vernon Smith George mason university Virginia.</seg>
<seg id=1751> As many Nobel Prize, these rewards recognise not only determining the work undertaken by Mr kahneman and Smith, but also schools of thought they have helped to develop.</seg>
<seg id=1752> Mr kahneman and psychologist, has shown that individuals behave in a less systematically classic that conventional economists believe.</seg>
<seg id=1753> Its work shows not only that individuals sometimes act differently predictions standard economic theory, but also that they regularly, systematically, and in a manner which can be understood and interpreted through different hypotheses projects compete with those used by economists traditional.</seg>
<seg id=1754> For most of the market players, and indeed ordinary observers, it does not appear to difference.</seg>
<seg id=1755> Brokers of Wall Street who traffic with actions that they know be bad exploit the irrational that Mr kahneman and Smith demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id=1756> A large part of the issues which led to the ballooning of markets was based on the exploitation of psychology investors.</seg>
<seg id=1757> In fact, this irrationality is not new for economists either.</seg>
<seg id=1758> John Maynard Keynes once the stock market as not being based on the fight of individuals rational to discover the foundations of markets, but rather as in a beauty contest in which the winner is the best guess that those judges will.</seg>
<seg id=1759> The Nobel Prize this year celebrating the criticism of the market economy simplistic, as last year (which I have received with two other colleagues).</seg>
<seg id=1760> The winners last year focused on the fact that the different market players have different information (and imperfect), and that this asymmetry information has a marked impact on the functioning of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1761> In particular, the winners of last year sous-entendaient that markets are generally not efficient; that remains to governments a great role to play.</seg>
<seg id=1762> The invisible hand of Adam Smith, the idea that free trade leads to the efficiency and guided by an invisible hand, is invisible in part because it does not exist.</seg>
<seg id=1763> This, too, is not new to those who work effectively with the markets (and are taking advantage of this wealth of information and the asymmetry exceeding).</seg>
<seg id=1764> For more than twenty years, economists have passionate models for these so-called "rational" forecasts who assumed that all actors have the same information (even imperfect) and are acting perfectly rational and the markets are fully effective, there is never any unemployment (except when it is caused by the unions greedy or the minimum wage imposed by governments), and there is never any rationing of funding.</seg>
<seg id=1765> Such models are dominant, particularly in the postgraduate courses in the United States, despite the evidence to the contrary which show the triumph of ideology on science.</seg>
<seg id=1766> Unfortunately, students of these programmes of higher education today are the decision-makers many countries and they are trying to put in place programmes based on these ideas, the so-called today market fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id=1767> Let me be clear: the models of rational forecasts have contributed significantly to economic theory; rigour that their advocates have imposed on economic thinking has served to highlight the weakness of many underlying suppositions.</seg>
<seg id=1768> All good scientific thought knows acknowledge its limits, but the prophets of rational forecasts generally have shown little modesty.</seg>
<seg id=1769> Vernon Smith is one of the leaders of the development of the experimental economy, the idea that we can test many economic proposals in a laboratory.</seg>
<seg id=1770> One of the reasons why the economy is a complex issue, which also explains the many disagreements between economists, is that economists cannot conduct controlled experiments.</seg>
<seg id=1771> Nature imbalance real-life experience, but in most of circumstances, so many things can change so quickly that it is often difficult to disentangle the causes of the consequences.</seg>
<seg id=1772> In principle, in a laboratory, we can conduct controlled experiments, and thus provide inférences more reliable.</seg>
<seg id=1773> The criticism of the experimental economy are worried about the fact that the subjects apportent aux experimental contexts patterns of thought determined outside the experience, and that the experience and the inférences also are not spare and clear that in the natural sciences.</seg>
<seg id=1774> Nevertheless, the economic experiments provide some knowledge of a large number of issues, such as the design improved auctions.</seg>
<seg id=1775> Above all, irrationality market players, the main question of the work of Mr kahneman, true repeatedly in the context of laboratories.</seg>
<seg id=1776> One of the most interesting results released by the experimental economy is altruism and selfishness.</seg>
<seg id=1777> It seems (at least in situations experimental) that the trial subjects are not as selfish that economists believe, apart from a group: the economists itself.</seg>
<seg id=1778> Because the economy is even discipline which attracts individuals who are, by nature, egotists or because the economy can shaping individuals in order to make them more selfish?</seg>
<seg id=1779> The answer, certainly, is certainly a bit of both.</seg>
<seg id=1780> There is no doubt that the experimental research and the future work help resolve this issue the relative importance of these two hypotheses.</seg>
<seg id=1781> The Nobel prize shows how important it is to study individuals and economies as they are and not as we want to see them.</seg>
<seg id=1782> Only by including better real human behavior can we hope to devise policies that will also do better function our economies.</seg>
<seg id=1783> Bush and his energy policy of bad faith</seg>
<seg id=1784> An episode of more outlandish happened, this year, in the World Economic Forum in Davos. Experts from the oil industry have explained that the melting of the polar women -- much faster than all forecasts announced ­ -- is not only a problem, but also a new chance that enormous quantities of oil will now be accessible.</seg>
<seg id=1785> Similarly, these experts have recognized that America's refusal to sign the law of the Sea, the international convention which determines access to sources of offshore oil and other maritime mineral resources, represents a risk of international conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1786> However, they also stressed the advantages: the oil industry, in its quest constantly new reserves, does not need beseech Congress to obtain the right to plunder Alaska.</seg>
<seg id=1787> President George W. Bush has a strange ability to do not understand the important messages.</seg>
<seg id=1788> For years, it is increasingly clear that its energy policy is amiss.</seg>
<seg id=1789> Some members of his party refer even a former energy bill, written by the oil industry, as highly advantageous for all lobbyists.</seg>
<seg id=1790> By praised the virtues of the market economy, the only purpose of Bush is to give huge subsidies to the oil industry, despite increasing deficits that the country faces.</seg>
<seg id=1791> However, the market does not work properly when it is a question of energy. Government intervention should take a sense totally opposed to that the Bush administration has proposed.</seg>
<seg id=1792> The fact that the Americans do not pay the price of pollution -- and above all of their huge production of greenhouse gases -- resulting from their energy waste leads to a devaluation of the energy prices, and the excessive consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1793> The government must encourage energy savings. His speech on price fixing, mainly through the energy taxes, is an effective method.</seg>
<seg id=1794> But, instead of energy saving, Bush persists in a policy of ‘ first draining America ’ of its own resources, making it in future even more dependent on oil resources external.</seg>
<seg id=1795> Whether a strong demand is rising oil prices and thus creates a godsend for many countries in the Middle East, which are not the best friends of America.</seg>
<seg id=1796> Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it seems that Bush has finally taken the measure of the increasing energy-dependence of America. It had become difficult for him not to see the consequences of galloping rising oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1797> But, again, actions hesitant his government does not fail to aggravate the problems in the immediate future.</seg>
<seg id=1798> Bush refuses even to act in favour of energy saving and spends ultimately very little money to support his continued prayer technological salvation.</seg>
<seg id=1799> What is to be done, then, the recent statement by Bush on its commitment to reduce, within the 25 years, America's oil dependency on the Middle East 75%?</seg>
<seg id=1800> For investors, the message is clear: we are more in the new reserves in the Middle East which are by far the least expensive oil resources of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1801> However, if there is no new investment in the reserves of the Middle East, the unbridled growth of energy consumption in the United States, China and elsewhere implies that demand outstrips supply.</seg>
<seg id=1802> And to crown it all, the threat of sanctions against Iran Bush could provoke interruptions of supply, one of the biggest producers of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1803> With a global level of oil production and almost maximum price has almost doubled since the war in Iraq, this foreshadows even higher prices and even more profits for the oil industry, the only real winner of Bush's policy in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1804> Nevertheless, nobody should reproach Bush for having acknowledged that there is a problem.</seg>
<seg id=1805> But, as always, its proposals are nothing other than a small trick of its administration.</seg>
<seg id=1806> In addition to its refusal to admit global warming, to encourage energy savings or to allocate sufficient funds for further research, the great promise of Bush to reduce American dependence on oil from the Middle East does not mean a lot.</seg>
<seg id=1807> With only 20% of America's oil extracted in the Middle East, the objective of Bush could simply be achieved by increasing modestly supplies from other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1808> The Bush administration must realise that oil benefits of the world market.</seg>
<seg id=1809> Even if America was completely independent of oil from the Middle East, the reduction of energy production of this region would have devastating effects on world prices and especially on the American economy.</seg>
<seg id=1810> As is too often the case with the Bush administration, there is no clear explanation of the official policy.</seg>
<seg id=1811> Bush is to play with the policy waving the feeling anti-arabe and anti-iranien Americans?</seg>
<seg id=1812> Or is yet another example of incompetence and confusion?</seg>
<seg id=1813> According to what we saw in the last five years, the right answer offers little more than a bad faith and sheer folly.</seg>
<seg id=1814> The roadmap China</seg>
<seg id=1815> China is on the point of adopting its 11th five-year plan, taking the scene to extend what is probably the most remarkable economic transformation of history, while improving the welfare of almost a quarter of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id=1816> Never before the world had suffered as sustainable growth; never before has there been such a reduction in poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1817> The explanation for long-term success of China is partly in its unique association of pragmatism and vision of the future.</seg>
<seg id=1818> When a large part of the rest of the developing world, following the Washington consensus, is launched in a quest to increase in GDP worthy of Don Quixote, China has once again made clear that it sought increases and fairer sustainable levels of real life.</seg>
<seg id=1819> China realise that it has entered a period of economic growth imposing huge demands on the environment that cannot continue.</seg>
<seg id=1820> Unless we change of course, standards of living will eventually be compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1821> It is for this reason that the new five-year plan really puts the emphasis on the environment.</seg>
<seg id=1822> Many of China among the most backward regions have undergone a rapid growth if we crierait wonders if the other parts of the country was even more rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id=1823> While this phenomenon has reduced poverty, inequality has increased, with growing disparities between urban and rural areas and between regions of the coasts and within.</seg>
<seg id=1824> This year's report of the World Bank explains why inequality, and not only poverty, should raise concerns; but the 11th five-year plan of China frontalement tackles the problem.</seg>
<seg id=1825> The government is a more harmonious society for several years, and plan describes ambitious programmes for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id=1826> China also recognises that this between the least developed countries of the most developed countries is not only a disparity of resources, but also of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1827> It has therefore drawn up projects bold to reduce these disparities and create a basis for an independent innovation.</seg>
<seg id=1828> China's role in the world and in the world economy has changed, and the plan also reflects this situation.</seg>
<seg id=1829> Its future growth will be based more on domestic demand that on exports, which implies an increase in consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1830> Indeed, China suffers from a rare problem: a savings excessive.</seg>
<seg id=1831> People save partly because of weaknesses in social insurance programs of government: to strengthen social security (pensions), public health and education will reduce simultaneously social inequalities, increase the sense of well-being of citizens and will promote the everyday.</seg>
<seg id=1832> If that worked (and, until now, China has almost always surpassed even his own high expectations) these adjustments might impose huge pressure on a global economic system already destabilized by the enormous fiscal and trade imbalances of the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1833> If China at least save -- and if, as has announced its representatives, it pursues a policy more diverse investment of its reserves, which will finance the trade deficit of more than $2 billion per day of the United States?</seg>
<seg id=1834> This is a subject to address another day, but this is not perhaps so distant.</seg>
<seg id=1835> With a clear vision of the future, the challenge will lie in the implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1836> China is a great country, which could not succeed both without a wide-ranging decentralisation.</seg>
<seg id=1837> But decentralisation raises its own problems.</seg>
<seg id=1838> Greenhouse gases, for example, are global problems.</seg>
<seg id=1839> While America proclaims that it does not have the resources to do anything about this, the most senior officials Chinese acted more responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1840> In the space of one month after the adoption of the plan, new ecological taxes on cars, petrol and timber products were imposed: China uses the market mechanisms to solve its environmental problems and those of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1841> But the pressure on those responsible for the local governments in that they create economic growth and jobs will be enormous.</seg>
<seg id=1842> They will be very tempted to say that if America is not capable of producing way to protect our planet, how would they?</seg>
<seg id=1843> This vision to translate into action, the Chinese Government will need strong policies, including hefty increases taxes on the environment.</seg>
<seg id=1844> While China became a market economy, it saw develop some problems which are the scourge of developed countries: specific interests concealing self-interest under a market ideology.</seg>
<seg id=1845> Some will mention the simple trickle-down effect where: do you not for the poor, in the end everybody will benefit from growth.</seg>
<seg id=1846> Will the and other competition policies strict laws and corporate governance: let Darwinism operate its wonders.</seg>
<seg id=1847> Arguments growth will be made to counter strong social and environmental policies: for example, raise taxes on gasoline kill our motor industry to emerge.</seg>
<seg id=1848> Such policies so-called pro-croissance fail do not only to provide growth, they would threaten the entire vision of the future of China.</seg>
<seg id=1849> There is only one way to avoid this: the open discussion of economic policies to expose the sophistry and give the means to implement creative solutions for the many challenges China faces today.</seg>
<seg id=1850> George W. Bush has shown as it is dangerous to abuse of secrecy and restrict the decision-making process to a close circle of sycophantes.</seg>
<seg id=1851> Most people outside China do not realise how its leaders, conversely, engaged in the deliberations extensive and wide-ranging consultations (albeit with foreigners) while they struggle to solve the enormous problem they face.</seg>
<seg id=1852> Market economies are not auto-régulatrices.</seg>
<seg id=1853> They cannot simply be left in autopilot, especially if we want to ensure that the benefits are widely shared.</seg>
<seg id=1854> But manage a market economy is not easy.</seg>
<seg id=1855> It is a balance must always react to economic changes.</seg>
<seg id=1856> The 11th five-year plan of China provides a roadmap in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1857> The world, full of hope and fear, while the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to be processed.</seg>
<seg id=1858> The lessons on democracy de Tocqueville</seg>
<seg id=1859> The war in Iraq, 200 years after the birth of Tocqueville, the world is the nature of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1860> Rightly Tocqueville is famous for having rejected the reactionary nostalgia in recital that democracy was our destiny, but we warning on the dangers that it contains for freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1861> Should we share his concern?</seg>
<seg id=1862> Tocqueville do not regard democracy as a political system, but above all as an intellectual system which shapes the customs and habits of society, accusing it a sociological and psychological dimension.</seg>
<seg id=1863> Tocqueville believed that the democratic regimes guide our thoughts, our hopes and our passions.</seg>
<seg id=1864> Similarly there was Renaissance man and the 20th century the Homo sovieticus, "the democratic rights" is a form of human beings.</seg>
<seg id=1865> The effects for Tocqueville, systemic democracy can get people to renounce their ability to reasoning.</seg>
<seg id=1866> They can only pretend to judge the events and values by themselves, when in fact they are réductrices repeating the views of the majority.</seg>
<seg id=1867> What Tocqueville called the stranglehold of the "social" on the opinion is probably stronger in democratic systems - a point of view that was the level of demagogy and manipulation by the media in the modern world.</seg>
<seg id=1868> Tocqueville believed that in the long term, nothing can oppose really this trend.</seg>
<seg id=1869> Neither local democracy, or small groups within society, neither the checks and balances, and civil rights cannot prevent the decline of critical thought that democracy is cause.</seg>
<seg id=1870> School is at best an enclave immune influence irresistible that society has in mind.</seg>
<seg id=1871> Similarly, Tocqueville believed that research of virtue fashion to the old or a religious faith occasionally raise the soul, but one and the other are incompatible with the democratic ideal when they are imposed by the authorities in the framework of public life.</seg>
<seg id=1872> In this respect, the néo-marxistes theorists school Frankfurt and Hannah Arendt who feared above all the disappearance of reason in modern societies are the heirs of thought de Tocqueville.</seg>
<seg id=1873> We can also note that the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet has called one of these recent books democracy against itself.</seg>
<seg id=1874> For these authors, democratic way of life tends to eliminate any original thinking and to prevent the emergence of a culture of good level, a mediocrity that leaves the citizens vulnerable to the enemies of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1875> If history is rife with criminal regimes supported by masses intimidated and manipulated, the greatest risk of democratic countries is to see their citizens sink into indifference and confine itself to a short-term thinking, in the search for their immediate interest.</seg>
<seg id=1876> The past - despite the rituals which aim to commemorate the historic events - is masked by the dependence on this moment and the last novelty.</seg>
<seg id=1877> Even the ruling class, supposed well educated, is a victim of this grip.</seg>
<seg id=1878> The main problem with the democratic mentality lies in its lack of historical awareness.</seg>
<seg id=1879> As stated Tocqueville, the shortcomings of democracy are the only road - pessimism resigned realistic but unacceptable - which opens to us?</seg>
<seg id=1880> I do not think so.</seg>
<seg id=1881> There are ways to combat what one might call the "democratic" stupidity that spread today.</seg>
<seg id=1882> The first of these resources is to develop an education system which form of real critical minds, notably through teaching materials largely neglected (nowadays) that are literature, history and philosophy.</seg>
<seg id=1883> If we want to train informed citizens and able to think for themselves, which is necessary for the functioning of democracy, our schools must stop chasing the recent modes underway and begin to develop capacities analysis of pupils.</seg>
<seg id=1884> Because of their tendency to cultivate the superficial and diverted, the mass media are the main obstacle to such an education.</seg>
<seg id=1885> Today, many people spend more time during their lives to the TV that in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id=1886> Passivity that the mass media mislead is exactly the opposite of the active involvement of citizens, necessary to democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1887> But it is difficult to imagine that the mass media (newspapers) accept the quality of their own volition to become the tools of education which would develop the critical spirit of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1888> This focus on the mass media is not an elitist contempt for the popular culture.</seg>
<seg id=1889> It is not just a question of popularity - Mozart was popular in its time and coins from Shakespeare attiraient the poor and the rich, but the refusal of mass culture questioning and cause.</seg>
<seg id=1890> The result is a widespread passive indifference and the public.</seg>
<seg id=1891> For a long time, a global media culture spreads increasingly incapable of cause critical or to raise the sentiments.</seg>
<seg id=1892> Because of its disinterest in these questions is a culture which threatens democratic freedoms because it is in no way a sense of duty to society, history or the Community.</seg>
<seg id=1893> It is too late to defend itself against a culture which émousse the minds?</seg>
<seg id=1894> Tocqueville scorned the elites of time because of their complacency about the dangers of the mass democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1895> The short-sightedness of our leaders will promote the achievement of its worrying prophecy?</seg>
<seg id=1896> A Europe for all</seg>
<seg id=1897> The old members of the European Union seem to doubt the future of the European Union, but Ukrainians watch the European Union with a certain hope and admiration.</seg>
<seg id=1898> The basic aim of our foreign policy is to integrate the European progress, because Ukraine has discovered that national autonomy is not an end in itself, but simply a beginning.</seg>
<seg id=1899> Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when a nation is victim of ostracism, no nation is free.</seg>
<seg id=1900> Europeans, we are all bound by a link, which we cannot avoid linked in a single destiny.</seg>
<seg id=1901> All aspects of culture that we share, not to mention the century of suffering that we have to share, we confirm this.</seg>
<seg id=1902> Everything affecting a European directly affects us all indirectly.</seg>
<seg id=1903> We can never again afford to live with the close notions of two Europes, a Europe of the haves and have-nots, a Europe of elected eliminated.</seg>
<seg id=1904> Anyone who lives on the European continent today cannot in fact must not be regarded as a foreigner to its Union.</seg>
<seg id=1905> The great Pax Europa today, as the current pan-European prosperity, depends on it.</seg>
<seg id=1906> Of course, some will say that Ukraine is not part of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1907> They come to Kiev and meet its inhabitants, young and old, workers, the wives of farmers, lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood up and remained standing in the cold and snow for weeks to defend their freedoms last winter.</seg>
<seg id=1908> To those who are not united rallied around the General de Gaulle within the French resistance?</seg>
<seg id=1909> Do they do not bodies with those who died in the fight in defence of the Spanish Republic in the 1930s, those who libérèrent Budapest in 1956 and set end fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970s?</seg>
<seg id=1910> Heated are not the same spirit as the Union solidarnösc Polish and peaceful masses which amorcèrent the Velvet Revolution in Prague in 1989?</seg>
<seg id=1911> This is the soul of Europe and no doubt cannot destroy it.</seg>
<seg id=1912> All those who believe that Ukraine is too lagging behind to become a member of the Union, I would say this: they have also visit my country and see mothers who remain late to the Bureau for their children to teach the use of computer their office.</seg>
<seg id=1913> They have just attend language courses of each village and city where our youth prepares for Europe by learning French, German and English.</seg>
<seg id=1914> Those who doubt the European vocation of Ukraine should understand that Europe is not just a matter of equipment and motorways: it is the craving for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=1915> I believe that our future is also promising that Europe's past is proud, and that our aim is not that of a land border forgotten in a troubled region but a participant influential of peace and unity of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1916> Self-determination no longer means insulating because reach national independence nowadays simply means the return on the world stage with a new Statute.</seg>
<seg id=1917> The new nations can build with their former occupiers the same sort of productive relationship that France has established with Germany: a relationship based on equality and mutual interests.</seg>
<seg id=1918> This is the relationship that my government wishes to establish with Russia, so that we can help to extend the area of peace in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1919> It is premature, of course, to go beyond the indication of the utmost importance that we attach to the possibility of joining the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1920> We know that our role in this great structure will not come about overnight.</seg>
<seg id=1921> We know that the major projects of European unification are not limited to documents and declarations but taking root in the innovative action designed to improve the living standards and provide security for all Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1922> Building a dignified Ukraine to join the European Union will not be easy or rapid and without effort.</seg>
<seg id=1923> But as the European Union itself, this will be built and this will happen.</seg>
<seg id=1924> We know that the challenge is high but this is worthwhile and Europe must understand that this is our objective.</seg>
<seg id=1925> The renovation of Ukraine happening in part by a battle innovative to put an end to a century nightmarish during which fascism and communism, ideologies born at the heart of Europe clashed to take power.</seg>
<seg id=1926> Through the Ukrainian mentioned a few months ago, parents and children faced armed troops, grondants dogs and even death.</seg>
<seg id=1927> Only a few years ago, a young journalist Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public about corruption of our former regime, and décapité was brutalized by the henchmen of the regime.</seg>
<seg id=1928> Our orange revolution, last winter, has proved that Ukraine and its people could win.</seg>
<seg id=1929> Thus, despite the doubts and the difficulties, I retains a staunch confidence in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1930> I refuse to accept despair as final response to the ambiguities and horrors of the history of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id=1931> I refuse to accept the idea that Ukraine is so tragically condemned to live at the heart of the night without stars of the Communist legacy of never be able to see the day of peace and a genuine European unity.</seg>
<seg id=1932> When the citizens of the European Union look at the place of Ukraine in Europe they need to examine closely and look beyond the face as we speak.</seg>
<seg id=1933> See beyond the regions devastated that we imposed communism, beyond poverty and social divisions through which our former leaders today répudiés sought to extend their grip.</seg>
<seg id=1934> Instead, they will look very closely at the face of our President, Victor Yushchenko, ravaged by the poison it has administered during the election campaign last year and remember the words of that great French than was André Malraux, for that "the finest faces are those which are injured."</seg>
<seg id=1935> Muslim civil war</seg>
<seg id=1936> The gap between Sunni Shiite and in the Middle East is now more profound that the conflict between Israel and the Arabs?</seg>
<seg id=1937> One might think at seeing the reaction of some Arab governments the decisions of Hezbollah attacking Israel.</seg>
<seg id=1938> While the Israeli bombs and tyr fall on Beirut, Saudi Arabia, perhaps the Muslim Arab state of all the more conservative, has openly condemned the Shiite Hezbollah acts which initiated the conflict against Israel.</seg>
<seg id=1939> Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, which regards itself as the leader of the Muslim Arab people had supported Israel if openly.</seg>
<seg id=1940> Moreover, the breakdown of Saudi Arabia with Hezbollah is not an isolated case.</seg>
<seg id=1941> Egypt and Jordan have also categorically condemned Hezbollah and its leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, for their adventurism.</seg>
<seg id=1942> What is behind this astonishing situation?</seg>
<seg id=1943> We are experiencing a fundamental change in the relationship between nationalism bigotry Arab and Islamic?</seg>
<seg id=1944> The government has he Sunni Saudi Arabia more fear and anxiety Shiite before it means in Arab unity and the Palestinian cause?</seg>
<seg id=1945> Denunciations Hezbollah by Arabs suggest that the gap sectarian Muslim, already evident in the daily violence in Iraq widening and intensifies throughout the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1946> The will of President George W. Bush to destroy companies frozen in the Arab world was doomed to draw up the forces of modernisation against the traditional components of Arab and Islamic societies.</seg>
<seg id=1947> It seems to be released most atavistic forces in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1948> The opening of this Pandora's has been able to give rise to an even more dreadful era of general violence, which without doubt that cannot be called "Muslim civil war."</seg>
<seg id=1949> The gap chiite-sunnite exists since the dawn of the history of Islam, but geographical isolation and ethnic non-arabe Shiite Iran and the domination of their minorities Sunni, Shia by Arab countries generally has left this rivalry into the background.</seg>
<seg id=1950> These tensions has fallen further at the wave of Islamicisation '"created by the Iranian revolution, because in its wake identity sectarian Sunni Arabs has been more relegated to the background as' Islamic 'statement was a widespread.</seg>
<seg id=1951> All this has changed when Al Qaeda, a Sunni terrorist group which is largely based ideology and staff wahabbites Saudis, launched its attacks against America in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1952> A Sunni specifically branch of militant Islam was under way.</seg>
<seg id=1953> When the United States have launched wars against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and against the Sunni Iraqi Sunni, this new trend Sunni radical has acquired more adventurous.</seg>
<seg id=1954> Sunni Arabs in the region, who have become insurance won, Israel and the West as a single threat, including the so-called "Shi'a Crescent" -- the arc of land which stretches of Lebanon to Iran via Syria and Iraq, populated by the supposed heretical Shiites.</seg>
<seg id=1955> The leaders in Saudi Arabia, as guardians of the sacred sites of the Muslim faith of Mecca and médine, perhaps this threat with more acute.</seg>
<seg id=1956> For the Sunni, Shia are not confined to dominate the oil-rich regions of Iran, Iraq, and the eastern regions of Saudi Arabia, they are also trying, by acts of Hezbollah, to usurp the role of "protector" of the central dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cause.</seg>
<seg id=1957> It is because the Saudi royal family derives its legitimacy from a strict form of Sunni Islam and casts doubt on the loyalty of its population that the Kingdom diverges Shiite Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id=1958> The irony of the thing is that America, protector of Saudi Arabia, made the assumption of responsibility by toppling Saddam Hussein Shiite possible and putting the Shia parties in power in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=1959> The Bush administration seems to recognize what it has done; the Shiite arc amounts in the Arab Muslim world, the US is trying to consolidate their protection of the Sunni arc -- Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia -- to the west of the region.</seg>
<seg id=1960> Israel, once implacable enemy of the Arab cause, now seems to encastré in this structure defensive.</seg>
<seg id=1961> But such a defensive position is necessarily unstable, simply by panarabes sentiments.</seg>
<seg id=1962> Today, the citizens remain static ordinary Saudis Al Jazeera and other networks of Arab satellite TV to follow events in Gaza and South Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id=1963> They see bloodshed Arab (not only), and Shiite Hezbollah answer.</seg>
<seg id=1964> For them, Hezbollah has become a model heroic resistance.</seg>
<seg id=1965> This situation leads the Saudi state to widen the rift sunnite-chiite.</seg>
<seg id=1966> After the official denunciation Hezbollah by the Kingdom, the Saudi state instructed its official Wahhabi clerics issuing fatwas condemning Hizbollah as irreverent Shiite and deviant.</seg>
<seg id=1967> Such sentences can only exacerbate divisions sectarian inside the Saudi Arabia and in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1968> Before the worsening of these antagonisms, by Sunni regimes increasingly believe that they need their own Hezbollah to combat in their corner?</seg>
<seg id=1969> If they come to this conclusion, they will not need search too far, because the fighters of this kind have already followed a training - offered by Al Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id=1970> Why Europe can no longer ignore Georgia</seg>
<seg id=1971> The time when Europe could rely on America to make war, restore peace and democracy in its own court is over.</seg>
<seg id=1972> With the enlargement of the European Union, and as has been demonstrated by the recent crisis of Russian gas, this Court now includes not only Ukraine but also Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1973> Indeed, in Georgia, such as Ukraine, democracy is being tested and Europe cannot afford to ignore.</seg>
<seg id=1974> Georgia was the first country post-Soviet space to operate its "color revolution ’ and as proof, with dignity and maturity, the choice of his people in favour of democracy and European values.</seg>
<seg id=1975> The flags of the European Union which float on all public buildings Georgians since then clearly show the attachment natural, as old as the history of this country which, in the ancient Greeks, was part of the world of the time.</seg>
<seg id=1976> The amazones Prometheus, médée, and in neighbouring Armenia Noah's ark are all signs that the Europe of our myths begins.</seg>
<seg id=1977> In its history, its culture, its old traditions, but also more recently, when Georgia was full of other republics of the former USSR, by its critical, independent even somewhat maverick, Georgia is probably still today the place of this area where the democratic transplant can take the better.</seg>
<seg id=1978> So it is all the more worrying democratization threatened.</seg>
<seg id=1979> Everything seemed have enough promisingly.</seg>
<seg id=1980> Without dissent thanks to the launch of a policy of reform, privatisation, fight against corruption, the search for new and therefore frameworks free of shady deals with the previous regime, the implementation of a foreign policy marked by a return of Europe in the game in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1981> The totalitarian mindset has resurfaced in these leaders who, declaring the representatives of the majority, have appropriated ever greater powers.</seg>
<seg id=1982> This is a caste which such as the Hydra to thousand is to die and rise from the ashes.</seg>
<seg id=1983> These and their methods of power that the ‘ rose revolution ’ in November 2003 wanted once and for all bowdlerise have reintroduced into the heart of power, extending their networks, including outside their borders, considerable financial burden, their skill scheming and the manipulation of political systems and electoral.</seg>
<seg id=1984> It is a power which do not sufficiently respect the essence of democracy is not at the ballot box but in the separation and the balance of power.</seg>
<seg id=1985> Every day, the government to interfere in the legislative, the vast majority of laws are writing to the presidential Chancellery; Parliament wants to control the daily exercise of government policy, including, in my case, the nomination of ambassadors and their everyday operations!</seg>
<seg id=1986> Finally, and this is the most serious, the judiciary have still not managed to be relieved of the tutelage of the executive and no longer represents or not yet for the citizen or the investor the guarantor and protector, without which there is no rule of law or of economic freedom</seg>
<seg id=1987> It is a society which to be democratic in his head, is still not in legs. It is still reluctant to engage in politics leaving the arena for those who are for too long.</seg>
<seg id=1988> Because this democracy is in danger of collapsing, but because it is still there, located greatly in the population in civil society organisations, in a press is seeking but which does not lose its ability criticism...</seg>
<seg id=1989> It is time for Europe to save democracy in order not to eliminate all these hopes.</seg>
<seg id=1990> The United States has done what they have since independence, and they are alongside the Georgian stability.</seg>
<seg id=1991> Stability was identified in democracy under the rule of Eduard Shevardnadze, former Soviet Foreign Minister that the rose revolution has removed the post of President of Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1992> But Americans have invested very generously in the survival of Georgian elites and in their learning of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1993> The critical initiatives Soros, today, I find that very unjustified: the revolution in November was not created by the Americans, not withstanding propaganda of Russian nationalist too accustomed to the intervention to think differently, but the substratum democratic has enabled has certainly been fed, encouraged and supported by the aid from the Soros Foundation.</seg>
<seg id=1994> The course which must be taken today to that Georgia weakens its body -- this time définitivement- evil totalitarian, is a step complex calls for support of a different nature, that Europeans are better able to provide.</seg>
<seg id=1995> The models which must be proposed for the balance of power, the institutions of the rule of law, the operation of the judicial or local democracy must be guided European closer forms of the Georgian reality that the Anglo-Saxon model, American variant.</seg>
<seg id=1996> If Europe today rejected this task, it will be betraying its fundamental duty towards this country, small, Mediterranean, flexible, long tradition, where democracy has a better chance of success than in Ukraine, which is both great and always very Soviet in its spirit, not to mention Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1997> Not help Georgia is to accept that democracy and stability are so long to come not only in Tbilisi, but even more in Kiev, Minsk, to say nothing of Moscow.</seg>
<seg id=1998> It is above all take a very serious risk.</seg>
<seg id=1999> Moscow which, with ups and downs shilly-shallying infinite, an internal systems, began to resign itself to the idea of the democratic inevitability, at least at its borders, not without abandoning its imperial dreams and their instruments of domination, could suddenly review its perception.</seg>
<seg id=2000> This resignation hesitant, this acceptance normality in its relations with its neighbours, which was in its early stages can be washed away by a sudden eruption of the irrational of the Russian power of this infamous ‘ derjava 'who does not resist the attractiveness of the weakness, to a sense of empty, to the temptation to again be not equal, but most.</seg>
<seg id=2001> This is what explains the recent crisis of Russian gas.</seg>
<seg id=2002> Any sign of a decline in democracy, slowing of the democratic tide, will be taken by Moscow as a hope no sense of reversibility accoutumait gradually where Russia is no longer to believe it.</seg>
<seg id=2003> It is the responsibility of Europe to convince Russia that it is his place to hope for a return to the past.</seg>
<seg id=2004> Europe has this responsibility for itself, to its future energy independence. It also has the responsibility to show that there are also strong European values -- of freedom, democracy, justice between peoples.</seg>
<seg id=2005> For that Europe needs instruments of its policy: a great public private foundation for Europe and democracy, a university to form the framework of tomorrow democracies which are surfacing again, a police, army of judges and magistrates who live close models of societies that we want to convert.</seg>
<seg id=2006> Above all Europe needs of conviction.</seg>
<seg id=2007> If Europe does not convint itself that it is the fate of its neighbours, democracy and the future of its values and spread, who believe in it tomorrow?</seg>
