Europe breeds divided House
A common feature of all the extreme right in Europe is their racism and the fact that the issue of immigration as a political lever use.
The Lega Nord in Italy, the Vlaams bloc in the Netherlands, the supporters of Le Pen's National Front in France, are examples of parties or movements, the common issue: rejection of immigration have formed and call for a simplified policy, in order to regulate them.
While individuals like Jörg Haidar and Jean-Marie Le Pen and (unfortunately not soon) may go, the racial from the European policy is not as soon disappear.
A ageing local population and always open borders increase the racist fragmentation in the European countries.
The big parties in the right and centre left have raised the problem of the heads in the sand and set counter all prospects have hoped that it will soon disappear.
This, however, will not, as the history of racism in America clearly shows.
The relations between the races were in the US over decades - and even today - in the centre of the political debate which went so far that racial segregation just as important as the income, if not more important - political Zuneigungen and attitudes to determine.
The first step to deal with the racial cause and consequences of racist hostilities to understand, even if it means to uncover unpleasant facts.
This is in the US a large number of research in the economy, sociology, psychology and science done. These research showed that people of different race trust each other clearly less.
The whites are less willing to support spending, because they think so to encourage minorities. Stronger racially divided societies have less clever governments, more corruption and nepotism, more crime and less public benefits per dollar revenues.
This does not mean that the answer should be to remove the peculiarity racial and to create similar communities but must be the realities recognise behind this question, a sound public policy in relation to the race relations design.
Of course, there is under Americans no agreement about how to be done.
Some ‘yes’ programmes to minorities in the allocation of jobs, access to the higher colleges of technology and public contracts to prefer.
These measures will as a kind of compensation for previously considered injustice done you, what is more, Rollenmuster shape, in order to help left remain, and perhaps to overcome unintended discrimination.
Others reject such action and claim that there is only one not to concept of race respects policy in connection with a free market and family-friendly values needed for minorities to create jobs and to help the families of the coloured people stay together.
The latter is crucial for any policy, and one of the main causes of poverty in the US is the great dissemination of households alone erziehenden parents (i.e. mothers) under the coloured people.
Despite the right answer, the question of how dealing with the races, a prominent role in the US policy.
Of course, minorities have made progress towards more integration and better economic success.
In the 1950s people of color were not even allowed forward on the bus take place today are two of the most important players in the US foreign policy people of color.
However, we can be sure that right-wing politicians in America continue to the ,Rassen-Karte "as a tactical giving resources.
Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, the former assistant of Nixon and Reagan, in the last elections as an independent candidate appeared.
He recently published a successful book entitled: "The death of the West: how dying classes and the invasion of immigrants our country and threaten our civilisation."
But for every book such as this, there are ten others with a serious analysis of the racial in America.
Political analyses and debates on the race relations in Europe lagging behind terrible ago.
Mostly the issue is also closely in terms of entrance and Grenzregelungen this limit, not treated and the related social problems and the chances of an increasingly racial mixed Europe arise.
Of course, a clear immigration policy needed to the accumulation of illegal immigrants to avoid.
But that cannot be everything. border controls with Mexico are not everything the American policy racial in the country has to say.
Europe is rich and ageing rapidly; the Europeans, generous Fürsorgeprogrammen abgepolstert no longer preparing "dirty work ', we say in agriculture or in the leather industry to take.
Even that makes increased immigration inevitable.
Europeans are ready, however, the US every mistake in its minorities and every sign of racism on the Atlantic blame.
Reading the European press is in the Rassenfragen often superiority towards the United States: the Americans have problems with racism; we are opposed to immune a few insane Neo-Nazis, skinheads and suchlike apart.
In the last few weeks has shown that the Rassenproblem in Europe from Paris until Amsterdam sits much deeper, and - as in the United States - attributable to the sad fact that race relations inherently difficult and that a reliably and cooperative dealing not easy on Rassenschranken hinwegkommt.
If Europe's major parties do not start Rassenspannungen in Europe seriously to investigate and to understand and ,Rasse "to make one of its main priorities, individuals like Le Pen led to see the gaps with their message of hatred fill. Alberto Alesina professor of economic science in the university Havard; Francesco Giavazzi, Professor of economic science Bocconi university in Milan belongs to the group of Economic Advisers of the President of the European Commission.
The French exceptions combat!
The attention in Europe is now right to enlargement and the Constitution, which are currently between the EU Member States drafted, directed.
But the outcome should some squabbling Galliens with the European Commission the fate of the new and enlarged Europe scarcely less serious determine.
France has decided unilaterally, the Stability and Wachstums-Pakt to ignore by vorausgesagtes deficit, beyond the limit of 3% of GDP Inlandprodukts (GDP), in buying adopted.
The French stick like the rational rigour of their thought to good, but when it comes to budget, it is not Descartes but non-transparency asked.
France was among the leading critics of Ireland, as the Irish Government in the year 2000 their surplus, then at 4% of GDP, only to 0.5% reduced.
Other countries have violated the Stability Pact, but France is the first country to open hämischer contempt did.
But something along these lines surprise.
France is simply applying the rules on its card-carrying habits, namely its own culture as something extraordinary to consider.
For example, France prevented by veto persistent reforms of the common agricultural policy (GEA).
As even children know that the GEA means a respectable and totally unverdientes gift to the European prosperous (particularly French) farmers and at the expense of for survival struggling farmers in the developing countries and of consumers in the EU.
France is trying once again to resort to an old policy, namely unprofitable private companies on the brink of their Zusammenbruches with the taxpayers' money to relieve.
The Commissioner for competition policy, Mario Monti, must not lose this fight: He needs the support of the market and the equal treatment of all believe.
In this case, is quite simple.
The French Government intends the company Alstom entsetzten, a company, a number of high-tech-Erzeugnissen including the TGV, the French Hochgeschwindigkeitszeug, has developed, but recently went bankrupt.
The French Government claims that they never in its plan to save Alstom, will compromise, a plan with all familiar justifications of dirigisme: the preservation of jobs, protection of investors, etc.
Moreover, the French Government plays, since Alstom a high-tech-Firma research and Entwicklungskarte and claims, investment in R&D are good for growth.
Alstom by the nationalisation of the company to save, is clearly wrong.
The company consists of many different parts. Some of them bring profits, others are bankrupt: What is obvious, to dismantle the company.
The profitable parts, such as the TGV-Werk to be easy buyers; works, not earn money, should be closed.
The money French taxpayers will be better for the support of sacked workers as spent on subsidies, unprofitable companies to keep alive.
It is important that the European Commission does not allow France, in the area of competition policy as apparently with its deficits remove arrangements.
The Commission must public aid to private companies in France, just stop, as such subsidies in any other Member State case has brought.
The Commission has on this front some successes, as you know, forced Germany, Regierungsbürgschaften for public banks lifted.
Alstom in particular, and France in general should not constitute exceptions; they should to adhere to the same standards.
If the Commission failed to act, the EU will be even more as the playground French civil servants appear.
France has already a leading role in the EU’s foreign policy accepted, with Foreign Minister Villepin Dominique-de more and more like the Foreign Minister Europe appears and.
At the same time, France violated essential provisions of the common economic policy and the award of public aid to private companies.
If the European Commission, what its credibility is still left, and finally lose as a minor Paris district?
A defeat in the Alstom affair would have far-reaching consequences for Europe and not only for its competition policy.
The war lost their oil
For decades, America under democratic and Republican-controlled presidencies held a number of clear energy objectives consistently, namely the Weltölpreis as stable as possible to keep; oil consumption in the country possible without pain way to shrink; the dependence on foreign imports, wherever possible, to reduce; and the oil imports to several countries of origin divide.
Even if it seems to be different, under the Bush administration was none of these objectives changed.
Many observers believe that Bush have a new approach, because the invasion of Iraq these objectives run counter seems.
A large increase in oil production in Iraq should the US dependence on oil in relation to the other energy sources probably increase, since the Weltölpreise consequence of the extra supply are likely to be collapsing.
This would in exchange for an increase in the US-Abhängigkeit of imported oil, particularly from the Middle East mean.
The irony is, however, that the US under the Vorkriegsprogramm of the UN, ,Öl for food '(the UN and not Saddam Hussein, the level of Iraqi oil sales to get to abroad certain) greater control over the Iraqi oil sector exercising than they continue in a democratically governed Iraq.
If the Bush administration stable, safe and cheap oil imports by many sides would have aspired, it would simply the embargo against countries such as Libya, Iran, Iraq and Sudan and lift the oil from there hereinschwabben.
But was the American interest in the Iraqi oil from its economic or energy policy.
The Bush administration realized that Iraqi oil, in particular, is a crucial geopolitical levers.
Anyone Iraqi oil controls, dominated Iraq.
Saddam's power based on his control over the second largest reserves in the world.
He undoubtedly understood the role that the oil for his power played.
With the possibility of an invasion and defeat our eyes, threatening Saddam, the oil fields in Iraq anzuzünden.
A large part of the subsequent destruction and looting of Iraqi pipelines and Öleinrichtungen reflects the widespread recognition that reflect the control of the oil rule over Iraq means.
In the US-Invasionsplänen securing the oilfields a crucial priority.
The aim was not to extend the deliveries and reducing prices for the Americans, but Saddam from its power to separate and ultimately a new Iraqi Government to deploy and to stabilise.
Iraq's future depends directly from the fate of the Iraqi oil production.
But the vagaries of the Ölgeschäftes, especially in such obscure circumstances, it is hard to see how the Bush administration within the next few years their goals in Iraq will be able to achieve.
The logic is simple.
The US must use the oil revenues, the American taxpayers the burden by the financing of regime change in Iraq to facilitate.
All reconstruction depend on the long term from the ability of Iraq, large quantities of oil to export.
If Iraq should not be extradited oil, President Bush may its promises to the Iraqi, the American people or the international community does not deliver.
Before the invasion amounted the capacity of Iraqi oil to three million barrels per day.
Iraq will be its production within the time-scale, commands to establish an Iraqi government, not to raise this again level.
Any increase of Iraqi oil production requires to develop the fields, which is extensive investment, a legitimate, representative government and political stability means.
Not even the Bush Administration believes that these conditions to meet soon.
Indeed, political stability is the most important condition for the increase of production capacity.
Historischer examples from Iran, from Kuwait, Russia, and even Iraq itself show that after the political stability recovering around three years, in order to significantly increase the capacity and the achieved, higher levels to keep.
Iraq needs several years to write a new constitution, a legitimate and democratic government set up, the distribution of oil revenues on its various regions negotiate to enact new Investitionsgesetze, and its economy attractive to foreigners.
It needs time to continue with the international oil companies and to negotiate neighbouring countries to carry out technical feasibility studies and rebuild its fields, in motion and to explore.
It therefore seems even a timeframe of three years as optimistic, because it implies that the occupation ended in that time, the Iraqis their own democratic government building and get a political stability.
We do not need to mention that the situation can develop very different.
The tensions can still years to remain.
No one should be surprised if the Iraqi oil production even under a democratic government suddenly disappear.
Historical experience suggest that disputes and similar disorders, which could prevent oil production, in democratic countries represent a greater threat than undemocratic.
If Iraq its Förderkapazitäten in the next few years cannot increase quickly, it will be both the US-Außen- disturb their energy policy.
As the United States want the reconstruction of Iraq long-term finance?
Who will pay, a shaky Iraqi democracy alive?
Can the United States maintain their occupation, if the Iraqi people do not food, health care and other basic services can offer?
These are awkward questions. It remain unbeantwortbar principle, unless a stable, democratic regime in Iraq the steady flow of oil exports determine and ensure.
murderers as guardian of human rights
Would it not so deeply sad, we should laugh: Libya is the chairman of the UN have been elected!
As Caligula horse to senators made, klebte at least no blood whose hoofed.
Of course, the procedure was perfectly legal: the Presidency rotiert each year by a region to the next.
This year was Africa the number to choose the chairman and appointed Libya.
Only the United States and Canada voted against.
On their forever healed disgrace the European countries abstain.
It is typical of the state of the moral corruption of the UN, that this decision just now, in this organisation for the difficult time was taken.
President Bush has asked the UN, to demonstrate that it with their those concerning Iraq seriously: otherwise they will humiliating suffer the same fate as the SDN, in the 1930s the aggressive policy by Nazi Germany and the Fascist Italy had to overcome completely powerless.
Libya just now in the chairmanship of the UN body the to choose, which is responsible for human rights, proposes negatively on the legitimacy and the moral authority of the whole organisation reflected.
Let us: Libya is a totalitarian tyranny, head of state, Muammar Khadafi combines often unpredictable behavior with extremist policy by making it the dictators supported the world.
It is one of the repressive regimes in the world, not even the pretence of elections and where opposition immediately crushed.
Under his rule, Libya has terrorist organisations in the world - supported by the IRA to various Palestinian extremist.
The sanctions for the role of the country in the crash of Pan Am-Passagiermaschine Lockerbie, Scotland has played a decade ago, are still not lifted.
In the last ten years, the position of the UN as a symbol of the ideal of a peaceful world community has been continually undermined.
It was completely incapable of preventing the wars in the Balkans and at least in one case - Srebrenica - a Dutch peacekeeping saw the worst massacre in Europe since 1945 passively, the Bosnian Serbs 6 000 defenceless Muslims murdered.
A Dutch Aufklärungsausschuss later admitted that the Dutch United Nations force actually in this war crimes was involved.
Hardly Rwanda. had begun the genocide, ordered the peacekeeping measures responsible UN-Funktionär the withdrawal of UN troops from the country and left the field of the bloodiest racist massacres since the Second World War.
The name of the Funktionärs Kofi Annan.
The - probably wasted - the UN attempt in the Iraq crisis now to create the impression that they speak with the voice of reason and the international legitimacy is only depressing and pathetic to mention.
But, at the same time as the UN-Waffeninspekteure in Iraq seem as the Salvation Army, which sends a paedophile Gangsterbande, the fact that Libya, the Presidency of the Commission on Human Rights will transfer, perhaps the history as the mistake comment, which enshrines the failure of a organisation, which has so much hope was created.
organisations normally do not go under, and there is certainly much raison d 'etat to ensure that the UN perpetuates further.
But it is only a shadow of what it should be and could be.
The UN today is nothing more than a different word for hypocrisy.
authoritarianism on the march
Last Thursday condemned me the judges at the Indonesian Zentralgericht in Jakarta to a year prison.
As editor-in-chief of the news magazine Weekly pace, I am, in accordance with the judgment, guilty, Wirtschaftsmagnaten called Tomy Winata slandered by I its possible involvement in a fire on the textile market Southeast Asia assumed in Jakarta, Moreover, I am guilty have been declared by the spread of lying riots stirred up.
Is my case and other similar cases already a reference to the end of a further short-lived democratic experiment in Indonesia?
The riots' I supposedly stoked, were in March last year instead, as almost 200 hooligans would, as supporters Winatas expenditure, the office of attacked pace, to set fire threatened, the workforce drangsalierten and reporters wounded.
In the attempt to resolve the situation peacefully, I was persuaded me to talks on the key police station in Jakarta to go. On my horror was police station but under the control of the mob.
I was beaten and came, while the police wegsah.
Fortunately came many journalists and Tonbandgeräten cameras to help.
The publication of their admissions caused a public outcry, which Parliament forced to organise a public hearing.
The police chiefs of the country and the Jakarta were appear and the leader of the mob, under massive public pressure, criminal accused.
However, the Winata escaped a police investigation, and just because he claimed that his supporters have without being prior knowledge and its assent act.
Then he centred on the egoistic and back on itself complaint against Ahmad Taufik, the author of the article against the editor Teuku Iskandar Ali, carefully-edited him and against me.
The long-standing trial was a number of suspicious developments characterised, all Winata beneficiary.
First of all, the police and the prosecutor built case presented documents, which are so obviously forged, that the police two responsible criticised.
The court, however, indicated our request to Verfahrensaufschub up to the legal clarification of the prosecutor and the police built case.
The procedure against the two policemen seems to be delayed.
One of the police was commander of the newly created (and financed by the US) anti-terrorist from Jakarta promoted.
The other Fortbildungslehrgang for police officers sent.
Subsequently, in the sixth month of the procedure, the chairman of the three-member Richtergremiums suddenly to the head of Stadtgerichtes appointed, one hour away from Jakarta.
One of my lawyers said that it is not in his career 35-jährigen court has not happened yet, that a presidency leading judges during a procedure exchanging.
Indeed, the judge acted, despite its transport, in another case in the same House continue as chairman.
In our procedure judges took over the presidency, previously in Winatas Zivilrechtsverfahren a judgment against rate was taken.
Finally, Winata presented in his statement a perjury, when he denied, pace given an interview.
A Bandaufzeichnung Telefoninterviews has happened in court; the reporters, the interview was conducted, and two editors said as witnesses under oath; the official record of the telephone company was before the courts as evidence of the call tabled and experts came to the conclusion that the voice on the tape-recorders Tomy Winata.
The judges, however, rejected the request of pace, detention and criminal prosecution Winatas because of perjured and rieten us to lodge complaints, what we did.
Then the judges given our motion a rejection of the Court's ruling to resolve Winatas Meineidfall to postpone.
In the light of such a poor procedure, was made my condemnation and the prison surprisingly little.
However, I am confident that we will ultimately prevail, if speed appeal before higher courts.
The Indonesian courts of higher level are clean and the President of the Supreme Court is a staunch defender of democracy and freedom of the press. The case could become a pace ground-breaking victory for our democracy, as the famous decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of The New York Times against Sullivan.
This was the barrier to defamatorische charges increased. This decision is sure that American journalists public people to account.
In any country in the world knows better than in Indonesia, that freedom of expression and freedom of the press verifiable indicators include democratic development, and that the criminalisation of journalists an early signs of authoritarianism.
Until the 1950s years Indonesia was a liberal democracy. year 1956 took then President Sukarno, with the support of the military drastic measures against the press.
Critical voices have been raised calm, thereby consolidating uncontrolled power was easier. July 1959 possessed by decree Sukarno "Gelenkte democracy '.
In the first years after Sukarnos fall in 1966 were all standards of a real democracy, including the press restored (except for the Communists).
But in the early 1970's President Suharto began again take action against the press and finally to prohibit different media and many journalists to imprison.
After the press was brought under control, were also quickly other political rights curtailed and the Indonesian democracy failed again.
Since the fall of Suharto in 1998 Indonesia is the third largest democratic country in the world and the largest Muslim democracy in the history.
Two parliamentary elections and two direct presidential elections - including the recent runoff - took free, fair and peaceful and were proof that Islam and democracy can certainly exist side by side.
The enemies of democracy sleep, however, never.
Radical Islamic groups pursue indiscriminate bombing and groups with strong authoritarian tendencies until the deeply-held circles of President Megawati managed.
However, suffered Megawati just a defeat in the presidential election.
Will the newly elected President Susilo continue to pursue journalists?
Will my condemnation and the procedures and convictions of Members the end of the hard-won third democracy in Indonesia herald?
The answer lies in the support of the pro-democracy activists in Indonesia and can win abroad.
The loss of Indonesia - a potential beacon of hope for all pro-democratic activists in the Muslim world - would be a terrible defeat.
The moral of the death penalty
The US will because of their refusal to abolish the death penalty, often criticized.
Now many claim that the abolition of the death penalty is a prerequisite for a civilized criminal justice system.
Nobel Prize-winner Gary Becker contradicts.
The European governments are strictly against the death penalty -- in the European Union is completely banned -- and some Europeans consider the use of the death penalty in the United States than barbaric.
Many European intellectuals even argue that not only the death penalty, but punishment in general, no deterrent effect on criminals.
While Europe with crime levels in the last 50 years far below those were America, over long time could afford to most crimes relatively "mild" to meet, there in the last twenty years to a dramatic increase in crime.
In contrast, these figures in America partly due to a further use of penalties fallen.
That includes the death penalty.
I am in favour of the execution of some as murderers of convicted persons, because -- and only because -- I believe that other murderers are deterred.
If I am not convinced, I would argue against the death penalty, because revenge and other possible motives should not serve as a basis for the policy of a state.
Empirical research took on the death penalty in the United States with a study ground-breaking Isaac Ehrlichs its outcome, the 1975 in the American Economic Review was published.
In some subsequent studies of the deterrent was described as much lower in others more than.
The available data, however, quite limited, so its conclusions not exclusively on the basis of econometric evidence draw.
It is, of course, with political decisions about any kind of punishment does not wait until this is completely evidence.
But even these limited quantitative data reason for adopting that the death penalty has a deterrent effect.
Most people, especially murderers, fear the death, especially when he quickly and with some certainty after the alleged of a murder happens.
David Hume formulated in his treatise on suicide, "no one wegwarf a life to maintain worth.
For our natural fear the death is so great... "Similarly Schopenhauer, put it as follows: 'If they have come, that the horror of life outweigh the horror of death, the person his life put an end to this.
But the horror of death considerable resistance... "
The opponent of the death penalty often claim that the state had no moral right to someone to take the life, not even a despicable murderer.
For someone, the deterrent effect of the death penalty believes, but it is absolutely wrong conclusion.
In order to understand why, we assume that for any executed (for example, rather than lebenslänglicher prison condemned) murderers three murders can be prevented, with a much smaller number is than in the discourse Ehrlichs or other work on the subject of deterrence.
It therefore follows that for any murderers not executed three innocent victims their lives would have to.
Indeed, the government would therefore indirectly many lives "", if they do not began to the death penalty.
The saving three innocent lives for any person hingerichtete appears to be a perfectly interesting value and even if per execution two save lives, it seems as convincing cost-benefit ratio.
Admittedly, the argument for the death penalty with a smaller number of life outcomes less powerful.
But even if per execution only a life could be saved, it would still a desirable value, if the rescued life is much better than the taken, as it normally should be the case.
Many people oppose a balance between the quality of the outcomes and of life adopted.
I see no reason, however, for such a comparison is not.
Consider Berufsverbrecher, a people deprived and kills. This victims led a respectable life and leaves several children and a spouse.
Let us, it would be possible to the life of an innocent victim by the execution of such a criminal to protect.
For me, it is clear that there is more weight must be to save the life of the victim as a criminal life.
Of course, not all cases so clearly, but the comparison in relation to the quality of the two life must be part of any sensible social policy.
That also helps in the explanation of why the death penalty only in the case of murder, but not in lower crimes to use.
If in exchange for executions, for example, a reduction in the Diebstahlsfälle is to be achieved, speaks far more for a lesser form of punishment.
Although massive attacks as cruel rape murder regarding the Schweregrades quite close and understandably calls for the death penalty loudly, I am not in these cases.
A persuasive argument that the death penalty apply only in Mordfällen is "marginal deterrence."
If attacks on the death penalty, the perpetrators would have an incentive to their victims, to kill itself is not to be taken (that is the main reason why the severity of penalties in general to the severity of the crime should be attached).
One difficulty is that murderers threatened by the death penalty would go even further, to their arrest to escape, thereby turn could increase count.
While the marginal deterrence is an important factor is, I believe that the murderer attempts to his arrest -- perhaps at the expense of their own lives, to escape, an indirect evidence that criminals fear the death penalty.
Of course, I am the risk, perhaps innocent to execute concern.
My consent to the death penalty would be severely weakened, when the number of innocent actually executed would be so great, as is often said.
I believe, however, that the appeal in the United States extraordinary protect, not so much against unjustified convictions, but very well, against unjustified executions, so that, if at all, very few cases of innocent people executed people.
With the development of the DNA-Identifikation this protection has been broadened enormously.
Once again, the debate about the death penalty is essentially a debate on deterrence (the effect given in the length drawn appeal lose).
I understand that some people the evidence mentioned sceptical about, although I believe that they both in this respect and also in relation to the common sense on this issue wrong.
The idea a people, even a murderer to take the life is worrying, but sometimes are highly unpleasant measures to prevent worse behaviour, the lives of innocent victims cost.
The people against Putin
I have the choice Vladimir Putin as successor for Russia’s first democratically elected president, Boris Yeltsin, participated.
Since KGB- and Mafia-Strukturen govern Russia and manipulate the judicial system, it is accepted that Yeltsin his successor itself wanted to choose to avoid future prosecution.
But we select Putin, had the task of finding someone to Yeltsin's continuing reforms, and not to him and his family to protect.
Yeltsin was perfectly become fearless and sought not be personal survival, but the survival of the democratic idea, which he introduced in Russia.
However, this idea now because of the elected successor in danger.
I reject the responsibility for supporting Putin’s not by me.
We were not close friends, but he and I worked in critical situations together, and I have never in his sincerity doubt.
Putin is after his convictions.
The problem is that its convictions -- including his faith due to the fact that Russia can only flourish if it is governed by a single Machtquelle -- are wrong.
This is a great mistake lead Russia in the political ruin.
Of course, nobody in this Spitzenamt, without mistakes, even fundamental, and especially in turbulent times.
Yeltsin was no exception, but he recognized its mistakes.
When he in the Eve resigned in 1999, he asked, for example, forgiveness for the fact that he the war in Chechnya began.
Putin against seems unable to its mistake to recognise and acknowledge and considers a policy to note that long after its failure for the world recognisable.
One of Yeltsin's mistakes was his failure to moral priorities at the top of its reform agenda to set.
Russia would have Stalinism and Gulag-System must regret.
Without exception, the whole nation should feel remorse, such as the Germans since 1945 have felt remorse.
This failure is important, because could Putin’s unsafe belief in a central authority mean that the state of the security services recaptured.
In fact would national regret the Gulag-Ära as a direct result ban the Communist Party and the exclusion of the former KGB-Mitarbeiter political offices must mean.
Although such political checks in the postcommunist societies are complicated, since both position as victim as well as collaboration widespread and the limits intervening were often vague, a good solution could be found -- as in the Czech Republic.
Since nothing was done, remained Russia’s security structures intact and were able to tackle a political comeback, which they have now reached.
The political resurrection of the KGB-Strukturen Putin and its efforts to divergent opinions to silence Russia back to a country of the transformed defector.
It is impossible to independent politicians and independent media to silence, without independent finance remedy why the Kremlin Putin its attacks on the so-called "oligarchs" concentrated.
Mikhail Khodorkovsky arrest and process precisely this reason orchestriert.
The security that dominate the Kremlin, hope to delete independent sources of finance the independent political life in Russia.
Without independent intellectual bases spread a climate of fear.
But fear is not only degrading, it also promotes a bad governance.
Yeltsin understood intuitively that fear and a centralised decision-making from the top down no way to govern a modern country, so he insisted that the relationship between citizens and state reform.
Putin understands is still not a centralised political system now is equally unable to understand mistakes and to correct, as in the Soviet-era at the time.
As not very educated man leads Putin Russia in full and deeper sincerity in the same undermining the collapse of the Soviet accompanied.
The people start to understand.
They recognise that Putin’s wish that a strong and effective modern state to create, cannot be implemented because a modern state is not governed from above, but informed citizens, forcing their leaders to see their mistakes and to rectify.
Putin seems the inability of his government also suspect.
This is one of the reasons why Russia since recently so aggressively against its neighbours, Ukraine and Georgia, acting and trying to its military presence in places like Transnistria to maintain the breakaway region of Moldova.
By its influence in Russia closely felt abroad, the Kremlin makes believes that the Russians home from his omnipotence to convince.
Given the narrow debates in Russia and the ability of the Kremlin to manipulate elections, a change of government is the only option for those democratic idea want to retain in Russia.
There is no point to adhere to illusions.
Those who confront Putin, must decide what they want, and say that if the regime does not adhere to the Constitution, have the right to every necessary means to force.
The issue of power in Russia today is not just be decided at the ballot box.
As in Ukraine, Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan it will be decided in the streets.
raise taxes and spending (please)
A excessive tax burden can reduce incentives and hinder the growth.
A low taxation can, however, bring about the same.
Governments, the only feeble tax revenues have no money, basic public goods available.
Even worse is the fact that in poor countries less low tax revenues to low rates rather than due to defective Steuereinhebungssysteme, which also lead to unproductive companies.
On India example shows the importance of a well thought-out tax.
In Bangalore Hi-Tech-Firmen disobeying well-maintained with world-class following Hochgeschwindigkeitsdatennetze built.
Outside this Universitätsgelände shape open sewers, however, is not entsorgter waste and urgent reparaturbedürftige roads the picture.
While valuation in a moment Terabytes data in sending remote continents, moving the local public transport with almost medieval pace continues.
For this reason, pursue companies in Bangalore their own bus routes, have agreements with private providers for the water supply and have their own generators, before the failures in the public electricity network to protect.
The state cannot remove the chaos, because it is bankrupt.
The Indian Staatschulden amount to more than 70% of GDP. More than half of tax revenue must therefore be spent Zinsentilgung.
However, the debts are not excessive expenditure due in the past.
The public expenditure in India amounts to approximately 15% of GDP. By comparison in the OECD countries an average of 40% of GDP for public expenditure is used.
The financial difficulties India’s instead have their cause in a poorly outlined and badly managed taxation.
Compared with international standards seem the fiscal provisions and Income for individuals and companies properly.
Nevertheless, the tax revenues amount from the Indian Government income taxes only 3.7% of GDP. This value corresponds to the half of revenue South Korea and other Asian "tigers" as.
About a quarter of GDP attributable to agriculture, but not even wealthy farmers pay taxes.
Exportorientierte companies in the software industry and in other sectors enjoy exemptions for their profits, although the staff of these firms very well Lohnsteuer pay.
Despite appropriate rates is widespread tax evasion.
This fraud can take place, because the government either in staff in spying systems of evaders invested, rarely to reckon with a sentence and have often enough with their way bribes prepare from the difficulties.
The evasion in the "direct 'income and Gewinnsteuern reflects the chaos in the' indirect taxes, which reflects production and consumption eingehoben.
More than 60% of indirect taxes in India is accounted for by excise duties. The share of the indirect taxes Gesamtsteuervolumen 60% again.
The Basissteuersatz was 16% of Produktionswertes a firm set.
In addition, there are a number of advantages, exemptions and Aufschlägen.

In addition, Polyesterfasern containing products, cars, air-conditioning and tyres' special excise duties') (SED eingehoben of 8%.
The "additional excise duties' (AED, not to be confused with the SED) attributable to" goods of special importance '.
Moreover, there are many complex exemptions from excise taxes, which enjoy companies with Gesamtjahreseinkünften of less than 10 million hold rupees and firms in difficult or backward regions.
Overall, these exemptions in 70 broad categories together, which in turn 259 filling, 52 conditions and 7 lists are divided, each of which, in turn, contains many points.
exemptions invite abuse.
At a certain price rangniedrige officials, considerable discretion in the application of the conditions to play, led, the provisions favourable interpretation.

The evasion of duties is more widespread than those of participation in profits and income taxes.
Hinterzieht a company excise duties and the rate in the industry in relation to the profits before high tax, the competition to fraud forced if it wants to survive.
In increasing tax evasion invent the governments "additional" or "special" taxes, and thus encouraging even more tax evasion.
It is also suffering the Einhebung direct taxation.
The favourable tax officials classifications paid bribes, the difference between the value of polished and not polished Granit secretive and create actual receipts "dirty money ', which in any Einkommenssteuererklärung also-rans.
The evasion indirect taxes hampers not only the state in the provision of basic public goods, but adopted the companies the incentive to introduce more productive technologies for production are necessary in greater style.
However, indirect taxes easier in the operation of many small production units as a major can be evaded, are not to achieve economies of scale.
In this context, it is worth noting that Indian companies in the software industry, where all companies exempt from indirect taxes, economically efficient.
Could India follow the example of China, where the rationalisation indirect taxes in 1994 the conditions for a large boom managed?
Or are coalition governments in a strong democracy to such reforms are not able?
Last year the government led pursued by the BJP laws on the drastic reduction in the deficit.
It has subsequently been set up a working group to which the necessary changes in the tax and spending had to produce.
In July of this year the working party proposed to raise taxes (and not to cut spending), by, among other things, the most exemptions be removed from indirect taxes.
The new Indian Government under the leadership of the Congress Party seems these proposals to be welcomed.
If the Congress Party and the opposition to this project end, they will be a far-reaching step for the sustainable economic development of the country set and allay the idea, whereby democracies are not able to impose measures that are needed to promote development.
What is true of Turkey does not?
On 16 December will Orhan Pamuk, one of the foremost writer of Turkey, before a court in Istanbul, the charge, "to insult the national identity ', after he for the open discussion of the Turkish genocide of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916 gave.
Pamuk must three years in prison count.
The efforts of Turkey, the official line oppose, with fine and to punish imprison, I am convinced that I was right, as I accession negotiations for membership of the country rejected in the European Union.
In December 1999, the European Council gave Turkey's status EU-Anwärter, which meant that Turkey of the Union to a later, not deadline set would join.
The Council asked the European Commission then about until October 2004 to decide whether Turkey the political criteria for membership sufficiently fulfilled -- including democracy, the rule of law and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities.
This was one of the last decisions that the Commission under Romano Prodi 13 September, which I sat.
From their 30 29 Members felt that Turkey sufficiently meets the criteria, to continue.
I was the only dissenters.
The report by the Commission itself on Turkey, the then enlargement of the EU for the relevant Günter Verheugen was drawn up, influenced my decision.
In this report has been mentioned that in 2003 around 21.870 Turks asylum tabled in the EU, which 2127(INI were adopted.
In other words, the governments of the EU itself recognised 2003 that the Turkish Government over 2000 pursues its own citizens had.
Meanwhile, the Commission published a progress report on Turkey, which granted that the reforms under the more Islamic hired government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan would continue, albeit in a slower pace.
But the report also presented serious concerns: human rights violations, including torture, continued; the influence of the military remained too big; the speech was not respected everywhere; non-Muslim religious and cultural minorities have been discriminated against, and violence against women were not strong enough combated.
It has not changed much since the accession talks started in October.
In addition to the current persecution Pamuks there are plenty of examples of unacceptable behaviour.
In March 2005, the police gavel violently a demonstration to mark the International Women's Day.
In May was banned the greatest teachers, because they fought, the 14 million Kurds in Turkey to inform in their own language.
intolerance actually prefers to the top of the Turkish Government.
The Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül said recently burst a press conference in Copenhagen, when it is a Kurdish journalists in the audience erspähte and the Danes refused to this old-style.
Such actions and attitudes justify my vote in October 2004 adequately.
But even if these shortcomings were corrected, Turkey should not always be included in the EU, because it is not a European country.
Christianity, feudalism, Renaissance, enlightenment, democracy and industrialisation have made us, what we Europeans, but they do not have the Turks, what they are.
That is why I am not convinced that the reforms in Turkey, implemented at the insistence of the European Commission, after the accession would continue.
Indeed, I suspect that they would be withdrawn.
Moreover, would the accession of Turkey inevitably lead to Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova were joining, and perhaps Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The first three of these countries are certainly European than Turkey.
Can the three Caucasus republics outside, but excludes the former Yugoslavia, which would an EU with approximately 35 Members mean.
What a Union would be?
The EU is not simply a Freundschaftsclub.
It is based on the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.
As guardian of the treaties of the European Union, the Commission must take these four fundamental freedoms protect, which means that they must sometimes convince Member States, and if necessary force to change their laws.
The alcohol policy in Sweden, Volkswagen in Germany and the discrimination against foreign investment funds in France are Fallbeispiele, with which the Commission has made unpopular.
But they were necessary.
When I left the Commission, and I sat on a batch of 1 500 such infringement proceedings.
In short, the EU membership result, a state must accept radical measures, which strongly on its internal affairs effect.
This will such different members impossible.
The EU would victims of what the historian Paul Kennedy as "imperial overstretch '.
The EU would be an excessively bent.
That is why feared the former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, that the accession of Turkey to the dissolution of the EU would lead, and therefore said the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt: "The Turkey’s accession would be more than the EU could cope."
But the main reason against the accession of Turkey is a question of democracy: the majority of the European population wants it simply do not.
Bolivia's crisis, Latin America Failure
Bolivia is in any respect, a typical Latin American country.
Apart from Haiti, it is the poorest nation in the western hemisphere, even suffers from greater instability and looking at a history with over 200 coups since its independence back.
In a region with a strong indigenous past and a disruptive and isolated present is Bolivia alongside Guatemala perhaps the only country in Latin America, where indigenous peoples form the majority.
His topography and ethnic distribution autonomous forces and even Abspaltungsbestrebungen show the national unity menacing way jeopardise than in other countries.
Moreover, it is together with Paraguay, of course, the only nation in the subcontinent without access to the sea.
It would therefore be extremely unwise, Bolivia's current crisis on the rest of Latin America to transfer.
generalisations are much too simple: other countries, the institutions much more, poverty -- especially the extreme poverty -- has fallen, and the fight for natural resources is generally resolved.
Even in countries such as Venezuela with large reserves and traditionsbewussten, nationalist government has the current practice, foreign investment in energy resources permit, soon the eight-year government of President Hugo Chavez survived.
Although in many countries -- of Chiapas "Araucania" Amazonia Ayacucho -- indigenous movements exist, they are nowhere in Latin America a real threat to national unity.
So Bolivia is neither a crisis many words of warning, seems the time-honoured 'domino', which both Lyndon Johnson, as well as Che Guevara in the case of Bolivia, followed by valid or even reasonably sensible.
Yet suffers, Bolivia's current crisis on the 'democratic deficit' towards Latin America currently beset.
In Bolivia, Ecuador and Haiti were elected leaders from various reasons overthrown.
In Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua democracy is either poorly developed or does not exist, and in Venezuela and Colombia is threatened by different causes.
None of these cases corresponds exactly the other, they are in varying extent threatening, harmful or By way of conciliation, though.
The question is, what can be done about this situation, which strongly is different from encouraging outlook, a few years ago the image of certain.
During the last Assembly of the Organisation of American States in Fort Lauderdale in Florida took the United States is a good idea of other and brought it mainly through their support to case.
The history started a few years ago, when the former Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), so that instructed a draft for the report on democracy in Latin America to write.
They concluded that an early warning system for democratic crises in the region would help to act before the things as currently in Bolivia out of control.
Caputo and the UN persuaded the Chilean then President Ricardo Lagos to include the initiative and to promote some of his colleagues.
He did so, but the initiative came not very far.
Even in 2004 published UNDP report on democracy in Latin America they had little mention.
The US and the new Chilean Secretary-General of the OAS, Jose Miguel Insulza, brought the OAS-Treffen plan in Florida again on the table, but it is disregarded because of the well-founded fears of the Latin Americans, the idea would be directed against Venezuela, mixed with the anachronistic fears of the Latin Americans, against the sacrosanct principle of non-interference to break.
Although the continent is not the principle of consensus, due to the idea of an early warning system attention.
At present there is probably little of what the US regarding the situation in Bolivia can do, and yet entails the situation for all some dangers.
Evo Morales, opposition leaders and leader of the Kokapflanzenanbauer may an honest, if beratener bad, democratic leaders, but his supporters are completely free from authoritarian aspirations?
Hugo Chavez may not be financed Morales and the other Bolivian critics of the regime, but Venezuela and Cuba are not tried to intervene in the affairs of the country in which Che Guevara almost 40 years ago when died guerrilla?
Perhaps the Bolivian businessmen from Santa Cruz its threat of secession not true, but they will be the oil and gas their region prefer with the indigenous population in the Highlands share as Brazilian industrialists from São Paulo?
Before the events achieved such extremes, the OAS (not the US) under certain circumstances intervene.
The region is still depend on this intervention -- in time, consistently and on a proper democratic basis -- a intervention, from the traditional US intervention and Latin America differs traditional indifference.
The Fall of France?
We know that the French are sensitive if not defensive what France's image in the world.
The French state much money for promoting the French language and culture and the French painfully aware that the global position of their country, not more of the same value as previously.
It is therefore no surprise that the publication of a report by the European Commission during the last presidential elections, which has been claimed that France in the economic ranking of European countries in a period of ten years from the third to the tenth place has fallen to a soul-searching and led to controversy. soon was President Jacques Chirac his rivals Lionel Jospin, the blame on "France decline."
The OECD and Eurostat, for such data European office responsible, thought this aspect of the debate by their presentation that France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain all around the same per capita living standards enjoy ended.
The public controversy, however, remained.
This year's demonstrations against pension reform, increased disputes with the European Commission on the financial policy and bickering with America because of the war in Iraq could worried discussions on the "French decline" revived.
This currently top-selling Sachbuch in France is a controversy of Nicolas Baverez, La France qui tombe (France in decline).
Baverez 'book involves a host of two quotes of de Gaulle and Napoleon.
According to the author France reached its last achievements in the 1970s with the introduction of the Schnellzuges TGV and the Airbus.
He disfigures both Mitterrand Chirac for their "common talent to win elections and France losers".
The success of the book is itself a reference to a sort of "malaise."
But what kind of abuse?
Baverez 'evidence of degeneration is not as convincing as he believes.
For example, it leads the Dahinschwinden of jobs in the industry as a flagrant evidence of the demise of France.
The deindustrialisation, however, is common to all the industrialised countries.
France is even better than most of its rivals in the rich countries, and, unlike Germany, the United Kingdom or the United States, the same global market in the industry maintained, the beginning of the 1970's was.
According to the foreign investment, a better measure of competitiveness, France also very well.
A recent report by the Council for economic analysis according to the direct investment in France in 2001 has risen to EUR 60 billion, almost twice as much as in Germany.
Even the French prices have become more competitive improved (20%) in the last three decades through increased productivity, the rapid Lohnwachstum provoked.
The crux of the long-term economic difficulties of France, however, is precisely the fear the loss of Industriearbeitsplätzen.
In traditional sectors such as the car or space, France is still a strong industrial power; in innovative markets, in which smaller companies disseminate new technologies, but it remains back.
France, for example, only 30 billion dollars in the year for the R&D of advanced technologies, compared with 51 billion dollars in Germany, 98 billion dollars in Japan and 265 billion dollars in the US.
In short aims Baverez 'analysis simply in the wrong direction.
In the course of the last twenty years France has a number of crucial reforms experienced: economic and financial liberalization, the abolition of price and Devisenkontrollen, the end of restricting credit, European liberalisation, reduced inflation and trade deficits, the introduction of the euro and the forced globalisation of companies in the country.
The French malaise has nothing to do.
France's problem is that it does not manage to recognise the new world, of which there is already a part.
The French monarchy is dead and France, it is hard to accept his demise.
France seems to be the only country in which a prime minister, Lionel Jospin, committed to a day later on television to apologise for his statement that "the state is not bestrode the world like a colossus."
There are many reasons for this French schizophrenia, one of the crucial, however, has to do with the political events of the last 20 years together.
Until 1981 in France, there was a clear distinction between right and left.
Since both governments and Mitterrand Mr Chirac their ideological acute alleviate the difficult process of adaptation to Europe and the globalisation to bear.
A round "shock therapy" à la Margaret Thatcher twenty years ago might create a new political awareness.
But the consensus kleckerweise reforms enabled the French, to live in a world and in a different to think.
This is one of the crucial reasons for the devastating political upheaval, during the last campaign has taken place before the presidential election, as the far-right party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen before the current Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, the second round of the presidential elections achieved.
The rise of the extreme left, during this campaign 10% of the votes for could sign, also shows this political failure.
France needs a political rather than a economic revolution, if it is to put up with reality. part of this reality is that the "France decline 'is a fear that the French people themselves produced.
The value of European values
The governments of Europe have the talks on a Constitution resumed, after this last December on the basis of a dispute about voting procedures have been cancelled.
Such differences are, of course, by compromise resolve, the most likely be found.
What, however, we must be united, is a clear idea of what is to be achieved with the European Constitution.
European integration is based on two fundamental principles: solidarity and subsidiarity.
Both principles are the interface between philosophy, politics, economics, sociology and justice.
For years in the legal and institutional framework of the European Union their expression - in the Treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (where they are mentioned in the preamble) and in the current draft Constitution.
Both principles are therefore in the history and anchored in the ideals of the EU.
But mean solidarity and subsidiarity really?
Let us look at solidarity, at least doubly can be interpreted: When static solidarity, only the distribution of income and wealth and the broader concept of dynamic solidarity, in which the production of income and wealth is taken into account.
In the history of European integration after the Second World War, was in the first stage - those of the European Coal and Steel Community - the dynamic solidarity in the foreground, and both in economic development (reconstruction) and in the treaties, particularly in the Treaty of Rome.
This does not mean, however, that the dynamic solidarity later was no longer: the European monetary union is, for example, is an expression of this dynamic solidarity.
Although some countries no direct benefit of the introduction of the euro, they have voted their still, because it from the long-term positive effects of the single currency were convinced.
In other words, dynamic solidarity is strategies aimed at investment, innovation, economic growth and to promote the creation of jobs.
As, however, the figures for GDP growth in the EU show that the dynamic solidarity weakened in the last ten years.
It is particularly worrying in this context is far behind Europe in the areas of research and development.
The implementation of the adopted Lisbon Strategy in 2000 by the EU, from the European Union the most competitive economy in the world should create, however, is a growing shift in the direction of static solidarity threatened in high costs for the welfare state and high taxes reflects its funding.
The Überhandnahme of static solidarity in the ageing of the population justified, alongside slower economic growth a structural imbalance in national budgets leads.
One of the greatest future potential future impact of the EU will be the preparation of Lösungsmodellen today prevailing static solidarity that the old people guided, in favour of a dynamic solidarity to change, the young people at the centre is.
Ultimately, it may be the Union cannot afford that the current consumption continue on that level of investment, which is needed to prosperity in the future.
The principle of subsidiarity is the concept of solidarity similar because there are also two interpretations: the vertical and horizontal subsidiarity.
The vertical subsidiarity describes the division of powers between the various levels of government and the supremacy: So between the EU, the nation states, regions and local authorities.
The best-known application of this principle of federalism.
In the European Treaties, this is clearly defined vertical subsidiarity.
But that is sufficient to the emerging institutional and constitutional framework of the Union to cover?
The horizontal subsidiarity describes the responsibility and freedom of people and social and economic power.
These include the relationship between the state, society and the market.
Nonetheless, the society and the market on their own rights and Hoheitsbereiche, not be granted by the state.
The problem therefore arises in securing the autonomy of each area.
An example of horizontal subsidiarity is the European internal market, which is a new type of economic freedom and growing competition between companies created by the state safeguards for these companies have been abolished.
Horizontal subsidiarity means that the state either in the society in the economy, the individual freedom and responsibility violate must, therefore in maximum extent to respect.
Moreover, horizontal subsidiarity means that a "overriding power" there assistance, where the individual freedom and responsibility is not enough to the objective of respect for human dignity to achieve.
This support should, however, be implemented in a way that the natural potential of individuals, society and the market promotes.
However, this is only possible if the role of horizontal subsidiarity is clear. This is neither in the European Treaties in the Charter of Fundamental Rights or in the work of the European Convention the case.
In short, solidarity means today redistribution rather than growth (today’s generation brings its solidarity with future generations expressed) and subsidiarity means today the distribution of political power and not the careful distinction between the state, civil society and the market.
Today both values defined so that the state of the beneficiaries.
For example, the concentration on market-based growth often as identification with the halb-fremden values America interpreted.
But these values in Europe are deeply rooted and should again be brought to the surface.
The EU should regain their economic dynamism, by a model of solidarity and subsidiarity persecuted, the more the market and society preference and reduces the socio-economic impact of the state.
State institutions for the provision of public goods to be responsible (such as defence, justice and fiscal and monetary policy) society for social goods (such as culture, education and aid for needy people) and the market for economic goods (with profit, growth and employment in the context).
In the 21st century must Europe back on the values of both principles - of solidarity and subsidiarity - remember, if historical objective of integration wants to achieve: freedom and prosperity to gain needed to the differences and political divisions to overcome the disasters triggered in the 20th century.
In this spirit, the European Constitution must be written.
The politics of values
The debate about the American elections has still not eased.
As President George W. Bush managed to three million votes more than to get Senator John Kerry and also in both chambers of the Congress elect a Republican majority?
In the answers there is little agreement, but two issues appear in many statements.
This is a personality.
At a time of full of uncertainty and threats people had more confidence in the President, which they knew as a candidate, whose abilities not yet proven seemed.
The second issue values.
The people voted for a fabric of values, and not for a specific policy.
Indeed, some were (reported) Kerry agree with politics, gave their voice however Bush, because they with its general attitudes "probably felt."
The United States are currently in view of the elections clearly divided.
A not told them blue (democratic) states in the East, North and West spans a huge (Republican) area in the middle and in the south.
Moreover, the division reflects at local level.
Wahlkreisschiebungen -- i.e. the withdraw from Wahlkreisgrenzen, a certain political party to encourage -- are no longer necessary.
The people actually tend to draw in areas in which other share their values, whether they are republican or democratic.
What precisely these values?
They have allegedly something 'God, Duhamel and gays "-- with God, weapons and gay -- to do.
religion plays a role and including the literal truth of the Bible, when it comes to the Genesis.
The possession a weapon is the key Individualismustest, and the use of weapons in wars is nothing abominable.
gays and other 'modern' practices as grossly rejected.
As the political scientist Andrew hacking recently put it: "Bush's candidacy is designed to win the majority by approximately 60 million people charter, with itself to be satisfied."
Is all this in an American phenomenon or in other places similar trends?
An answer is that the politics of values currently as American phenomenon can create a majority, but this is by no means universal.
Europe and other parts of the world are equally divided.
figure is undoubtedly important, and below the obvious political differences may hide value, not to light reached.
But traditional political differences, the disagreement concerning fundamental values based play an increasingly smaller role in the elections.
For example, sets the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, which is the next great leader before an election, at the map "figure 'and speaks of politics, but he represents, above all, a structure of values of the middle classes.
Is there he "modernisation" or that "arriving in the twenty-first century," it manages, a curious, but attractive mixture of change and stability to communicate.
This fact has been found the conservative opposition has not yet effective response.
Even in matters such as tax cuts and stricter asylum rules values are not to the extent brought into play as the Republican Party in the US managed.
A similar picture arises in Germany, where the obvious influence of the Wertepolitik even lower.
The debate in Germany is largely a political debate.
If the opposition, the government talks on health reform or -- as happened least -- offering to combat unemployment, the reason liegendem compete more competence than values.
But well-known battlefields lurking in the political debate in Germany and Britain as elsewhere in Europe Wertekonflikte.
The parties fighting for those who can bring, "with itself to be satisfied ', but they see may not perfect, that it is only partly a question of policy.
It is unlikely that religion in the European policy to be an important factor. Opinion polls show that the observance of religious rules of a few major differences between Americans and Europeans.
weapons also take a different importance in the European consciousness. Most Europeans see their absence as important.
In Europe is also a trail pacifist values undeniable.
But plays the issue of political correctness ("gays") in Europe also has so far been underestimated role.
Above all, Europe itself shares the Europeans, because the "national" question in all European states will be raised.
This is a Werteproblem caused by fear.
The people want to know where they belong, and turn against the United States and towards Europe, or against Europe and towards their own country.
In any case, we leave the area of political directives and even the policy and enter the grim kingdom of symbols and myths.
This is in any case the main, the democratic countries are exposed, because the politics of values is a dangerous development.
In societies, whose main democratic achievement precisely the banishment of fundamentalism of politics, it leads again fundamental divisions.
A enlightened public debate must be an argument about policy, a interconnection of values is determined.
To insist on, is therefore a primary goal of the policy of freedom.
The time of interest rates is at hand
A swallow makes no summer and a month Arbeitsplatzwachstums normal and rising prices in the United States does not mean that the Bundesaufsicht US-Banken the fear of economic abuse and deflation would have lost.
But time will come in the rates of the world begin to rise, because central bankers are preparing emerging Inflationstendenzen halt.
When always so far - whether, in this autumn, in 2005 or 2006 or in 2007, America and the world economy are being confronted with financial vulnerabilities, the success of monetary Stimulationsmaßnahmen the last three years in terms of containment of Produktionsrückgängen and the deceleration of unemployment reflect.
Interest rates for short-term credits are remarkably low: only 2% in the euro area, only 1% in the United States and zero in Japan.
The expansionist monetary policy is successful, but only by the rates of historic lows avoided - and by investors were convinced that the cost of borrowing for a long time in their current state will remain.
The main outcome of monetary stimulus was a inflation in assets: everything non-interest profits, a dividend or rents pays, are just attractive - and thus geldlich much valuable - if interest rates are very low and probably will remain very low.
This explains the great gulf between the current prices for property in the US, securities in New York, London and Frankfurt and long-term bonds widely and what we normally should keep for their fundamental values.
So what will happen when the central banks begin to increase interest rates?
In 1994 led the increase of interest rates for short-term loans to Zinsanstiegen in the field of long-term - and falling prices for long-term bonds - at least twice what were normal thresholds predicted at this time.
Moreover, increased interest rates in the peripheral economies of the world, the developing countries, much more than interest rates in the major industrialized countries.
The first risk, thus for the year 2005 and beyond must make idea - if interest rates worldwide in all likelihood will increase - is therefore a further wave of financial crises in Entwicklungsmärkten.
For countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the record of the 1990s have shown that Zinsspannen bigger and flows remarkably can reverse quickly, regardless of how favourable IMF and analyses of big banks assess the policy of a country.
The Zinsspannen of emerging are currently unusually low.
International flows, apart from Zuflüssen in the United States - are still not levels, "irrational Überschwänglichkeit" in connection would bring, but this could happen before the interest rates rise to begin.
These are alarming prospects, because if the 1990s a taught, then, that nobody the stability of international financial flows overestimate.
The second risk stems from high assets within the large since industrialized countries.
The prevailing mindset within the Bundesaufsicht US-Banken - with which I agree - is that the information revolution continues, that the growth of potential output in the US remains very high and therefore the output is relatively large.
The conclusion that interest rates may actually on a quite considerable period must remain low.
Moreover, the confidence in the Bundesaufsicht US-Banken is high and the last remnants of the risk premium of the 1970's inflation rates herausgepresst.
As a result, will interest rates, measured in the 1980's and 1990's, remain low, even after Produktionsstände again their potential.
That, of course, are all good news for those who assets as long-term bonds, stocks and property possess.
Because the prices have risen long-term assets was exactly the point in the reduction of interest rates: Finally affects enriching the shareholders in particular the Immobilieneigentümer stimulating the expenditure.
The bad news is that, even if it is expected that interest rates a time remain low, they do not indefinitely remain so low.
In a word, if interest rates rise, the assets fall.
These are precisely the times - especially when assets fall quickly and considerably - in which we see how well our central bankers its primary task genuinely meet: reducing financial volatility and the promotion of economic stability.
While such periods we also see how many people, the long-term bonds, property or shares have do this, not because they believe that the current prices measured by the indicators are attractive, but because the prices in the course of recent years have risen.
For decision-makers is a crucial question, because those long-term assets from apparently rising prices have acquired, are also those who sell them again, once the hung obviously reverse develop.
In particular, the US current-account deficit is emerging hangs as massive cause of instability, should prices for long-term assets fall clearly.
The challenges that the economic decision-makers in the world in the course of the coming years to see, are certainly other than with which they have since the bursting of the NASDAQ-Blase were faced.
The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those collapsing production and threat of deflation arise.
As we have learned in the 1990s, this does not mean that the forthcoming difficulties easier to manage would be.
America's contradictory prospects
I recently brought something interesting in experience: America have oriented Finanzökonomen international and national situations oriented macroeconomists very different views -- almost contradictory -- on the probable consequences of the huge American current-account.
The outward-looking Finanzökonomen keep a financial crisis, followed by a painful and perhaps persistent recession in the United States for likely.
In contrast, see the national oriented macroeconomists a expected decline in the dollar not as a crisis, but as an opportunity to accelerate economic growth.
The macroeconomists presented the situation around: at some point in the future foreign central banks will no longer still be prepared to en masse to buy dollar-denominated securities, to base American currency.
If they employ extensive Dollarkäufe, the value of the dollar fall -- and the hard landing.
With the fall of the dollar, however, macroeconomists, US-Exporte attractive to other countries and employment in America will improve, because more workers in the emerging export migrate.
The development would be similar in Britain, when the bailouts abandoned and the British pound against the Deutsche Mark has been devalued or, as in the US of the late 1980s, when the dollar vis-à-vis the pound, the Deutsche Mark and -- especially -- has been devalued against the Japanese yen.
The outward-looking Finanzökonomen see the future are just bleak.
In their eyes will be the end of the Dollarkäufe by the central banks not only lead to a devaluation of the dollar, but also to a record high in the long-term interest rates in the US, thereby directly consumer spending and expenditure short time later will reduce the investment expenditure.
Of course, the Finanzökonomen also expect that the US-Exporte of a decline in the dollar benefit, but by the delays in the demand the Exportanstieg or two years after the decline in consumption and investment expenditure occur.
The jobs of eight to ten million people will by the services in the export and importkonkurrierenden area, thereby shifting with an increase in the structural unemployment to be expected.
Moreover, it could become a panic: large financial institutions with their short-term liabilities and long-term assets, it will be difficult to a sharp increase in the long-term Dollar-Zinssätze to cope with.
This disparity can just as easily to financial pressure and bankruptcy as then during the crises in Mexico and Asia in the 1990's and a few years ago in Argentina, as the imbalance between the local currencies kept installations of banks and their Dollar-Verbindlichkeiten financial congestion and ultimately led to the bankruptcy.
If Finanzökonomen internationally oriented design this scenario, which macroeconomists reply, all this sounds a case of incompetent monetary policy.
Why should the US Federal Reserve Federal Reserve allow long-term Spitzenzinssätze just because other central banks Dollarkäufe no longer carry out?
If the Fed cannot intervene and instead itself long-term treasury buy and thus to a long-term rate contribute in a level, compatible with full employment?
This is certainly what the Finanzökonomen react with the reference that the Fed do not force would have.
If the choice between price stability and full employment, then, the Finanzökonomen, the Fed opt for price stability, because the memories of the rampant inflation in the 1970s still very presence.
As a decline in the dollar to an increase in import prices lead and therefore a negative shock for the supply side of the economy, the Fed will have to increase interest rates, and not lower and not buy bonds, but to sell.
On both sides of this debate engaged with great vigour serious economists, which I appreciate very.
I am not clever enough to decide which side in the right, but I know perfectly well from which side, I hope that they are wrong.
Europe's freeloading on
In the United States must states, which pursue a inadequate budgetary policy count on penalties.
Their bonds are worth less than those from better conducted states.
The higher debt, the negligent to provide serves -- to a certain extent -- than disciplinary action against the temptation to spend the money now and foot the bill later.
Of course, the discipline by the market is not perfect: Anleihenmarkt 'provides "implicit future liabilities (such as promised pensions) is not in large scale.
Nevertheless, this forced budgetary discipline in combination with the Budgetmaßnahmen of individual states contributed to the fact that in the US since the Great Depression any major Haushaltskrisen were more.
Let us now Europe.
Before the introduction of the euro, there was in individual countries of southern Europe Budgetkrisen high inflation led.
Because of the single currency, however, is the way to solve a budgetary crisis blocked on inflation, because the European Central Bank (ECB) is watching over monetary policy.
So the European countries their Finanzdefizite not more about the can settle inflation, allow them the single currency, the Schuldenkapazität, which really belongs to the other EU members, claim to and extend its Ausgabenorgien a while in profligate and Braus to live and the political responsibility to later.
To this a barrier to opportunities, the growth and stability pact launched: government deficits must be below 3% of GDP.
Last week broke Germany -- once the most disciplined budgetary, sets an example of the EU -- the rules of the pact for the fifth time in succession and without great) excuses.
Finance Minister peer Steinbrück was to understand that it with the European Commission sanctions against Germany expect, because otherwise the credibility of the Pact at stake.
Unlike two and a half years ago, Germany would therefore not this time against the sanctions.
Steinbrück was also clear, however, that he expect that the sanctions due to the predicted deficit of 3.4% of GDP largely symbolic and no penalties, which the government or economy with significant costs would be.
The growth and stability pact works -- still -- nowhere near as originally intended.
What about the market discipline?
Will the willingness of the German Government, even more debt and increased deficits accumulate lower, because the market those states recognises and punished, the weakening of its fiscal position accept?
The answer is' no '.
The rates for the euro denominierten public debt of twelve Member States of the eurozone are all very similar.
The market therefore seems not to take care that the countries have different potential to boost exports to years--rather those financial flows, the repayment or for different current or forecast quotas would be required.
Willem Buiter of the University of Amsterdam and Anne Sibert of the University of London believe that the willingness of the ECB, ultimately all debts of the euro zone as guarantees to accept the ability of the market as a driving force to act budgetary prudence, undermines.
So long a small part of the German debt as security for a short-term loan or as the heart of a Wertpapierpensionsgeschäfts to improve the liquidity can serve, will be worth much more of those conditions intended to what the ECB accepted this as security, as its true value.
The fact that the ECB all these debts treated as equal Liquiditätsquellen, will be given more weight than all the analyses of the differences in long-term national risks.
In the long run, this development is dangerous.
To a reasonable chance of long-term to maintain price stability, we need both market discipline and sound budgetary management.
Will the rapid punishment of the market for behaviour later in recklessness degenerate, eliminated or lacks institutional arrangements, to future generations to give a voice, then face serious risks -- perhaps not today or tomorrow, but at some point determined and then for a long time.
Over the years, the introduction of the single currency and the way as it was carried out to more unease held.
The policy in the euro zone is designed to deflationary.
It failed to carry out transfers, which would be needed to the single currency acceptable for those regions, whose position is deteriorating and already in recession, if the ECB tightened its policy.
The institutional foundations for a stable long-term budgetary policy will be undermined.
And now Buiter and Sibert convincing to see that the ECB the market little room granted to reward the Sparsamen and to punish squanderers.
More fracture lines are no recognisable and for the next time is not to be expected.
But if things do not change, the ground might under the euro very well moving.
Milosevic and Hussein: jurisdiction as a farce
war-crimes were once a serious matter.
Witness the photographs of Herman Göring and Schuster Heß in Nuremberg, quashed in the dock sedentary.
Some Nazigrößen were relatively recently, but fair process even hanged.
Today, the trial against the verworfensten political leaders of our world mockery.
The trial of Saddam Hussein and his cronies from the Ba'ath 'ath-Partei is characterised by a continuing series of embarrassments.
The defendants try with a farce after another, and Saddam Hussein shows every possible form of disregard of the court, except the judges bare the butt to show.
It is difficult to imagine a result that in the eyes of Iraqis or the world will appear legitimate.
Alldieweil the trial of Slobodan Milosevic burial changed -- after four boring years of testimonies and a waste of more than 200 million dollars.
In Cambodia haggle the United Nations and the government almost a decade since the question of how the surviving elements of the Khmer Rouge the process.
The mass murderer of the 20th century came to power, were -- if they do not verstarben, while they were in power -- condemned to Volksaufständen killed or for their crimes before the courts.
Who can be proud that the last communist leaders Romania, Nikolae Ceauşescu, and his wife without even the appearance of a fair trial were shot?
The formal ceremony real courts certainly seems better than one’s, even if, at the end in both cases of death.
Today, there are two credible methods to combat dismissed tyrants.
A nation can their former leaders themselves before the court, as Argentines in the 1980's, with the for the disappearance of more than 5 000 of its citizens responsible generals did.
At international level for future processes continue the Nuremberg model available -- admittedly under the questionable circumstances, that victorious sometimes penalties for crimes -- such as' crimes against humanity '-- impose, at the time when they were committed, no proper definition was.
There was a time in which the benefits both national as international processes were recognisable.
On the ground, held processes enabled the local communities, through close involvement in the procedure to provide Trauerarbeit.
As judge and jury could the defendants compatriots also greater sensitivity in the assessment of the blame table, because they were aware of the difficult circumstances under which the dictator outgoing 13 September its decisions.
Argentina's proceedings against the generals was a successful ritual in the arduous transition from the military junta to democracy, but the experience ended in tears and self-doubt.
Even after their condemnation the generals were still sufficiently powerful, the end of the processes and then the pardon from their subsequent President to impose.
Even today, the Argentine policy by the legal consequences of those 20 years ago processes caused complications labelled.
At international level was the decision of the UN Security Council on the establishment of the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also welcomes with great confidence.
The ICTY 13 September, under the leadership of Antonio Cassese, a number of fundamental choices.
Then, however, the judges had the misfortune to achieve their wildest dream -- the negotiation, before their court, against the Erzschurken Slobodan Milosevic.
It is not clear how the Serbs in a process in their own country dealt with Milosevic would be.
Much would be the political party have been dependent on the court had controlled.
At international level feared no too much policy, but right.
Milosevic's process should be more than fair, should be a symbol for the fairness of the UN.
So it was Milosevic allowed to defend themselves -- under the point of view of the length and efficiency of the procedure a monumental.
The number of witnesses, called the charge, to keep the same horrifying history of Serbian aggression and brutality to testify to knew no borders.
It will take months, in order to determine what went wrong and why the process over four years scandalous whatsoever.
My instinct tells me that the generous Gerichtsbeamten too much from the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission could influence -- a model in the legal faculties as an alternative to the desirable Vergeltungsjustiz proclaimed.
In the South African procedure was the most important issue is not after the future of the accused, but the victims past.
Every victim was encouraged to tell its history, and the accused heard.
In the case of the in the course of the twentieth century suffered massacres such a reappraisal can require decades.
The victims to encourage speeches and then the defendants that give right, Anpreisen own merits political to delay the procedure, a recipe for not end interminable delays also.
A lesson we from the processes against Milosevic and Hussein have learned is that men or women are not before the court, their charismatic attractiveness caused an end to make.
They will be the procedure to usurp -- especially if it allows them to defend themselves -- and the courtroom to justify the own career use.
tyrants should only court, if they are clearly defeated.
Ironically, there was an advantage of the Nuremberg courts, with the representatives of the victorious were occupied.
This was a permanent memory Heß Göring, and their accomplices, that the Allies the shots had and the Nazis were defeated inevitable.
final objective of the procedure was always the punishment of those guilty, not the influence of future history.
The tragedy of the processes against Milosevic and Saddam Hussein is that the "i" of history in their case go-between lacked -- and the history itself was before the courts.
The consequent stipulated uncertainties led by the leaders -- internationally as national -- procedures, the fantasy of rehabilitation and return facilitated.
In the case of Hussein’s this fantasy could even become a reality.
Economic divisions in Iraq
Iraq presented, all the observers as a between Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds divided state.
But it is also a fundamental divide is proceeding along the growing gap between rich and poor -- a line, the current insurgency as religious fight has contributed, as well as the resistance against the Americans quoted military occupation.
As Iraq was liberated, many hoped, particularly poor people on a charismatic leader, from the bitter reality of their everyday would save.
These people are in fear grew up and had no idea of how democracy would affect their society or how human rights groups and Bürgerrechtsbewegungen a contribution to shaping the future could make.
Soon it was in Iraq with a new social divide faced.
On the one hand, were those who had understood, as acting in a democracy, gained power and its goals.
They learned the language of democracy to speak, as in this process money and influence and how independent organisations use is to defend rights and privileges.
On the other hand this divide, however, remains the great majority of helpless Iraqis, including the widows and divorced or by their men abandoned women who have anyone who for them and their children provides.
For these people democracy and human rights mean nothing.
They have no education, are poor and ill.
As victims of education, more than a decade ago collapsed, they do not have few knowledge, which could help them in the Iraqi economy ailing to find employment.
While Saddam's rule, there has been no effort to improve the standard of living of the poor.
I have the huge shanty visited in Iraq and found families living in homes, where there is little shelter who were through and through were afflicted by insects and where the waste under the door durchsickerten.
In day and night they live in darkness.
These families need nothing more than food, shelter reasonably acceptable and the prospect of a job, but they are waiting for the death and afraid of the shouts of their starving children.
When I with the women in these homes met, überhäuften me with questions: Will the democracy we are providing food and houses?
Will it prevent men, women to propose?
Will our children thereby gain the nationality?
Will we then have a right to divorce of husbands, which we have left?
My answer to all these questions was' yes'.
Yes, the democracy you have the right to a decent housing, education and work, your children will gain citizenship and their you want your equal men.
you will, however, work hard and must make every effort to demand your rights.
This is certainly what the women replied: "Saddam Hussein has 35 years eingebläut, without work and without aufzumucken to live in fear.
What can we do now? "
In these poverty-stricken areas, where most Iraqis live, people are succumbing bitter temptations.
Many of them are policy or the government not to achieve.
They are occurring in violence, theft and sabotage.
Angestachelt allurement of false heroism, during the long Saddam's rule ausleben could not, it brings the poverty, money to carry out acts of violence.
The poverty exacerbates the trauma of violent, wars and horrors characterised history of Iraq, which the people towards the killing ‘terrorism’ left.
Although many young men through the conditions in Iraq to violence carried away, I am convinced that we them only proper jobs and shelters must, in order to dissuade them.
Above all, jobs would help the young people, their lives through serious work to make new.
We must armies of the unemployed not fictitious, so-called No-Work-Jobs conceal.
We must offer jobs to the people who give them the opportunity to contribute to the reconstruction of the country.
Everyone is inherently endeavouring, a valuable member of society.
But the culture, under Saddam thrived, the Iraqis convinced that political compounds are the only way to power, money and knowledge to gain. To overcome this attitude it takes time and a dynamic economy.
This means, then, that the power of the new Iraqi government must be limited to the growth of the private sector to enable, but must be a wide-ranging understanding of democracy and human rights must be promoted.
Religious groups are ready to contribute to this process.
We can also technocrats, under Saddam served to rehabilitate, so that they get the chance to serve their country.
Finally, we must poor families provide loans, which will allow them to build a respectable life.
Above all, the government must not refrain from effort, the Iraqis the value of democracy and freedom to convince and to show them how important the Constitution for the realisation of their dreams of a better life.
This will not be easy in a country where many people recognise law-breaking considered heroic act.
We Iraqis have also learned that power is not in the hands of fewer people must be concentrated and that the establishment fair conditions in the fight against all forms of corruption requires.
If the Constitution as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security should be used, the Iraqis must learn this fight to their fight.
Islamist identity
Everywhere you see today, such as Islam as a political force used (and abused).
Some Muslims use it as a call for action; many in the West (and elsewhere) understand it as a "different 'desire for demarcation and exclusion.
When I feel Turk both sides in this debate immediately.
The reason why the Islam in the view of the West as a "different" religion seems based, that the West a systematic has experienced Entinstitutionalisierung of religion.
Religion is obviously not from the modern Western lives disappeared, much more, it is the right to religious institutions to raise the behaviour of the individual.
Religion is in the modern world a much personal and spirituellere experience than ever before.
But within Islam finds a process of Entinstitutionalisierung religious experience instead.
The politicization of Islam postponing the authority of religious classes of Islam, the ulema.
As in the West will religious experience in Islam personal.
One result is the interpretation of religious texts by the individual Muslim, also by the political combatants, intellectuals and women.
Another is the Vergröberung of religious knowledge, with the lesson of the Koran abused and from the context, in order to support political objectives.
Who decides what is now in Islam is permitted and what is forbidden?
Who has the authority to interpret religious texts?
Who can be a 'fatwa' declare or explain "jihad"?
Today, offer activism and terrorism is a new source of legitimacy, or necessary this more.
So layman decide what Islam does or does not mean, and they do without the authority of religious schools and Spezialausbildung.
Indeed, Islam today in the first instance of political actors and cultural movements and not interpreted by religious institutions.
These Entinstitutionalisierung allowed Islam, rather than remains a local and national social bond, move, a imaginary link between all Muslims to forge wherever they feel harassed and suppressed.
So the Islamism, supporters, which were once deeply divided, unite: Sufi and spiritual law-abiding Sharia Muslims; Shiites and Sunnis; the Conservative Saudi Arabia and the revolutionary Iran.
At the same time, as its believers leaving the rural areas and in cities, including in the West went, is also Islam in moving.
Many seems this development as something negative, and they emphasise that people are thus socially uprooted, which alienation and for some leads to terrorism.
But social mobility is also the condition to gain a modern perspective.
Of course, seeing Muslims as a result of emigration a feeling of distance or even a complete break with their social origin.
Therefore, their religious experience of a new kind and all theological and gemeindlichen deprived state institutions.
The religious experience will instead become a form of social idea, within which people again develop a sense, in the new and foreign surroundings belong Islam.
Not distancing itself from the modern life, but the approximation of solving this returning to the religious identity.
Indeed, the radicalism arises mostly in groups which, because they expulsion and mobility have learned, with the secular forms of political thinking and urban life are familiar in the West.
By unsettled topic environment, they find in Islam their support.
But will this support prove must Islam in the face of modernity of its traditionally docile, passive and mild attitude free.
By a veil or a beard bear, the right to spaces for their prayers in the workplace or in school demand and special food claim Muslims openly as such to see.
They show thus each in their environment, that they firmly and more precise their religious responsibilities than those that their religion confined to their private life.
For example, see non-Muslims usually in the wearing of the veil a sign of humiliation and oppression of women Muslim.
Instead of a stigma where is the veil for Muslims signs of positive confession to their Muslim identity has become.
Young Muslim women in Europe illustrate this transformation very closely.
girls, the French and German schools bear the headscarf, are in many ways (namely in terms of youth culture, their Modebewusstseins and their language) closer to its Mitschülern as their home to the gefesselten, uneducated mothers.
By the headscarf in Europe bear in the public, change this girls unintentionally the symbol and the role of Muslim women.
This trend is enough well beyond the headscarf.
All Muslims in the West have a dual Zugehörigkeitsempfinden, a double cultural capital.
They define by their religion, but they also have a comprehensive, secular knowledge acquired.
Because they have a dual cultural capital, they can also relatively freely between various activities and premises move - between the homes, schools, the youth organization and the urban leisure.
Muslim and Islamic fundamentalist is not the same thing.
What we are witnessing today is the transformation of the Muslim identity Islamist.
The religious Even of individual Muslims shifted from the private in the public sector.
The question which everyone is whether the search for identity with headscarves and a broad public acceptance of religious practices of Islam can be met, or whether the positive commitment to Islam requires a fundamental rejection of modernity.
A new era for the Islamic science?
As science and mathematics few hundred years a period of great inventions enjoyed, stach a region of the world particularly shows.
That is where the champions of these disciplines verehrt medicine made rapid progress and the average was curious to know the nature works.
As not otherwise this region worldwide respect.
On the other half of the planet known were punished scientists, even killed.
mathematics than gottlos and absurd outlawed and later subject of religion.
The standard of living was low.
The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, while a Europe ignorant remained further poor.
Both regions were determined by the religion (historians have different views on the role and the nature of religions in this context), but science erblühte in only one of the two.
Now the roles of the Islamic Middle East and the West course reversed.
Since the Second World War, the United States uncontentious world leader in science.
During this period the gescheitesten been diverted students from their home countries, attracted by superior Forschungsuniversitäten and better ways.
Until recently, is more than half of all university students in the US in the areas of mathematics, science and Engineering abroad was born.
Many of these talents remained after the degree, and both industry and the government took their benefit from it.
However there were Islamic cultures in an historic phase in the science equated with western influence and avoided.
Even in countries where oil revenue in considerable research could push forward, Arab rulers have not promoted this type of investment, with the result that their societies are not so far advanced, as it could have been.
Recently, a desire for greater respect political Islamic nations moved to invest in technology, which, in view of the Pakistani and Iranian Atomambitionen particularly clear.
Such weapons have political weight, but the science behind, is trivial and old.
The respect, the Ausreifen knowledge arises, is much more meaningful than the products from the past discoveries.
Imagine the influence, generated by an institute Pakistan would, the world leader in cancer research.
Would the political rhetoric shift, if researchers in Oman a key to fight AIDS discovered?
This is a wasted opportunity.
However, there is still a different and not just for Islamic societies.
The USA in the recent past serious missteps done.
Science was in the government, the President downwards, "religious'.
The reports of Spitzenforschern were amended by political officials, if the facts of the official conviction objected.
Through a religiously influenced government encouraged to shift school systems its focus from science "values".
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 entry visas have become less and difficult to get what the flow of young talent to American universities impedes.
Large research organisations have protested vain.
At the same time, the tax laws have been changed, investors Vermögenszuwächse short term to bring what long-term investment in research discourage.
Half a trillion dollars has been provided for the war in Iraq, a sum that some of the support for the whole research in the last thousand years meets.
Even if the US a fundamentalist Middle Ages deal, they risk clearly the loss of their global dominance in research.
Japan has the connection between political power and science in the 1980 recognised.
Japan's leading industrialists Morita Akio, the President of Sony, and the Shintaro rechtsstehende Ishihara politicians considered a number of speeches collected and 1986 in a book entitled 'The Japan that Can ‘say No were published.
They outlined a national strategy, which assumed that impact on the world leadership in science shows.
The main idea was that military power could be made obsolete, if the "chain" of military technology requires by other nations would be controlled.
The title of the book relates to Japan project 'No to say "the American military influence, when Japan controls the decisive military technology.
It is clearly possible, a knowledge-based economy through the use of oil wealth build.
That was around Texas, as most southern either, once economically poor and in decline.
Although it is in possession of oil revenue was to increase the flow of dollars in an economy alone prosperity is not as strong as one might think.
So Texas decided Ölgeld Ausbildungsstiftung to use.
This funding meets today in some of the Harvard University and to 15 universities distributed.
The result is striking: production in the field of aerospace industry from California as well as disappeared, but in Texas flourishing.
research centres and consortiums in telecommunications in droves came to Texas, even from the Canadian Telekommunikationsriesen Nortel.
Although the processing industry in the US in the crisis, Texas has one of the strongest economies produktionsorientierten world.
There is no reason why the same result might not be achieved in the Middle East.
First, however, the Islamic world must be proud their heritage discover new and embrace.
Iran’s debates on Iraq
No country in the Middle East focuses more on the events in post-war Iraq and Iran.
With his western neighbours combine Iran's geographical proximity, a long history of bloody conflicts with Iraq, Saddam Hussein, religious and emotional ties with the Iraqi Shia and concern for the policy of the United States in the region.
In view of the continuing tensions with the US is Iran, especially in the light of possibly longer lasting US-Präsenz concerned in Iraq, and also because of the dominant role of America in the future shape of Iraq after Saddam Hussein.
To outsiders, it is probably difficult to the internal debates in Iran to follow, but these discussions and they will be fiercely fought, even if for a greater international public opinion does not at first sight shows.
In this debate on Iraq after Saddam Hussein are three basic approaches recognisable.
The pragmatists are of the opinion that Iran with the US in post-Saddam Iraq must necessarily cooperate, even if it is just a question of the rights of the Iraqi Shia to preserve.
For this reason, we should assure Iran, that a new leadership in Iraq this section of the population not treat hostility and forge friendly bilateral relations.
On the other fundamental interests of pragmatists include the preservation of the territorial integrity of Iraq and the repatriation of tens of thousands in Iran live Iraqi refugees.
The moderate pragmatists want the Iranian Government pressure on America, so that in Iraq living members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MKO) to be extradited and dismantle the organisation.
In return, the Iranian Government should their support for the preservation of peace, stability and security in Iraq offer.
In a word, the pragmatists want the iranisch-amerikanischen relations on an agenda limit, mainly national affairs of Iran.
This approach will generally by conservative forces in Iran supports.
Another approach provides for a more active role of Iran in the reconstruction of Iraq.
The advocates of this line are of the opinion that Iran could due to its well established infrastructure personnel and institutional links to Iraq facilitate the reconstruction.
Ultimately, it believes that the United States and the international community the value of Iranian cooperation see.
In return for the Iranian cooperation should the infrastructure of the MKO in Iraq be dismantled. This point might a promise of Iran linked, even harder combat activities of Al-Qaeda and their in Iran living expel members.
It is primarily the advocates of this position, however, the fact that Iran from the American side will guarantee that the country is not the aim of American military action.
In short, it is the advocates of cooperation to open and clear deal: Iran supports the stabilisation in the current transition in Iraq and promises, cooperative relations with every Iraqi Government, which should come to maintain and receives the assurance to improve its regional and international position.
This opinion is particularly Iranian reformers, within and outside the government - and outward-looking technocrats and economists represented.
For the radicals finally, the possibility of cooperation with the United States sheer fantasy.
They believe America would only to the safety of Iran to undermine and jeopardise its national interests.
In the eyes of the radicals want the US at least greater changes to the Iranian foreign policy force.
In the worst case, argued that the Americans actively for regime change in Iran occur.
They will actively against the appropriation of nuclear knowledge through Iran address, and possibly even try to the entire military potential of Iran to weaken.
These radicals consider the American invasion of Iraq as a part of the American strategy, encircle Iran.
For that, they believe that Iran must aggressively defend its interests reply, strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers form and its influence in Iraq, a pro-American, anti-iranische government in Baghdad to prevent.
That is the approach hardliners from all the groups support.
The fall of Saddam's regime was the easiest exercise in the Iraq crisis.
Now the difficult part: to secure peace and stability, to win the war against terrorism and the Muslim populations to convince them that it is not the intention America is to occupy Iraq, oil abzusaugen and the Middle East after its Ebenbild to make.
Meanwhile, the rejection of the United States in the form of suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism very probably increase.
Iran should be an important force in the region remain, because his political momentum and its Muslim identity find large reverberations arising throughout the Muslim world.
What happens in Iraq, has major impact on Iran and the United States would be well advised to this fact to face.
The American threats or the suggestions of a new war in Iran fuel resentment and frustration and strengthen the radical forces.
If the US would avoid such development, they should be the influence of its own radicals limit and realise that the American interests in Iraq best through a broader cooperation with Iran served.
The road from Iraq
Finally, the point in Iraq achieved, in which all the same apparently want: the withdrawal of the Coalition from the country.
The recent Defense Ministry from the British evasive reporting on a document on the withdrawal underlines this wish.
The only question is how we can fulfil him.
Until the Coalition remain, violence will probably escalate.
But they go, it will also come to an escalation, only faster.
The real question is therefore how reaches the point that the Iraq police and army may record, trusted to maintain law and order.
It is still a further way, until this objective even approximately achieved.
Despite the courage of the many Iraqis, the army or police join, no one should be surprised if some motives, which is not quite purely.
In northern Iraq should be paid old bills, and in areas such as Irbil, which traditionally ethnically mixed, a de facto ethnic division introduced.
In other areas the law of Sharia violently enforced.
As Iraq can therefore establish people there in military uniform services, which an effective and impartial enforcement of the law, without taking account of ethnicity, religion and gender trust?
The traditional answer is to entice people to educate and give them the right "values" to communicate.
But it is not enough time.
Other options are necessary.
Without a deep enshrining values Iraq needs civil society organisations on the ground, the police and the army to account.
This could adopt various forms, but is really important that they actually people at local level and involve the structures at district level, at regional and national level should be supported if they highlight abuse.
If there is a local review, whose value reinforced nationally and recognised, the majority of members of the services uniformed accordingly probably -- and when they do not, they can be simpler identified and treated accordingly.
This may excessive hopes sound, but in Afghanistan, a country that Iraq is similar in many respects, there are groups to work towards this goal.
The Newens for Peace and Unity (CPAU) provides a model of how this can be done.
Just as in Iraq had the dismantling of violence for ordinary people in Afghanistan top priority.
The CPAU in the last three years throughout the country, worked Friedenskomitees to set up district level, Friedensräten be supported in the surrounding villages.
The initiative has a culture of violence is so deeply rooted, that children previously arithmetic learned by dead Sowjetsoldaten includes.
The committee therefore trying together all parts of the Community, including teachers, tribal, religious leaders, women, the police, soldiers, judges and businessmen, new ways to non-violent conflict resolution.
Although hitherto monitoring is not formally part of the role of the committees was (this is planned for the future), brings the mere fact that the police, justice and the army belong to the committee, they are in contact with the rest of the Community. This provides feedback and creates confidence.
Some are remarkable results.
In a workshop came the local Militärkommandant out of courtesy for a few hours are gone and remained at the end of the whole week.
Finally, he apologized for his violent past and committed itself, its 2000 man to disarm Privatarmee strong.
Now he visited the offices of the committee regularly.
In Iraq start currently projects such as the Humanitarian Liaison Center (humanitarian anywhere) in Kirkuk, a supervisory role to fulfil by the ethnically mixed local population offer the opportunity to present their problems and assistance in the solution to receive.
But too often judicial decisions, even if they were decided, as a result of intimidation is not implemented.
Of the American and British forces has been much good work to the strengthening of civil society.
We hear nothing about the workshops on the empowerment of women or the successful organisation of local elections within small everywhere in the country.
But the mobilisation of civil society is an enormous challenge, especially when, as in Iraq, quickly and in large scale must be done.
incapable still needed, but equally incentives to disarm, including the prospect of economic possibilities, which are fruitful than crime and blackmail.
Fortunately, the construction of civil skills cheaply as important.
Humanitarian Liaison Center serves very Kirkuk in annual expenses of $75 000.
With $10 million could further 100 such centres are being created, and would much 'small change remains.
The challenge is to commit to this approach extend him and fully behind the courageous people to accept the challenge of the powerful accountable.
Otherwise, it is unlikely that Iraqis receive the safety, after so many years of suffering so urgently need.
Democracy in the Nile?
The surprising decision of the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for a constitutional amendment of the direct election of the President on several rivals should enable could in Egypt and throughout the Arab world as a huge step towards democracy prove.
For people in the West, pluralist democracies are used, it is perhaps difficult to understand what a huge change associated in a country could be, for more than 50 years under military rule.
In the current system Egyptian citizens must only every six years on the day of the presidential elections to the polls appear and the only name on the ballots their approval or not.
This explains why someone like Mubarak every time over 90% of the votes receives, if different turnout.
Syrischen and Iraqi leaders was with such systems even better. This undoubtedly because name and addresses the voters on every ballots aufzuscheinen had.
Many was argued that the democratisation process in the Middle East will not move forward until Egypt in full participating.
Egypt was able to the path of democratisation but not go down, without changing its constitution -- the phenomenal powers its President to reduce and to limit its mandate.
Mubarak is after all 24 in the year of his term as President.
That is why his announcement, for a presidential election with multiple candidates to ensure that an important first step.
The regime may assume this process to its benefits, but the course of events is perhaps not so easy to monitor, if people have the feeling, equipped with power.
The Flaschengeist of democracy would have left its bottle.
In any event Egypt is not the only country in this region problembeladenen now on the path towards democracy.
Turkey on the one side of the Middle East and Morocco on the other are already under way.
The real pressure seems this time by the strict timetables and the positive results of the recent elections in Iraq, in Palestine, and in lesser extent in Saudi Arabia.
In the unprecedented demonstrations against the Syrian occupation in Lebanon in the wake of the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri seems to be no end in sight.
Egyptian opposition in the last few weeks increasingly risky marches organized and other forms of civil disobedience demonstrated.
Angeheizt was their rage by the arrest of health attack Oppositionschefs Eiman Only at the end of January.
The merciless procedure of the government led to a revival of the national "Kifaya-" (enough) movement, the end of the Mubarak-Regimes demands.
Suddenly seemed the widespread view, whereby Egyptians would be passive and unperturbed activities, become unsustainable.
A alliance from local, regional and international forces united against the day-to-day tyranny of the shores of the Nils.
The recent Druckwelle from the population, the regime appears to have shaken.
just a month ago did Mubarak demands for a constitutional reform as "futile '.
But what constellation of events its change always led, an initiative to change the right to vote should be welcomed.
It is a necessary -- albeit inadequate -- first step towards the modification of the deadlock over political system in Egypt.
The Egyptians are already sceptical Alibireformen à la Tunisia, where Langzeitpräsident His Ben Ali al-Abidin the caricature of a constitutional amendment created, which superficially enabled competitive elections, but then led to a Scheinwahlgang, a few high-value "rivals' office.
On previous presidential election in Tunisia reached Ben Ali routinely 99% of the votes, in this election was 96%.
Let us hope, therefore, that it is Mubarak with its electoral reform seriously believes.
As a sign, it must be the immediate release of Eiman Only ordering and take measures to 24 years since ongoing emergency to end a campaign actively prevented.
Moreover, Mubarak for restricting the term of President on two times use five years.
It is also necessary confidence-building measures, including an open and equal access to the media, which is currently under state control are.
I have announced that I intend to stand in the forthcoming presidential elections, a debate on these fundamental reforms.
I would, however, I am pleased again in my life withdraw if free and open elections in the autumn would be guaranteed.
In serious implementation of these measures would Mubarak's legacy in a different light.
Together with the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine could thus a long-overdue Arab spring heralding of freedom.
Historical elections in Egypt?
On 7 September the Egyptians choose its new President. Among the ten candidates of 24 years since acting President Hosni Mubarak.
Although his reelection almost no doubt that followed the electoral process in many places with great interest.
In this election prepare 6 000 national observers and hundreds of foreign journalists flooding this week to Egypt.
Although the aggregate criteria of a real fair round met, lacks important aspects of the credibility, however, in flagrant manner.
Despite the contrary promise of equal opportunities miles away.
Mubarak considers still disproportionately many assets in the hands: scratch, a virtual monopoly on the government-controlled electronic media and around 85% of the press.
A week before the elections some opposition candidates are still waiting for the broadcasting of their Wahlwerbesendungen Egyptian television.
All members of the Electoral Commission for the presidential elections were appointed by President Mubarak and with the new electoral rules be adopted independent competitors any chance.
After a judgment by the Supreme Court must since the year 2000, the 8,000 Egyptian judges supervise the elections and confirm the results.
This ruling was an important step in the direction of fair elections, because the Berufsvereinigung of judges in the last 50 years their independence reasonably well against the Zugriffsversuche of the executive could claim.
So the Mubarak-Regime had to resort to various tricks, the Richtervereinigung auszubooten.
It was thought, for example in the judiciary 'thousands of loyal government officials, a conclusion in Rechtswissenschaften could show, but no experience in court had because the real judges hands are tied, because a protest by boycott their with monitoring this task would once again the police of the notorious Ministry of the Interior fallen.
In the past, the added Richtervereinigung foreseeable effects.
In the parliamentary elections in 2000 reached the ruling party Mubarak in the real judges monitored constituencies about 38% of the votes, while the winner-take-all where Quasi-Richter at work, 86% rises in.
Today it promises to be different.
In the spring, the judges considered a nationwide General Assembly. It was agreed that the forthcoming presidential elections (or parliamentary elections) only to monitor, if the government judges full independence and the exclusive monitoring of the Wahlvorganges grant.
On 2 September formulated its final demands: the election civil groups must be observed, the definition of who is a legitimate judges, to electoral cannot be changed, and no ballot box must be removed, without the votes before a legitimate counted judges and the result of this has been confirmed and sent.
Until now, it looks after a stalemate, because the chairman of the electoral commission has publicly stated in the Egyptian television, that it is any monitoring of the electoral process by citizens rejects...
Another interesting development on the eve of the election is the heated public debate about whether its vote or the presidential election boycott.
Several opposition have asked their members, the election of protest against the excessively restrictive electoral rules stay off, the Mubarak an enormous advantage vis-à-vis the other candidates give.
On the other hand, urges the strongest supposedly Einzelopposition in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, their supporters to vote and asks them to take a conscience, not any despotic ',' corrupt rulers to support.
This is a implicit but clear rejection Mubarak, the ruler of the last 24 years.
About 34 civil society organisations preparing despite repeated objections to the government of thousands of young Egyptians on the monitoring of elections.
These groups are of the opinion that national and international monitoring of the elections well should be no problem if the government anyway not plans to manipulate the ballot.
The regime kontert that any monitoring by foreign people a violation of the Egyptian sovereignty and national observers an affront to the integrity of judges would be.
This argument, however, was immediately away from the basis, as the Richtervereinigung their support of the civil observers were known.
Whether Mubarak-Regime because of the growing demands at home and abroad after free and fair elections in panic puts or whether it is simply incapable of the party gewohnheitsmäßigen abzugewöhnen fraud, the current signs of the election on Wednesday bad omens.
Meanwhile, the Egyptians see for the first time a exciting taste of resistance against the tyranny and enjoy some newly discovered area of freedom.
Europe Dollar-Neid
monetary focus not only commercial transactions but also diplomatic and political cat-fighting advised.
If that happens, economic transactions will be difficult and subject to greater uncertainty.
The politicization of money in the depression of the interwar was the impact economically devastating.
But it is also more recently quite unpleasant Währungskriegen has arrived.
In the 1960's became the international Financial Regulation in the centre of political haggling.
Each side had for what was going, quite different theories and statements.
The Europeans - especially the French - complained about what General Charles de Gaulle "exorbitant privilege 'of the US dollar mentioned.
The General and Finanz-Guru, Jacques Rueff, claimed that the US would the status of the dollar as Hauptreservewährung under the Bretton Woods regime fixed exchange rates use such to allow deficits and thus for their overseas military adventurism pay (then in Vietnam).
France responded with the reputation: financial reform, in order to put an end to the whole of the dollar, and tried largely discredited gold standard to revive.
The Europeans began a long discussion about the benefits of monetary union, with this achievement the dollar in the eyes look.
But the US position was the international role of the dollar a trap.
Other countries have been able to change their exchange rates and in this way for greater competitiveness in exports maintained.
The US Government was in the face of a undervalued Yen powerless and nährte belief, the rest of the world would the dollar used to America's productive base attack.
The government Nixon concluded that the only way to save the American economy was the monetary unilateralism, a drastic Geldausweitung that other countries are forced to adapt their exchange rates.
This long forgotten battles suddenly seem very topical again.
The world is no longer under the regime fixed exchange rates, but remains the dollar greater reserve currency - a kind of floatendes Bretton Woods.
For Americans, the role of the dollar as a reserve currency a potential threat, while Nicht-Amerikanern as a further case of American neo-imperial search for dominance seems.
In this decade China has taken the place that Japan held in the 1960's. It considers its exchange rates are low, provoke the growth of its exports.
Consequently, China aim of US complaints about unfair competition and its efforts to adapt the exchange rates to force the Americans would prevent, Chinese toys, equipment, and to buy clothes.
The manufacturers in the United States have decided that in China gefertigte Büstenhalter present a risk for the American way of life.
Meanwhile, the Europeans complain (particularly the French) on the great US-Defizit, and the argument de Gaulle ', that the rest of the world for America's wars has to pay back in fashion.
Some Europeans propose that the Asian central banks should a larger proportion of their reserves in euros keep. This is a response to the unsuccessful attempt, with the General America by buying gold against dollars in wanted to force their knees.
The 1960's ended with the collapse of the "system 'and greater financial turbulence. Added to this a inflationary increase of Güterpreise.
All have been damaged, and America's role in Weltangelegenheiten was shaken.
A similar collapse today would probably quite different effects yield.
The system floating exchange rates is now more and the burden of adaptation be distributed differently.
The most Americans do not suffer under the clear Dollarabsturz, since the seller from abroad their prices on the American market must adapt.
The Asian economies grow substantially and gather in their central demands of the United States.
They are likely to continue this policy, because the alternative a sudden setback for the competitiveness of its Ausfuhrsektoren on the extremely important American market now prefer to see.
This leaves the US time, its deficit, which is long term so cannot be maintained to address.
The economically dynamic regions of the world - North America and Asia - are in this way in a pact linked to what the central role of the American dollar still ensure.
The Americans will continue to accumulate debt, because the Asians wish of them.
The Pact to terminate, would be against the interests of both sides.
This is not a American unilateralism, because it is the cooperation with Asia means.
But for the Europeans, who are excluded from this pact, such as monetary and Wirtschaftsunilateralismus.
In the meantime provides the rise in the euro against the dollar for significant pain in the European Güterexporteuren.
Europe cannot do much to gain relief.
Indeed, Europe will in the new Währungskämpfen greater suffer.
answers, which have been trumpeted in the 1960's, the relaunch of the pre-World, or the introduction of a common European currency - seems not now to be very helpful.
A single common currency to have, as no significant protection proved.
Only the old form of European response - they could psychologists "Dollar-Neid" name - will increase.
It is appeals to the European Central Bank to extend the monetary basis, as would the imitation of the dollar is the answer to all industrial, demographic and structural problems that Europe toil.
But already brief reflection should remind us that Europe’s problems do not depend on Währungsmanipulationen.
The protest against the renewal of an exorbitant American Geldprivilegs should be seen as what it is: a way with the real European powerlessness accepting.
So it is in the Dollar-Neid remain, and he will increase if the value of the international greenbacks then is melting, and without clearly adverse impact on the people they print and use.
The disease of the political influence
Just as citizens of other countries around the world, the Americans have noted that the policy in the occupation of certain public offices plays an important role.
Few are surprised (although sometimes disillusioned), if the appointment of a high-level judge or diplomats after has been observation of its loyalty to certain political principles of the party of the President or Prime Minister takes place.
There is, however, almost complete agreement about the fact that the science a special position. The United States begin in this respect, however, to an ominous example for the rest of the world to develop.
appointments in the field of science should be on objective criteria such as education, skills and performance based.
Of course it is legitimate to future American Health to his opinion on the to consult abortion.
But it is totally inappropriate, members scientific Beraterstäbe a test of their political loyalty to undergo.
Similarly, the membership Peer-Review-Gremien - a central body for scientific progress - absolutely free of Beitrittshindernissen, not scientific qualifications in the context.
Unfortunately scientists increasingly in the United States with obstacles of this kind.
In the last autumn published the science journal Science several articles on this issue.
In one of these contributions, there was the complete reorganisation of Beratergremiums of the American National Centre for health and the environment, a subsidiary of the Centre for Krankheitskontrolle and prevention of conflicts (CDC), without prior consultation with the head of the institution.
Similar cases concerning the Lagos CDC Bleivergiftungen and prevention, and the Bioethikkommissionen advisory National Committee on Human Research Protections and advisory Committee on Genetic Testing.
The currently foot-and-mouth epidemic political influence in their wake Beratergremien be filled completely new and candidates will undergo a Loyalitätstest, for some observers to be an old hat.
officials in the American Ministry of Health call the "practice '.
Well, it is not the practice in America - at least it was not so far.
It is really worrying is certainly not that the Bush Administration candidates on their compatibility with their "values" examining.
The bedenklichste aspect of this development, as this profound ideological examination invaded in areas that previously immune to this kind of manipulation.
Perhaps the most glaring example of the spreading disease political influence was the reorganisation of a body on the American Institute for safety, with the financing of studies on breaches employed in the workplace.
Beratergremien were in the past, perhaps sometimes this kind of influence exposed.
After all, they recommend strategies to implement the politicians or not.
But for Studienfinanzierung competent bodies?
In October 2002 Science published an editorial by David Michaels and some of his colleagues.
For them it was former high-level officials, some of the bodies mentioned belonged. It is on the basis of their personal experience it provided valuable information on this issue.
Your contribution was a history, but what followed was interesting.
It came to a flood of letters, in which scientists of similar experiences reported.
A candidate for the Koordinationsausschuss of the American Institute of Health research of muscular told, as a staff of the White House was reviewed.
After their opinion on various strategies of the Bush administration had made inquiries, not something with the work of the committee had to do, it was asked whether the President's policy on embryonic stem cells support.
Another sender, a renowned professor of psychiatry and psychology, reported by a telephone call from the White House, in which it on his nomination for the US National Council against drug abuse informed.
The Anrufer stated that he should have review, "to determine whether he any views represent, the unpleasant for the President would be".
According to the comments made by the professor, he was asked a number of questions, with the officials of the White House constantly a scoreboard rose.
One example: 'You have now two out of three points. The President without taking account of the consequences of moral reasons against Nadelaustauschprogramme [for addicts of intravenous drugs consumed]. "
Then the survey adopted a change unerfreulichere.
The officials asked the candidates, whether he Bush might have chosen and he told that this was not the case, he set: "Why did you not the President supported?"
This is in line with the procedure in dictatorships and not in democracies.
Scientific Beratergremien are there, balanced and thoughtful advice to make for the policy.
If the desired political outcome first and foremost, so that has gained nothing, but much lost.
For this reason was the decision to support what research projects are always a matter of objective evaluation by peers and not by politicians.
Indeed, the demands in this respect leading American law, the Federal advisory Committee Act - that balanced bodies must be composed and the "appointed authority must not be unduly influenced."
The American Health Tommy Thompson and the resources of the White House should for the rest of the world an example here.
This is very simple: By followed the law.
murder in Moscow
It is time to clear up the fiction, whereby the postcommunist Russia by Vladimir Putin "dictatorship of law" less would become unlawfully.
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of the most courageous and best Russia’s journalists, a woman who dared to the brutal killings of Russian troops in Chechnya to the public, is the last proof that President Putin no more than an ordinary dictatorship established, with all the accompanying usual disregard for the law.
This recognition for the world in time, especially for Europe.
The German Foreign Minister just working on a strategy for the Russian-German relations, in which the indifference towards Putin’s lawlessness as the national interest of the powerful member of the European Union should be established.
This indifference is to ‘Old, if they are encouraged Putin, its lawless methods on the international scene to move, as currently in its campaign to ruining Georgia economically.
The murder of Politkovskaya’s unheimliches has triggered vu: how to those times when the KGB at the height of its power was to disappear in Putin's Russia simply people.
The killing Politkovskaya is the third politically flavoured murder within three weeks.
Enwer Siganschin Chefingenieur BP, Russia was on 30 September in Irkutsk shot.
Andrey Kozlov, Deputy Governor of the Russian Central Bank, just a campaign against financial fraud led, was murdered on 14 September.
The fact that the Russian Attorney-General Yuri Tschajka as in the case of Kozlow studies in the murder of Politkovskaya’s took no reason to great hopes, as in real democracies of the case, if high Justizkreise representatives involved.
Indeed, the involvement at the highest Russian government almost a guarantee that the murderers never be taken.
The murder of Mrs Politkovskaya is a particularly grim omen, given that it is one of the most powerful Kritikerinnen the Russian president was.
In its articles for the last independent newspapers in Moscow, Novaya Gazeta, and in its books "Putin's Russia" and "Chechnya. The truth about the war" wrote Politkovskaya’s on the waning freedom, a distinctive feature of Putin's presidency.
Both the expulsion of the previous Medienzaren Boris Beresowsky and Vladimir Gusinsky and the detention of oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky show what Putin’s enemies approaching: exile, detention or the grave.
I accuse Putin's government, not Politkovskaya’s killed on a Auftragsmörder.
As Enthüllungsjournalistin Politkovskaya’s, not only in Putin, but also in many other unpopular, not least in the current Chechen Prime Minister Ramsan Kadyrov, accused, a policy of kidnappings for ransom to pursue.
But even if Vladimir Putin people with the murder of Politkovskaya’s in the lift their gates in the centre of Moscow have nothing to do, created Putin's contempt for the laws the climate in which this murder happened.
Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in the Cathedral of Canterbury many centuries before this was clearly crimes committed in the belief that the King would fallen.
Given for what was Politkovskaya’s -- for the responsibility of a democratic press, the Kremlin and its policy to probe -- the government would ensure that the journalist no trace evil.
Putin's Russia has in the last six years already 12 leading journalists lost by murder.
None of these crimes has been clarified. would be different if Putin's "dictatorship of law," would be more than a strategy.
The six years since Vladimir Putin's appearance in the Kremlin were a time deeply contradictory signals.
On the one hand, the world is looking at a young, educated leader, which promises to modernize Russia and the country, especially in terms of enforcement and judicial practice closer to international standards.
On the other hand, the President sees silence, if his former colleagues in the Russian security FSB (the former KGB) of the life and limb fear offer no security and a number of notorious Spionagefälle against journalists, scientists and environmentalists into roles.
One of these "Neo-Spionen" count the journalist Grigory Pasko, the Waffenkontrollexperte Igor Sutjagin, the diplomat Valentin Moisejew, the physicist Valentin Danilow and others.
The alleged civilizing influence the role of Russia as a partner of the West -- such as his presidency at the G8 summit in St. Petersburg -- appears Putin’s Kreml-Kabale any effect failed.
The confrontation with western values has again a Potemkin village to light. Russia presents a facade of legislation and democratic institutions, behind this scene prevail, however, the same Rohlinge arbitrary manner.
The danger for this world is that Putin's lawlessness exports.
Throughout the near abroad takes up a form of kriminalisierter diplomacy.
We see in this context Putin's attempt to manipulate the presidential election in Ukraine or regularly raised and again withdrawn criminal charges against the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko.
Consider the situation in the breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia, that is, because the Kremlin supported.
We consider, as the Kremlin is trying to blackmail its neighbours, by placing it threatens their energy supply.
Every policeman knows that criminals are increasingly impudent, when criminal behaviour is ignored.
It is high time that the world as Vladimir Putin recognizes that what it is: a man of Russia again in the darkness leads.
The whole world must the old Latin principle remember qui tacet consentire videtur -- who seems silent, approve -- and it must ask itself whether it is wise to the formation of a lawless superpower by Putin silence to tolerate.
Russia's pipeline to empire
Gerhard Schröder, less than a month ago German Chancellor, has agreed to the company Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender Gas-Pipeline Russia through the Baltic to Germany and further building by Western Europe.
In many countries would Schroeder now because of an inherent conflict of interest are the process.
His obvious moral rivalries will be reinforced by the fact that Russia, particularly in this moment threatening to remedy the gas of Ukraine, if the country is not the state Preisforderungen Gasgiganten the Kremlin, Gazprom, complies.
Russia's strategic task is obvious: Ukraine starve to cut off gas supplies also means Europe’s gas largely limit, because some of the largest European pipelines through Ukraine.
By Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic states, of course, be circumvented, the new pipeline promises the Kremlin even greater influence, during this regional trying to say.
President Vladimir Putin and his government from former KGB must the decision, how hard it Russia’s postcommunist neighbors exclude, no more concerned about Western Europe.
If Europe Putin actually with this new imperial weapon resources?
Worse still, Russia could perhaps this weapon against a energy obvious address EU?
The fact that a German Ex-Kanzler companies, Russia is a means for could give to manipulate the EU’s economy, shows Europe’s dangerous indifference in the face of Putin's neoimperialistischer ambitions.
Undoubtedly, Russia's media about the growing European dependence on Russian energy aware of this.
They even exuberance: we After our Community gas companies have increased and unified, write Russian Leitartikler, Europe will to mention human rights.
Putin this attitude indirectly by his commitment expressed, he called "independent" policy.
Among he understands that Russia from the moral and human rights concerns of Western democracies' independent '.
Perhaps believe some European leaders actually, maintaining the cozy prosperity of the Union justified our silence on human rights and other issues that the Kremlin inconvenient.
Of course, we can, in short, to "business affairs position, as expropriation of Yukos, but if the Kremlin our values or criticism of Russian misdeeds -- for example, in blood-stained Chechnya -- with a price realm, the Europeans seem to be more prepared to keep their mouths shut, as the possibility of higher energy prices or even a blockade, as it is imminent of Ukraine, buying.
While Putin its Court umbildet and the Duma assumed his desire, should the EU hopes for a growing "Europeanisation 'Russia’s abandoned.
Russia, which is built Putin, from the post-Soviet hopes of freedom in oil and Gasbollwerk for his new model of the former KGB-Elite transformed.
In fact, Matthias Warnig, the Director-General of the Pipeline-Konsortiums, Schröder will chair, an old friend Putin.
The Wall Street Journal was reported in this year, that Warnig the branch of the Russian bank opens Dresden, the officer Stasi, the eastern secret police, and Putin in the late 1980s seen as the Russian President in East Germany as ex-KGB was stationed.
The fact that the Russians a government from former KGB-Mitarbeitern tolerate, for the lack of sympathy and intolerance towards differing opinions the norm, reflects their exhaustion of commotion in the last 20 years reflects.
Now the Kremlin appears to think that what for ordinary Russians is good, and also for independent nations is good: small and weak countries towards no mercy demonstrated, when Russia receives the tools to intimidate them to isolate and them with the prospect of a Energiesperre to threaten.
As a former Head of State of the newly independent Lithuania, I have often receive such threats.
The EU has many agreements signed with Russia, including one for a "common space" for freedom and justice.
The Kremlin well able to counterfeit such a idealism.
His control of Eastern Europe was always on the basis of "Freundschaftsverträgen" invoked, and the Soviet invasions Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were "fraternal 'operations.
But look, as Putin this "common" area abused: barbaric treatment of the Chechens, the businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky in prison, foreign NGOs in trouble, one of the Mitanführerinnen the Orange Revolution of last year, Yuliya Tymoshenko, Russian Militärstaatsanwälten for imaginary accusations accused.
If Europeans their common area for human rights and freedoms seriously, they must recognise that these values are not computational Pöstcheninhabern in Putin's Kremlin shared.
The same applies, if Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism is seen.
Is it really imagine that the country of the "Red Terror" with countless unpunished crime from the Soviet-era, whose trail of Lithuania to prefers in the Caucasus, reliable support offers, Iran and North Korea stop to threaten the world?
It seems likely that the Kremlin kalkulierenden heads every crisis merely as an opportunity to exploit their power and destructive to expand its influence.
For decades, was my European region at the mercy of evil.
Therefore, I cannot relax silence, while Europe is blind in a new hineinstolpert appeasement.
We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe were taught by our heritage, that behind every diplomatic action Russia’s hide imperial ambitions.
The Western Europeans, which this heritage was spared, should heed our warnings.
The dependence on Russia -- even if they are now with the face of supposedly 'charismatic "Gerhard Schröder presented -- leads only in the abyss.
bullets and elections in Iraq
As the war in Iraq began in 2003, followed the Bush administration very ambitious plans: how in Germany and Japan after 1945 was a long and peaceful occupation planned, while the expanding oil should secure rising prosperity and democratic structures built piece for piece would be.
The basis should be a liberal, even post-modern Constitution, the women 25% of the seats in Parliament guaranteed.
In Iraq today, there is no peace and no prosperity.
The Constitution, which will be voted on 15 October, contains the 25% rule, otherwise but it is far from liberal.
The Schlüsselbestimmung (Article 2), that no law "the undisputed rules of Islam must contradict ', goes against the fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty and will prevent the legislation to comply with international standards.
For example, the age of sexual maturity in girls do not set on nine years, because Mohammed itself nine years old woman had.
As a result, nine girls in criminal law also as adults apply and subject to the death penalty, for example for the Übertritt other religion.
In the wider context the Shia their ayatollahs through this provision, as in Iran on the elected parliament, because this alone have the right to 'establishing rules of Islam.
Outsiders and the few Iraqi Liberals mainly on this provision Islamic concerns, but the widespread Sunni resistance against the Constitution is directed against other provisions: the exclusion of the "saddamistischen Baath Party 'from the political life and from the government and the federalist provisions to the Iraqi 18 provinces give autonomy and allow them to regional governments band together to form.
The Ausschlussregel is a personal matter for the Sunni elite -- including thousands of businessmen, professionals and even artists, because until few exceptions, they were all Baath-Mitglieder.
Theoretically, could the ban in the Constitution be interpreted in such a way that it only applies to the future.
But in practice the regulations currently applied so that so-called "high-level" Baath-Mitglieder of any governance are excluded, and are affected thousands.
The Sunnis would the federalist provisions probably accept, if only for the Kurds specific.
You know that the alternative is not the return to centralism, but the secession of the three largely Dahuk Kurdish provinces, ace Arbil and Sulaymaniyah of an independent Kurdistan with their own Treasury, army (the) and Peschmerga Kirkuk oil -- with the second largest reserves in Iraq -- to base.
The Sunnis reject the same federalism for the Shia, because they consider related Arabs, the Sunni rule have always accepted in the past, and do so again -- unless they get their own government.
This would enable the new Constitution, because the provinces with Shiite majority in the south, the largest part of the Iraqi oil reserves have their own regional government could form.
In the usual Nahost-Stil threatening Sunnitenführer disappointing, dissatisfied with the Constitution, with violence.
But not federalism is the reason why Sunni extremists and Islamists commit lethal attacks.
Your opposition is fundamental: you accept the principle of democratic Mehrheitsregierung not.
Instead, they want the rule by the Sunni minority restore.
For the Islamists all Shia deserve the death anyway, just as apostates.
One of the Shiite leaders, Muqtada Sadr, speaks also vehemently opposed to federalism.
Its supporters are mostly uneducated, poorest and violent Shia from the slums of Baghdad and environment, whose "Mahdi-Milizen" 2004 itself against the American troops weiterkämpften than the Americans Shia before Sunni attackers protected.
As a very young priest, his authority of his late Ayatollah-Vater -- even a populist -- derived, faces Sadr on the resistance of living ayatollahs of Iraq, his ignorance and brutality ignored.
As regards the religious authority, Sadr it impossible include with them, and that is why it takes a arabisch-nationalistische stance against them and often recalls that the highest Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Sistani, was Persians, and no Arabs.
In the same way he calls his supporters remembered that the El Hakims the Supreme Council for the Islamic revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) mention, and their "Badr-Milizen" subsidised exiles in Iran, of which many in the long and bitter Iran-Iraq fought for Iran, until the Americans' they have returned. "
Sadr against the federalism, because a regional Shiite government its enemies Sistani and would obey the SCIRI and, he says, under putting Iranian influence.
In order to highlight its message, Sadr sent his men to attack the Badr-Milizen of what it in Baghdad, where the Mahdi are numerous, managed, in Najaf, where Sadr after the last year caused destruction hated, but it was unsuccessful -- until his men were massacred by the Americans.
It was bad enough, with Sadr as bandits to be completed, but now that it will make to a simple political bill that he probably the central figure for the outcome of the elections to the Constitution in October.
To reject the Constitution and elections to impose a National Assembly, the opponents need a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces.
The Sunnis win probably only in two provinces, but if Sadr his supporters in the slums of Baghdad dictate, together with the local Sunnis vote 'no', which would probably the capital for the ‘no’ decide what the rejection of the Constitution would guarantee.
As a political crook Sadr course ready to be bought.
Last year it was because of murder sought.
Now he wants to be recognised as a statesman, he wants and money, at least implicitly, the humiliation Sistanis and SCIRI.
He will probably receive offers, perhaps the bargaining has already begun.
But some Shia, which he with words and bullets attack, thousands of gunmen among themselves and believe that it only bullets should be offered.
The decline of the secret police
As Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany discover, as a aufgezeichnetes acknowledgement that his government lied, led to riots, openness in Eastern Europe new democracies not always easy.
Just as Hungary, Romania has tried to Communism, transparency and honesty in a previously to increase verschlossensten societies in the world.
While we are zealous, the continued secrecy led to a sudden extension of corruption and malpractice.
But it has finally -- a real movement towards greater openness. This progress has been recognised by the European Union, when it Romania’s accession to the European Union at the beginning of 2007 was green light.
Apart from achieving what the EU now for a "functioning market economy" considers that there are major political and legal changes, as a Minister for Justice supervised and include different areas such as increased transparency and control in the creation of political parties or the complete reversal of the judiciary.
judicial reforms, in turn, help to eradicate corruption.
Against former and current cabinet ministers, Members, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police, customs officials, other employees of public service and directors of private companies was charges.
Moreover, were introduced new standardised forms, on which every official position in the government, in Parliament, in the public or local administration or judicial holding assets and should indicate its financial interests.
The new statements are detailed in Europe, and, above all, it will be published.
Romania's progress in this month published report confirms, which shows that the citizens' access to public information in Eastern Europe is now as well as in ancient democracies.
Indeed, the report suggests Transparency and Silence (transparency and silence), the Open Society Justice initiative (Rechtsinitiative for an open society, www.justiceinitiative.org) was drafted, point out that the new democracies the old something in some cases teach: Certain state authorities in Romania were more cheek of citizens than comparable authorities in France or Spain.
Particularly in Romania 60% of the archivierten answered questions, compared with 31% in France and 24% in Spain.
Among the other countries, abschnitten well, were also Peru and Mexico, both in 2002, shortly after Romania, laws informed public institutions adopted.
But Übergangsdemokratien it is not always easier to reach sensitive information, as I do from my previous job as Menschenrechtsanwältin in the Romanian Helsinki Committee knows.
Often we had before the courts draw on Romania’s law on information from 2001 to impose the publication of information.
Even if, for example, we had won a case in which access to the record phone-tapping telephone conversations which was approved by the Attorney-General were ignored the prosecutor simply the court decisions.
We ranged Zivilklage against the prosecutor and judges imposed a fine for every day that withholding information.
But only when we media attention, we got the data -- which stated, as many Lauschangriffe in the previous ten years had been approved, against whom they are addressed and how long.
With the publication of Romania has started its past Securitate-beherrschten to distance.
Now, since I myself sit in the government, I am aware that it is sometimes difficult to information to share with the public.
But if painful reforms are necessary, there is no alternative.
We have the economic and political reforms, which we qualify for membership, have not been able to enforce, if we do not policy exposed to the monitoring of the public and had increased public participation in the decision-making, with this openness inevitably accompanied, had not accepted.
This is even an indispensable condition of democratic governments in the world has become.
When the United States 1966 their law informed public institutions decided that they were in the exclusive society Sweden and Finland.
Today 65 countries such a law.
In Romania, those who fought for a law on information, this fully exhausted.
As parts of the study of the Justice initiative shows that were cheek to the Romanian Government readily answered and information issued, whose publication would have been unthinkable a few years ago.
The Romanian Defense Ministry published, for example, the number of troops who died in 2003, and the causes of death (including 13 suicides, two executions and two deaths in the use in Afghanistan).
Similarly, the Court of Bucharest asked about the number of judges, since the beginning of 2000 had received penalties, including the reasons for possibly imposed sanctions.
The court communicated to the question the Supreme Richterrat, gave a complete answer: a quadripartite list of all sanctioned judges, with details on the reasons and penalties.
Such information is both a product of the continued reforms and a motor for this.
It was not always convenient for the government, and still is a tug-of-war on confidential documents in progress.
However, the benefits of transparency in the former Eastern bloc has brought, cannot be denied.
At the same time, show Romania’s experience that the confidentiality of the authorities as a threat to the deeply-held values democratic regimes and that both established and young democracies only permanent vigilance preventing this secretiveness creeps again.
The saving the Lebensbäume
Nobody is by the day, without using a product from a forest dates.
In much more than most people realise the paper on which we write, the water from our Mrs flows, the medicines, which we cure, the wood, from which we are building our houses and furniture, from the forest.
forests provide us with the fresh air we breathe, and provide habitats for endangered species.
They offer us voluntary, in our complex world increasingly important.
About 1.5 billion of the poorer rural in the world are directly dependent on forests, their basic needs to meet food and firewood.
Nevertheless, the deforestation goes further.
Every year we lose 14.6 million hectares of forest -- an area around four times as great as Switzerland.
Loose forest management, lax state rules and enforcement will be strengthened, and markets, the illegal logging reward robbing the world currently together their most valuable and most vulnerable forests.
Once forests begin to disappear, usually follow any amount of environmental, social and economic evil, which we all different kinds of concern.
The Indonesian island of Sumatra is a good example.
cellulose and Papierunternehmen currently pursue the unbridled and illegal destruction of forests, the richest Pflanzenvielfalt contained in the world.
It is likely that still not discovered plants and endangered species such as the Sumatranashorn Sumatra-Elefant or Orang-Utan will disappear.
If the forests Sumatras disappear, the people of whole communities without a proper shelter and without a decent earning one's living reflected.
Moreover, arising from the distortion of global markets by the trade in illegally and cheap products produced disadvantages for responsible companies.
By illegal logging go developing countries annual tax revenues level of $15 billion lost.
the situation by the fact that the demand for wood for reconstruction following the tsunami last year, the already unsustainable requirements of Sumatras forests more.
Similar threats to forests and Amazonas- Congo Basin clear.
The recent Millennium-Ökosystemstudie the United Nations (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, MA) shows that forests in these and other critical regions because of mismanagement and worrying decline further disappear, if not serious measures to be taken.
From the Brazilian Government information shows that deforestation of the irreplaceable Amazonian (including through the transformation of agricultural land) in the last year to 2.6 million hectares has increased, what the deforested land area of the Amazon rise to 17% leaves.
But the fight against deforestation is not lost.
Various organizations, environmentalists and societies, the state of the forests worldwide ensure that currently close together to reverse the deforestation and to improve the forest management.
For example, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the World Bank Brazil's government support, an initiative to launch over 17 million hectares of new protected forests has been converted into national parks.
The alliance from WWF and the World Bank has its partners also led to establish a Trust, these protected areas to administer permanently.
Similarly, arose from a summit between the leaders of the countries in the Congo Basin an extraordinary, cross-border cooperation for Forest and responsible management.
This, in turn, led to an initiative of the Foreign Ministry of the United States to promote the forests in Congo with a budget of $53 million.
Since the first meeting of the leaders in 1999 in the Congo Basin 3.5 million hectares created new areas of natural beauty.
In view of the effects of the tsunami in Asia last December, and given the weight of the MA submitted data and Entwaldungsstatistiken from the main forest areas nevertheless our efforts must be continued.
The World Bank and the WWF recently assured that they work together, the global Entwaldungsrate 10% by 2010 to reduce, and that it with other public and private institutions will cooperate, ambitious targets at the Forest to implement.
WWF-Studien show that we consumption to cover Waldprodukten and, at the same time, important environmental and social values in the foreseeable future retain, if the global forest resources types and various uses be allocated, including nature reserves, responsibly managed commercial and Nutzwäldern aufgeforsteten Waldlandschaften again.
businessmen, governments and NGOs must its role in implementing this vision exercise.
Are the Saudis fanatics?
Terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia not only have led to the opportunities of the Weiterbestandes the ruling al-Saud royal house into question, but also raised the question of whether this Kingdom a fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive state.
It seems as if the Saudi society a wave of violent had produced fanaticism, its inspiration from the extreme religious orthodoxy refers.
The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States were Saudi Arabia, strengthened the long accepts view that the Kingdom would be a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.
In some way, inspire also true, but as a whole can do not on the broad public in Saudi Arabia transfer.
On the contrary, it would be a serious mistake to believe that the attitude of the Saudis towards the religion completely fanatical Islamism is defined.
Between 2001 and 2003, I was a team in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, in Iran and in Jordan an extensive Wertestudie conducted.
Our results show a remarkably nuanced picture of the Werthaltungen in Saudi Arabia.
Compared to the people interviewed in countries of the Middle East, were Saudi-Araber in general less religious and their attitudes to issues such as democracy and arranged marriages reveal a moderate undertone.
Of course, the religiosity in all four countries strongly enshrined as 90% of respondents gave them to God, a life after the death and heaven and hell believe.
But the Saudis seem to be less religious, when the Muslims in other countries.
In comparison to 82% of Iranians, 85% of Jordanians and 98% of Egyptians describe only 62% of the Saudis as religious.
Even the Americans seem far religious than Saudi-Araber, and America declare, 81% as religiously.
Some may these country-specific derogations due to differences, as defined religiosity.
For example, the Americans define religiosity may unlike people from the Middle East, and Americans may have a weaker attachment to their faith as people in Islamic countries.
Some could thus also declared differences between the Muslim countries.
However, the discrepancy in terms of selbst-definierten religiosity between the Saudis on the one hand and the Iranians, Jordanians and Egyptians on the other side so great that it is the predominant idea of Saudi Arabia as highly conservative and religious society into question.
Indeed, the practice speaks a clearer language than mere words: Only 28% of the Saudis, gave weekly attend worship while 27% of Iranians, 44% of Jordanians, 42% of Egyptians and 45% of Americans known.
Although these results of the conventional view of contradict the Saudi culture, they are less surprising than it appears.
Religionssoziologen have long argued that the general religiosity declines, if the environment dominated religious or religious institutions too are associated with the state.
If state authorities to set strict rules of engagement, people tend to rebellion and distancing themselves from officially sanctioned religious institutions.
So it is no surprise that Egyptians and Jordanians in the countries live without state prescribed piety, religious than Iranians or Saudi-Araber, with the state supported 'Tugendpolizei must live.
Even in the issue of marriage took surprisingly many Saudis Liberal views.
On the issue arranged marriages arose an almost balanced distribution. Half of respondents was of the opinion that a marriage after consultation among the parents closed, while 48% love as the basis for a marriage privileged.
Given the deep gender segregation and the domination of the Patriarchate seems this result is a strong need for more individual choice to reveal decisions, which traditionally fall to the family.
Finally, proved the Saudis as a strong supporter of democracy, which is again in contradiction to the general idea of Saudi conservatism.
For 58% of all questioned Saudis democracy is the best form of government, 23% were not of this opinion and 18% is not expressed.
The fact that in a country in which there is no secular and nationalist tradition, a majority for democracy happens, seems illogical.
Indeed, the affirmation of democracy with a number of other liberal attitudes in connection that we in Saudi Arabia found.
Advocates of democracy tend to less religiosity, more secularism, more tolerance towards others, a critical assessment of the polity and greater concern about the Western Kulturinvasion.
Beyond the surveys has emerged in the course of history, that liberal ideas to gain popularity, if a country of a despotic monarch and the religious establishment is governed.
So developed in the late 19th century in Ottoman Syria is a strong liberal trend as a response to the religious despotism of Sultan Abdulhamid.
At the same time unfolded in Iran antiklerikale secular movement in the name of constitutionalism - as a response to the absolutist alliance between the Kadscharen-Dynastie Shah and the religious establishment.
Given these similarities between historical precedents and the current situation in Saudi Arabia, we should the possibility of reforms do not exclude.
Today Umfragedaten show that the Saudis start could well, greater transparency in the policy and a less interventionist religion to demand.
Europe Museum
In the late 19th century Europe regarded Asia largely either as a source of inspiration for his artists or as a focus of its imperial ambitions.
The Asians, on the other hand, saw Europe either, as in Japan during the Meiji-Zeit, as a model of modernity or, as in China as a barometer of the deterioration.
A century later the Japanese miracle had the image of the Europeans at least a small part of Asia to a place industrial and technological progress transformed.
Currently, in the first years of the 21st century, changing the way in which Europe in Asia and Asia in Europe are perceived drastically, Asia economies and flourishes, while the European Union a deep identity and Zuversichtskrise experiencing.
Prominent Asians, such as the former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, warn the Europeans that now -- they should retain its previous course -- Europe quickly in all areas, except tourism and high-quality property should be irrelevant.
A well-known Chinese businessman, his time between Hong Kong and London dividing, expressed even more clear.
At a meeting private entrepreneurs leaders and politicians in Paris some weeks ago, he said: 'Your Europeans you become a third world country. your spends your time with the wrong issues -- constitution, welfare, pensions crisis -- and their systematically give the wrong answers to the questions it aufwerft. "
Europe's views on Asia in general and China in particular are complex and rich hellsichtigen adaptation to a new and respected competitors to purely ideological justified rejection.
As in May 1968 in France, the students on the streets were, in order to invent a new world, they dreamt (or at least some of them) by the Maoist China -- a China, in the middle of the brutal and senseless Cultural Revolution was.
Their absurd and bizarre 'Betörtheit was as much a product of their ignorance of the crimes of Mao as the result of boredom within a prosperous society, in which unemployment was practically unknown.
By contrast, their heirs criticise today open the capitalist Asian model.
Yesterday, China was a anti-capitalist lodestar for utopian revolutionaries; today it has become a ultra-liberal Nemesis for a new generation utopian reactionaries developed -- the defenders of the status quo in Europe.
The recently in the streets of Paris wild-eyed students do not want to be as Indians and Chinese; they reject the logic of globalisation and refuse to their hard-won social guarantees abandon.
Europe's Wirtschaftseliten China and India significantly different true.
They are now fully aware that their easily post-colonial's Nostalgic view of these countries as a major export markets and comprehensive reservoirs cheap labour obsolete.
China and Inden have become real competitors, which deserve respect, if not sheer awe.
Quality, costs and lead times in automobiles around now rich in approaching the European level.
Europe has an advantage in terms of theoretical sciences received, such as the pharmaceutical industry, but evolving Weltklasseunternehmen particularly in India are increasingly able to graduates from M.I.T. or from Harvard to recruit whilst their lower labour costs and thus to maintain its global competitiveness.
Unfortunately, the political leaders of Europe from Asia outgoing challenge recognised, but it failed to this as a Realitätstest within the irresistible process of globalisation and -- in social and economic terms -- than Waffenruf to use.
Indeed, we can balanced consideration to say that the European politicians, few exceptions, such as Tony Blair apart, their view of the world too slowly to the revolutionary speed of change in Asia adapted.
Trapped between its lack of a long-term strategic vision and their fixation on short-term interests, have political leaders of Europe largely failed to respect its Asian colleagues to acquire -- contrary to European companies, the Asians much eminent.
Of course, the EU will in Asia -- a continent that far it has failed to bury its past and the ghosts of nationalism the door to show -- often as a model of reconciliation, peace and prosperity considered.
But this perception will survive if Europe's performance declines further?
Perhaps the Asians, the European model as a kind of political Venice to see -- a place that visited nostalgic his previous Glorie cling and its museumsartigen nature because admired.
The Red and the Blue
The replacement Colin Powell as Secretary by Condoleezza Rice shows that America's last presidential election remains strong reverberations arising produced.
But it is not only important for Americans to understand what this election on America says, but also for the world.
This year's presidential election demonstrates that America has a healthy democracy, but also that some things could be better.
In contrast to the election of 2000, President Bush's majority failed and the vote in the electoral college just won, he won this time with a margin of 3.5 million votes.
Although some democrats remain bitter, there are few serious doubts about the legitimacy of Bush's victory.
America remains divided in red States (Republicans) and blue states (democrats).
If 100 000 votes in the red state changed Ohio, John Kerry would President (albeit with a minority of popular vote).
This was electoral college in America's Constitution included, small states in a federal system to protect, now it means, however, that the campaign in particular around a dozen disputed states concentrated in which public opinion is divided.
Another fundamental issue is that it seems rude, President without the majority of the popular vote to choose.
It is therefore time for a serious discussion on a constitutional amendment on the abolition of the college.
Some observers also complain about the polarizing, negative rhetoric and advertising campaign.
But this should be a historical perspective.
At the time of the founding fathers newspapers were extremely biased, and George Washington was dismayed by the intensity of the political language.
In his early history was the country for a long time in equally narrow majorities divided as today -- without only on the time of civil war and reconstruction respond. The harsh rhetoric of the campaign was reflects how closely the battle.
At the same time, raised the three nationwide broadcast discussions, despite the negative campaigning on both sides important points in a serious format and were pursued in large.
In general, it is likely that a President-in-Office in re-elected growing economy.
In this sense, surprised to Bush's re-election, how low its majority.
This is largely due to the unpopularity of the Iraq war.
Kerry tried to the war, the slow job creation, inadequate healthcare and Bush's tax cuts for groups with higher incomes to the central points of the campaign, but some observers had the feeling that of which never showed a clear message.
Bush konterte with safety in relation to terrorism and Kulturpopulismus on issues such as Homo-Ehe and Abtreibungsrecht.
At the end stachen security and Kulturpopulismus Wirtschaftspopulismus.
The interpretation of the election was (after the vote conducted) interviews influenced, in which the voters were asked what issues were most them.
The majority (22%) replied "moral values" in relation to 20%, called the economy, and 19%, which have claimed terrorism.
Conservative social affairs politicians suggested these results so that they choice for Bush have won and that its programme its next term should dominate.
But indicated a Pew, a week after the election was held, point out that the category of "moral values" alongside Abtreibungsrecht and Homo-Ehe a long topic included.
Indeed, surveys show that 25% of the population support the Homo-Ehe and 35% legal eheähnliche communities for homosexual couples (the Kerry position) support.
Yet applies to the 37% against the Homo-Ehe, particularly in the red centre of the country, that the issue of mobilising Bush-Anhänger paved for the elections.
An important question is whether the United States are hopelessly divided.
The geographical voter’s with red and blue states led to Internet-Witzen and comic strip on the two blue coasts, the red secede do! centre of the country.
Some call this' Coastopia '.
The separation, however, is not so clear.
In both camps many states only won by narrow majority. Färbt the card at the level of the cantons, and not the Member States, a large part of the country rather blue.
"cities against suburbs and rural areas' describes the conditions better than 'coast against" centre.
Indeed, public opinion polls show that most Americans moderate in the middle of the political spectrum collect, and not to the external two margins.
But tend political elites, such as activists and congressmen, to be extreme than the public.
This seems first confusing, because it is an incentive for, in the middle stimmenreichen to move.
But many congressmen represent districts, the parties are safe, and their re-election is threatened by intra-party elections, the aktivistischeren and extreme Parteiflügeln governed.
That tendency is reinforced by the spread of cable, which viewers through controversial "Infotainment-Sendungen" investment--without, and Internet-Blogger bitter controversies without any editorial filters involved.
reforms to change the borders of the Kongressbezirke to competition in them to strengthen, would help to improve the problem but few acting Congressmen voting for amendments that the risk of their defeat increase in circumstances.
The narrow outcome suggests that Bush less was elected for change, when he seems to believe.
Given the difficult issues in the foreign, fiscal and social policy, it would be wise of him to more address the centre than to soften his conservative basis but remains unclear whether a policy of convictions or of pragmatism will prevail.
liberation from the dependence on oil
Chancellor Angela Merkel raise the climate of high priority on Germany's agenda for his EU and G-8-Präsidentschaften given to begin in January.
This is a concrete proposal, so general that the political leaders in the world to consider and can accept and so clear that other governments and companies can take it up: simply at the next G8 summit set a date from the benzinbetriebene cars in large industrialized countries are not allowed.
Such a decision would have a clear positive economic and geopolitical effect.
The real reason for the current Energiesorgen are not the dwindling world's reserves, but rather that the domestic output by the Spitzenverbraucher -- Europe, the United States and China -- at the very moment will fall, in which the Asian growing demand the market under pressure.
available reserves are increasingly concentrated in the Middle East, because the deposits in all other regions simply exhausted faster.
Moreover, the big Ölexporteure are not prepared to their investment policy to the requirements of the market subordinate.
Saudi Arabia is endeavouring, whatever to pursue its output, while Iran potential investors with bureaucracy and corruption discourage.
Iraq is suffering from a lack of security and foreign investors in Russia is constantly a net by the bill.
These four countries have half of the world's confirmed reserves and two thirds of what potentially could be exported.
All this, not the production costs, high oil prices and the fight to Ölverträge in Central Asia and Africa underlying.
In the adoption, high oil prices are good, because they serve the environment, some basic facts of international politics overlooked.
Firstly make oil imports in many of the poorest African and Asian countries have a significantly higher proportion of spending than in industrial countries, which means that economic growth and social development are at risk, while new debt-crisis emerge.
proceeds from the oil hamper reforms in the large countries exporting.
Thanks to their well-oiled financial strength feel regimes such as those in Venezuela and in Iran is becoming less and less linked to international rules.
laggard under the consuming nations, such as China, are known, condoning violations of human rights, lucrative business with authoritarian, oil-rich regime to secure and succeeded in imitating the former habits of the industrialised West.
Only the political and economic heavyweights in the world, the major industrialized nations, which remains the vast consumers of hydrocarbons, can change at global level set in motion.
The change must begin in the transport sector, for half of the current oil is responsible -- a percentage that in future will probably increase.
The G-8-Länder should therefore agree, by 2025 in any new cars to allow benzinbetriebene.
This decision would not turn against the individual mobility, but against the waste of scarce raw material, the urgent needed to establish synthetic materials.
The political leaders should not certain technology prefer.
Instead, they should create incentives for the automobile industry to develop alternative technologies on fuel from biomass, Ethylen hydrogen, and during a transitional period even based gas.
Countries that a political pioneering role, the domestic industry, as an additional benefit, a leader in the energy technology and give secure future markets.
The likely substantial reduction of CO2 emissions could finally bring the breakthrough in international climate policy is necessary.
But the economic development comes into play: curing our "dependence" from oil would poorer, less developed and emerging more of them, and the prices down and defuse the geopolitical Energiewettbewerb.
geopolitical benefits would be similar obviously, since the ability of the great Ölexporteure to blackmail the industrialised countries would substantially lower.
This could be the negotiating position of the international community in the Middle East and possibly improve the social forces in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia strengthen the serious political and economic reforms aspire from within.
As technologically highly sophisticated country and one of the big car manufacturers Germany is well positioned to reach such an initiative.
Merkel, promoviert physics and their political career as Environment Minister has begun -- they chaired 1995 at the first conference of the Klima-Rahmenkonvention the UN -- has perhaps more credibility in the addressed this issue than any other their EU and G-8-Kollegen.
The time for a courageous action out of the leadership has arrived.
The myth of trade and aid
trade and aid have become international Modewörtern.
More aid (including debt relief) and greater access to the markets of rich countries for products from poor countries seem to the top of the global agenda.
Indeed, turns the current debate is not about what should be done, but how quickly and how much it should be done.
This is the clear lessons from the past five decades of economic development lost.
The most important of them is that economic development largely in the hands of the poor nations themselves.
Countries that in the recent past have provided good performance, create from our own effort.
aid and access rarely have played a decisive role.
Let us take a developing country, on a free and privileged access to its largest neighbour has also happens the strongest economy in the world.
Let us also, that this country millions of citizens as workers send over the border, largely receives foreign investment and completely integrated in international production chains.
Furthermore, the banking system of the country by the willingness shown its based rich neighbours, in the worst case as a lender intervene in such situations.
Far better globalisation can hardly be, or?
Let us a second country.
This country is a trade embargo on the largest market in the world, receives facing foreign aid or any other support from the West, is of international organisations such as the WTO excluded and will be prevented, at the IMF and the World Bank loans.
As would these external disadvantages not debilitating enough, this economy receives their own high barriers to international trade maintain (in the form of government trade, import duties and quantitative limits).
As the readers may guess, it is real countries: Mexico and Vietnam.
Mexico shares over 3 000 km long border with the United States, which is not only for a privileged access for goods and workers, but also provides for a claim on the resources of the US Treasury (which during the peso clearly 1995).
However, America received until 1994 a trade embargo against Vietnam maintain, until 1995 diplomatic contacts and since acknowledged Vietnamese imports years later no preferential treatment.
Vietnam is still excluded from the WTO.
Let us now their economic performance.
Since the American free-trade agreements (NAFTA) was signed in December 1992, Mexico's economy average to little more than 1% per capita and per year grown.
This value is not only far below the growth rates of economic superstars Asia, it is only a fraction of Mexico's own Wachstumsleistung in the decades before the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).
Vietnam economy is, however, between the start of his reforms 1988 and the diplomatic relations with the US in 1995 to 5.6% per year per capita grown. Since growing fast pace of 4.5% further.
Vietnam has a dramatic reduction of poverty experienced, while in Mexico the real wages fallen.
Both countries have registered a surge in international trade and foreign investment, but arise where it is most, completely different images: the rising standard of living, particularly for the poor.
These examples show that the own efforts of a country for its economic fate is much more crucial than anything else.
All the chances of the American market offered Mexico, could the consequences of political mistake in their own country does not outweigh, particularly the failure to the real appreciation of the Peso-Wechselkurses reverse, and the inability in a small area of export productivity gains achieved to extend the rest of the economy.
The most that a country chooses the right strategy for growth.
Quite without the benefits Mexico Vietnam pursued a strategy that focused, its economy broad to diversify and the domestic suppliers to increase capacity.
The further experience of the post-war period supports the conclusion that the internal policy is the most important.
South Korea's breakthrough in the early 1960s, not as the foreign aid on their peaked at were, but as they are and have been cancelled.
Taiwan received no foreign aid or privileged access.
China and India, the economic superstars today, especially flourish because of their own reform.
It is tempting, the few African successes -- Botswana and Mauritius -- external demand for their exports (diamonds or clothing) fault, but the history, there is already end.
Obviously both countries would without access to foreign markets much poorer.
But, as in other cases of successful development are not their external benefits from other withdraw, but it is their ability to use these benefits.
One need only consider the theft of the other countries from their wealth of natural resources.
In Sierra Leone calls the word "diamond" hardly images of peace and prosperity shows.
Similarly, have only a few of the free Industriezonen spread in the world, the results produced, which were observed in Mauritius.
None of this dismisses the rich countries from their responsibility to help.
You can the world for corrupt dictators make unfriendly, for example by giving them more financial information exchange and international treaties sign these dictators, do not recognise.
Similarly, would an increase in the number of workers from poor countries who work in rich countries must, and more room for establishing pro-growth policies by a relaxation of the WTO rules and the dependence on the United States better long-term effect on the development.
It is anything other than clear that an extension of access and the increase of aids the productive use of valuable political capital from the north represent.
Development should not on trade and aid, but focus on improving the political environment in poor countries.
Who is now dependent on whom?
If the great Argentine economist Raul Prebisch today still alive, it would undoubtedly ask whether the world because head.
His enormously influential "Dependenztheorie" assumed that those poor countries which are too dependent on raw, never achieve those industrial penetration, which is necessary for sustainable economic growth.
Instead, they are in a vicious circle falling global commodity prices and steadily falling Einkommensanteile caught.
Prebischs privileged political response, protectionism, proved for the many Latin American and African countries that followed by his views, as catastrophic.
The fact is, however, that Prebisch over many years in relation to the long-term trends in the commodity prices right to lie seemed.
Ruthless efficiency gains in agriculture and in the reduction of natural resources interdependent.            the commodity prices downwards, particularly during the 1980's and 1990's.
From few exceptions, developed the economy of those countries that raw concentrated, pathetic, while many Resource poor Asian countries pushed forward.
Today, however, where Asian giants -- India and China -- in the world economy has occurred, explode the price of oil, gold, wheat and practically all the other raw materials.
Although there will always be cycles -- such as oil prices will probably fall, before they begin to rise again --, but the long-term trend for many raw materials will clearly for the time rising show.
What many of the actors in the trade negotiations and other political decision-makers apparently not yet understood -- although Prebisch it would have immediately recognised -- is that this tragic turn of events huge impact on global balance of forces entails.
Indeed, will probably no other aspect of globalization, the leaders of our world in the coming decades major challenges.
The questions are manifold.
Are the rich countries of our days ready for an era of Kodependenz, in what they do not less desperately need of raw materials than the developing countries of the Industrieimporte and technology?
Are they ready for the inevitable flow of power and influence towards the raw, because this clearly prosperous?
How will the two global superpowers, China and the United States to deal with the fact that important rohstoffexportierende regions -- of Africa on the Middle East to Central Asia -- with bad buzz nation-states littered?
Some even appointed guides the problem as a limited natural resources, what the world with alarming speed Congress critical raw materials.
There are nowadays many supporters of the Hubbert 'schen theory of oil production, which says that we have the upper limit of the Förderkapazitäten have achieved that dry up the sources and that everything worse.
However, as the leading Ölhistoriker Dan Yergin points out, the prophets of doom already at least four declared that the world's oil took.
Each time radical technological progress led to this threat abrogated in the air.
At the end of the nineteenth century were oil production Maultiere used for the Ausschachtungen.
Today, no one thinks something, 3 000 metres below the seabed for oil to persevere.
Similar progress in the field of Metallbergbaus and agriculture everywhere.
No, the world is not before, that their the starting point of the raw materials.
Instead, happening is that the inclusion of two-and-a-half billion people (in China and India alone) in the world economy causing a Nachfrageveränderung clearly greater Aufwärtsdruck commodity prices should exercise, as it all technological progress can compensate.
That is why the commodity prices rise -- at least for the next 50 to 75 years, and perhaps, until the people at some point in the next centuries with mining on Mars begin.
Will the education from it derived a new balance economic power destabilise the world?
The First World War was clearly partly caused by fears Germany, that the other colonial powers far too large proportion of the world's oil and Rohstoffvorräte have secured.
Similarly feared in the Second World War Japan to the stability of its supply with oil and other natural resources from abroad.
Will similar tensions between the resource-poor China (where even the water is a problem) and the West occur?
Fortunately this is not currently likely, particularly given the sober and pragmatic approach of the Chinese leadership to resolve their Ressourcenprobleme.
The Chinese based in the direction of regions such as Africa and hope that there stable trading partners.
They do not share that political destiny of the Americans, not just with the Rohstoffexporteuren trade, but also to the real belief preaching want.
Then there are those American leaders, still talk of the United States in relation to the energy supply independent.
But this is all in all a joke: Unmäßig they may be, whatever they never.
Understandably considered a large proportion of the Arab world the invasion of Iraq as a cornerstone of the real mimicking, the stability of their energy supplies.
If this is true, it only remains to hope that America on a plan B has.
In the meantime the commodity prices continue to rise, while the Ölexporteure now the largest amount to America's klaffendem deficit afford.
Perhaps the real US strategy even to try to high debts in the rohstoffexportierenden countries that they feel obliged to America to keep whim?
This, however, is a phrase, the Prebisch had never anticipated.
Harsh line during the elections in Iran
The choice of hardliners known as mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the next President of Iran will probably relations with the West and worsen the international isolation of the country increase.
As regards the internal affairs, yet it is safe for the Islamic regime is better than a moderateres result.
Ahmadinejad has clearly a broad basis of supporters.
But the fact that it led a populist campaign, spoke to help the poor, the performance of the government and condemned, almost as a candidate of the opposition, aufführte is irrelevant: He was the choice of the regime, and in the end he received even against other rival representatives of the hard line under the candidates official aid.
The regime has played tide excellent.
It was the somewhat more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani, with some current political measures did not agree, as a figure of the "establishment" out and made its own man to the rebel.
The Government used that Anti-Establishment-Gefühl its own rule to revive.
The fact that the last President Mohammed Khatami, a supporter of the reformist movement -- albeit timid, ultimately nothing reached -- only underlines how carefully the rulers have turned the political situation.
Ahmadinejad is a representative of the younger activists of the revolution against the Shah a quarter of a century ago.
He was directly to the abduction of American hostages involved in Iran, although the exact extent of his participation remains controversial.
The most concerned by the fact that it is the two groups is close to the main representatives of the most extreme elements in Iran represent: the corps of the guardians of the Islamic Revolution and Basidsch-Organisation.
The first is a parallel, regimetreue army, the second an organisation for the intimidation of opponents and all the others who aspire to a more open society.
Yet the concern that an even more radical leadership in Iran came to power is offset by two factors.
Firstly, Ahmadinejad will probably focus on internal affairs and try to the standard of living of the poorest Iranians to raise -- with what success is unclear.
Secondly, the same group, since the revolution is in power, the ideology and foreign policy essentially continue.
The President has less power than it appears, and will, in particular by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei overshadowed.
Nevertheless, the election makes Ahmadinejad quite clear what a challenge of Iran for the Western policy and stability in the Middle East.
First, they indicated in particular the most extreme elements in Iran and the terrorist customers of the country (Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad and various small groups, against Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Arab countries proceed), that they green light for attacks.
You probably assume that Iran supports them, whatever they do.
From the outside considered, Iran is often relatively cautious, but he secretly is the world's leading Terrorsponsor.
Sometimes individual Iranian officials in isolation perhaps ordered and coordinated certain operations, now they will feel free to do so.
Moreover, Ahmadinejad openly represents the Iranian crash for the production of nuclear weapons.
Most Iranian politicians -- at least those of the government was allowed to work openly -- support the programme, but draw a calmer and prudent approach.
Rafsanjani was, for example, the construction of better economic relations with the West on an initiative of nuclear front.
Ahmadinejad as President of a nuclear Iran it is more likely that the arms being used in bizarre way.
This does not mean that he would abfeuern, but that it under certain circumstances for the purpose of diplomatic blackmail and thus use threats to crisis will increase.
Since the Iranian leaders daily declare their desire to wiping out Israel off the map and to combat the US (Ahmadinejad came on its way to vote on a picture of the American flag), the risk of confrontation increased.
Finally, Ahmadinejad will probably stability in Iraq dreistere way undermine, and his victory will be radical Iranian officials and extremists in Iraq itself encourage.
Iran has already sent agents in Iraq and supported customers, the country transformed into a clone want.
The Iraqis, including the Shiite Muslims, the same direction of Islam support, such as the Iranians, such reject interference in general.
A militantere Iranian attitude is the friction with Iraq may strengthen and there cause further anti-American violence.
In short, the outcome of the elections in Iran is dangerous, although its exact destabilizing effect will ultimately depend on how Ahmadinejad, the situation is and how much power him by Khamenei’s will be given.
Moreover, the dealings with Iran, as open extremely and even the standards of the uncompromising regime measured radical, not only for the US is a challenge, but also for Europe.
Will the European countries try to pretend that would be Ahmadinejad's bellicose rhetoric and provocation regardless and could as a diplomatic solution for the nuclear ambitions of Iran be found?
With Rafsanjani, it would have been easy to conclude a real agreement or maintain the appearance of cooperation.
But Ahmadinejad will be a high degree of appeasement be necessary to even the smallest diplomatic processes continue.
Some Iranian reformers and exiles the election of Ahmadinejad nice spoke to the argument that his government probably the true face of the regime and shows all the Western hopes for a compromise destroyed.
But the success of the regime, reflect the dissatisfaction on a quarter of a century radical Islamic rule to neutralize.
Whatever the outcome means Ahmadinejad's victory that everything to do with Iran, probably even more difficult.
From the poor, the rich
President Bush seems to be, America's budget years also to foment.
President Bush 's office, saw as far as the eye tabled only budget surpluses.
Today, threatening huge deficits in the Haushaltshorizont and, as a result of Gemisches irresponsible, introduced by the Republicans tax cuts, from the malaise of the economy, the bursting of the stock-market bubble and a huge increase in the defence budgets.
It is even worse, because Bush Administration and Congress, under the leadership of the Republicans, Haushaltsmisere still further.
The damage that they cause, the US will probably weaken and disorient the world economy.
Traditionally was the Republican Party America for balanced budgets.
This changed under the government Reagan. In he supported conservative Republicans tax cuts at the expense of big deficits.
President Reagan promised the American people both tax cuts as military spiral and the continuation of them favored spending and everything at the same time.
The outcome - not surprising - was a number of huge deficits, eliminate the again coveted years.
Both President, both George Bush senj. as well as Bill Clinton, had new taxes, the legacy of the Reagan era weed.
The tax increases were probably accessories to President Bush 's senj. defeat towards Bill Clinton in 1992.
Yet Clinton courageously decided on the way to a balanced budget weiterzuschreiten. He did this partly to long-term financing its social programmes to secure pensions.
When Clinton in the year 2000 retired from office, the budgetary situation was the best for decades.
Then President George Bush appeared Jr to Reagan revived and comprehensive tax cuts, huge increases the military and the continuation or even extension of popular spending.
The result was predictable.
In January 2001 the cumulative coloured for the years 2002-2011 5.6 trillion dollars overall estimated surplus.
Even in the middle of 2002 had evaporated these surpluses planned.
In view of this changed economy and the shadow, which is a possible war in Iraq vorauswirft, one would have expected, the Bush administration and the Congress, under the leadership of the Republicans went with recommendations further tax cuts cautious.
But no, they put their high priority to further tax cuts, primarily the rich to good.
At the same time, the government is asking significant increases in the military.
After the attention once again the presidential elections in November 2004 address, will certainly be no meaningful trade-off between non-military spending programme to be made.
So, it seems that the massive deficits will remain.
Even if the internal expenditure remains the same retain as a share of national income, the cumulative coloured in the next ten years to a deficit of 1.5 trillion dollars ride.
But this figure could still to be optimistic, because they are probably the cost of possible war in Iraq is not sufficiently taken into consideration, not another round of tax cuts and not the risk of higher interest rates in the years ahead.
Why the Republicans so little concern about the confusion, which they cause?
Some Republicans are tax cuts for the rich more important than almost anything else.
Others believe that high deficits would greater sacrifice the domestic government spending force and the influence of state restrict what they actually heart want.
The problem of the latter view is that most taxpayers promise domestic programmes and therefore greater restrictions on how we can spend money not so easy support.
A much exciting question: why the Americans vote for such political programmes, but where they should know what difficulties they will probably lead.
An answer says that many voters see the threat of budgetary problems simply do not.
A better answer indicates that actually most Americans did not vote for such programmes.
The turnout in the elections of 2002 was only 40%, since the votes cast got half of the Republicans, i.e. only around 20% of voters.
Of course, the prospects must not be as bleak.
The war in Iraq can be prevented.
The proposed tax cuts can be diluted or abandoned.
But I say huge deficits in the coming years ahead and in the US and abroad increasing unease about the macro-economic situation in America.
Investors from abroad should decide to the budgetary and external deficits America does not continue to favourable conditions want to finance.
The dollar will probably be weaker and Inflationsängste could be obvious.
All this will US-Politiker less flexible and reliable respond to the economic shocks.
The poor, both within the US and abroad should suffering the most, if President Bush and the Congress of the American people and the world will say that because of the large deficits no money left, the problems of poverty and in health and education address.
If the simple Americans do not wake up and not the latent seriously, the rich again with a gift from many billions of dollars of them, while the country and the world in the next few years hard to bear the consequences.
lessons from the financial rashness of the USA
George W. Bush has more than any other president in the American history done, the economic policy of the United States underlying, and has even his mentor Ronald Reagan exceeded.
In only three-year term, he has destroyed a fragile political consensus to establish the had taken a decade and to build again another decade could take.
This Bush has America's long-term economic health and social stability is at stake.
Since the long-term challenges for the budget, the US manage as catastrophic, are not unusual, America's fiscal Schnitzern important lessons for other countries.
The main problem of monetary policy is that politicians on tax cuts and an increase in the public spending easily a temporary increase their popularity can achieve, by enormous state debt, which then baggage remains reserved for the future.
This trick can be a few years work; sooner rather than later, however, impose deficits and rising debt is a political U-turn painful.
A cynical politicians, however, can buy his reelection and is probably in the crisis broke in retirement.
We should think that the voters after world’s hundreds of such episodes fiscal irresponsibility in recent decades allergic reaction to this type of tricks would react.
Bush again, however, so: He bought today popularity, it by huge tax breaks distributed and, at the same time, the military and even increased expenditure on education and health.
The result is a deficit of EUR more than 5% of GDP.
Worse still, the long-term prospects for the American budget were already worrying, before Bush began its rash policy.
The average age of transfixed adopted; consequent arises for the future of a sharp increase in the cost of public health and pensions.
Careful calculations show that the Bush favors taxation erzielbaren future income the cost of pensions, health care and other expected by the public public spending is likely to many below 10 trillion dollars.
Sometime in the future will therefore be a strong increase taxes, deep cuts in public expenditure or both together will be needed to Bush's actions to be corrected.
Why, then, the public supports his policy?
The reason is that the public little understanding or interest in this long-term consequences summon up, although ultimately most Americans suffer from them.
The richest taxpayers are naturally pleased because they benefit most from these tax cuts.
It is unbelievable, but almost half of the tax cuts the richest 5% below the American taxpayers benefit, and these rich taxpayers obviously expect that the other 95% - the middle class and the poor - the largest part of the future Ausgabesenkungen and tax increases should bear.
Meanwhile Bush has many voters from the subcommittees and middle convinced that they can be satisfied - without them to say that it is for their small tax cuts with considerably greater cuts in the future state services will pay if the policy of its government prevails in the long term.
If the Americans is a political memory, would they realise that these tax, ,Achterbahnfahrt "in the past 20 years have already experienced.
As Ronald Reagan was elected, he promised also massive tax cuts and a substantial increase in the military.
The result was a huge deficit in the mid-1980's.
The tax cuts made Reagan enormously popular and contributed to his re-election in 1984.
Then it took over a decade, Reagan's second term on the presidencies of George Bush high-investment and Bill Clinton, the deficit again in a budget surplus to turn.
Of course, this made the granting of new tax increases necessary to what George Bush high-investment re-election cost and the polarized political landscape of the 1990s led.
The history should almost repeat with security.
Some right-wing ideologues within the Bush administration believe that the deficits of our days ultimately deep cuts in public spending force.
They hope for a dismantling of programmes such as social security and Medicare.
In the American public, however, enjoy these social programmes broad support.
The strategy of political rights, firstly to reduce taxes, then cuts in social programmes insofar to force will therefore fail, and the taxes will ultimately have to rise again.
Other within the Bush Administration argue that tax cuts are important for the US to draw from the recession.
Even this argument is wrong.
America's economy would without this tax cuts recovered, perhaps even sustainable.
Regardless of paragraphs, it is a huge mistake, a long-term taxation build on short-term cycle.
For other countries arise consequent two basic lessons.
The first is that the emerging deficits in the US, sooner or later, America's influence international borders are set.
The Americans have the Iraq war supported only because they are not had to pay tax increases.
Once the Americans have to decide whether their Auslandsabenteuer want to finance higher taxes, they are much less willing, expensive military operations abroad to support.
Indeed, in the wake of the public dispute about the Bush bequeathed fiscal chaos to an in-depth internal division of the United States.
The second lesson is that countries the rising cost an ageing population, in its draft budget should take into account.
The long-term budgetary situation is often the taxpayers or Parliament aware.
Governments should be obliged, together with their annual Budgets long-term assessments of the budgetary submit to the trend towards short-term, politically motivated manipulation counteract the budget.
The US can other countries serve as an early warning.
The White House should other give the same warning, which wizards in television give their viewers: ,Versuchen you not home. "
The political stock market
Many economic and financial analysts complain that the stock markets of emerging often heavily manipulated by their governments would and politically rather than economically are.
In contrast, seems to be in stock markets in industrialized nations implicitly the adoption, that this original force will be driven economic nature and forecast their Wertentwicklung therefore with a growth forecast for trees is comparable.
This description of stock markets in developing countries is wrong, not only prejudiced, because the same description of stock exchanges in industrialized countries applies.
The best analysts know that a prognosis of the Wertentwicklung the stock market of each country essentially means predict how well investors in the stock market to the will of the government in the current political environment fare.
If we take the stock market in the United States, far and away most of the world.
The general view is that enterprises remain freely by the government and the returns on assets of non-US reflect the fundamental forces of a strong capitalist economic system.
This is one of the reasons why the United States a magnetic appeal to Portefeuille-Investoren exercising from all over the world.
But the profits of the American stock markets so attractive, reflects a sensitive political balance.
In particular, the rates influence shares, under veränderndem political pressure in the course of time varies.
For example, during the Second World War, the political support for major assets eased and the government has taxes on capital gains, dividends and high incomes increase dramatically in general.
When the Second World War thorough recovery of the Great Depression attributed brought the Dreißigerjahre, President Roosevelt collected and the Congress a tax on excessive profits, in order to ensure that not to shareholders would benefit greatly.
In 1980, on the other hand, when there was no war, the stock market but was in a watershed, chose the voters Ronald Reagan, a man, many very right-wing angehörig thought to be President.
He asked for - and achieved - tax cuts on capital gains, dividends and incomes.
Political interference in the stock market is not limited solely to tax on capital gains, dividends and incomes.
wealth taxes, excise, import duties and VAT - all directly or indirectly to be paid by companies - can be extended level on company profits and thus act the stock market.
Wherever flourish stock markets, it is no coincidence that governments ensure these taxes certainly not so far enough to allow company profits for withdrawal of taxes destroyed.
The policy of stock markets listening taxes are not.
On the contrary, almost every Regierungsaktivität affects company profits, and in exchange on the stock market.
After the stock market crash in the year 1929 set the US Administration many activities of competing authorities and enabled companies to obtain monopoly, which would increase its value.
This policy delayed the recovery of high unemployment, but even this is not enough for the political forces in the rein to keep to benefit the support of the stock market were mobilized.
Similarly, it was one of the most important things that President Reagan has done, large parts of the remaining power of the American unions, to destroy their piece in the Unternehmenskuchen fight.
Reagan's dismantling the Fluglotsenstreiks of 1981 was a turning point for the American trade union - and for the stock market, whose spectacular uneven in 1982 started.
Since the speculative inflating the stock prices in the year 2000 its peak reached, the US administration has supported the stock market particularly strongly, particularly by repeated reduction of interest rates.
public’ was naturally as a measure to stimulate the economy justified, not to support the stock market.
It is, however, a revealing reference to the importance of non-US, that the Aktienkursverfall for the main factors have been kept, the burden on the economy.
The reaction of the authorities are not limited to monetary Stimulationsmaßnahmen.
Macroeconomic accounts of the US shows that the effective tax on company profits (the percentage of profits, indeed in the form of taxes paid to the government will) its peak 33,7% in the first quarter of the year 2000 achieved - the peaked at the stock market and the economy in general - in the fourth quarter of 2003 20,2% fell, as the market had a low.
This decline reflects largely clear, by Congress advocated measures to tax break again, and the view of companies, that they taxes in the current economic and political environment can avoid aggressive.
Moreover, the maximum tax on dividends from stocks after the Börsencrash reduced from 35% to 15%, which was long-term investors a major new advantage and Zinseszinseffekt reinvested the dividends to increased taxes.
Even this reduction was as Konjunkturanreiz justified, which is of course virtually every measure can say, which aims to base the stock market.
It is, however, the balance political forces on the credibility of such a justification decides.
One could say that the same variables, including the negative attitude towards high taxes and the weak trade union, in the US since the last 200 years at work - and therefore we can assume that they will be in future, and produce high stock market gains and enormous capital inflows attract foreign investment.
Those who believe that investments in the US stock market done the same strong growth trend should be maintained for decades, could quite right.
We should, however, realise what we predicted.
In fact, saying not only economic developments ahead, but policy - and even cultural values - the economic policy and -leistung shape.
The global evicted
Of all the investments are homes most a certain location and tied to Gedeih or corrupt local economic conditions subject.
In our televisions, although we are pursuing at an incredible rate worldwide developments, but our Eigenheimmarkt, almost exclusively in the hands of local amateurs, remains enshrined in our backyard.
But this could change soon.
Within a month the Produktbörse Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in cooperation with my companies and MacroMarkets and Fiserv standard & poor 'futures and Optionskontrakte on home prices in ten US cities on the market.
The basis of this contracts form the S & P/Case-Shiller-Immobilienpreisindizes -- a further development of those scientific work, which my colleague Karl Case and I almost twenty years ago provided.
We have many years for Immobilienfutures committed, but until now no Stock Exchange wanted a Futuresmarkt based on such indicators create.
The futures investors throughout the world enable us to buy shares indirectly in US homes to invest.
A investors in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo can therefore in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas invest in homes, which are inhabited by their owners.
Because of a fundamental principle of the theory -- the "diversification" or "risk-spreading are concerned" -- can assume that interest in the new contracts certainly will be high.
For example, some individuals and firms in New York excessive Immobilienrisiken local exposed. It should therefore this risk by the sale of futures to reduce home prices in New York.
In acceptable prices people in Tokyo by the purchase of this New York futures on home prices play a part of the risk.
The New York live still in their buyers, but their Anlagerisiko they have now disseminated throughout the world.
A genuine futures market for homes were since 1991, not more than the London Termin- and Optionsbörse (now under the name Euronext.liffe firmiert) failed to ensure that such a market building in Britain.
At that time we could not obtain sufficient trade.
The stock exchange schmiss Party, but none went out.
Even the British Spread-Betting-Märkte and some Online-Handelsmärkte could not achieve sustainable success.
Will it be different this time?
Of course, the launch of a new market is always a unsafe enterprise. people go only like to parties, when many other people there.
Is nobody there is also no like out, and it is in markets with a few investors.
There are too few transactions, in order to achieve those returns, which are necessary to attract enough investors, and as brilliant parties is also the success of new markets is sometimes a mystery, but we know that from time to time works out very well.
There are signs of a growing interest in the trade with futures on home prices, particularly since the debates about a "bubble 'the importance of Risikodiversifikation stress.
After the CME announced their plans, said their Mitbewerberinnen, the Chicago Optionsbörse, that also intends to futures and Optionskontrakte for the most important regions in the USA on the market, and on that basis for the American association of real estate agents issued Medianpreise homes.
However, apart from the strong public interest in property investment and the safeguarding of the Immobilienrisiken for the success of Futuresmärkten a crucial point to clarify: prices must be exposed and investors must be on the importance of this prices clear.
I believe that many of these futures soon with a considerable, within the next year campaign prices in some US cities count.
The prices in the traders known as "Backwardation" are, the price of a futures on the market today is lower than the current price of one’s.
This Backwardation will perhaps not on the first day of trade with futures occur, but very probably within a few months.
This Backwardation could some markets be needed if they are to be fulfil its role.
Everyone knows that in many of these towns (and elsewhere) in the last few years a huge real-estate boom.
International investors will probably in these cities do not want to invest if it Futuresmärkten no expectations with regard to a drop in prices, such as the inhabitants Tokyo’s know from bitter experience.
If, however, marked this Backwardation enough, could also investors, who believe that the boom is falling, the Eigenheimfutures expect a good return, because they are these on Futuresmarkt to acquire a more favourable already price.
Yet those New York to safeguard their property investment want, to a certain extent need to rethink, when it comes to sell Futureskontrakte, in which prices is already in the calculations.
They will only have to become accustomed to the idea that the market prices already expected and that they themselves for the only possible future part secure any reduction, which go beyond these expectations.
Such rethinking will probably then established there, if we future market prices actually know.
Up to now the future development of the housing prices a matter entirely different opinions.
When the markets an international consensus on the future home prices in the cities can establish this world, we will also with the risks in these cities can deal better and thus the respective economies -- and our own lives -- stabilise.
What news persuade the markets?
The stock markets in a large part of the world have been roughly 10 May clear Kursverluste must accept. The most of them occurred in the two weeks around until May 23; on average, however, are the rates since continue to fall.
Wise Men these problems in the international exchanges problems for the global economy out?
Let us the strongest Kursverluste consider.
In the main national indexes was made the biggest crash in India, where the stock prices from 10 to 23 May fell 16.9%.
The debacle on the other side of the globe was almost as great, and the maximum and Tiefststände wichen only two days of those in India: Argentina gave the rates to 16.1% in Brazil to 14.7% and in Mexico to 13.8 billion.%.
Even the European markets high losses.
In Sweden, the rates fell between 9 and 22 May to 15.2%; almost in the same period they were in Germany to EUR 9.7%, in France 9.4% and in Britain and Italy to 9.3%.
In Asia the rates fell in almost exactly the same period of relative highs on relative lows -- in Korea to 11.5%, in Hong Kong to 9.3% and Japan 8%.
Many commentators are trying to these events of the developments in the United States rosier.
But in the US, the stocks dipped between 9 and 24 May only 5.2%.
Nor China seems behind the global fall to pour, because the courses there during this period rose.
The Standarderklärung of economists is the monetary policy in the centre.
In the course of the great Deflationsangst 2003 reducing the central banks throughout the world, interest and triggered spekulationsbedingte booms, both in the stock and Häusermarkt.
Now, however, this view, unpleasant rising interest rates, which felt for the future can be expect further Kursrückgänge.
That is undoubtedly an important grain of truth.
The US Federal Reserve stressed the interest on 10 May, in fact, and its Chairman, Ben Bernanke, indicated the possibility of further interest rates.
On 17 May deteriorating Inflationsdaten reported, which indicates that a further streamlining of monetary policy is imminent.
The economists see the world like as logical and manageable -- and imply that they understand what is in it.
But by, they assess the role of the Central Bank often on.
Indeed, was the rate hike in the US is only one in a whole series of interest rates -- 16 in succession.
No other important Central Bank has after the fall in the stock markets until 7/8 June, the increased interest rates, as several did (the ECB and the central banks India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).
Another factor is the price of oil between 22 March and 2 May rises in order to 24% and set several absolute highs.
This was certainly an important event, and it is plausible that impact on the stock markets throughout the world could have.
oil-price virtually all economic recessions since the Second World War contributed.
However, the do not fall oil-price in the window in the middle of May, when the most visible indexes nachgaben.
Those who argue that rising oil prices Kursverluste in the stock market caused, requires that the stock markets reacted with mehrwöchiger delay.
Now act stock markets is not necessarily very logical, and could be a delayed reaction to the oil-price available.
As in all other prices on the financial markets calls an increase shows attention.
If oil prices soar, respect for the people with oil prices related news and strengthened talking about oil prices -- what a growing raising awareness of such news led.
The crisis in the Middle East, the news dominated in May, in connection with the oil prices.
Perhaps the investors due to the oil-price ominous indications and the impending vocabulary various political actors strengthened perceived.
That stated on 8 May the deputy Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres in response to hostile statements by the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: 'The President of Iran should remember that Iran can be brushed off the map ".
Similarly, the newspapers reported on 13 May, around the beginning of the falls in the stock exchanges, that Ahmadinejad in his visit to Indonesia -- the most populous majority Muslim country in the world -- of students by two of the country’s Topuniversitäten the ovation was considered.
This notification may be interpreted as evidence that Ahmadinejad confrontation course in the nuclear issue for this politically worthwhile -- which boost the idea may have been, that the tense situation in the Middle East even higher oil prices could lead.
This newspaper may the appearance be much further away from the stock market than the monetary policy.
But the public reaction to them -- along with the recent rise in oil prices -- may be a good part of the amendment of the Marktpsychologie responsible.
The risk-taking changes in the course of time, and events such as Ahmadinejad and Peres' statements could trigger such changes.
Such things happen in difficult quantifiable manner. Yet should the analysts in their attempts to the development of the global stock markets to predict the remarks Ahmadinejad perhaps as much attention as those But Bernanke's.
It may not have fallen, the economists, your attention to the attitude of the public and their interaction with price changes, global newspaper and Spekulationsdynamiken to focus.
Finally, they would thus admit that less predicted economic events (and the economists even less) allwissend than they would like.
But such a focus intuitively make sense.
What moves investors really?
Ahmadinejad is a charismatic shape; Bernanke is not.
Ahmadinejad followed a implausible course; Bernanke does not do so.
And, perhaps most importantly: Ahmadinejad is a destabilising influence, Bernanke is not.
Indeed, the global case is pointing stock prices in the middle of May, whatever its eventual cause may be, an unstable Marktpsychologie out.
It is hard to imagine that it is only the views on monetary policy suspected rosier and not broader and deeper proliferation of, global economic development for the basic problems -- including the energy supply and the political tensions.
Why fairness should pay more
Marks & Spencer, Supermarkt- and Bekleidungskette 400 branches across the United Kingdom, was recently known that their whole coffee and Teepalette overall, 38, Produktlinien Fairtrade, Marketingsymbol 'ethical production', wants to change.
The chain sold in its 200 Café-Revive-Kaffeestuben already exclusively tea and coffee with Fairtraide-Siegel.
It also increases their Einkaufsmenge shirts and other goods from Fairtrade-Baumwolle.
The announcement was made during the "Fairtrade Fortnight", a 14 campaign for Fairtrade-Produkte, including farmers from developing countries the British on lecturing in various places told, as Fairtrade has helped their communities.
The movement towards a ethical consumption in the United States grown in importance, where the consumers ever more organically grown, locally produced food and eggs from free-range hens address.
In Britain a survey showed that half of the respondents recognized the Fairtrade-Symbol and knew that it relates to products, the farmers in the developing world offer better business conditions.
There is no comparable American study, but similar data and discussions with my own students point out that the figure would be much lower.
traders, the Fairtrade-Siegel request that the manufacturers must pay a price, the costs of sustainable production covers and ensures minimum wage.
For example, stands at the minimum price for coffee $1.26 per pound, no matter how deeply the market price falls.
If the market price on this value is rising, increased the Fairhandelspreis, so that he per pound five cents remains higher.
small farmers must themselves in cooperatives or other groups organise to enable a democratic participation.
plantations and factories Fairtrade-Siegel can use the, if it is their workers pay decent wages, health, safety and environmental standards, trade unions or other forms of Arbeiterorganisationen allow, provide good shelter, if the workers do not live home, and neither children are still forced to take.
Not all finds Fairtrade popular.
Brink Lindsey, the director of the market oriented Cato Institute 's Center for Trade Policy Studies, believes that the campaign for Fairtrade-Kaffee a "well-meaning impasse constituted."
With some justification, he argued that the real cause for the case of coffee prices is not the greed multinational companies was, but the enormous increase in the pin in Brazil, and Vietnam, in combination with new techniques, which will make it possible to coffee with fewer workers and therefore grow cheaper.
From Lindeys point of view, we should coffee planters, if we want to help them, either encourage, the coffee growing abandoning and gewinnbringendere produce crops -- and he rightly points out that trade barriers and subsidies in the rich countries are obstacles that must be abolished -- or address higher-quality products, for example, the Spezialkaffees achieve higher prices.
At Lindeys argument is strange, however, that the campaign for Fairtrade-Kaffee as that can be considered what he recommends: coffee planters be encouraged to grow Spezialkaffee, reached a higher price.
The representatives of the free market have nothing against companies which use Snob-Appeal quite openly, to promote their products.
If the people $48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue-Mountain-Kaffee want to pay, because the James Lieblingskaffee bonds, economists have nothing against the fact that the market is distorted.
Why are they then critical if consumers choose $12 for a pound of coffee spend, which they know that he without toxic chemicals under the shadow spendenden trees was grown, in which birds can survive -- of farmers, which can now afford to feed their children and to attend school?
The economists might reply that, if it wants to help the people to feed their children and train, $10 for not paying fairly traded coffee could equally taste, and then the saved $2 donates a humanitarian workers, the poor children with food and education supplies.
This is a possible strategy, but fair trade certain benefits.
The farmers know that they are a product must provide that consumers like, both in taste terms and in the bananas.
If their product sold well, they can be proud to have produced something in the world are rebelling.
From the point of view of the producers, it is better to a premium by the sale of a Fairtrade-Produkts to get as a charity to receive, regardless of whether they received had worked or not, and despite the quality of their product.
A higher price for Fairtrade-Etikett to pay is not "anti-competition ', as a higher price for Gucci-Etikett to pay, and it reflects better ethical priorities.
Fairtrade is no state subsidy.
His success is the demand on the market, not dependent on political lobby.
Fortunately, this growing demand on the European market quickly.
It remains to be hoped that they all industrialised countries and wherever the people freely on their expenditure can decide soon similar high.
pigs, calves and the American democracy
In all the headlines about the victory of the Democrats in the American Congressional in November is an important result of these elections almost disappeared.
And although this Teilergebnis the shortcomings of the political system in the USA revealed, my faith in the sympathy of American ordinary restored.
In Arizona federal citizens can be due to a sufficient number of signatures a bill to submit direct vote.
In this elections, it was the ban, pregnant pigs or Zuchtkälber peg or in buffalo to keep the animal prevent to move freely, lie or his Lending a limbs.
Those with the methods of modern agriculture industry are not familiar, perhaps ask why such legislation could be necessary at all.
Under conditions as they are 50 years ago in the welfare everywhere prevailed and how it in some countries still practised, all animals enough room to move and Lending a.
Today, however, spend roughly 90% of all American breeding -- the mothers of those piglets, the production of pigmeat, bacon washed down and ham bred and killed - the bulk of their lives imprisoned in Kastenständen not greater than 60 times 220 cm.
In it they can reverse or hinlegen, stretch out their limbs or more than a step backwards or move forward.
Other sows so short chains linked, that it is also not reverse.
Even in the calves veal are their entire lives individually in small Verschläge blocked, where they are not reverse, hinlegen or stretch out.
The aim of this animal-rearing Arbeitsersparnis -- they facilitate the Tiermanagement and allow the attitude of thousands or tens of thousands of animals under one roof. This are less or lower qualified staff necessary.
In addition, these methods prevent the animals by much movement or battles between them wasting energy.
Following protests by animal welfare organisations was the European Union some years ago in its Scientific Veterinary Committee a report on this type of livestock farming in mandate.
In the report of the committee, it was the result that the animals suffer, they are not to be able to move freely and nothing to do.
On this conclusion would obviously also under the use of the normal Hausverstandes.
Following the publication of this report, the EU set deadlines, to what time imprisoning of animals should be banned.
For Zuchtkälber already is at hand the ban on 1 January 2007.
Einzelkastenstände breeding in Great Britain and Sweden are already banned, in the entire EU 2013 illegally.
Gradual should be implemented measures to improve the living conditions of laying hens, usually closely packed into Drahtkäfigen be kept, in which they are not even spreizen their wings.
In the United States, 160 officials measures of this kind nowhere in sight.
If I European friends in the past asked why the US Europe in terms of animal protection so far lag behind, I did not answer.
Have the desperate issues, I had to admit that a declaration is perhaps the fact that the Americans animals less heart than Europeans.
In 2002, however, brought animal liberationists in Florida a legislative proposal on the banning of Kastenständen for sows to the vote.
On the surprise of many, the proposal was 55% of the electorate adopted.
Last month in Arizona despite expensive Gegeninitiativen of the agro-industry the prohibition of small Kastenständen for sows and calves with 62% of the popular vote also adopted.
Neither Florida or Arizona are particularly progressive countries -- in both George W. Bush defeated 2004 its competitors John Kerry.
The votes lay therefore suggests that the majority of Americans, they would have the opportunity to vote on - the attitude of pregnant sows and calves in close buffalo would ban.
The Americans seems animal welfare equally to be a concern as Europeans.
So the gap between Europe and the US in terms of Nutztierschutz to say that we should the political system under the microscope.
In Europe managed to the concerns of voters in the area of animal welfare parliamentarians in the individual countries and the Members of the European Parliament steady. This led to corresponding national Tierschutzgesetzen and directives, which take account of these concerns.
In contrast, had in the US concerns in the area of animal welfare no measurable impact on the congressman.
Neither administer at the level of the individual states, there is a legislation on the protection of animals.
The reason is, I think, to seek that representatives of the agro-industry capable of millions of dollars in the pockets of those congressman migrate to want to be re-elected.
In the field of lobbying and fundraising Tierschutzbewegung could, despite widespread public support with these targets set out not compete.
In the American electoral system is one more money than the opinion of the electorate.
The party discipline is weak and Congressmen must money for their re-election find themselves -- and such elections are in the case House of Representatives every two years.
In Europe, where the party discipline strongly and not the candidates, but the parties finance campaigns, money plays a smaller role.
In the US, where so proud of its democratic traditions, are hardly pigs and calves are the only losers.
What is new to the new Afghan All-Parteien-Armee?
(perhaps by the Afghan interim government itself instigated) murder of the Afghan Luftfahrtministers by a mob shows that the Afghan society is deeply divided.
The first reforms in the Afghan army these divisions only deepen.
The Defence Minister in Hamid Karzai's government in Kabul has the highest officers of this new army already appointed.
The Minister, General Mohammed Fahim, Tadschike from the northern region, Pandschir took three months ago command of the Alliance troops, the einnahmen Kabul, after them American bombers opened the way had.
Overall, his appointments a direct threat to Karzai's intentions to unite the country.
Afghanistan is a and multi-ethnic state of the Pashtuns with two fifths form the majority.
Every one fifth of the population are Hezaras and Tajiks.
Of the 38 Fahim collected officers in the Generalsrang thirty-seven Tajiks and Usbeke.
Each to military service pyramid members of the 15 to 17 million Euro-land community of the Pashtuns, will therefore under a command serve, almost exclusively from Tajiks.
The language of Pashtuns differs from the Tajiks, however, as much as English and Spanish millions of Pashtuns wehrfähigen age have at best fragmented knowledge of the Tajikistani language.
The geographical origin of the new military leadership is equally narrow, as its ethnic profile.
Thirty-five of 38 officers come from the region north of Kabul, to which the province Parwan (where the airport Baghram is) and Pandschir-Tal close to the former high temple of the Alliance, heard.
In other words, it for 27 leaders from the overall twenty-nine Afghan provinces the doors to the new military leadership of the country remained closed.
It may so closely broadly-based group the impression that it is a clique, deny if they at least one representative cross-section of more than a dozen Afghan parties would constitute.
However, this is not the case.
Eighteen of the 38 highest officers come from the Jamiat-e-Islami, an Islamic party, the long time by the former Theologieprofessor Mullah Burhanuddin Rabbani has been mentioned.
It is precisely this party governed in the middle of the 1990s of the last century for a short time in Kabul and that caused bloodshed and chaos, which led the most Afghans, the arrival of the Taliban to be welcomed.
Almost as many members of the Armeeführung come from the communist camps.
Sixteen of 38 officers were long associated with this party, whose tricks in the late 1970 of the last century to the Soviet invasion between 1979 and 1989, which led two and a half million Afghans lost their lives.
Today, the Communists in Afghanistan roughly as popular as Hitler’s Nazis in the Czech Republic or Poland.
Of course, there were the people in Afghanistan, as elsewhere of the Communist Party from the different reasons and certainly not all were convinced ideologues.
But six Fahim generals were professional staff of the Communist Party and remained after the invasion of the Red Army in the services of the Communists.
These six men and three other communists, in the Afghan army as served, officers collaborating during the ten years lasting occupation of Afghanistan with the Soviets.
Imagine, as the French would have responded, if a quarter of the French corps after the Second World War during the occupation of France would have collaborated Wehrmacht.
In Afghanistan spread news by mass-based quite quickly.
So Afghan nationalists (which almost all Afghans include) soon on the political background of Fahim generals know, if they do not do so already.
Even this crushing evidence of the unilateral and selective shaping the Armeekommandos could reasonably neutralised, if the generals at least professionalism and commitment to patriotic values in their work einbrächten.
Unfortunately, have but only ten of the 38 Fahim be transported officers on a military background.
One was pilot earlier.
On the contrary, twenty-four (the background of four generals is unknown) from the civil sector - either from the academic terms, from Communist Parteistuben or, as in the case of a former mullahs, from the religious area.
What are the consequences of these statistical data on the reality?
First of all, it means that the main commanders of the international peacekeeping troops in Afghanistan, American soldiers and diplomats in the event of a meeting with the Afghan Vizeverteidigungsminister, Abdul Rashid Dostum will take, for its brutality and corruption notorious warlords and Communists, still with old friends in the Red Army in Moscow in connection.
Furthermore, it means that the Commander-in-Chief of the Afghan forces, as well as the Chief of Staff and the head of the Enlightenment are also communists, whose loyalties are uncertain and which most Afghans distrust.
Can a team this by wars rent country again?
Is the presence of such a dubious team in Kabul suited to the confidence of three quarters of the Afghan population, the appointment of the Armeekommandos taking account to win?
Or is this list of appointees not rather the expression of Führungsstils following the motto 'everything for the winner? "Birgt such a approach is not the risk (at some point in the future), a bloody back to reopen backlash of those whose interests so cynically ignored?
Before this unscrupulous grip on power by a small minority and unpopular agree, the United Nations should, European and American policymakers consider answers to these questions.
The irrationality to honour
A threefold roll on the new Nobel laureate economist: Daniel Kahneman of the University of Princeton and Vernon Smith of George Mason university in Virginia.
How many Nobel prizes honour this awards not only the befruchtende work of Kahneman and blacksmith itself, but also the attitudes, whose leadership they contribute.
Kahneman is psychologist. He has shown how systematically individuals behave far less rational than they suggest orthodox economists.
His research shows not only that individuals sometimes quite different act as the prevailing economic theories predict, but also that they regularly, systematically and in a way because other hypotheses can understand and interpret. These hypotheses compete with those who use the orthodox economists.
For the majority of operators - and particularly for simple observers -- that seems to be no great news.
The broker on Wall Street, which shares act, which they know that they are waste, exploit the irrationality, Kahneman and blacksmith highlighted.
A large part of the obsession of the bursting of the economy has led to based to exploit the psychology of investors.
Indeed, this irrationality no news for Berufsökonomen.
John Maynard Keynes described a long time ago, not the stock exchange as an area of rational trading individuals struggle to uncover the bases of the market, but rather as a kind of beauty contest, in which the wins, the best guess whereby the panel will decide.
The Nobel Prize this year celebrating the criticisms of the simplified just Marktwirtschaftslehre, as the price in the last year (whose three winners, I was a) has done.
The winner of last year had stressed that various operators on different (and imperfect) information and that the inequality of their authoritative far-reaching impact on the functioning of the economy.
In particular, could the winners of last year recognise that in general markets do not work effectively and therefore an important role for the government to play remains.
Adam Smith's invisible hand -- the idea that free markets as led by invisible hand lead to economics -- is not to see, because it, zumTeil at least, there does not exist.
That too is nothing new, the day work on the market (and thus make their assets, that it from the inequality of the paramount benefits or by the fact that they overcome this).
For more than twenty years models draw 'rational appeasing "economists in their curse. The models assume that all operators the same (if not a total) update and act entirely rational, and that the markets fully efficient, and that there can be no unemployment (if not hungry unions or governments such by establishing minimum wages cause); they never Kreditverknappung.
That such models particularly to the universities America despite all Gegenbeweise prevail, on that ideology triumphed over science.
Unfortunately, students act such Aufbaustudienprogramme now in many countries as politicians and try there because of ideas which go so far as to market fundamentalism has mentioned to implement programmes.
Let me be perfectly clear: models rational expectations essential have contributed to the economic theory; the consequence of its followers on the economic thinking have applied, helped, the weaknesses of many fundamental hypotheses expose.
Good science acknowledges its own borders, but the prophets of the models rational expectations usually do not identify any such modesty.
Vernon Smith, was a leader in the development of experimental economy. your root idea that many wirtschaftstheoretische claims in certain arrangements in the laboratory could check.
One reason that economy such a difficult dried, and that it is under economists so little agreement, due to the fact that economists cannot undertake controlled experiments.
The nature are natural experiments. But in most cases change in them so many things so quickly, that it is often difficult to unravel, what is the cause of what was.
In principle we can in a laboratory implement controlled experiments and more reliable draw conclusions from it.
The critics of experimental economy to bear in mind that the subjects in the experimental situation bring thinking, from outside the Versuchssituation certainly, you think that the experiments therefore not as clean and the conclusions are not as clear as in science.
Yet give economic experiments insights into a number of important items, such as the improved management of auctions.
The most important result was that the irrationality of operators, which is central to the work of Kahneman was repeatedly confirmed in the context of laboratory examinations.
On the more charming results of the experimental economy include those altruism and selfishness refer.
It shows (at least in experimental situations), that the subjects are not so selfish, as the hypotheses require the economists - exempt is a group - the economists itself.
Is this because the economics as individuals attracts discipline, which is inherently selfish, or because the economics helps to shape individuals and it makes selfish?
The answer is with great security: A bit of both.
Presumably will future experimental research help to question the weight of the two hypotheses in relation to each other to resolve.
The Nobel Prize stresses how important it is that people and whole economies as they are, to study and not as we would like.
Only if we are the real behaviour of the people better understand, we can also hope to draw up a policy that meant that our economies work better.
Bush's evil intentions in energy policy
In the surrealeren meetings of this year's World Economic Forum in Davos declared experts from the oil industry, that the melting of the polar ice cap -- that happens faster than anyone had predicted -- not only a problem, but also a chance: Large amounts of oil are perhaps available.
Similarly, these experts acknowledge the fact that the United States maritime law (the International Convention, which certainly, who access to Offshore-Öl, and other rights of raw materials in the sea regulates) have not signed, put a risk with international conflict.
But they again point to the advantages out: the oil industry must in their never never-ending search for further reserves the Congress did not ask for the right to plunder Alaska.
President George W. Bush has a sinister talent, the great message to overlook.
For years is increasingly clear that its energy policy some things that are not true.
From a previous Energiegesetz, dictated by the oil industry was said, even members of his own party that "no lobbyist was forgotten."
While he embraces the benefits of the free market, Bush is only ready to Energiebranche huge contributions to send, even if the US high deficits into the House.
The market failed in energy, but intervention by the government should exactly go in the other direction, as the Bush administration has proposed.
The fact that the Americans do not full price for pollution pay from their wasteful energy what emerges -- particularly from their contribution to greenhouse gases -- means that energy under price is offered, thereby maintaining the excessive consumption.
The government must promote the environment, intervention in the pricing system -- and energy taxes -- an effective way.
But instead to promote the environment, Bush has pursued a policy of America first throttles and dependent in the future of foreign oil makes.
He is regardless of the great demand in oil prices drives the level and windfall for many brings in the Middle East, not to America's friends count.
Now, over four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, seems Bush finally the reality of America's growing dependence to be awakened; in the level soaring oil prices, it was difficult for him, the consequences not to say.
But again the fluctuating steps his government things in the future even worse.
Bush refuses still to do something for the environment, and he has permanent prayers, that the technology will save us, with very little money equipped.
So what can be of Bush recently declared commitment to keep America within 25 years to 75% irrespective of oil from the Middle East?
For investors the message is clear: Investment not more in the opening up of reserves in the Middle East, Ölquelle far lowest cost of the world.
But without new investment in the enhancement of reserves in the Middle East means the unbridled increase in energy consumption in the US, China and elsewhere, that the demand will exceed supply.
As would not be enough to risk Bush with its threat of sanctions against Iran, that it is in the supply of one of the world's largest Ölförderer interruptions.
Especially Weltölförderung almost has achieved its full capacity and the prices are already more than twice as high as before the Iraq war, this indicates even higher profits for the Ölbrache out -- the only clear winner in Bush's Middle East policy.
After all, it should be given credit for Bush, that he has at least recognise that there is a problem.
But, as always, suggests a more accurate reflection of his proposals for a further cover-up of his government out.
Not enough, that he refuses to the importance of global warming acknowledge, to promote environmental protection or sufficient funds in the research stuck to really change things -- also Bush's superb promises, the dependence on oil from Middle East to reduce, less important than it seems.
Since only 20% of US-Öls from the Middle East, it could be objective by a slight shift its spree achieve.
However, one would think that the Bush Administration must surely say that oil in a global market is traded.
Even if America 100% regardless of the Nahostöl, could be a decline in the oil from the Middle East devastating effects on the world price -- and on the American economy.
As so often in the Bush administration, there is no flattering explanation for the official policy.
power Bush political manoeuvrings, giving anti-Arab and antiiranischen feelings in America encourages?
Or is just another example of incompetence and confusion?
After what we have seen in the last five years, the right answer is likely that more than just a little evil intentions and sheer incompetence are at stake.
The Chinese roadmap
China is the adoption of its eleventh Five-Year Plan because the way for the continuation of the probably remarkable economic change in the history of paved.
At the same time, so that the welfare almost a quarter of the world's population promoted. Never the world has so seen sustainable growth and never before has poverty in such a scale reduced.
Sometimes the long-term success of China on its almost unique combination of pragmatism and vision due.
While most of the developing countries by the Washington Consensus towards unrealistic increases of GDP were pushed, China made clear once again that there is a sustainable and fair distributed increase of living wants.
In China sees that a period of growth has achieved, in which there are huge -- and unacceptable -- burden on the environment.
Without changes of direction the standard of living is ultimately at risk.
For this reason is a priority of the new Five-Year Plan on environmental issues.
Even many of the more backward areas China’s grow at a speed, which would be equivalent to a miracle, if not other parts would grow faster.
While thereby could reduce poverty, but inequality with the growing differences between town and country and between coastal regions and the interior has risen.
This year's report on human development from the World Bank explains why not only poverty, but also inequality should be a concern and in the eleventh Five-Year Plan China takes decided to this problem.
The government has on several years spoke of a harmonious society and the plan describes ambitious programmes, in order to achieve this objective.
It is also in China sees that the difference between developing countries and more developed countries, not only in a gap of resources, but in a gap of knowledge.
Therefore, in China bold plans, not only to close this gap, but also a basis for independent innovations to create.
China's role in the world and the world economy has changed and this fact in this five-year plan taken into account.
The future growth will not so much on exports, but based on domestic demand, hence the need to stimulate consumption would be the result.
Indeed, China has to contend with a problem rare: with a surplus of savings.
The people in China save partly due to the weaknesses in the state social security system. A strengthening of social security (pensions) and the health and education at the same time help reduce social inequality, the feeling of prosperity in the public improve and boost the current consumption.
If that is -- and, until now even China has its own ambitions are almost always exceeded -- these adjustments could tremendous burden for a global economic system, by the huge American fiscal and trade deficits already is unbalanced.
If in China will save less - and if, as announced by public side, a broad range strategy for the investment of its reserves followed -- who will then the US current-account deficit of over 2 billion dollars per day finance?
This issue is not currently topical, but it could come.
Despite the clear grand design is the challenge in the implementation of the strategy.
China is a vast country and it would not have come this far, if there is no widespread decentralisation exist.
However, arising from the decentralisation own problems.
For example, the greenhouse gases are a global problem.
While America believes that it could not afford to do something about this, the Chinese policymakers acted responsibly.
Within a month after the adoption of the plan have been new environmental taxes on cars, petrol and wood products introduced: China used therefore market-based mechanisms, the environmental problems of the country and the world under control.
The pressure on local government officials to produce economic growth and jobs, but will be enormous.
They are the utmost subject to temptation to say that, if America an environmentally-friendly production cannot afford to how should work in China?
To vision in action, the Chinese government will need sound policies, such as environmental already introduced.
With the development of China in the direction of a market economy, arose for the country problems with which to fight industrialised countries: interests, the selfish arguments behind a little veil from conceal ideology.
Some of the so-called "Trickle-Down-Economy" advocate, that is to say, a system in which the prosperity of top down leaked: We make the poor not worry, because ultimately all benefit from economic growth.
Others will be against competition policy and strict Unternehmensführungsgesetze turn: We shall only Darwin Darwinian their miracles.
To strong social and environmental strategies counter to be made Wachstumsargumente: higher fuel taxes, for example, would our emerging car destroy.
With such supposedly growth-oriented strategies would not only bring about no growth, but also the whole vision of the Chinese future threat.
There is only one way to prevent: Open discussions on economic policies, to expose errors and room for creative solutions to the many challenges facing China today.
George W. Bush the dangers of excessive secrecy and a decision-making within a small Zirkels Kriechern shown.
The contrary to Bush's tactics, the scale of the extensive discussions and deliberations of the Chinese leadership (even foreigners) in their efforts to find solutions to the enormous problems is the most people outside China does not really goutiert.
economies does not regulate itself.
One cannot simply automatic, especially not if the benefits a maximum visibility achieve.
The management of a market economy, however, is not an easy task.
It is rather a balancing act, which constantly to respond to economic changes.
The eleventh Five-Year Plan of China is a roadmap for how these reactions be visibly.
The world is looking in awe and hope to China, as the lives of 1.3 billion people will continue to change.
Tocquevilles democratic lessons
It seems only reasonable that the world today, 200 years after the birth Alexis de Tocquevilles, because of the war in Iraq on the nature of democracy debated.
Tocqueville deserves the glory for the fact that he reactionary yearning for the Last disregarded and the triumph of democracy as our destiny regarded -- and at the same time warned against the dangers of democracy for freedom.
Should we his fears are still share?
Tocqueville regarded the democracy is not solely as a political Herrschaftsform, but primarily as an intellectual Ordnungssystem, that the customs of society in general does because he gave the concept of a sociological and psychological dimension.
Democratic systems, argued Tocqueville, determine our thoughts, wishes and passions.
Just as the Renaissance One and, in the 20th century, the homo sovieticus is the 'democratic man "a form of human existence.
Tocqueville was of the opinion that the systemic effects of democracy can lead to the citizens refuse of reason.
They would then simply claim that events and values to assess independently, but in reality merely the brute and simplizistischen opinions of the masses accept.
Indeed, what Tocqueville the control of "social power" on the opinion called in democratic systems probably most pronounced -- a approach to the increase in the demagogy and manipulation of modernity takes away.
Tocqueville believed that there is no long-term effective opportunities for restricting this trend admit.
Neither local democracy or small companies, mutual state control or civil rights might stop the decline of the critical thought that the democracy seem to cause.
schools could little more than enclaves within the erosion power of the social impacts on the role of thought.
Similarly, there is, even if Tocqueville believed that the pursuit virtue in terms of ancient or a religious belief sometimes raise the soul, a conflict between the two and the democratic ideal, if it in relation to public life would be officially prescribed.
In this sense, belong to Tocquevilles intellectual heirs around the neomarxistischen theorists the Frankfurt school and Hannah Arendt, all above all others the disintegration of reason in modern societies feared.
Indeed, was the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet a recently published book entitled La démocratie contre elle-même (democracy against itself).
The democratic lifestyle, argue this authors, tends to independent thinking and to destroy the "high culture" to suppress; the result was a mediocrity, which citizens vulnerable to the enemies of democracy make.
But while the history of murderous regimes, which eingeschüchterte and getäuschte masses praises, only riddled with, the greater danger for democratic nations, is that their citizens are in favour of an immediate satisfying in apathy and withdraw short-term thinking.
The past -- despite the rituals, the memory of historic moments aspire -- blurred by addiction to the Now and the new.
Even the supposedly educated ruling class subject this Betörung.
The heart of the democratic spirit is its lack of historical awareness.
Does the shortcomings of democracy really, as Tocqueville claimed that the only -- realistic but not to maintain the sustained -- the path is open to us, schicksalsergebener pessimism?
I think not.
There are means to combat the growing 'democratic stupidity "our might call days.
The first line of defence is the search for an education system that really critical heads breeds, and by the (today) largely neglected subjects of literature, history and philosophy.
If we want to citizenry and critical citizens must be used, such as democracy, it needs our schools must stop the up-to-date fashion chase and start to the analytical capabilities of the pupils to promote.
The biggest obstacle on the road to this form of education are the media with their tendency to cultivation of superficiality and meet.
Many people now spend a larger proportion of their lives before the television than in the classroom.
The passivity, to encourage the media, is diametrically opposed to that active commitment, characterised democratic citizens.
However, it is hard to imagine that the mass media (demanding newspapers apart) of their own accord to instruments of education, which would be expanded the critical capabilities of the citizens.
This concern with regard to the media is not a mere elitistische contempt for popular culture.
The question is not the popularity alone -- Mozart was finally to his time popular, and Shakespeare dramatic lockten the poor, as well as the rich -- but the refusal of the Mass culture to challenge the thinking and to provoke.
The result of this failure is a general indifference and passivity of the audience.
Indeed, a globalised media literacy, which is incapable of the ability to critical thinking to promote or arouse higher feelings, have long been on the march.
It is a culture, the Achtlosigkeit democratic freedoms threatened, because they failed to produce some form of responsibility -- whether to society, the history or the Community.
Is it too late, something against a culture to take the spirit in this way abtötet?
Tocqueville despised the elites of his time for their complacency in the face of the entwurzelnden Massendemokratie power.
Will the short-sightedness our leaders contribute to its worrying prophecy reality?
A Europe for all
Ancient members of the European Union seem at the future of the Union to doubt, against we look in Ukraine with hope and admiration of the European Union.
The basic aim of our foreign policy, on the progress of the EU participate, because Ukraine has stated that national unity no end, but a start.
The European unity is indivisible: if a nation will be excluded, are all free.
We unentrinnbar Europeans are trapped in a network, our fates are interconnected.
Every aspect of our common culture, if not the last century of suffering common, confirms this.
As a European country directly concerned, affects all indirectly.
We can close idea of two Europe -- the Betuchten and the have-nots, the fortunate and the outcasts -- never again afford.
All who live on the European continent, cannot, they must not be excluded from the Union remain.
The current major European peace and today’s pan-European prosperity depend on it.
Of course, grumble some people, that Ukraine is not Europe.
They should come to Kiev and speak with the people, the young, such as the old, with factory workers, Bauernfrauen, lawyers, doctors and teachers, the last winter weeks in the cold and snow were and ausharrten, in order to defend their freedom.
Are they not associated with the General de Gaulle in the French resistance beistanden?
Are they not one with those in the fight for the Spanish Republic died in the 1930, Budapest in 1956 liberated and fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970s concluded?
Are they not from the same spirit as Poland’s Solidarnosc-Bewegung and the peaceful masses, the 1989 the Velvet Revolution in Prague hervorbrachten?
This is the true European spirit, and no doubt can break it.
To those who believe that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership, I say: they should in my country and look at the mothers, the late in the evening to the work remain and their children to their Firmenrechner explain how a computer used.
They should in the language centres to open in every village and every city go, in which young people prepare for Europe by learn French, German and English.
Those in the European ethos of Ukraine doubt, should understand that Europe is not a question of hardware and motorways is the insatiable desire for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.
I believe that our future is promising, as Europe’s past is proud, and that we are not our destiny as the borderland forgotten deadlines in a troubled region must, but that we Europe’s peace and unity as Macher shape.
Self-determination is no longer synonymous with isolation, because the achievement of the national independence means today only the return to the world with a new status.
New nations able to their former occupiers a similar productive relationship build such as France to Germany -- a relationship based on equality and mutual interests is based.
Such relationship tried my government to Russia, and by we achieve this, we can help the European territory enlargement, in which there is peace.
Of course, it is premature to do more than the high reputation express the prospect of membership enjoys.
We know that our part of this large building is not being erected overnight.
We know that the great achievements of European unification is not in documents and declarations, but in innovative steps to improve the lives of all Europeans and their safety.
It will not be easy to cheap or quickly to do to build a Ukraine, worthy of membership.
However, as the EU itself will be completed and built.
We know that this is a great challenge, but the price is worth the effort, and Europe should know that this is our objective.
The Erneuerungsarbeit of Ukraine is part of a creative fight, alptraumhaftes century to end, fascism and communism -- ideologies, at the heart of Europe were born -- tried to gain the upper hand.
Only a few months ago were our children and parents in towns everywhere in the Ukraine armed forces, growly dogs and even death towards.
Only a few years ago was the young journalist Georgi Gongadze, the public about the corruption of the old regime wanted to clarify, the thugs of the regime and mistreated beheading.
But our Orange Revolution shows the last winter, that the Ukrainian people has won.
That is why I remain despite the current doubts and difficulties in my unshakeable belief in Europe.
Madam President, I refuse to desperation as a last answer to the confused and cruel history of Ukraine to accept.
Madam President, I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine so tragically sternenlose night of communist heritage is tied that we will never glory Morgendämmerung of peace and the true European unity see.
If the EU citizens on the place of Ukraine reflect in Europe, they should look beyond the facade, which they see that they should but they also look into.
They should the devastated wasteland vorbeisehen communism has caused over, poverty and social differences, with which our ausrangierten former leaders tried to extend their mismanagement.
Instead, they should be the face of our President Viktor Yushchenko, look at the last year in the election campaign was distorted by a Giftangriff, and the words of the great French André Malraux remember, "the finest faces the injured."
The Muslim civil war
Is the gap between Sunni and Shiites in the Middle East is currently deeper than the hostility between Israel and the Arabs?
Given the reaction of some Arab governments to the decision of Hezbollah, attacking Israel, could be my.
Even as Israeli bombs in Beirut and Tyrus were convicted, Saudi Arabia, perhaps the conservative non-Arab state of all, open the actions of the Shiite Hezbollah, the conflict with Israel would have incited.
Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, a state that themselves as leader of the Arab peoples considered, Israel as openly supports.
Moreover, Saudi Arabia break with Hezbollah is not an isolated case.
Egypt and Jordan have Hezbollah and its leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah opted for their bravado condemned.
What is behind this amazing development?
Will we witnessed a fundamental change in the relationship between arabischem nationalism and Islamic sectarian reasons?
power of the Shia Islam the Sunni Saudi authorities more concerns and fear, as the Arab unity and the cause of the Palestinians committed?
The Arab condemnations of Hezbollah indicate that the gap between the Muslim denominations in the daily violence in Iraq is already clear, throughout the Middle East deepened and strengthened.
President George W. Bush's desire to deadlock societies in the Arab world shock, the modernising forces must make against the traditional elements in the Arab and Islamic societies embarking.
Instead, he seems atavistic forces of the region unleashed.
The opening this Pandora 's box could be a new and hässlichere era of general violence have heralded, perhaps they can only be described as "Muslim war'.
The gap between Shiites and Sunnis exists since the beginning of Islam, but the geographical and ethnic isolation of the non-Arab Shiite Iran, together with the rule sunnitisch-arabischer countries on their Shiite minorities this rivalry in the background.
The tensions triggered further in the wake of the "Islamization" by the Iranian Revolution arose, so that the konfessionsgebundene identity of the Arabs as further Sunnis pushed into the background, while a general "Islamic" self-confidence hervortrat.
All this is changed, as Al Qaeda, a Sunni terrorist group, much of the wahabitischen ideology and the staff of the Saudis has adopted, in September 2001 attacked America.
A explicitly Sunni variant of militant Islam was now on the march.
The fact that the United States both the Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan and the Sunni Iraqi regime declared the war, encouraged this new, radical Sunni trend only.
The newly self-confident Sunni Arabs take Israel and the West than just a threat true, the other covers the so-called "Shi'a crescent" -- the Landbogen from Lebanon on Syria and Iraq until Iran extends and häretischen Shia supposedly inhabited.
As guardian of sacred sites of Muslim faith in Mecca and Medina feel the Saudi Arabia's rulers perhaps this threat in the most impassioned.
In the eyes of the Sunnis the Shia prevail, not only on the oil-rich areas in Iran, Iraq and in the East Saudi Arabia, but also try -- by the actions of Hezbollah --, the role of the "Schutzherrn" of the central dream of all Arabs to usurp the Palestinian question.
Because the Saudi royal its legitimacy of a strict form of Islam Sunni derived and loyalty its Shi-ite population doubts, the Kingdom contacted against Hezbollah.
Ironically, there was America, for a long time Saudi Arabia protector, the rise in power of the Shiites, by allowed plunged Saddam Hussein and Shiite parties in Iraq brought to power.
The Bush administration seems to see what it has done; while the Shiite not told them in the east of the Arab world aufspannt, the US try their protection of the Sunni arc -- Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia -- in the West to strengthen the region.
Israel, once implacable enemy of Arab matter, now seems in the midst of this improving defence structures embedded.
But such Verteidigungsstellung necessarily because of pan-Arab feelings unstable.
At the moment posted normal Saudi citizens al-Dschasira and other Arab Satelliten-Fernsehsendern, the events in Gaza and southern Lebanon witness.
You see, as Arab (not Shi'a) will shed blood and Hezbollah exclusively areawith against.
In their eyes Hizbollah is a model for the heroic resistance become.
This has the Saudi state led to the division between Sunnis and Shia to deepen.
After the Kingdom officially reproaching those Hizbollah had called the Saudi state its official wahabitischen clerics to express fatwas to Hizbollah as Shi'a apostates and heretics condemn.
Such convictions can only the religious divisions within Saudi Arabia and exacerbate the region.
Will the Sunni regimes, when these differences deepen, convinced that their own Hezbollah is needed in their land to fight?
If they are to this conclusion should be that they do not need to look for a long time, because many such fighters have already been trained -- of Al Qaeda.
Europe must not forget Georgia
The times in which Europe could rely on America in the backyard Europe’s wars, which is includes peace and democracy, are introducing is past.
With the enlargement of the European Union and as the latest Russian gas crisis to see, not only heard the Ukraine backyard, but also Georgia.
Just as in the Ukraine democracy will at the moment in Georgia also put to the test and Europe cannot afford to ignore this development.
Georgia was the first post-Soviet country in which there is a "color revolution" came and where the people of their choice for democracy and European values with dignity and maturity demonstrated.
The flags of the European Union, since all the public buildings flown in Georgia, demonstrate a natural link to Europe, which goes back as far as the story of a country since the time of the ancient Greece part and parcel of the world known was.
Prometheus, Medea Amazonen and Ark Noah in neighbouring Armenia show that European myths took their outcome.
With its history, culture and its traditions -- the critical, independent and even rebellious spirit from the days of belonging to the former Soviet counts -- Georgia would be the ideal candidate for a successful democratization.
It is therefore all the more serious that this democratization do not succeed.
This had begun everything as well.
Political reforms, privatisation, Anti-Korruptionsmaßnahmen, the search for new links with the former regime pristine leaders and the introduction of a pro-European foreign policy were stretched to any resistance.
But enters the totalitarian attitude of some leaders highlighted again today, under the pretext to represent the majority, more and more power to usurp.
Similarly, the ancient Greek Hydra tense the political elite Georgia’s always over again.
It is precisely those people and Herrschaftspraktiken that the "Rose Revolution" in November 2003 finished wanted to appear once again to seize power in this, they serve their on the borders of Georgia that go beyond the requirements networks and their fantastic wealth and their skill in political intrigue and manipulation.
This has little to do with real democracy, not only through elections, but also by separation of powers is characterised.
The government interfering in the affairs of Parliament, which, for its part, is again trying to governmental until into mere detail to manage -- in my case was the attempt to the nomination of ambassadors and their functioning to determine!
Another serious problem is the lack of judicial independence, thereby undermining the rule of law and urgently needed private investment will be obstructed.
The Georgian democracy exists in the head, but not the hearts: the people despise the policy still as a dirty business. We will leave those the ground, which is actually long should have withdrawn.
The hope of democracy, however, in the people, the organisations of civil society and the media deeply rooted.
It is now up to Europe to ensure that this hope not extinguished.
The United States have already everything in its power done to political stability in Georgia since its independence to support.
During the term of Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister, the presidency during the Rose Revolution lost, this stability was not always equated with democracy.
But the Americans invested generous in the survival of democratic ideas and their proponents.
Although the Rose Revolution not as claimed by Russian nationalists, the work of the financier George Soros supported Foundation was, this has undoubtedly encouraged the democratic foundations, encouraged and supported.
For the consolidation of its democracy needs Georgia but a different kind of support, the more Europe can offer.
The balance of forces, the practice in justice and local democracy must be in accordance with European models that is the reality of the Georgian comply rather than the Anglo-Saxon models American mould.
By rejecting this challenge, Europe would its fundamental responsibility towards a small, Mediterranean, flexible country with betrayed old traditions, where democracy a much greater chance of success than in the vast and still very Soviet spirit arrested Ukraine, let alone to Central Asia.
The refusal to Georgia in his battle to support democracy would very probably the democratic process in Ukraine, Belarus and even in Russia itself delay.
It is therefore more and more at stake.
Although Russia and its Großmachtträumen never power renunciation, had the inevitability of democracy, at least accept at the borders.
But this reluctant acceptance of some normality in relations with its neighbours was always vulnerable to the sudden Wiederausbruch Russia’s famous irrational "Derschawa" -- an aggressive, the ethos glorifies the state and its strength from the exploitation of weaknesses of the other concerns.
That is the key to understanding of the latest Russian gas crisis.
It is true that any signs of a withdrawal of democracy in Georgia and other post-Soviet states Russia’s neoimperialistische ambitions revived.
It is Europe's responsibility to convince Russia that there is no hope of a return to the past.
Europe must accept this role, not only to ensure the independence of its future energy supply, but also to demonstrate that the European values freedom, democracy and justice between peoples really stand on solid foundations.
In order to be successful, Europe must provide the necessary tools: need a large semi-public foundation for the promotion and support political reforms, a university for the training of future managers in burgeoning democracies, and police and a host of judges and courts, those models breathe life, which we want to follow.
Above all, however, Europe needs conviction.
If the Europe of today cannot convince themselves that there is a fundamental interest in the future of its neighbours, who will then tomorrow believe in Europe?
