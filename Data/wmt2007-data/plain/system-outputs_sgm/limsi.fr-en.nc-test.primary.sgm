<seg id=1> The racial house divided Europe</seg>
<seg id=2> The European far right is characterised by its racism and its use of immigration as a political dissent.</seg>
<seg id=3> The Lega Nord in Italy, the Vlaams Blok Holland, the National Front of Le Pen in France, are all examples of parties or movements trained on current aversion to immigrants and promoting simplistic policies to control them.</seg>
<seg id=4> While individuals as Jorg Haidar and Jean-Marie Le Pen can go and (never come early enough), the question of race will never be closed European policy in the near future.</seg>
<seg id=5> An aging population and borders increasingly open imply a growing racial fragmentation in European countries.</seg>
<seg id=6> The main parties of the centre left and centre right have met this prospect in the sand, hoping against all expectations that the problem would disappear.</seg>
<seg id=7> This will not be the case, as clearly demonstrates the racial history of America.</seg>
<seg id=8> The racial relations in the US have monopolised for decades - and still have cornered - the political agenda, since the racial divisions are as important as the income, if not most, as determining factors of political preferences and attitudes.</seg>
<seg id=9> The first step to address the issue of racial policy is to understand the origin and the consequences of racial animosity, even if it means finding unpleasant truths to hear.</seg>
<seg id=10> That is precisely the aim pursued largely by research teams in economic sciences, sociology, in psychology and in political science in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=11> This research shows that the representatives of different races are much less confidence with each other; the whites are less inclined to support for social expenditure which, according to them, foster minorities; communities have more fragmented racialement inefficient governments, of corruption and influence peddling more crime rate higher and less productive public goods per dollar imposed.</seg>
<seg id=12> This does not mean that we should eliminate the heterogeneity and create uniform racialement communities, but it is necessary to recognise the reality of these problems to begin to develop sound public policies relating to racial relations.</seg>
<seg id=13> Of course, the Americans are opposed to use methods.</seg>
<seg id=14> Some argue in favour of action programmes affirmatifs who give preference to minorities in the allocation of employment, the admission to university and public contracts.</seg>
<seg id=15> These policies are seen as a means of redress for injustices of the past and, more importantly, to create role models and overcome discrimination and perhaps remaining unintentional.</seg>
<seg id=16> Others are protesting against affirmative action and support a policy that does not race, with free market policies and values family pro, is enough to create jobs for minorities and to help not to separate the black families.</seg>
<seg id=17> The latter is crucial in any policy as one of the most significant causes of poverty in the US is the spread of lone parents (i.e. single mothers) in the black community.</seg>
<seg id=18> Whatever the right answer, the question is that the measures concerning race is a dominant problem in American politics.</seg>
<seg id=19> Of course, the minorities have made progress towards greater integration and economic success.</seg>
<seg id=20> In the 1950s, the blacks are not allowed to sit before buses, two of the main players in the American foreign policy are blacks.</seg>
<seg id=21> We cannot deny that the right-wing American politicians continue to deploy the ‘ race card ’ as a tactical tool.</seg>
<seg id=22> Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, who won the former assistant of Nixon and Reagan who has brought independent presidential candidate during the last election.</seg>
<seg id=23> It has recently published a book entitled ‘ The Death to success of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasion Imperil Our Country and Civilization '.</seg>
<seg id=24> But for every book like this, there are ten others which contain a serious analysis of the race issue in America.</seg>
<seg id=25> The analysis and political debates Race Relations have a considerable delay in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=26> Moreover, the issue is examined closely in terms of immigration quotas and restrictions of borders, not in terms of opportunities and social problems created by an increasingly racialement Europe mixed.</seg>
<seg id=27> Of course, a clear immigration policy is needed to prevent the accumulation of illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id=28> But it is not enough: the border controls in Mexico does not mean the end of the American policy on the internal problems of race!</seg>
<seg id=29> Europe is rich and its population is aging rapidly: the Europeans, strengthened generous social assistance programmes, are not prepared to accept the ‘ dirty jobs ’ in, say, agriculture and the leather industry.</seg>
<seg id=30> This attitude is unavoidable increased immigration.</seg>
<seg id=31> The Europeans are quick to criticise the United States for the failures of their policy towards minorities and for all manifestations of racism across the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id=32> The reading of the European press often show a superior to the US on racial issues: they (the Americans) have problems with racism; we are unaffected against him, except skinheads neo-Nazis mad and their counterparts.</seg>
<seg id=33> What happened in recent weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, shows that the racial problem in Europe goes deeper and to cause the sad truth is that are inherently difficult race relations and confidence and a cooperative behaviour does not travel well on racial lines.</seg>
<seg id=34> If the main parties in Europe have not taken more seriously to understand the racial tensions that exist in their country and for placing 'race' at the centre of their priorities, individuals such as Le Pen always try to fill the gap with their message of hatred.</seg>
<seg id=35> Combating the exception française</seg>
<seg id=36> The attention of Europe is today and with about any geared towards enlargement and the constitution being negotiated between the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=37> However, the result of several taken of tooth Gallic with the European Commission will be less important to determine the fate of the new enlarged Europe.</seg>
<seg id=38> France has chosen unilaterally to ignore the Stability and Growth Pact leaving run its deficit beyond the limit of 3% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=39> The French love talking about rational rigour indemnity, but where budgets are concerned, Descartes is no longer needed and into confusion.</seg>
<seg id=40> France was one of the main criticism of Ireland when, in 2000, the Irish Government réduisit its budget surplus, then to 4%, as a simple 0.5%.</seg>
<seg id=41> Other countries did not comply with the Stability Pact, but France is the first country to do so with a slight smile satisfied openly contemptuous.</seg>
<seg id=42> None of this should not surprise.</seg>
<seg id=43> France is only applying the usual European regulations very well established to treat culture as an exception.</seg>
<seg id=44> Thus France a veto systematically opposed to any reform of the common agricultural policy of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=45> As everyone knows, the CAP is a fine gift offered to rich European farmers (particularly French farmers) worthy whatsoever, at the expense of farmers in difficulty developing countries and European consumers.</seg>
<seg id=46> France is also trying to go back to the old policies to boost private companies in deficit and about to collapse using public money.</seg>
<seg id=47> The European Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, cannot lose this battle: it needs the support of those who believe in markets and equal treatment for all.</seg>
<seg id=48> History is simple.</seg>
<seg id=49> The French Government intends to bail out Alstom, a company which has developed high-tech products, including the TGV high-speed train, the French, but which recently is bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id=50> The French government proclaims it never abandon its plan to rescue Alstom, for a plan which has all the usual dirigiste motives: maintaining employment, investor protection, etc.</seg>
<seg id=51> Moreover, since Alstom is a high-tech company, the French government is playing the card of research and development, suggesting that the R & D investment is beneficial to growth.</seg>
<seg id=52> The saving Alstom by nationalising the company is evidently wrong.</seg>
<seg id=53> The company is made up of various units, some profitable, other bankrupt: it is obvious that we must abandon it.</seg>
<seg id=54> The profitable units such the TGV could easily; the buyer loss-making units must be closed down.</seg>
<seg id=55> The French taxpayers' money will be better spent in the temporary costs of conversion of employees rather than to sustain a company which is not profitable.</seg>
<seg id=56> It is important that the European Commission does not allow France to obtain laws for itself in the policies on competition, as it seems to be doing with budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=57> The Commission must condemn the public financing of private companies in France as it condemns any other European state subsidies.</seg>
<seg id=58> The Commission has already achieved some success in this area, notably by forcing Germany to cancel the government guarantees of public banks.</seg>
<seg id=59> France and Alstom in particular in general must not be an exception and must meet the same standards.</seg>
<seg id=60> If the Commission does not act, the European Union even more to shape a playground for the French officials.</seg>
<seg id=61> France has already taken the lead of the European Union's foreign policy with its foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, and which is increasingly resembling a Foreign Minister of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=62> At the same time, France ignores the basic regulations of common economic policy and government aid for private companies.</seg>
<seg id=63> The European Commission perdra-t-elle the little credibility it remains to be a minor Parisian rounding?</seg>
<seg id=64> Losing on the issue of Alstom would have serious repercussions in Europe and not only for the policies on competition.</seg>
<seg id=65> The war for oil</seg>
<seg id=66> For decades, both the Republicans, Democrats have the same objectives: keep oil in which the stability of oil prices, reduce smoothly domestic consumption, reduce the dependence on imports and diversify foreign sources of supply.</seg>
<seg id=67> Despite appearances, these objectives are always the same today, under the Bush administration.</seg>
<seg id=68> Many observers believe that the invasion of Iraq, Bush has chosen another path.</seg>
<seg id=69> A increased Iraqi production likely to increase US oil dependency.</seg>
<seg id=70> The price of a barrel of oil will undoubtedly with the emergence of a new source of supply, hence increased dependence US, particularly against the East.</seg>
<seg id=71> Paradoxically, the US were exercising more control over the Iraqi oil programme "Nourriture against oil UN" before the war (it was the UN and not Saddam Hussein who set the level of Iraqi exports) that they cannot do it in a future democratic Iraqi state.</seg>
<seg id=72> If the Bush administration sought stable oil supply sources, safe, cheap and diversified, it was sufficient to lift the embargo on Libya, Iran, Iraq and Sudan and let it flow of oil.</seg>
<seg id=73> But the interests of America for Iraqi oil is not dictated by the economy or by energy policy.</seg>
<seg id=74> The Bush administration acknowledged that Iraqi oil is primarily a geopolitical asset.</seg>
<seg id=75> Who controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=76> Saddam has had its power to the fact that it controlled the second world oil reserves.</seg>
<seg id=77> It knew perfectly well what it was in black gold.</seg>
<seg id=78> Faced with the possibility of the invasion and defeat it threatened to the Iraqi oil fields fire.</seg>
<seg id=79> The pillages and looting of Iraqi oil and pipelines shows that almost everyone has understood that control oil is controlling the country.</seg>
<seg id=80> In preparing the invasion by the USA, the securing of oil fields was a priority.</seg>
<seg id=81> The aim was not to increase supply or lower prices on the American market, but the overthrow of Saddam and his replacement by a new government.</seg>
<seg id=82> The future of Iraq is linked to oil production.</seg>
<seg id=83> But given the vagaries of the oil market, especially in a very unstable situation, we cannot see how the Bush administration will achieve its objectives in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id=84> The problem is simple.</seg>
<seg id=85> The US must use oil earnings to ease the burden of the Iraqi regime change based on US taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id=86> In the long term, any plan depends on the ability of Iraq to export large quantities of oil.</seg>
<seg id=87> If Iraq does not produce oil, President Bush cannot keep the promises it made to the Iraqi people, the American people and the international community.</seg>
<seg id=88> Before the invasion, Iraq had a production capacity of three million barrels of oil a day.</seg>
<seg id=89> But it will come back to this level of production in the time allotted to establish an Iraqi government.</seg>
<seg id=90> Increased requires the development of oil installations, which requires substantial investment, an established government and political stability.</seg>
<seg id=91> No one, the Bush administration, expects that these conditions are met soon.</seg>
<seg id=92> The political stability is the precondition for increasing production capacity.</seg>
<seg id=93> The experience of Iran, Kuwait, Russia and Iraq, shows that approximately three years of political stability before production capacity can increase significantly and sustainable.</seg>
<seg id=94> It will be some years to Iraq for drafting a new constitution, establish a democratic government, negotiate oil income distribution between the various regions, regulate investment and make the economy attractive to foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id=95> He must also time to negotiate with the multinational oil companies and neighbouring countries undertaking the feasibility studies and necessary technical studies and reconstruction, rehabilitation and exploring its oil fields.</seg>
<seg id=96> Thus, even a period of 3 years seems optimistic, because it means that during this time continuing occupation, Iraqis put up their own government and that any political instability.</seg>
<seg id=97> But the reality may be quite different.</seg>
<seg id=98> There may be serious tensions over the years.</seg>
<seg id=99> And it is not surprising that the Iraqi oil production is suddenly halt, even with a democratic government.</seg>
<seg id=100> History shows that strikes and social unrest which can occur more easily disrupted oil production in a democratic context that under a dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id=101> If Iraq is unable to increase its oil production in the next few years, this will be a thorn in the foreign policy, both for the US energy policy.</seg>
<seg id=102> How will they be able to finance long-term reconstruction of Iraq?</seg>
<seg id=103> Who pays for the maintenance of a fragile democracy in Iraq?</seg>
<seg id=104> The US to maintain their occupation of the Iraqi people without ensuring food, medical and other basic services?</seg>
<seg id=105> These are difficult issues, and we cannot respond before a democratic regime and does not guarantee controls Iraqi oil production.</seg>
<seg id=106> Leaving killers defend human rights</seg>
<seg id=107> If it were not so sad, this would be the Millennium grim joke: Libya has been elected to chair the UN Commission on Human Rights!</seg>
<seg id=108> When Caligula has appointed a horse in the Senate, the horse, at least, did not jump on its blood.</seg>
<seg id=109> Of course, the procedure was perfectly legal: the Presidency rotates every year of one region to another.</seg>
<seg id=110> This year, was to appoint the President and Africa has appointed Libya.</seg>
<seg id=111> Only the United States and Canada voted against.</seg>
<seg id=112> In their shame infinite, European countries abstained.</seg>
<seg id=113> This speaks volumes about the moral bankruptcy of the UN that this decision comes at a very delicate moment for this organisation.</seg>
<seg id=114> President Bush has challenged the UN to demonstrate their serious about their own binding decisions concerning Iraq; otherwise, they can enjoy the same fate as the shameless League of Nations, which has proved powerless in the 1930s when it has been faced with the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany and Italy fascist.</seg>
<seg id=115> The choice of Libya to chair a UN body responsible for enforcing human rights now contributes nothing to support the legitimacy or moral authority of the global body.</seg>
<seg id=116> Remember that Libya is a totalitarian tyranny; its leader, Muammar Ghaddafi, combines a sometimes changing attitudes to policies extremists by supporting dictators throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id=117> It leads one of the most oppressive regimes in the world, which is no mockery of election and where the opposing views are instantly suppressed.</seg>
<seg id=118> During her reign, Libya has supported terrorist organisations throughout the world, the IRA to many Palestinian extremist groups.</seg>
<seg id=119> It has always UN sanctions for the role it has played in the attack on a flight Pan Am Lockerbie in Scotland, over ten years.</seg>
<seg id=120> Over the last decade, the UN position as a symbol of the ideals of a peaceful world community has been regularly undermined.</seg>
<seg id=121> They have proved totally incapable of stopping the war in the Balkans; and in at least one case, Srebrenica, the Dutch forces of UN Peacekeeping went and attended the worst massacre in post-war Europe while the Bosnian Serbs massacraient approximately 6 000 Muslims defenceless.</seg>
<seg id=122> A Dutch committee of inquiry has admitted later that the UN Dutch battalion was, in fact, complicit in this war crime.</seg>
<seg id=123> In Rwanda when the genocide began, the UN representative for peacekeeping operations ordered the evacuation of UN forces in the country, leaving room for genocide the bloodiest since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id=124> On behalf of the UN representative is Kofi Annan.</seg>
<seg id=125> It is a sad and depressing past that the UN, probably trying in vain to buy in seeming, in the Iraqi crisis, as the voice of reason and international legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id=126> But when the UN inspections in Iraq resemble the sending the Salvation Army to withdraw a bunch of criminals, the election of Libya at the head of the Commission on Human Rights remains a historic date, the final collapse of an organisation which had raised immense hope.</seg>
<seg id=127> The organisations do not usually die, and certainly, there is too much reason to state not to ensure that the UN will continue to stand.</seg>
<seg id=128> But they will be a mere shadow of what they should and could be.</seg>
<seg id=129> The UN today give the hypocrisy a bad reputation.</seg>
<seg id=130> Are We advocate of the authority are</seg>
<seg id=131> Last Thursday, judges of the central court Jakarta in Indonesia was sentenced to one year in prison.</seg>
<seg id=132> I am guilty, as editor of Tempo Weekly Newsmagazine, according to the tribunal, slander against Tomy Winata, a tycoon business, to have implied its possible involvement in a fire in the textiles market Southeast Asia in Jakarta and of instigating riots in disseminating lies.</seg>
<seg id=133> My case and others like présagent-ils once again the end of a brief democratic experience in Indonesia?</seg>
<seg id=134> "The rioting" I have incited occurred in March, last year, when nearly 200 thugs campaigns in Winata assaulted Tempo offices, threatening inflaming the building harcelant staff and injuring a journalist.</seg>
<seg id=135> To try to resolve the situation peacefully, I was persuaded to negotiate in Jakarta central police office and découvris, horrified, that the leaders that the clique took power at the police station.</seg>
<seg id=136> I was struck by fist and foot while the police laissèrent do.</seg>
<seg id=137> Fortunately, many journalists have come to our rescue magnétophones and with cameras to record these events.</seg>
<seg id=138> The spread of these images força originated public outrage and the parliament to open a public inquiry.</seg>
<seg id=139> The leaders of the national police and police were called in Jakarta and, because of strong public pressure, the leaders of this clique were charged.</seg>
<seg id=140> However, Winata échappa himself to the police investigation simply stating publicly that its supporters agirent without informing and without its consent.</seg>
<seg id=141> It porta complaint himself afterwards, against Ahmad Taufik, the author of Article, Teuku Iskandar Ali, the editor and myself.</seg>
<seg id=142> The hearings of the trial which lasted for a year were marked by a series of developments in all suspects Winata.</seg>
<seg id=143> First, the dossier mounted by the police and the prosecutor were obviously forged documents so that the police inculpa two officers.</seg>
<seg id=144> But the Court rejected our request to suspend hearings until the clarification of the legality of the issue of prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id=145> The case against the officers involved shows no.</seg>
<seg id=146> On the contrary, one of them was promoted at the head of the new unit Jakarta antiterrorist new (and is funded by the United States).</seg>
<seg id=147> The other has also been sent to school police to receive specialist training.</seg>
<seg id=148> Then, after six months of hearings, the main judge the panel of three judges was suddenly promoted to head a local court at a time of Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id=149> One of my lawyers noted with that 35 years of practice in court, he had never seen a lead judge to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id=150> In fact, despite its promotion, the judge continua to chair another matter in the same building.</seg>
<seg id=151> A judge who previously had ruled against Tempo during the civil proceedings brought by Winata came to replace it.</seg>
<seg id=152> Finally, Winata, during his testimony, presented a false demonstration by denying have been spoken by Tempo.</seg>
<seg id=153> A registration of the telephone conversation was broadcast during the hearings, the journalist realizing maintenance and the two authors who assistèrent témoignèrent under oath, it telephone company documents attesting to this telephone call as proof of its existence and experts attestèrent that the voice of registration was that of Tomy Winata.</seg>
<seg id=154> Yet the judges rejetèrent the request of the arrest of Winata Tempo calling for it to be judged on false evidence and we conseillèrent to appeal to the police, something that we have made.</seg>
<seg id=155> The judges have then rejected our request for postponement of the court decision until the case of false testimony of Mr Winata tried.</seg>
<seg id=156> Given all these defects form, my condemnation and my prison sentence are hardly surprising.</seg>
<seg id=157> But I am very hopeful win ultimately when the appeal of Tempo will be brought before the upper courts.</seg>
<seg id=158> The higher Indonesian courts are more respectful of ethics and the Director of the Supreme Court is a champion of democracy and freedom of expression. The Tempo affair may become a milestone in our democracy, like the famous US Supreme Court decision in matters in New York Times against'Sullivan.</seg>
<seg id=159> With increased the tolerance threshold in the accusations against defamation, this decision enabled the US press to demand accountability to officials of public affairs.</seg>
<seg id=160> No country knows better than Indonesia that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are tested indicators of democratic development and that is a penalisation journalists symptoms of authoritarianism.</seg>
<seg id=161> Indonesia is a liberal democracy in the 1950s, before the gagging of the press by President Sukarno helped the military junta in 1956.</seg>
<seg id=162> Any criticism was stifled, the consolidation of power without against power was smoothly and, in July 1959, could Sukarno announcing the beginning of the enlightened "Democracy".</seg>
<seg id=163> For the first few years following the fall of Sukarno in 1966, all the benefits of real democracy, including freedom of the press, were restored (except for the communists).</seg>
<seg id=164> Yet the regime of President Suharto is also began in the gagging of the press in the early 1970s, by suspending various newspapers and by imprisoning many journalists.</seg>
<seg id=165> The press gagged, other political rights were quickly violated and democracy in Indonesia disparut once again.</seg>
<seg id=166> Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia became the third largest democratic country in the world and the first Muslim community of democratic history.</seg>
<seg id=167> free, fair and peaceful elections were held twice for the election of parliament and the direct election of the President, including the recent election Présidentiel, proving preventing any mix possible between Islam and democracy.</seg>
<seg id=168> The enemies of democracy will never happen.</seg>
<seg id=169> The extremist Islamic groups have engaged in bomb attacks without distinction, while the authoritarian tendencies groups have made a breakthrough in the near circles of President Megawati.</seg>
<seg id=170> But Mrs Megawati has just lost the recent Présidentielles elections.</seg>
<seg id=171> , the new President Susilo, continue to persecute journalists?</seg>
<seg id=172> My condemnation, and the trial and sentences of other journalists, marquera-t-elle the beginning of the end of the third Indonesian democracy so hard won?</seg>
<seg id=173> The answer lies in the support that the Indonesian democrats activists will generate national and internationally.</seg>
<seg id=174> Losing Indonesia torch potential for the hope of all democratic activists in the Muslim world, would be a terrible defeat.</seg>
<seg id=175> The moral of the death penalty</seg>
<seg id=176> The United States often accused their refusal to abolish the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=177> Many argue today that the abolition of the death penalty is a necessary condition for establishing a civilized system of criminal law.</seg>
<seg id=178> The Nobel Gary Becker does not.</seg>
<seg id=179> The European governments are resolutely opposed to the death penalty, the European Union completely forbidden, and some Europeans consider that its use in America is barbaric.</seg>
<seg id=180> In fact, many European intellectuals think that the death penalty, and any penalty in general, do not deterring criminals.</seg>
<seg id=181> But while Europeans, with the crime rate far below those of the United States in the last century, have long afford a certain "mild" of most crimes, he saw their crime rate brutally increase over the last twenty years.</seg>
<seg id=182> Instead, the American rates have fallen partly due to the increased use of retribution.</seg>
<seg id=183> The death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=184> I am for the execution of some people accused of murder because, and for that reason alone I believe that this prevents other murders.</seg>
<seg id=185> If I was not convinced, I am opposed to the death penalty as revenge and other possible motives must not serve as a basis for public policy.</seg>
<seg id=186> The serious empirical research on death began with a study of mourning Ehrlich in 1975, published in the American Economic Review.</seg>
<seg id=187> Some studies following sometimes have discovered a deterrent effect far smaller, other a much stronger effect.</seg>
<seg id=188> However, the information available is limited, it should not base its conclusions solely on the econometric evidence.</seg>
<seg id=189> Obviously, public castigation policy cannot expect perfect evidence.</seg>
<seg id=190> But even with limited quantitative evidence available, good reasons to believe in power have sufficient dissuasive capital punishment.</seg>
<seg id=191> Most people, and the murderers in particular, are afraid of death, especially when it follows quickly and almost inexorably perpetration of murder.</seg>
<seg id=192> As the David Hume said about the suicide, "no man has never rejected life unless it is worth living.</seg>
<seg id=193> That is our natural horror of the death … "Even Schopenhauer thought" when the horrors of life reach the point where they exceed the horrors of death, a man puts an end to his life.</seg>
<seg id=194> But the terrors which were of considerable resistance against the death … "</seg>
<seg id=195> Opponents of the death penalty often proclaim that the state has no right, morally, to take the lives of anyone, even the most murderous reprehensible.</seg>
<seg id=196> Yet this is a completely mistaken conclusion to who believe that the death penalty is dissuasive.</seg>
<seg id=197> To see why, expect for each murderer executed, (instead, say, to be condemned to lifelong imprisonment) the number of murders were reduced to three, which is a figure of lower than Ehrlich and other estimates of the deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id=198> This means that for every murderer not yet executed, three innocent victims are going out.</seg>
<seg id=199> In fact, the government 'would' indirectly many lives if it had not resort to the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=200> The saving of three innocent lives for each person executed seems a very attractive market, and even two lives saved by implementing a cost / benefit ratio is persuasive for the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=201> We must agree that the argument in favour of capital punishment becomes less clear-cut when the number of lives saved whenever fall.</seg>
<seg id=202> But even if one life was spared each execution, the market can still be desirable if the life saved is much better than life deleted, which is usually the case.</seg>
<seg id=203> Many are protesting to compare the qualities of life saved and that is suppressed.</seg>
<seg id=204> But I do not know how to avoid such a comparison.</seg>
<seg id=205> Take the case of a career criminal wheel and killing a victim who led a decent life and several children and partner leaves behind it.</seg>
<seg id=206> There he comes up possible to save the lives of an innocent victim executing a criminal of this kind.</seg>
<seg id=207> It seems evident that save the lives of such a victim must weigh more heavily than make life criminal.</seg>
<seg id=208> Of course, all cases are not as clear, but a comparison of the qualities of individual lives must be part of any reasonable social policy.</seg>
<seg id=209> This is also why the death penalty should be used for murder and no less serious crimes.</seg>
<seg id=210> When it comes to choose between take lives and, for example, reduce flights of private goods, the theory of more benevolent punishment is more powerful.</seg>
<seg id=211> Although serious aggression, including some horrendous murders, rapes are sometimes in their seriousness, and could possibly call the death penalty, I am not for its use in such cases.</seg>
<seg id=212> One of the main reasons for reserving the death penalty murder is the "marginal deterrence."</seg>
<seg id=213> If the attacks were punished by the death penalty, it would force the aggressors to kill their victims not to be discovered (which is a major reason for the severity of punishments is proportionate to the seriousness of crimes).</seg>
<seg id=214> One complications could be that a murderer would fight with greater determination to avoid being caught, which could cause more deaths.</seg>
<seg id=215> But, although marginal deterrence is important, I believe that the resistance killers to their catches, sometimes at the expense of their own lives, actually constitutes an indirect evidence that criminals fear the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=216> Of course, the risk to execute the innocent worries me.</seg>
<seg id=217> My support to death faiblirait much if the rate of implementation of innocent people was as important as much the claim.</seg>
<seg id=218> However, I believe that the appeal process in America, not a huge provide protection against the wrongful convictions against unfair executions, so that there was little or no cases of people executed he has proven that they were innocent.</seg>
<seg id=219> And this situation has been enormously consolidated by the development of identification by DNA.</seg>
<seg id=220> I say again that the debate surrounding the death penalty is a deterrent effect (which can be reduced by invitations too long).</seg>
<seg id=221> I can understand that some remain sceptical about the existing evidence, although I think they are wrong about this and on the issue of common sense of the problem.</seg>
<seg id=222> It is very disturbing to take the lives of someone, even a murderer, but sometimes extremely unpleasant acts are needed to prevent even worse behaviour causing the death of innocent victims.</seg>
<seg id=223> The people against Putin</seg>
<seg id=224> I have contributed to the choice of Vladimir Putin to replace the first democratically elected President Boris Yeltsin.</seg>
<seg id=225> Given that such structures the KGB and the Mafia masterminding today Russia and manipulate the judiciary, it is admitted that Yeltsin wanted to choose its successor to avoid prosecution.</seg>
<seg id=226> But we, who have chosen Putin, were charged with finding a successor to pursue the reforms initiated by Yeltsin, and not someone who would protect him and his family.</seg>
<seg id=227> Yeltsin was afraid of nothing and does not its own survival, but to the survival of the democratic idea that he had introduced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=228> This idea is now threatened by the successor that we have chosen.</seg>
<seg id=229> I do not seek to deny responsibility for support Putin.</seg>
<seg id=230> We were not friends intimate, but he and I worked together in critical situations, and I never doubted his sincerity.</seg>
<seg id=231> Putin acts according to its convictions.</seg>
<seg id=232> The problem is that its convictions, particularly the belief that Russia can only flourish if it is ruled by a sole source of power, are misguided.</seg>
<seg id=233> And this gross mistake is conducting Russia policy to his downfall.</seg>
<seg id=234> Clearly, nobody can take a post with great responsibility, even without committing misconceived fundamental mistakes, and it is especially true when times are perplexed.</seg>
<seg id=235> Yeltsin was not exception, but he admitted his mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=236> When he withdrew 31 December 1999 he apologized to have triggered the war in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id=237> Putin, however, seems unable to acknowledge and recognise its mistakes, and persists in a policy long after its failure becomes apparent in the eyes of the world.</seg>
<seg id=238> One mistakes of Yeltsin was its failure to put moral priorities in his reform programme.</seg>
<seg id=239> Russia should repent Stalinism and the system of gulags.</seg>
<seg id=240> The entire nation, without exception, should be sorry, as Germans did since 1945.</seg>
<seg id=241> This failure account because he has allowed the unconditional faith in the central authority of Putin leads to a new state capture by the security services.</seg>
<seg id=242> Indeed, a direct consequences of national repentance would be isolated from the Communist Party and the disqualification of all political duties of those who have worked for the KGB.</seg>
<seg id=243> Even if such political sorting are not easy in the post-communist societies, where victims and collaborators were so many, and the border between the two sometimes so vague, a viable solution could be found, as in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id=244> The choice of doing nothing has left the Russian security structures unscathed and capable of return on the political scene, what they have received today.</seg>
<seg id=245> The political resurrection of KGB structures under Putin, and their efforts to silence the dissidences, have transformed Russia into a country of transfuges.</seg>
<seg id=246> It is impossible to silence the politicians and independent media without stifling independent financial sources, which explains that the Kremlin of Putin has concentrated its attacks on the so-called "oligarchs."</seg>
<seg id=247> The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his trial were orchestrated for this reason.</seg>
<seg id=248> Removing the independent financial sources, the security services which dominate the Kremlin hoped destroy independent political life in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=249> Without foundations of independent thinking is a climate of fear that occurs.</seg>
<seg id=250> But fear is not only degrading, it fails to govern.</seg>
<seg id=251> Yeltsin had intuitively understood that fear and centralised decision-making top-down and could not be the right way to run a modern country, and he therefore insisted reforming the relationship between citizens and the state.</seg>
<seg id=252> Putin does not always understand that a centralised political system is also unable to understand and correcting today than it was at the Soviet era.</seg>
<seg id=253> Lacking a sound education, Putin is, quite frankly, conducting Russia towards the same disintegration that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet state.</seg>
<seg id=254> The people start to realize that.</seg>
<seg id=255> It notes that the desire of Putin to create a solid and effective modern state cannot develop, because a modern state is governed not from above, but by the citizens informed that force their leaders to recognize and correct their mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=256> Putin, too, seems suspect the powerlessness of his regime.</seg>
<seg id=257> This is one of the reasons that have given Russia aggressive with its neighbours, Ukraine and Georgia, and that the drive to maintain a military presence in places like Transdniestria, the secessionist region of Moldova.</seg>
<seg id=258> By imposing itself in neighbouring regions of Russia, the Kremlin thinks it can convince the Russians of his omnipotence.</seg>
<seg id=259> Given that the debates in Russia are châtrés and that the Kremlin is able to manipulate the elections, a change is the only solution that remains to preserve the idea of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=260> It is pointless to hang on to the illusions.</seg>
<seg id=261> Those against Putin must decide what they want and say that if the regime fails to enforce the constitution, they have the right to enforce it.</seg>
<seg id=262> Today, the question of power in Russia can no longer decide to vote.</seg>
<seg id=263> As in Ukraine, Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan, it will decide in the streets.</seg>
<seg id=264> Imposez and spending (SVP)</seg>
<seg id=265> A excessive taxation can soften encouragement and hinder growth.</seg>
<seg id=266> But an insufficient tax can also produce the same effects.</seg>
<seg id=267> Governments with a feeble tax revenue cannot provide the essential public goods.</seg>
<seg id=268> Worse still, a low tax revenue in poor countries is often a result of faults inherent in tax collection systems (rather than tax rates) that encourage the not too low productivity.</seg>
<seg id=269> India illustrates the importance of a balanced tax system.</seg>
<seg id=270> A Bangalore, high-tech companies built of grasslands world-class campuses extant flawless and high-speed data communications networks.</seg>
<seg id=271> Without these campuses, however, extends the open sewers refuse not removed and roads in a parlous state of progress.</seg>
<seg id=272> While the technology companies téraoctets instantly of transmitting data continents away, local transport advance almost medieval along.</seg>
<seg id=273> Consequently, companies to exploit their own Bangalore, sous-traitent bus services with private providers for drinking water and installing generators to protect themselves against loss of course.</seg>
<seg id=274> The state cannot compensate for this disaster because it is bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id=275> The government of India's debt exceeds 70% of GDP so that over half of its tax revenue is spent on interest.</seg>
<seg id=276> But the debt is not excessive expenditure in the past.</seg>
<seg id=277> The government of India's expenditures represent around 15% of GNP, against an average of around 40% of GNP of the OECD.</seg>
<seg id=278> The financial difficulties of India have rather because a tax system ill-conceived and badly managed.</seg>
<seg id=279> The rates and the rules for income tax individuals and businesses seem reasonable in view of international standards.</seg>
<seg id=280> Nevertheless, the government of India sees of income taxes representative 3.7% of GNP, only approximately approximately half of those of South Korea and other Asian Tigers.</seg>
<seg id=281> The agriculture in India represents approximately a quarter of GDP, but even rich farmers do not pay tax.</seg>
<seg id=282> The export businesses in the software industry and in other industries receive temporary from taxation on their profits, although their employees pay taxes on their personal income.</seg>
<seg id=283> Despite reasonable rates, tax fraud is commonplace.</seg>
<seg id=284> Fraud indicates that the government has not invested in the staff or in the systems to discover the recalcitrant taxpayer, who are rarely in prison and who can often get out of business as paying bribes when they are caught.</seg>
<seg id=285> More subtly yet, the flight of direct taxes on income and benefits "reflects the disorder inherent in the system of" indirect taxes levied on the production and consumption.</seg>
<seg id=286> The excise duties represent over 60% of indirect taxes to India, which in turn represent the same proportion of its total tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id=287> The basic excise duty has been set at 4% of the value of the production of a company.</seg>
<seg id=288> Suivent cuts, and then various exemptions surtaxes.</seg>
<seg id=289> For example, a "constitutional rate conditions" for 8% from categories as foodstuffs, the allumettes, the son of cotton and computers.</seg>
<seg id=290> A special excise duty "additional" of 8% is levied on products which include filaments in polyester, cars, and tyres conditioners.</seg>
<seg id=291> A "additional excise duty" (not to be confused with the "right") is special taxes levied on "products of special importance".</seg>
<seg id=292> The exemptions excise duties are numerous and complex, including companies with total annual incomes below 10 million roupies and businesses located in some choppy areas or backward.</seg>
<seg id=293> In general, the exemptions fall into 70 categories, themselves sous-divisées 259 entered into, 52 and 7 lists conditions, each containing many elements.</seg>
<seg id=294> The exemptions incite to abuse.</seg>
<seg id=295> To a certain amount, officials located at the bottom of the hierarchy, who are exemplary discretion in the application of conditions, can be encouraged to interpretations favourable.</seg>
<seg id=296> The products taxed at rates high (e.g. the polite granite) are sold as products taxed at rates lower (such as granite unpolished).</seg>
<seg id=297> Fraud on excise duties is more infectious than tax evasion on profits and incomes.</seg>
<seg id=298> If a company fraud excise duties and that the rate of taxation is higher than the profit margins before taxes in industry, its competitors must also commit fraud simply to survive.</seg>
<seg id=299> While fraud increases, governments collect rights "or" additional "special" which incite greater fraud.</seg>
<seg id=300> There are also perceptions of direct taxes.</seg>
<seg id=301> The bribe paid to the tax man excise duties for a favourable classification, the difference between the value granite polite and unpolished, and the omission registration of real income create money "black" which cannot be declared on forms of declaration of income.</seg>
<seg id=302> In addition to weaken the ability of the state to provide essential public goods, the schemes to evade indirect taxes discourage businesses also to adopt technologies, which requires more productive technology involving a large-scale deployment.</seg>
<seg id=303> But as indirect taxes can be more easily disregarded by deploying several small units instead of one big unity, it is impossible to achieve economies of scale.</seg>
<seg id=304> It is important to note that in the software industry, where all units are exempt from indirect taxes, Indian companies operate on an effective scale.</seg>
<seg id=305> India could follow the example of China, a country in which the rationalisation of indirect taxes in 1994 has prepared the ground for a major boom?</seg>
<seg id=306> Or the coalition governments in a vigorous democracy are incapable of such reform?</seg>
<seg id=307> Last year, the government led by the BJP of India has enacted legislation allowing significant reductions in budgetary deficits.</seg>
<seg id=308> He has appointed a working party to make the necessary changes to the policies of public spending and fiscal policies.</seg>
<seg id=309> In July, the working group has proposed to increase taxes (rather than reducing expenditure) by removing the majority of indirect tax exemptions, among other things.</seg>
<seg id=310> The new government led by the Congress of India also appears to support these proposals.</seg>
<seg id=311> If the Congress and the opposition parties follow, they will help much to support the country's economic growth and to dispel the idea that democracies cannot take the necessary measures to promote development.</seg>
<seg id=312> What is wrong with Turkey?</seg>
<seg id=313> On 16 December, Orhan Pamuk, one of the most famous Turkish authors, faces a court of Istanbul. It must respond to the charge of "insult to national identity" to be called for an open debate on the genocide by the Turks of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and setting.</seg>
<seg id=314> Pamuk run three years in prison.</seg>
<seg id=315> The efforts of Turkey to impose fines and imprisonment for those who go beyond the official framework convince me that I was right to oppose the opening of negotiations on accession to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=316> In December 1999, the European Council gave Turkey candidate status of the EU, which meant that Turkey enters into the Union at a future date not yet set.</seg>
<seg id=317> The Council was then asked the Commission to decide before October 2004 if Turkey met the political criteria for accession, which include democracy, rule of law and respect for the right of ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg id=318> This was one of the last taken by the Commission of Romano Prodi, which I was a member.</seg>
<seg id=319> Of its 29, 30 members have said that Turkey fulfilled the criteria are sufficient to continue.</seg>
<seg id=320> I was the only dissident.</seg>
<seg id=321> That is the Commission's report on Turkey, prepared by Günter Verheugen, then responsible for enlargement of the EU, behind my decision.</seg>
<seg id=322> This report mentioned in 2003, some 21 870 Turks have sought asylum in the EU, including 2 127 were accepted.</seg>
<seg id=323> In other words, the EU governments themselves have acknowledged in 2003 that the Turkish Government was persecuted over 2 000 of its own citizens.</seg>
<seg id=324> In the meantime, the Commission published a progress report on Turkey believing that the reforms continued, although at a slower rate, under the government to Islamic moderately orientation of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’.</seg>
<seg id=325> This report was nevertheless state serious doubts: violations of human rights, including the practice of torture, continued; the military influence were too big; freedom of expression was not universally observed; the cultural and religious minorities non-Islamic were victims of discrimination and violence against women does not had a sufficiently strong opposition.</seg>
<seg id=326> The situation has not changed much since the accession talks began in October.</seg>
<seg id=327> Beyond the persecution Pamuk is currently the victim, the unacceptable behaviour abound.</seg>
<seg id=328> In March 2005, the police violently intervened in a demonstration is celebrating International Women's Day.</seg>
<seg id=329> In May, the largest trade union teacher has been banned for supporting the education of 14 million Kurds in Turkey in their own language.</seg>
<seg id=330> It is undeniable that intolerance reached at summits of the Turkish Government.</seg>
<seg id=331> The Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül has recently brutally overturned a press conference in Copenhagen when he saw a Kurdish journalist in public that the Danes refused to escape.</seg>
<seg id=332> Such acts and such attitudes justify differ widely in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id=333> But even if these defects were corrected, Turkey should not be permitted in the EU, because this is not a European country.</seg>
<seg id=334> The Christianity, the féodalité, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, democracy and industrialization have made us Europeans that we are, but they are not doing Turks what they are.</seg>
<seg id=335> I am not convinced that reforms in Turkey, implemented due to the insistence of the European Commission, would be continued after accession.</seg>
<seg id=336> I suspect that there are even re-offending.</seg>
<seg id=337> Furthermore, the accession of Turkey would lead to that of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and perhaps of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.</seg>
<seg id=338> The first three countries are certainly more European than Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=339> Leaving aside the three Caucasus republics but including the successor states to Yugoslavia, it would give an EU of approximately 35 members.</seg>
<seg id=340> What kind of EU even?</seg>
<seg id=341> The EU is not merely a club of friends.</seg>
<seg id=342> It is based on the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people.</seg>
<seg id=343> The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, must protect these four fundamental freedoms, which means that it must sometimes persuade, and if necessary force, the Member States to change their laws.</seg>
<seg id=344> Policies concerning alcohol loi-Volkswagen in Sweden, Germany and discrimination against foreign investment funds in France are examples of cases which have made the Commission unpopular.</seg>
<seg id=345> But they are necessary.</seg>
<seg id=346> When I left the Commission, I had to hold back me a stack of 1 500 findings irregularities of this sort.</seg>
<seg id=347> In short, EU membership implies acceptance of deeply incisive measures affecting the internal affairs of a state.</seg>
<seg id=348> This will prove to be impossible with members as diverse.</seg>
<seg id=349> The EU would fall victim to what the historian Paul Kennedy called "imperial surextension."</seg>
<seg id=350> It would dilute in an unacceptable way.</seg>
<seg id=351> That is why the former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing feared that the entry of Turkey does at the end of the EU, and that is why the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: "Turkey is more than what the EU could tolerate."</seg>
<seg id=352> But the strongest reason to oppose the accession of Turkey is a question of democracy: the majority of the population of the EU is simply not.</seg>
<seg id=353> The failure of the Bolivian crisis, America</seg>
<seg id=354> Bolivia is not a typical country of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=355> And if this were the Haitian disorders, this is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere: it is even less stable that Haiti as its history and its two hundred coups since independence.</seg>
<seg id=356> In a region in the past, but the strong indigenous now fragmented and isolated, Bolivia may, with Guatemala, the only Latin American countries where indigenous peoples make up the majority of the population.</seg>
<seg id=357> His topography and its ethnic distribution generate autonomy and separatist forces even threatening national unity provocative far more than anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id=358> And, of course, with Paraguay, the only country of the whole subcontinent denied access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id=359> Thus, it would be very little prudent to extrapolate the current crisis in Bolivia to the rest of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=360> The implication is too simplistic: elsewhere, the institutions are much stronger, poverty, and particularly poverty, has been reduced and struggles of ownership of natural resources were generally resolved.</seg>
<seg id=361> Even in countries such as Venezuela, which possesses huge oil reserves and which has a nationalist government in the traditional sense, the status quo had enabled the preservation of foreign investments during the almost eight years of government of President Hugo Chávez.</seg>
<seg id=362> Even if the existence of indigenous movement is a reality in many countries, since the Chiapas until the ‘ Araucania ’ of the Amazon until Ayacucho, they have never had any real threat to national integrity in any Latin American countries.</seg>
<seg id=363> Thus, Bolivia is not living a crisis, not an omen eternal "domino theory ', which Lyndon Jonhson and Che Guevarra believed both in Bolivia, seems reasonable or even partially valid.</seg>
<seg id=364> Yet the current crisis in Bolivia shows out the democratic deficit afflicting Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=365> The elected leaders are frustrated for one reason or another in Bolivia, Ecuador and Haiti.</seg>
<seg id=366> Democracy is so low or nonexistent in Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua and feels threatened pure some reason in Venezuela and Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=367> None of these cases is another and they are all different degrees of risk, destruction and reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id=368> The question is what can be done against this, which contrasts badly with the encouraging prospects that have prevailed over the last few years.</seg>
<seg id=369> During the last meeting of the Organization of American States held in Fort Lauderdale, in Florida, the US delegation has set a good idea provided by others and has simply enshrined in its support.</seg>
<seg id=370> The history began two years ago when Dante Caputo, former Foreign Minister, Argentina and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) were instructed to prepare a report on democracy in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=371> Their conclusions indicated that an early-warning system of democratic crises in the region would help to generate some actions before any loss of control, as is the case of Bolivia today.</seg>
<seg id=372> Mr Caputo and the UNDP team were convinced President Ricardo Lagos, Chile, to take the initiative and to promote with several of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id=373> What he has done without the initiative goes very far.</seg>
<seg id=374> In fact, the UNDP report on democracy in Latin America, published in 2004, the barely mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=375> The US and the new Secretary-General of the OAS, Miguel Insulza Jose, have relaunched at the meeting of the OAS in Florida, but it was killed by the reasonable fears of Latin Americans believe that this is an action against Venezuela, coupled to the anachronistic fears of Latin Americans on the violation of the sacrosanct principle of not intervention.</seg>
<seg id=376> Despite the inability of the continent to agree on the principle, the idea of an early-warning system deserves consideration.</seg>
<seg id=377> Today, the American community has probably little scope for intervention on the Bolivian situation, and yet it is dangerous for everyone.</seg>
<seg id=378> Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and growers of coca leaf, is perhaps an honest democratic leader, a rather unwise, but its supporters are all relieved of any authoritarian will?</seg>
<seg id=379> Hugo Chavez did not finance perhaps Mr Morales and other Bolivian dissidents, but Venezuela and Cuba are not tempted to meddle in the affairs of the country where Che Guevarra died at the head of the guerillas almost 40 years ago?</seg>
<seg id=380> The business community Santa Cruz in Bolivia may not give following its threat of secession, but préfèreront-ils share the oil and gas reserves of their region with indigenous peoples from instead of São Paulo Brazilian with industrialists?</seg>
<seg id=381> Before that events are extreme, it might be that the OAS (and not the US) interfere.</seg>
<seg id=382> The region continues to need this participation, in terms of time, message and proper democratic platform distinct from traditional American intervention and indifference to the usual America.</seg>
<seg id=383> The decline in France?</seg>
<seg id=384> The French are notoriously sensitive, not to say defensive, about the size of France abroad.</seg>
<seg id=385> The French state spends a substantial sum to the spread of the French language and culture, but the French are painfully aware that the global position of their country is no longer what it was.</seg>
<seg id=386> In this context, it is not surprising that during the recent presidential elections, the publication of a report by the European Commission stating that the French economic rank among the European countries had changed from the 3</seg>
<seg id=387> The OECD and Eurostat, the European body to gather this data, thought they had put an end to this aspect of the debate demonstrating that France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain had all living standards almost identical per capita.</seg>
<seg id=388> But the controversy on a larger scale has not disappeared.</seg>
<seg id=389> Stories are worried about the ‘ French decline ’ have done reappearance with the marches of protest held this year against pension reform, the growing differences in tax policy with the European Commission and the bickering with America on the war in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=390> The book not romancé successful in France at the moment is an argument written by Nicholas Baverez, France falls.</seg>
<seg id=391> The book is full of Baverez quotations from de Gaulle and Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id=392> According to the author, the recent achievements of France date back to the 1970s, with the high-speed train, and the Airbus.</seg>
<seg id=393> It gives kicks Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac put together by a ‘ common talent to win elections and make France a loser.</seg>
<seg id=394> The success of books is itself a sign of ‘ malaise ’.</seg>
<seg id=395> But what type?</seg>
<seg id=396> The evidence of degeneracy made by Baverez are not also convincing it wishes to believe.</seg>
<seg id=397> For example, he mentions the depletion of industrial jobs as the most glaring proof of the decline of France.</seg>
<seg id=398> But the de-industrialisation is a common reality in all advanced countries.</seg>
<seg id=399> Indeed, France has in fact better than most of its rich competitors and neighbours, unlike the UK, Germany or the United States, it has preserved the same share of global market in the industrial sector than it was in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id=400> Moreover, according to a degree of competitiveness and foreign investment, France has excellent results in these areas.</seg>
<seg id=401> According to a recent report published by the Council of economic analysis, direct investment in France rose to 60 billion in 2001, is almost twice as Germany.</seg>
<seg id=402> The French competitive costs has also improved (20%) in the last three decades, higher productivity counterbalancing the rapid growth of wages.</seg>
<seg id=403> But the heart of long-term economic problems of France lies in fear of losing industrial jobs.</seg>
<seg id=404> France remains a strong industrial power in traditional sectors such as the automobile and aerospace, but it has been delayed in markets where smaller innovative businesses disseminate new technologies.</seg>
<seg id=405> France, for example, spends only $30 billion per year in research and development of technologies, against 51 billion dollars for Germany, 98 billion dollars for Japan and 265 billion dollars for the US.</seg>
<seg id=406> In short, the analysis of Baverez hand in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id=407> France has done some very important reforms in the last two decades: economic and financial liberalization, eliminating price controls and currency, the end of credit restrictions, European liberalisation, the reduction of inflationary deficits, the advent of the euro and globalisation forced businesses.</seg>
<seg id=408> The French malaise has certainly not been misled by these reforms.</seg>
<seg id=409> The problem of France has just what it has failed to recognise the new world that it is already part.</seg>
<seg id=410> The French capitalism is dead and France cannot accept its disappearance.</seg>
<seg id=411> France must be the only country in which a prime minister Lionel Jospin, felt obliged to apologise having said on TV that ‘ state is not omnipotent ’.</seg>
<seg id=412> There are several reasons to explain this French schizophrenia, but the most important of them is the political game of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=413> Before 1981, France was clearly divided between right and left.</seg>
<seg id=414> Since this period, the administrations Mitterrand and Chirac have more flexible approach by their ideological side to implement the difficult process of adaptation to Europe and to globalisation.</seg>
<seg id=415> A ‘ shock treatment Mrs. Thatcher ’ to the two decades ago could forge a new political awareness.</seg>
<seg id=416> But the transition slow and consensual reforms enabled the French people to live in a world and think in another.</seg>
<seg id=417> That largely explains the political upheaval exploded during the last presidential campaign, when the leader of the far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen has reached the second round of presidential elections to the outgoing Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin.</seg>
<seg id=418> The rise of the extreme left, which gained 10% of the vote during this presidential campaign, also demonstrates this political failure.</seg>
<seg id=419> France needs a political revolution much more than an economic revolution if it wants to achieve and accept the reality, particularly the fact that the French ‘ decline ’ is a fear created by the French people.</seg>
<seg id=420> The value of European values</seg>
<seg id=421> European leaders have resumed the constitutional discussions which had ended in December following a dispute on voting rights.</seg>
<seg id=422> These debates must obviously lead to compromises, this will be soon.</seg>
<seg id=423> Then to understand clearly what are the objectives of the supposed constitution.</seg>
<seg id=424> Two fundamental principles underpin European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=425> These two principles are a link between the philosophy, politics, economics, social science and law.</seg>
<seg id=426> For years, they have been part of the legal and institutional structure of the European Union, in the Treaties, in the Charter of Rights Fondamentaux (which the quote in its preamble) and in the recent draft Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=427> In short, they are enshrined in history and the ideals of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=428> But what is the real meaning of these two principles?</seg>
<seg id=429> Take solidarity, who is prepared to at least two interpretations: solidarity static, which only affects the distribution of income and wealth, and the broader concept of solidarity dynamic, which concerns the production of income and wealth.</seg>
<seg id=430> In the postwar history of European integration, solidarity momentum has greatly contracted during the first period, that of the European Coal and Steel Community, both in its economic development strategy (reconstruction) that in the Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome.</seg>
<seg id=431> This does not mean that solidarity momentum was subsequently removed: the European Monetary Union, for example, expresses perfectly this principle.</seg>
<seg id=432> Thus, although some countries have not immediately benefited from the euro, they have nevertheless accepted because they were convinced that it would have positive effects on the long term.</seg>
<seg id=433> In other words, solidarity means encouraging dynamic policies which promote investment, innovation, economic growth and employment.</seg>
<seg id=434> However, as indicated GDP growth in the EU, dynamic solidarity has been shaken over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id=435> The gap between research and development is something particularly worrying.</seg>
<seg id=436> The implementation of the so-called Lisbon Strategy, adopted in 2000 with the promise of creating the world's most competitive economy, is threatened by the growing importance attached to static solidarity, reflected in high costs of social assistance and high taxes needed to finance it.</seg>
<seg id=437> The primacy of solidarity static is due to an ageing population which, together with a slow growth, caused structural fiscal imbalances.</seg>
<seg id=438> One of the greatest challenges in the future of the EU is to address the current predominance of solidarity static, which is geared towards the elderly, to the detriment of solidarity dynamic, which encourages young.</seg>
<seg id=439> After all, the Union cannot allow current consumption continues to prevail over the investment needed for the future prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=440> Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in what its interpretation is twofold: subsidiarity vertical and horizontal subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=441> The vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of powers between the different levels of government and of sovereignty: the EU, the national states, the regions and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id=442> The application of this principle is the best known federalism.</seg>
<seg id=443> The European Treaties clearly express vertical subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=444> But is it enough to include the emerging institutional and constitutional fabric of the Union?</seg>
<seg id=445> The horizontal subsidiarity concerns accountability and freedom of human beings and on the social and economic powers.</seg>
<seg id=446> It covers relations between the state, society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=447> But society and the market have their own rights and their own sovereignty which are not granted by the state.</seg>
<seg id=448> Surgit when the following problem: how to guarantee the autonomy of each kingdom?</seg>
<seg id=449> Examples of horizontal subsidiarity internal European market, which has created a new type of economic freedom and increased competition between companies, eliminating the protection that national governments were offering.</seg>
<seg id=450> The horizontal subsidiarity means that in society and in the economic sphere, the state cannot violate freedom and individual responsibility, which must be respected at the highest possible level.</seg>
<seg id=451> It also means that a "superior power" must give support wherever freedom and individual responsibility are not enough to achieve the objectives needed to human dignity.</seg>
<seg id=452> This support should be given using methods which promote the natural potential of individuals, society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=453> But this is only possible if the role of the horizontal subsidiarity is clearly stated, this was not the case in the European Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights or the work of the European Convention.</seg>
<seg id=454> In short, solidarity implies a redistribution rather than a growth (as the current generation expresses solidarity with future generations) while the subsidiarity concerns the distribution of political power rather than a cautious definition of borders between the state, civil society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=455> At present, these two values are defined in order to promote the State.</seg>
<seg id=456> Indeed, the emphasis on growth market-oriented has often been identified with the values semi-étrangères of America.</seg>
<seg id=457> But these values are deeply rooted in Europe and they must be uprooted again.</seg>
<seg id=458> The EU must restore its economic vitality by pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity more balanced in favour of the market and society, which would reduce the socio-economic impact of the State.</seg>
<seg id=459> The public institutions must produce public assets (such as defence, justice and fiscal and monetary policy), society must offer social goods (such as culture, education and help the needy) and the market must produce goods (linked to profits, economic growth and employment).</seg>
<seg id=460> In 21st century Europe must review the value of these two principles (solidarity and subsidiarity) if it wants to achieve the historic objective of integration: freedom and prosperity needed for overcoming differences and political divisions that have led to tragedies during the 20th century.</seg>
<seg id=461> That is the spirit in which the European Constitution should be developed.</seg>
<seg id=462> The Common values</seg>
<seg id=463> The debate on the American elections has never wavered.</seg>
<seg id=464> How President George W. Bush obtained three million votes more than Senator John Kerry, and make a Republican majority both chambers of Congress?</seg>
<seg id=465> There is little on the answers, but two subjects are recurring in many explanations.</seg>
<seg id=466> One of these issues is its personality.</seg>
<seg id=467> In our era full of uncertainty and threat, the citizens placed their trust in a president they knew rather than in a candidate who have not yet delivered.</seg>
<seg id=468> The second is that of values.</seg>
<seg id=469> The citizens voted for a set of values rather than for specific policies.</seg>
<seg id=470> Indeed, some (told) agrees with the policies of Mr Kerry but have lent their voice to Mr Bush because they felt ‘ comfortable ’ with all its attitude.</seg>
<seg id=471> It is clear that the US is now deeply divided into electoral terms.</seg>
<seg id=472> A ark blue states (democrats) to the east, north and west is spreading around a huge red zone Republican (the middle and south.)</seg>
<seg id=473> Beyond the geographical division, the divisions occur locally.</seg>
<seg id=474> The electoral charcutage retraçage, this practice of electoral borders to promote a political party another, is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id=475> The voters tend to moved in regions where the majority of people share their values, they are Republican or democrats.</seg>
<seg id=476> What are these values exactly?</seg>
<seg id=477> These are the values which relate to what we said, "of God, weapons and gay '.</seg>
<seg id=478> Religion plays a role, especially with the truths of the Bible in the history of the creation.</seg>
<seg id=479> The possession of a weapon is the ultimate test individualism and use of weapons in times of war is no evil.</seg>
<seg id=480> The gay and other ‘ modern ’ practices are rejected because nombrilistes.</seg>
<seg id=481> As the political scientist Andrew Hacker recently said, ‘ the candidature of Mr Bush was built to form a majority by giving 60 million voters the chance to feel good about themselves ’.</seg>
<seg id=482> All this is an American phenomenon or is there other trends elsewhere?</seg>
<seg id=483> A answers to that as an American phenomenon, the politics of values may well get a majority today but is not general.</seg>
<seg id=484> Europe and other parts of the world are divided equally.</seg>
<seg id=485> It is certainly personality, and the obvious political differences are also questions of values which have not yet been highlighted.</seg>
<seg id=486> However, the traditional political differences based on the disagreement about fundamental values play an increasingly important role in the elections.</seg>
<seg id=487> The Prime Minister Tony Blair, for example, other leading to confront an election in his country, plays the map of the personality and speaks of policies, but is primarily a set of values of middle class.</seg>
<seg id=488> When he speaks of ‘ modernisation ’ or ‘ to enter the twenty-first century ’, he manages to suggest a strange mixture but attractive to change and stability.</seg>
<seg id=489> This leaves the conservative opposition without any effective response.</seg>
<seg id=490> Even the issues of tax reductions and asylum stricter fail to fly on the ropes to the tune of values that the Republican Party has managed to make the United States.</seg>
<seg id=491> The situation is the same in Germany, where the obvious influence of the politics of values is even less.</seg>
<seg id=492> The debate, Germany, is still in the main political debate.</seg>
<seg id=493> When the opposition offers the government to negotiate the reform of social protection or, more recently, to combat unemployment, the underlying challenge is not posed in terms of values but rather of competence.</seg>
<seg id=494> Yet in the fields of traditional battles English or German political debate, or elsewhere in Europe, the values threaten clashs.</seg>
<seg id=495> The parties are fighting for those who can 'feel comfortable in their own place ’, but they do not understand very well that this is only partly a question of policy.</seg>
<seg id=496> Religion will never be an important factor in European policy: the opinion polls show that religious practice remains one of the few main differences between the Americans and Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=497> The weapons also occupy a place in the different European minds: it is their absence that Europeans regard as important.</seg>
<seg id=498> Europe is also undoubtedly aware of a peaceful values.</seg>
<seg id=499> And the question of political correctness (the ‘ gay ’) plays a role lesser hitherto in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=500> Above all, Europe itself divides Europeans, because the ‘ national issue ’ is present in all European countries.</seg>
<seg id=501> It is a question of values inspired by fear.</seg>
<seg id=502> The citizens want to know where they stand and, in addition, directed against the US and towards Europe or against Europe and towards their own countries.</seg>
<seg id=503> In any case, we leave when the kingdom of policies and even politics and are entering the field marécageux symbols and myths.</seg>
<seg id=504> What, then, is the main danger that democracies face, because the politics of values is a dangerous development.</seg>
<seg id=505> It reintroduces the fundamental divisions of a society whose greatest democratic success was precisely to banish fundamentalism of political life.</seg>
<seg id=506> A Informed public debate must be a debate on these policies by a community of values.</seg>
<seg id=507> It is therefore essential to stress this central objective of the policy of freedom.</seg>
<seg id=508> The advent of interest</seg>
<seg id=509> A swallow does not make the spring and one months of normal growth of employment and rising prices in the US does not mean that the Federal Reserve no longer fear an economic malaise and deflation.</seg>
<seg id=510> But the time will come when the world will begin to raise interest rates as central bankers are preparing to resist the wave of rising inflation.</seg>
<seg id=511> When the time comes, whether this autumn in 2005 or 2006, or in 2007, America and the global economy must face financial vulnerabilities conducting the success of three years of monetary stimulation by arresting the decline in production and limiting unemployment.</seg>
<seg id=512> The short-term interest rates are surprisingly low: just 2% in the euro zone, just 1% zero in the US and Japan.</seg>
<seg id=513> The expansionary monetary policy has proved to be a success, but only after having brought interest rates low levels historical and have convinced investors that borrowing costs remain at their current levels for long.</seg>
<seg id=514> The main monetary stimulus has more asset prices: all benefit dividend, a product or rent becomes much more attractive, and therefore more precious in financial terms, when interest rates are very low and should remain so.</seg>
<seg id=515> This explains the enormous disparities between the current prices of property in the US, ordinary actions in New York, London and Frankfurt, and long-term bonds throughout the world and what should be, conventionally, their fundamental values.</seg>
<seg id=516> What will happen when the central banks will begin to increase their interest rates?</seg>
<seg id=517> In 1994, raising interest rates in the short term has increased long-term rates (and lower prices of long-term bonds) at least twice the planned by the standard models that year.</seg>
<seg id=518> Interest rates in peripheral economies have also increased the rate of major industrial countries.</seg>
<seg id=519> The first danger for 2005 and for the coming years, when the global interest rates will rise, as is likely, is another wave of financial crises in emerging markets.</seg>
<seg id=520> For countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the record of the 1990s shows that the differences of interest rates can grow and capital flows are remarkably rapidly reversed, whatever the degree of sensitivity with which the representatives of the IMF and the analyses carried out by the big banks see the policies of a country.</seg>
<seg id=521> Differences in rates of emerging markets are being abnormally low.</seg>
<seg id=522> The international monetary influx of capital flows, with the exception of the United States, are not yet to levels associated with a "irrational exuberance", but it is likely to happen before interest rates will begin to rise.</seg>
<seg id=523> This prospect is alarming because if the lesson of the 1990s is that no one should exaggerate the stability of international financial flows.</seg>
<seg id=524> The second danger stems from the higher values of the advanced industrial countries in the main assets.</seg>
<seg id=525> The mind-set prevalent within the Federal Reserve, with which I entirely agree, argues that the information technology revolution continues, that potential output in the US grows always very quickly and that the output gap is relatively high.</seg>
<seg id=526> This means that interest rates will certainly remain low during a relatively long period.</seg>
<seg id=527> Moreover, confidence in the Federal Reserve is great and the last remnants of the risk premium inflation 1970s will no longer interest rates.</seg>
<seg id=528> Consequently, even after production levels have returned to their potential level, interest rates will remain low standards in the 1980s and 1990s.</seg>
<seg id=529> All this is obviously good news for all those who have assets such as of long-term bonds, actions and property.</seg>
<seg id=530> Indeed, raising prices of long-term assets was precisely what wanted: reducing interest rates and bond make property owners richer after all give a boost to spending.</seg>
<seg id=531> The bad news is that even if interest rates are expected to remain low for some time, they will not remain too low indefinitely.</seg>
<seg id=532> The key is that when interest rates are falling, the values of the active.</seg>
<seg id=533> That is during these periods, especially when the values of the active falling quickly and substantially, we discover fully the degree of competence of our central bankers in their main task: to reduce the financial volatility and promote economic stability.</seg>
<seg id=534> It is also during these periods that we discover how individuals who are holders of long-term bonds, property or shares their powers not because they think that the current prices are interesting with prices, but because their prices have increased over recent years.</seg>
<seg id=535> It is a crucial issue for the political decision-making as individuals who have bought long-term assets seemed increase indefinitely because prices are also those who will sell as soon as the trend will be reversed.</seg>
<seg id=536> In particular, the US trade deficit foreshadows a massive instability if the long-term asset price should fall considerably.</seg>
<seg id=537> The challenges arising ruling of the world's economic policies in coming years diffèreront to which they have been faced since the collapse of the illusion of the Nasdaq.</seg>
<seg id=538> The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those generated by a fall in production and the threat of deflation.</seg>
<seg id=539> But, as we have learned during the 1990s, that does not mean that the challenges ahead will be easier to resolve.</seg>
<seg id=540> The Avenirs opposed America</seg>
<seg id=541> I recently found an interesting fact: the American economists of international finance and the American macroéconomistes of domestic economy have very different perspectives – in fact, opposed – on the possible consequences of the enormous US deficit.</seg>
<seg id=542> The international finance economists believe that a financial crisis is possible, followed by a painful and prolonged recession perhaps in the US.</seg>
<seg id=543> The macroéconomistes concerning the internal economy to see a further fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis but as an opportunity to accelerate growth.</seg>
<seg id=544> The macroéconomistes considering the domestic economy generally consider the situation as follows: at some point in the future, foreign central banks will be less prone to pursue their massive buying securities in dollars to support the Green ticket.</seg>
<seg id=545> When they will end their purchasing programmes of large-scale dollar, the value of the dollar will fall, and it will drop sharply.</seg>
<seg id=546> From that point of view, if the value of the dollar declining, American exports will become even more attractive to foreign markets and the labour market, the US will of being redirigée towards the new export sectors in full boum.</seg>
<seg id=547> The situation is comparable to that of Britain when it He indexation of its exchange rate and the pound will depress laissa compared to the Deutschmark, or what it duly America in the late 1980s when the dollar is déprécia compared to the book, the Mark and, above all, compared to the Japanese yen.</seg>
<seg id=548> Economists of international finance describe a darker future.</seg>
<seg id=549> They believe that the end of purchasing programmes of dollar by the central banks will not only the decline of the dollar but also in spiralling American interest rates, which will fall household consumption and investment spending will regulate after a short time.</seg>
<seg id=550> Surely, the international finance economists also believe that American exports will benefit from the falling dollar but the differences in demand are such that the outbreak of exports cannot happen that one or two years after the decline in consumption and investment.</seg>
<seg id=551> Eight ten million people will spend on services and construction sector of the import and export of goods, which means that structural unemployment will increase.</seg>
<seg id=552> Moreover, there will perhaps financial panic: the large financial institutions with short-term bonds and long-term assets encounter difficulties in sustaining a sharp increase long-term interest rate denominated in dollars.</seg>
<seg id=553> The cause of inequality may cause some tension and a bankrupt financial just as easily as those caused during the Mexican crisis and East Asia in the 1990s or the Argentine crisis of this decade assets of local currencies and bonds in dollar that former banks.</seg>
<seg id=554> When economists of international finance highlights this scenario, the macroéconomistes specialising in the domestic economy their claim that this is a case of incompetence in monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=555> Why should enable the Federal Reserve higher long-term interest rates when foreign central banks will end their purchasing programmes of dollar?</seg>
<seg id=556> Should it not then intervene and take over by buying obligation of US Treasury. Keeping long-term long-term interest rates at a satisfactory level to promote full employment?</seg>
<seg id=557> Economists of international finance are generally what the Federal Reserve does not have the capacity to do so.</seg>
<seg id=558> Obligée to choose between full employment and price stability, according to them, the Federal Reserve chooses price stability, because its institutional memory of the 1970s and the surge of inflation remains very powerful.</seg>
<seg id=559> Thus, since the fall of the value of the dollar is raising import prices and thus functions as a negative shock supply side in the economic sector, the Federal Reserve will increase rather than reduce interest rates and thus sell rather than buying of treasury bonds.</seg>
<seg id=560> Economists are serious that I have great respect to comment on opposing sides of this debate.</seg>
<seg id=561> I am not enough to agree to any doubt, but I know where I hope to see mislead.</seg>
<seg id=562> The bad pupils of Europe</seg>
<seg id=563> In the United States, the pursuit of misguided fiscal policies are penalised.</seg>
<seg id=564> Their obligations cut-price selling compared with other states managed.</seg>
<seg id=565> The debt service they must pay higher serves, to some degree, disciplinary action against the temptation to spend today and pay later.</seg>
<seg id=566> Naturally, market discipline is not perfect: the bond market does not really "see" future liabilities implicit (as payments promised pensions).</seg>
<seg id=567> However, the application of this fiscal discipline, with internal budgetary process of each state, has prevented the large fiscal crisis occurs in America since Great Dépression.</seg>
<seg id=568> Consider the case of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=569> Before the advent of the euro, many countries of southern Europe suffered fiscal crises, producing inflationary waves.</seg>
<seg id=570> But with the introduction of the single currency, the path for solving a fiscal crisis by inflation has been closed, since the European Central Bank (ECB) monitors monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=571> However, even if the nations cannot rely on inflation to resolve the imbalance of their finances, the single currency allows them to use the capacity of debt which belongs to other members of the European Union to extend their madness wasteful and push their political responsibility for long periods of time to let the good [1] [sic] trap.</seg>
<seg id=572> This is to avoid this possibility that the EU has created the Stability and Growth Pact: the government budget deficit must not exceed 3% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=573> Last week, the German Government, once the European countries most prudent and disciplined fiscal level, broke the rules of the Pact for the fifth year running, without really (many) excuses.</seg>
<seg id=574> The Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck has indicated that he expected that the European Commission to apply sanctions against Germany: the credibility of the Pact, he would be jeopardised if any gesture was made.</seg>
<seg id=575> Thus, Germany would not obstruct the sanctions this time, as happened two years ago.</seg>
<seg id=576> But Steinbrueck also expressed clearly expected that a purely symbolic sanction in response to the budgetary deficit representative 3.4% of GDP, and not to penalties which would have a true cost to his government or its economy.</seg>
<seg id=577> The Stability and Growth Pact is not, or not yet, by way of work as originally planned.</seg>
<seg id=578> What about market discipline?</seg>
<seg id=579> The willingness of the German Government to increase its debt and increase its deficits is limited by the fact that the market recognises and penalises nations which causes their fiscal position shrinking?</seg>
<seg id=580> In a word, no.</seg>
<seg id=581> Interest rates on sovereign debt in euro of the twelve euro area governments are very similar.</seg>
<seg id=582> The market does not care that countries have different export potential to generate the necessary financial flows to reimbursement of debt or deficit / GDP ratios differents current or planned.</seg>
<seg id=583> Willem Buiter, of the University of Amsterdam and Anne Sibert, of the University of London, believe that it is the acceptance of the ECB throughout the euro-zone deficit as guarantee that has undermined the market will become the controller of fiscal moderation.</seg>
<seg id=584> Until the marginal part of the German debt is used as a guarantee for short-term borrowing or as a centrepiece fought for acquiring pension liquidity, its value is more likely to be determined by the terms on which the ECB accepts as guaranteed by its fundamental.</seg>
<seg id=585> The ECB's treatment of debt so as important source of false liquidity reserve now differential analysis of long-term sovereign risk.</seg>
<seg id=586> This is dangerous in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=587> We need both market discipline and sound fiscal management for a reasonable chance to enjoy a stable long-term prices.</seg>
<seg id=588> Omettez today to sanction by the market behaviour which can become casse-cou or to activate the institutional levers which give voice to future generations, and you are exposing to suffer serious consequences – perhaps not today or tomorrow, but one day, and for the rest of your life.</seg>
<seg id=589> As time passes, the arrival of the single currency and how the euro has been introduced generate increasingly uneasy.</seg>
<seg id=590> The euro area-wide policy in general is overly deflation.</seg>
<seg id=591> Transfers needed to make the current currency bearable slowed to regions which are already in recession or when the ECB applies a stricter policy are not made.</seg>
<seg id=592> The institutional foundations of a stable fiscal policy are undergoing long-term erosion.</seg>
<seg id=593> Now, Sibert Buiter and convince us that the ECB gives to the market less chance to reward more economical and penalise spenders than it should.</seg>
<seg id=594> The world is not shifting yet, and it never comes before a time.</seg>
<seg id=595> But the soil under the euro could well become ice if things do not change.</seg>
<seg id=596> Milosevic trial, and Hussein even even farce.</seg>
<seg id=597> The trial of war criminals were formerly serious Affairs.</seg>
<seg id=598> Remember photographs of Herman Goering and claims, Rudolf Hess, in the dock in Nuremberg.</seg>
<seg id=599> Some Nazi leaders have even been hanged after relatively short but fair trials.</seg>
<seg id=600> Nowadays, the trial of the most despicable leaders of the world became sham.</seg>
<seg id=601> The trial of Saddam Hussein and his friends are a series of Ba'ath uninterrupted embarrassing moments.</seg>
<seg id=602> The defendants try one singerie after another and Hussein shown all forms of contempt possible. The only thing that it has not yet done, is to show its fesses Judge.</seg>
<seg id=603> It is difficult to await an outcome which may sound legitimate in the eyes of Iraqis or of the world.</seg>
<seg id=604> Meanwhile, the trial of Slobodan Milosevic has changed in funeral after four years of testimonies boring and $200 million spent unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg id=605> In Cambodia, the UN and the government have procrastinated for almost ten years for how to persuade personalities of the Khmer Rouge survivors before the courts.</seg>
<seg id=606> The mass murderers who took power in the twentieth century were sentenced to be killed in popular revolts or trial for their crimes, at least, if they do not die during their mandate.</seg>
<seg id=607> Who can feel proud that the last Communist leader of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, was situated with his wife without even the hallmarks of a fair trial?</seg>
<seg id=608> The formal traps genuine Court appear always preferable to instant justice, even if the final result is also death.</seg>
<seg id=609> Today there are two ways plausible proceeding against a tyrant deposed.</seg>
<seg id=610> A nation can send its former leaders to court, like Argentina in the 1980s with the generals responsible for the disappearance of over 5 000 of their fellow citizens.</seg>
<seg id=611> Internationally, the Nuremberg model remains valid to be an example to other trial, although under the conditions that are sometimes ambiguous victorieuses powers for certain crimes, as the "crimes against humanity," which are not properly defined when they are committed.</seg>
<seg id=612> There was a time when we could see the benefits of both national and international trial.</seg>
<seg id=613> The trial on national territory enabled the local community to give vent to his regret by participating in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id=614> As judges and panels, the defendants compatriots could also give greater sensitivity to the status of guilt because they could appreciate the harsh conditions under which a dictator takes decisions deposed.</seg>
<seg id=615> The trial generals in Argentina was a ritual successful in the context of the painful transition from military junta to democracy, but this experiment ended in a larmoyante questioned.</seg>
<seg id=616> Even after their condemnation, the generals were strong enough to demand a denunciation of their trial then an amnesty next president.</seg>
<seg id=617> The Argentine policy is still enchevêtrée in the legal consequences of these trial for twenty years.</seg>
<seg id=618> Internationally, the decision of the UN Security Council to establish the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTR) has also been welcomed with great confidence.</seg>
<seg id=619> The ICC has taken several decisions under Antonio Cassese foundation.</seg>
<seg id=620> But then judges had the misfortune to make their dream the more expensive: judge the chief spells disaster, Slobodan Milosevic.</seg>
<seg id=621> It cannot be a clear idea of how the Serbs would have tried Milosevic in a local trial.</seg>
<seg id=622> Many would have been dependent on the political party which has controlled the Court.</seg>
<seg id=623> Internationally, fears were not about excessive politics but on an excess of law.</seg>
<seg id=624> The trial of Milosevic must be more than just, it should be the symbol of UN justice.</seg>
<seg id=625> Thus Milosevic has been allowed to defend itself – serious mistake in terms of length and effectiveness of the trial.</seg>
<seg id=626> There was no limits to the number of people that the charge has called to testify on the same appalling history of Serbian aggression and brutality.</seg>
<seg id=627> It will determine the problem for many months and why this scandal of a four-year trial.</seg>
<seg id=628> My suspicion is that well-meaning officials were too influenced by the Commission of truth and reconciliation, African model sold in schools of law as an alternative to the desirable distributive justice.</seg>
<seg id=629> In South African trials, the most important issue was not the future of the accused but history of victims.</seg>
<seg id=630> Every victim was encouraged to tell her history and listen to him.</seg>
<seg id=631> In the case of the twentieth century, massacres such narrations may take decades.</seg>
<seg id=632> Encouraging victims to speak can give the warned the right to require the trial and block up its merits of political leader are the ingredients of a never-ending session.</seg>
<seg id=633> One of the lessons learned from the trial of Milosevic and Hussein is not to judge the men or women of them lose their charismatic attraction.</seg>
<seg id=634> They will overturn with the trial, especially if they are allowed to defend themselves, and use the courtroom to justify their journey.</seg>
<seg id=635> The tyrants should be regarded as having been clearly defeated.</seg>
<seg id=636> The irony of history, the fact that the Nuremberg tribunal has been gripped by representatives of the victors and was a powerful advantage.</seg>
<seg id=637> They were a constant reminder to Goering Hess their minions, and that the Allies appropriate that the Nazis were irreparably defeated.</seg>
<seg id=638> Punir the guilty, rather than forming how history is written, has always been the clear objective of the trial.</seg>
<seg id=639> The tragedy of the trial of Milosevic and Hussein is that the points on the "i" of history are still missing and that history itself is in the dock.</seg>
<seg id=640> The consistent hesitancy responsible has created procedures, both domestic and international, who have facilitated the ghosts of justification and return.</seg>
<seg id=641> In the case of Saddam Hussein, this fantasy could still be achieved.</seg>
<seg id=642> The Line of shares the Iraqi economy</seg>
<seg id=643> All those who study Iraq see as a divided nation between the communities of Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds.</seg>
<seg id=644> But there is another division equally fundamental, a division which contributes equally to the insurgency continues, sectarian conflicts and opposition to military occupation led by the Americans, the growing gap between rich and poor in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=645> When Iraq was released, the populations, particularly poor people, have taken to hope that a charismatic leader would save the harsh realities of daily life.</seg>
<seg id=646> Élevés in fear, they had no idea how democracy could apply to their society groups and how the Human Rights and other organisations of civil rights could help to shape their future.</seg>
<seg id=647> Iraq has been faced with a new social divide.</seg>
<seg id=648> There were those who could understand how to operate in a democracy, come to power and achieve clean ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=649> They have learned to speak the language of democracy, to win both money and influence, and to ensure the help of independent organisations to defend their rights and privileges.</seg>
<seg id=650> On the other hand, however, there is a vast population of Iraqis, especially women without power divorced, widowed or abandoned without anyone to bear them, they and their children.</seg>
<seg id=651> For them, democracy and human rights does not mean much.</seg>
<seg id=652> They are poor, sick and uncultivated.</seg>
<seg id=653> Victims of an education system which collapsed over ten years, they are poorly trained to find employment in the Iraqi economy withering away.</seg>
<seg id=654> Under the yoke of Saddam, no effort was made to raise the standard of living of disadvantaged.</seg>
<seg id=655> I visited the big slums and discovered Iraqi families living in homes barely covered homeless, insect shark-filled waters everywhere, with open sewers lag under their doors.</seg>
<seg id=656> Nuit and day, they live in the dark.</seg>
<seg id=657> Let needing nothing less than food, housing and job prospects, these families face death, terrifiées by the cries of their starving children.</seg>
<seg id=658> When I met the women who live in these homes, they have bombed questions: democracy allait-elle give them food and homes?</seg>
<seg id=659> Democracy empêcherait-elle men of beating their wives?</seg>
<seg id=660> Democracy citizenship to place their children?</seg>
<seg id=661> Their donnerait-elle divorce law spouses who have abandoned them?</seg>
<seg id=662> In all these questions, I replied ‘ Yes ’.</seg>
<seg id=663> Yes, democracy will give you the right to live in a decent house, the right to learn and work, and it will give citizenship to children and equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id=664> But you must work hard and make every effort to demand these rights.</seg>
<seg id=665> What they replied: ‘ Saddam has taught us to be unemployed, silent and fearful for 35 years.</seg>
<seg id=666> What can we now do? '</seg>
<seg id=667> In these poor areas that most Iraqis, people are facing bitter temptations.</seg>
<seg id=668> Many are not within the reach of politicians and government leaders.</seg>
<seg id=669> They easily fall into violence, theft and sabotage.</seg>
<seg id=670> Poverty leads some to accept money in exchange for terrorist acts, made complicit by the promise of a heroism untrue that they could not exploit during the long reign of Saddam.</seg>
<seg id=671> Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of violent history wars and atrocities in Iraq, which has reversed the people's sensitivity towards the murder.</seg>
<seg id=672> Although the circumstances in Iraq today lead many young men towards violence, I am convinced that it is enough simply to provide jobs and decent housing for salvation.</seg>
<seg id=673> The jobs, in particular, would help young people to create new lives in serious jobs.</seg>
<seg id=674> We must not use posts to disguise the army of unemployed.</seg>
<seg id=675> We must give people jobs that enable them to contribute positively to the reconstruction of the country.</seg>
<seg id=676> By nature, each individual seeks to be useful for its own society.</seg>
<seg id=677> But culture that Saddam has created persuaded the Iraqis that the political connections are the sole mode to acquire knowledge, money and authority.</seg>
<seg id=678> Overcoming such sentiments will take time and will require a flourishing economy, which means that the new Iraqi Government must have limited powers in order to facilitate the growth of private sector while encouraging the widespread understanding of democracy and Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=679> The religious groups are ready to participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id=680> We can also rehabilitate the technocrats who servirent under Saddam, so that they have a chance to serve their country.</seg>
<seg id=681> Last but not least, we must offer loans to poor families to help build a decent life.</seg>
<seg id=682> The government must above all make every effort to convince the Iraqi people poor of the value of democracy and freedom and the importance of the constitution in achieving their aspirations for a better life.</seg>
<seg id=683> This will not be easy to achieve in a country where many people believe that break the law is an act of heroism.</seg>
<seg id=684> We have, Iraqis, yet we learned that power must not be concentrated in the hands of a minority, and that the establishment of justice requires to combat corruption in all its forms.</seg>
<seg id=685> If the constitution must function as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, the Iraqis have-nots must learn to make their this fight.</seg>
<seg id=686> The Islamic identity</seg>
<seg id=687> Where that you chairing your gaze today, Islam is used (and misused) as a political force.</seg>
<seg id=688> Some Muslims will serve as a basis for action; many Muslims in the West (and in other countries) the perceive as a ‘ other ’ containment and exclusion astreignants' another '.</seg>
<seg id=689> As a Turk, I feel directly both sides of the debate.</seg>
<seg id=690> The reason why Islam resembles a different religion of the West is that the West has seen a systematic de-institutionalisation of religion.</seg>
<seg id=691> It is not the religion that has disappeared of modern Western life, of course, but rather the claims that the religious institutions can pass on the individual behaviour.</seg>
<seg id=692> The modern world religion is more than ever personal experience and spiritual.</seg>
<seg id=693> However, a process of de-institutionalisation religious experience is also happening within Islam.</seg>
<seg id=694> The politicization of Islam supersedes the authority of religious classes of Islam, the ulema.</seg>
<seg id=695> As in the West, the Islamic religious becomes more personal experience.</seg>
<seg id=696> The interpretation of religious texts by individual Muslims, including political activists, intellectuals and women, is a consequence of many.</seg>
<seg id=697> Also popularisation of religious knowledge, the lessons of the Koran are bullied and taken out of context to support political objectives.</seg>
<seg id=698> Who decides now of what is legitimate and what is illegal in Islam?</seg>
<seg id=699> Who has sufficient authority to interpret the religious texts?</seg>
<seg id=700> Who can make a fatwa or say ‘ jihad ’?</seg>
<seg id=701> Nowadays, the activism and terrorism offer, or rather, a source of legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id=702> So the uninitiated decide what does or does not mean Islam, without the authority of religious schools and without specialised training.</seg>
<seg id=703> Indeed, Islam today is essentially interpreted by politicians and cultural movements, and not by religious institutions.</seg>
<seg id=704> This de-institutionalisation enabled Islam to move the status of local and national social ties to generate imaginary links between all Muslims of the world who feel oppressed or displaced.</seg>
<seg id=705> The Islam can thus unite members who were deeply divided: Muslims intellectuals Sufis and Muslims canonisés Shariat origin, Shia and Sunni Muslims; Saudi Arabia conservative and Iran revolutionary.</seg>
<seg id=706> Islam is also dynamic, its believers leaving rural areas for cities, including Western cities.</seg>
<seg id=707> Many regard this as negative and underline that these individuals are socially uprooted and they falling into alienation; some terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=708> But social mobility is also a precondition for creating a modern perspective.</seg>
<seg id=709> Of course, migration creates a sense of distance among Muslims, if there is a complete break, with their social origins.</seg>
<seg id=710> Their experience is new, religious institutions, private or public theological Community.</seg>
<seg id=711> Experience religious becomes a form of social imagination in which they rebuilding a feeling of belonging to Islam in an environment both new and strange.</seg>
<seg id=712> This is not the distance of with modern life, but the proximity of life which spawns a return to the religious identity.</seg>
<seg id=713> Indeed, the vast majority of radicalism in the groups which, by their experience of mobility and the movement, are familiar with the secular western modes of political thought and urban life.</seg>
<seg id=714> Désorientés by an unknown environment, these individuals cling to Islam, which is their only support.</seg>
<seg id=715> But if this support works, Islam has traditionally obséquieuse itself from its passive attitude, docile and with modernity.</seg>
<seg id=716> In a veil or a beard in claiming the right of obtaining prayer places at work or school and requiring special food, Muslims are identifiable openly as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id=717> They inform the world that they are more zealous and more meticulous in their religious observance that individuals bordering religious prejudice their privacy.</seg>
<seg id=718> For example, the Muslims are not generally of the veil as a sign of the degradation of inferiority and the Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id=719> The shame, however, for Muslims become a sign of their positive statement of Islamic identity.</seg>
<seg id=720> The young Muslim women in Europe to illustrate this transformation.</seg>
<seg id=721> Young girls who take the headscarf in the French and German schools are closer, in many respects (i.e., the youth culture, awareness of the way and the language), their classmates that their mothers uneducated who are forced to stay at home.</seg>
<seg id=722> By adopting the headscarf for the European public sphere, these young girls to change the symbol and the role of Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id=723> This trend goes well beyond simple scarves.</seg>
<seg id=724> All the Western Muslims possess a dual sense of belonging, a dual cultural capital.</seg>
<seg id=725> They are defined by their religious prejudice, but they have also acquired knowledge universal secular.</seg>
<seg id=726> Because they possess dual cultural capital, they can move relatively freely between the various activities and space (home, school, houses and leisure space for young urban).</seg>
<seg id=727> To be Muslim and be Islamiste are two different things.</seg>
<seg id=728> We are witnessing today to change a Muslim identity for an Islamic identity.</seg>
<seg id=729> The religious me for Muslims from individual private kingdom to public kingdom.</seg>
<seg id=730> The question remains for everyone is whether this quest of identity can be met with broad public acceptance headscarves and with the Islamic religion or whether a positive statement of Islam requires a more fundamental renunciation of modernity.</seg>
<seg id=731> A new era for Islamic science?</seg>
<seg id=732> For hundreds of years, while science and mathematics knew a period of great ingenuity, a region was full of others.</seg>
<seg id=733> The masters of non-conventional medicine were was celebrated, and people are wondering about the functioning of nature.</seg>
<seg id=734> No surprise that this region has been globally respected.</seg>
<seg id=735> In the other half of the world experienced, scientists were punished, even killed.</seg>
<seg id=736> The Foreign and mathematics, considered irréligieuses, were outlawed, and were later subjugated to religion.</seg>
<seg id=737> The standard of living is low.</seg>
<seg id=738> The prosperous region was the Islamic East, whereas a ignorant Europe remained poor.</seg>
<seg id=739> The two regions were governed religiously (historians agree on the role and nature of religions in this context), but science is épanouissait in one of them.</seg>
<seg id=740> Today, of course, the roles of the Islamic East and the West are reversed.</seg>
<seg id=741> Since the Second World War, the US is the world leaders indiscutés in science.</seg>
<seg id=742> Throughout this period, the brightest students were attracted outside their home countries by the prospect of better career opportunities and research.</seg>
<seg id=743> Up to a recent period, more than half of students graduates of mathematical, scientific engineering which, and the US were born abroad.</seg>
<seg id=744> Many of these talents have stayed after obtaining their qualifications, and both industry and the government have benefited.</seg>
<seg id=745> Meanwhile, the Islamic culture was in a historic phase in which science was equated with the influence of the West, and for this reason even declaration.</seg>
<seg id=746> Even in countries where oil earnings could supply a significant proportion of research, Arab leaders have not encouraged such investments, and the consequence is that their societies have not prospered as much as they could.</seg>
<seg id=747> Recently, a desire for greater respect policy drove the Islamic nations to invest in the area of technology, which is particularly visible in the Pakistani nuclear ambitions and Iran.</seg>
<seg id=748> But while such weapons have a political weight, science on which they are based is trivial and old.</seg>
<seg id=749> Respect from considered visions, rather than born of past discoveries, is far more significant.</seg>
<seg id=750> Imagine the influence of Pakistani Institute of global research on cancer.</seg>
<seg id=751> And political rhetoric changerait-elle if researchers to Oman découvraient a means of solving AIDS?</seg>
<seg id=752> This opportunity does not stand at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=753> But there is another, which is not confined to Islamic societies.</seg>
<seg id=754> The US has committed serious blunder recently.</seg>
<seg id=755> Falling "issues of faith" gave way to science within the government, the presidency.</seg>
<seg id=756> On reputable scientists have seen their reports changed by members of staff policy when the facts contradicted the official version.</seg>
<seg id=757> Encouraged by an administration influenced by religion, the school systems are turning their teaching of science into the "values."</seg>
<seg id=758> Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entrance visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, which hinders the flow of young talents to American universities.</seg>
<seg id=759> Large organisations scientists have protested without result.</seg>
<seg id=760> Meanwhile, tax laws have been revised to make short-term investors richer, discouraging long-term investment in research.</seg>
<seg id=761> A demi-billion dollars was devoted to the war in Iraq, a sum equal to about the financing of any fundamental research of thousand years.</seg>
<seg id=762> Even if the US avoid a dark age of fundamentalism, they risk losing their world domination clearly in terms of research.</seg>
<seg id=763> Japan has recognized the link between political clout and science in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id=764> The main Japanese industry, Akio Morita, CEO of Sony, and the right-wing politician Shintaro Ishihara, have made a series of speeches which were compiled and published in 1986 under the title The Japan that Can Say no [Japan can say no].</seg>
<seg id=765> They have outlined a national strategy in which the world influence would scientific power.</seg>
<seg id=766> The main idea is that military power could be rendered obsolete if the "food chain" of military technology was controlled by other nations.</seg>
<seg id=767> The title of the book relates to the project of Japan to say "no" to the US military influence once Japan will master the main military technology.</seg>
<seg id=768> Building a knowledge-based economy through the oil wealth outcomes is entirely possible.</seg>
<seg id=769> The Texas for example, like most of the southern states of the United States, was formerly poor and economically declining.</seg>
<seg id=770> Even with oil revenues, the flow of dollars in the economy, in itself, is not enough to boost prosperity as one might think.</seg>
<seg id=771> The Texas decided to allocate oil money to a sum for education.</seg>
<seg id=772> Today, this allocation is roughly equal to that of Harvard University, and it extends to 15 universities.</seg>
<seg id=773> It has had a staggering effect: the aerospace industry has nearly disappeared in California, but it exploded in Texas.</seg>
<seg id=774> The research centres and telecommunications consortiums ran Texas, the Canadian giant telecommunications Nortel.</seg>
<seg id=775> Although the industry experience a crisis in the US, Texas one of the strongest industrial economies of the world.</seg>
<seg id=776> There is no reason that the same results cannot be achieved in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=777> Above all, the Islamic world must rediscover and reconcile itself with its proud legacy.</seg>
<seg id=778> The Iranian Debate on Iraq</seg>
<seg id=779> No country of the East is following developments post-war Iraq as closely as Iran.</seg>
<seg id=780> The geographical proximity, a history of intense and violent war with Iraq of Saddam Hussein, religious and emotional links with the Shiites in Iraq, some concern about the United States and their policy in the region: these are the threads that bind Iran to its Western neighbour.</seg>
<seg id=781> Given the never-ending tensions with America, Iran is particularly concerned by the possibility of a US presence continues in its neighbour, and by the dominant role of America in building the future of Iraq's post-Saddam Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=782> The foreign observers can find difficult to follow the Iranian internal debates, yet they exist, they are compressed, although they are not always visible to the international public in general.</seg>
<seg id=783> We can find three general approaches in the debate on Iran changing Iraq's post-Saddam Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=784> The Iranian pragmatistes argue that Iran must inevitably cooperate with the United States in Iraq from post-Saddam Iraq, even if only to ensure that the rights of the Shiite population of Iraq are respected.</seg>
<seg id=785> For this reason, Iran should gain an assurance that the new Iraqi leader being not hostile and seek to gain bilateral friendships.</seg>
<seg id=786> Other key considerations pragmatistes concern for the preservation of the territorial integrity of Iraq and the repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.</seg>
<seg id=787> They are moderates who believe that the Iranian Government should urge the United States to obtain the extradition of members of the Olympic Moudjahidins Khalq (MKO) based in Iraq and the complete dismantling of the organization.</seg>
<seg id=788> Instead, the Iranian Government should offer its support to ensure peace, stability and security in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=789> In sum, the pragmatistes would limit relations américano-iraniennes, concentrating them on a programme which greatly reflects the concerns of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=790> In general, the conservative forces of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=791> Another approach proposes a more active and cooperative role for Iran in the reconstruction of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=792> Advocates of this position argue that Iran is well placed to facilitate the reconstruction of its infrastructure and institutional well-established personal links with Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=793> Finally, we pay, the United States and the international community will recognise the value of Iranian cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=794> The Iranian cooperation should be rewarded by the dismantling of infrastructures of MKO in Iraq, perhaps in exchange for a promise of Iran to address the actions of al-Qa ’ ida and to expel members of al-Qa ’ ida of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=795> Above all, Iran should invite the Americans to meet its cooperation with the assurance of a guarantee in return that Iran does not become the target of US military actions.</seg>
<seg id=796> In short, the defenders of cooperation are calling for an open market and explicit: the support of Iran to ensure stability during the current transition phase and commitment to maintain cooperation relations with any permanent government unfolding in Iraq in exchange for improving the regional and international position of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=797> This position is widely shared within the reformist movements in Iran, inside and outside the government and by the technocratic class business and which is more international.</seg>
<seg id=798> Finally, for Iranian radicals, the possibility of cooperation with the US remains pure fantasy.</seg>
<seg id=799> They are convinced that America is merely seeking to undermine the Iranian security and to endanger its national interests.</seg>
<seg id=800> According to the radicals, the US will seek to impose significant changes to the Iranian foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id=801> At worst, they say, America will seek to impose a change of regime in Iran.</seg>
<seg id=802> It militera enthusiastically against the acquisition of knowledge and nuclear energy by Iran and might even try to weaken the military capability of Iran as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=803> The radicals perceive the US invasion of Iraq as a reflection of the US desire to seal off Iran.</seg>
<seg id=804> In return, they believe that Iran must adopt an aggressive stance in defence of its interests in forming strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers and use the Iranian influence in Iraq to prevent the formation of a government in Baghdad and anti-iranien pro-America.</seg>
<seg id=805> The hard-liners of all sides.</seg>
<seg id=806> The overthrow of Saddam and his regime was that the most convenient of the Iraq crisis.</seg>
<seg id=807> Now the hardest remains to be done: creating peace and security, win the war against terrorism and convince the Muslim masses that America does not intend to occupy Iraq to siphonner all its oil resources and redesign the Middle East to its image.</seg>
<seg id=808> Meanwhile, opposition to the United States, under the expression of suicide bombing or other forms of terrorism, will probably increase.</seg>
<seg id=809> Iran is intended to maintain its decisive position in the region through its political dynamism and its Muslim identity which rings echo throughout the Muslim world.</seg>
<seg id=810> What happens in Iraq has major implications in Iran and the United States would do well to recognise that.</seg>
<seg id=811> US threats or discussions about another war, resentment and fuelling the flames of frustration in Iran, reinforcing the most radical movements.</seg>
<seg id=812> If the United States wishes to avoid such effects, they must accept to restrict the influence of its own radicals, assuming that American interests in Iraq are best defended through cooperation with Iran.</seg>
<seg id=813> A solution for Iraq</seg>
<seg id=814> The situation in Iraq reached the point where everybody wants ostensibly the same thing: the departure of coalition forces.</seg>
<seg id=815> The recent disclosure of a confidential memorandum British Ministry of Defence on the withdrawal of troops underlines this aspiration.</seg>
<seg id=816> The only question is how the meeting.</seg>
<seg id=817> Until the Coalition forces remain, violence will increase.</seg>
<seg id=818> However, if they are based, the escalation of violence will take place, and even more quickly.</seg>
<seg id=819> The real question is how to organise an Iraqi army and police to which we can rely to uphold law and order.</seg>
<seg id=820> Much remains way to approaching this goal.</seg>
<seg id=821> Despite the courage of many Iraqis who join the ranks of the police or the army, it is not surprising that some people have less than pure motives.</seg>
<seg id=822> In northern Iraq, we rule old scores and ethnic segregation is introduced in certain areas traditionally mixed, as Irbil.</seg>
<seg id=823> In other areas, Sharia law is imposed.</seg>
<seg id=824> How can create the Iraq capable of enforcing the law with effectiveness and impartiality, irrespective of race, religion or kind?</seg>
<seg id=825> The traditional answer is to recruit, train, and the "good inculcating values."</seg>
<seg id=826> But time is lacking.</seg>
<seg id=827> We must find other ways.</seg>
<seg id=828> In the absence of a system of value deeply rooted, Iraq needs associations embedded in civil society, in which the police and the army must be accountable.</seg>
<seg id=829> They may take various forms, but the most important is that they are very far-reaching locally, and they have the support of the district authorities, the region and the country when they are abused.</seg>
<seg id=830> If a local monitoring is established, supplemented and recognized at national level, while most members of the military and police forces probably behave properly, and otherwise, it is easier to identify and manage them.</seg>
<seg id=831> Such measures appear excessively optimistic, and yet in Afghanistan, a country that looks like Iraq in many respects, many groups work together.</seg>
<seg id=832> The cooperation for Peace Unity (CPAU) provides a model of how to operate.</seg>
<seg id=833> In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, the priority of ordinary people has been to reduce violence.</seg>
<seg id=834> The CPAU has worked throughout the country in the last three years to establish peace Committees in districts, supported by the peace Councils satellites in villages.</seg>
<seg id=835> This initiative addresses a culture in which violence is so rooted that children, at a time, learned arithmetic after the Soviet soldiers killed.</seg>
<seg id=836> The Committees have tried to unite all groups of the community, including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, the police, judges and businessmen, to devise ways to resolve disputes without violence.</seg>
<seg id=837> Even if the Committees does not officially a supervisory role played hitherto (is specified in future), the simple fact that the police, army, and justice in part Amendments puts into contact with the rest of the community, feedback enables, and contributes to the establishment of trust.</seg>
<seg id=838> Some are noteworthy results.</seg>
<seg id=839> In a workshops, the local military commander came across a few hours by courtesy, and ended stay all week.</seg>
<seg id=840> He went on to apologise for his past violent and undertook to disarm his private army of 2 000 men.</seg>
<seg id=841> It makes today regularly visit to the offices of the Committee.</seg>
<seg id=842> In Iraq, projects such as the Humanitarian Madrid Center of Kirkuk are beginning to perform a monitoring function by offering the people to the various ethnic groups the opportunity to explain their complaints and to get help to resolve its problems.</seg>
<seg id=843> But too often, even in the case of a trial, the judgment is not applied because the victims bow to the threat.</seg>
<seg id=844> The US and British forces have already well worked to strengthen civil society.</seg>
<seg id=845> However, we cannot speak workshops emancipation of women, or the success of the small-scale local elections in the country.</seg>
<seg id=846> Mobilise civil society represents a huge challenge, particularly when, as in Iraq, this must happen quickly and large-scale.</seg>
<seg id=847> The military forces are needed, but also that encouragement to disarmament, which may take the form of prospects for more fruitful economic opportunities that crime and theft.</seg>
<seg id=848> Fortunately, such a structured civil society is as cheaply as important.</seg>
<seg id=849> The association Humanitarian Madrid treats all Kirkuk Center for an annual cost US plus USD 75 000.</seg>
<seg id=850> With 10 million dollars, we could create a hundred such centres, and it would remain a currency.</seg>
<seg id=851> It is time to engage in this direction, to support the courageous people who elk accept the challenge of demand accountability in power.</seg>
<seg id=852> Otherwise, the Iraqi people may not be secure he desperately needs after many years of suffering.</seg>
<seg id=853> Democracy on the Upper Nile?</seg>
<seg id=854> The decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak surprise to propose a constitutional amendment authorizing the direct presidential elections and competitive could constitute a leap for democracy in Egypt and in the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id=855> The West accustomed to a pluralist democracy may be difficult to understand how this decision will change considerable potential in a country used military reign for over 50 years.</seg>
<seg id=856> Under the current system, the Egyptian citizens can only be born of a presidential referendum held every six years to say yes or no to single name on the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id=857> This explains why someone like Mubarak has always received over 90% of votes, albeit in the middle of a turnout indifferent.</seg>
<seg id=858> The strong men Iraqi Syrian and even better with this system, perhaps because they demanded that the names and addresses of voters are placed at the bottom of each ballot.</seg>
<seg id=859> Many people have long argued that democracy in the Middle East cannot progress while Egypt does not fully involved in the process.</seg>
<seg id=860> The Egypt could not really embark on a path of democratisation without first amend its constitution, to reduce the powers of his phenomenal president and limit the duration of its mandate.</seg>
<seg id=861> Mubarak, after all, is already his 24ème year as President.</seg>
<seg id=862> Thus, his announcement of presidential elections constitutes a major milestone competitive.</seg>
<seg id=863> The regime can assume it will be able to use the process to its advantage, but the events may be more difficult to monitor than expected once people start to feel responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=864> The democratic engineering emerged from the bottle.</seg>
<seg id=865> In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this troubled region embarking on the path of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=866> Turkey a part of the East and Morocco of the other are already well engaged in this process.</seg>
<seg id=867> The real groundswell seems determined by proximity this time of time and positive results of the recent elections held in Iraq, Palestine and, to a lesser degree, Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=868> The unprecedented protests against the occupation of Lebanon by Syria following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, his, do not seem to mitigate.</seg>
<seg id=869> Egyptian opposition groups have also held increasingly courageous marches and other forms of civil disobedience in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id=870> The catalyst for their anger was the arrest and imprisonment of opposition leader ill, Ayman Nour, end of January.</seg>
<seg id=871> The government's arbitrary attitude has reinvigorated the national movement Kifaya (meaning ‘ Enough ’), which demanded Mubarak's regime.</seg>
<seg id=872> Suddenly, popular wisdom that the Egyptiens fear of being passive and act has not appeared to check.</seg>
<seg id=873> An alliance of local, regional and international forces continuing tyranny unites against the flanks of Nile perch.</seg>
<seg id=874> The recent wave of popular pressure seems to have shaken the regime.</seg>
<seg id=875> Only a month ago, disrupted Muybarak applications of constitutional reform were a ‘ futile ’.</seg>
<seg id=876> But, whatever the combination of events that prompted this about-turn, the initiative on the elections must be welcomed.</seg>
<seg id=877> It is a first necessary step, albeit inadequate, to overhaul the political system stalled in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id=878> The Egyptiens distrust already symbolic reforms in Tunisia, the country in which President Zine El Abidin Bin Ali, who occupies office long ago, has created a caricature of constitutional amendment which seemed pave the way for presidential elections competitive, but which subsequently led to a sham competition with some "select opponents'.</seg>
<seg id=879> During the previous Tunisian presidential referendums, Bin Ali récoltait systematically 99% of votes; it has now reached 96%.</seg>
<seg id=880> Hopefully Mubarak is more serious about electoral reform.</seg>
<seg id=881> To demonstrate its sincerity, it must instruct the immediate release of Ayman Nour and take steps to stop the emergency of 24 years, which prevents successfully organising political campaigns.</seg>
<seg id=882> Mubarak must also adopt a limit of two mandates five years for each successive president.</seg>
<seg id=883> Just as necessary, measures to win the confidence of citizens, particularly open and equal access to the media, which are currently controlled by the state.</seg>
<seg id=884> I have announced that I intended to contest the upcoming presidential election in order to open the debate on these essential reforms.</seg>
<seg id=885> But I return with pleasure to my life of private citizen when I have the assurance of a free and open election next autumn.</seg>
<seg id=886> If they are seriously implemented, these steps will transform the legacy of Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id=887> With the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine, they may well usher in an Arab spring of freedom, waited for a long time.</seg>
<seg id=888> Elections historic for Egypt?</seg>
<seg id=889> The Egyptians will go to the polls on 7 September to elect a President Hosni Mubarak among 10 candidates, which, in power for 24 years.</seg>
<seg id=890> If little doubt that it will be re-elected after the elections, following the very passionate stages.</seg>
<seg id=891> Around 6 000 national election observers were trained on the occasion, and hundreds of international observers will arrive in the country this week.</seg>
<seg id=892> Although all external signs of a genuine electoral competition are established, it is striking that several signs of authenticity bombs.</seg>
<seg id=893> Despite the promises of the contrary, the conditions of game are far from being fair.</seg>
<seg id=894> Mubarak has a disproportionate number of advantages: the recognition of the name, a virtual monopoly of electronic media controlled by the state and nothing less than 85% of the printed media.</seg>
<seg id=895> A week before the elections, some opposition candidates have not yet had the opportunity to broadcast one campaign to Egyptian television.</seg>
<seg id=896> All the members of the presidential election commission are appointed by President Mubarak, and the new electoral rules have eliminated all independent competitors.</seg>
<seg id=897> Since 2000, a Supreme Court decision stipulates that 8 000 Egyptian judges must monitor the elections and certify the results.</seg>
<seg id=898> It is a major step towards fairer election, because the professional union judges remained independent enough the last half-century of stranglehold on the executive.</seg>
<seg id=899> The Mubarak regime has therefore been using various tricks to neutralise the union of judges.</seg>
<seg id=900> One was to push the definition of "judicial" to include thousands of employees graduates entitled, no experience of court but loyal to the government. That leaves little room for real judges, because if they are protesting in boycotting their observation work the task will come back again to police the infamous Interior Ministry.</seg>
<seg id=901> Thus, in the past, the union of judges did this job, with the likely results.</seg>
<seg id=902> During the parliamentary elections in 2000, while the ruling party of Mubarak has received that approximately 38% of votes in the areas affected by the real judges, the results have managed to culminate at 86% when the presque-juges were observed.</seg>
<seg id=903> This year is very different.</seg>
<seg id=904> In spring, judges held a national assembly and resolved unless the government gives full independence and exclusive control of the process of elections, they do not checking the presidential elections (or parliamentary).</seg>
<seg id=905> On 2 September, they have exposed their ultimate requirement: the regime must allow civil groups to observe the elections, stop change the definition of judges in a legitimate electoral goal, and accept that no box leaves a legitimate judge without that its content is short communiqué, and postponed.</seg>
<seg id=906> Now it seems that the situation is hopeless, because the leader of the presidential election commission has announced publicly Egyptian television that he rejected any comment by the citizens of the elections.</seg>
<seg id=907> One exciting developments, on the eve of the elections, is a fierce public debate on boycotting the election or whether we should vote?</seg>
<seg id=908> Many opposition parties have called their members to abstain in protest against the restrictive electoral rules that favour strongly Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id=909> Moreover, the Muslim Brotherhood, considered as the only opposition party having influence in Egypt, push their supporters to vote according to their conscience but not to support any despotic and corrupt government "."</seg>
<seg id=910> This is an implicit but clear répudiation of Mubarak, only Head of State for 24 years.</seg>
<seg id=911> Some 34 civil society organisations preparing thousands of young Egyptians to monitor the elections despite repeated governmental objections.</seg>
<seg id=912> These groups argue that if the regime does not intend to rig the elections, national and international observers should not pose any problem.</seg>
<seg id=913> The response of the regime is that any external supervision is interference in Egyptian sovereignty, and that of national observers would be an affront to the integrity of judges.</seg>
<seg id=914> This argument is quickly fell when the union judges stood by the observers of civil society.</seg>
<seg id=915> What frightens Mubarak's regime is the voice of the inside and outside the challenge that holding free and fair elections, or that it is simply unable to remove cheating within the Party became an inherent in its operation, the current signs presuming do anything good elections next Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id=916> Meanwhile, for the first time the Egyptians are exciting experience of the challenge to tyranny and take advantage of an entirely new area of freedom.</seg>
<seg id=917> The European envy dollar</seg>
<seg id=918> The currencies can play an essential role not only in commercial transactions, but also in the diplomatic and political wrangling.</seg>
<seg id=919> When that happens, commercial transactions will become more difficult and facing greater uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id=920> The politicization money at the depression of the inter-war period proved devastating economically.</seg>
<seg id=921> But of violent foreign-exchange wars were conducted more recently.</seg>
<seg id=922> In the 1960s, the international monetary system has become a political tug-of-war.</seg>
<seg id=923> Every leader had markedly different explanations and theories on the situation.</seg>
<seg id=924> The Europeans, and especially the French, complained that General Charles de Gaulle described as ‘ extraordinary privilege ’ of the US dollar.</seg>
<seg id=925> The general and its monetary guru, Jacques Rueff, support for America used the status of the dollar as a major reserve currency system of Bretton Woods fixed exchange rates to manage the deficits and pay their military adventurism abroad (then Vietnam).</seg>
<seg id=926> France has responded by calling for a currency reform which would put an end to the special role of the dollar and has tried to resurrect the gold standard largely discredited.</seg>
<seg id=927> The Europeans have begun a long discussion about the benefits of monetary union, which would allow them to compete with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id=928> But the US point of view, the international role of the dollar was a trap.</seg>
<seg id=929> Other countries could change their exchange rates and could thus maintain greater competition in exporting.</seg>
<seg id=930> The US Government has proved powerless at a yen underestimated fuelling the belief that the rest of the world used the dollar to attack the manufacture of America.</seg>
<seg id=931> The Nixon administration has concluded that the only way to save the American economy was to engage in a monetary unilateralism (a spectacular monetary expansion so that other countries would be forced to adjust their exchange rates).</seg>
<seg id=932> These have long forgotten battles suddenly appear to present again.</seg>
<seg id=933> The world has more of a system of fixed exchange rate, but the dollar remains the major reserve currency, a kind of Bretton Woods floating.</seg>
<seg id=934> For the Americans, the role of the dollar reserve constitutes a potential threat to the Americans, while not is more another example of American néo-impériale quest for hegemony.</seg>
<seg id=935> During this decade, China has taken Japan 1960s, preventing its exchange rate to push up export growth.</seg>
<seg id=936> This has made it the target of American complaints about unfair competition and efforts to impose an exchange rate adjustment likely to deter the Americans to buy toys, equipment and Chinese clothing.</seg>
<seg id=937> The American manufacturers considered that bras manufactured in China threatened the American life-style.</seg>
<seg id=938> Meanwhile, Europeans (especially the French) complain of enormous US deficits and the argument of de Gaulle saying that the world pays for the wars of America is back in fashion.</seg>
<seg id=939> Some Europeans suggest that the Asian central banks should play a larger proportion of their euro reserves, an echo of the general unsuccessful attempt to America's capitulation by selling dollars against gold.</seg>
<seg id=940> The years 1960 were concluded by the collapse of the ‘ system ’ and by a major financial turmoil, accompanied by a wave of goods inflationary prices.</seg>
<seg id=941> Everyone has been affected and the role of America on the world stage has been shaken.</seg>
<seg id=942> A similar collapse at present should have a slightly different.</seg>
<seg id=943> The current floating rate system is more stable and adjustment costs distributed differently.</seg>
<seg id=944> The majority of Americans do not suffer much of the fall marked the dollar because foreign dealers must make adjustments prices for the US market.</seg>
<seg id=945> The Asian economies is strongly development and their central banks their rely on the US.</seg>
<seg id=946> They should pursue this policy not to see their export sectors suffer a sudden failure on the American market capital.</seg>
<seg id=947> The US will thus have more time to deal with a current account deficit which will prove unsustainable in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=948> The economically dynamic areas of the world (North America and Asia) are linked by a pact which will ensure the continuity centrality of the US dollar.</seg>
<seg id=949> The Americans will continue to pile of debts because Asians are.</seg>
<seg id=950> The repeal of the Pact would be contrary to the interests of both parties.</seg>
<seg id=951> It is not an American unilateralism because the pact involves cooperation with Asia.</seg>
<seg id=952> But for Europeans, who are excluded from the Stability Pact, it resembles an economic and monetary unilateralism.</seg>
<seg id=953> Meanwhile, the supremacy of the euro on the dollar hitting European industrial exporters.</seg>
<seg id=954> Europe will not be able to alleviate them.</seg>
<seg id=955> Europe is indeed the biggest victim of the new currency confrontations.</seg>
<seg id=956> The answers pronostiquées in the 1960s (restoration of the gold standard or invention of a common European currency) no longer seem very useful.</seg>
<seg id=957> A single currency did not yield substantial protection.</seg>
<seg id=958> The former version of the European reaction (what psychologists call ‘ envy the dollar ’) will only most perceptively.</seg>
<seg id=959> The European Central Bank will be invited to extend the monetary base, as if the imitation of the dollar was the answer to all industrial problems structural and demographic, which are invading Europe.</seg>
<seg id=960> But we should remember that Europe's problems are not from the manipulation of currencies.</seg>
<seg id=961> The protests against the exorbitant monetary privilege of America must be seen for what they are: a means of compensating for a real European powerlessness.</seg>
<seg id=962> The desire of the dollar is ready to disappear and it will grow worse, the international value of the dollar without clearly disappear adverse effects on people who impose and use them.</seg>
<seg id=963> A political epidemic</seg>
<seg id=964> The Americans, as the citizens of all countries of the world, came to accept the fact that the policy plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public representatives.</seg>
<seg id=965> Few, we are surprised (although some may be disappointed) when a federal judge or a diplomat senior is appointed because he has succeeded a crucial test of loyalty to an important principle in the eyes of the Party of President or Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id=966> But science, of the opinion of all, occupies a separate and on this point, the US are beginning to serve as an example of warning for the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=967> The scientific appointments must be based on objective criteria of training, competence and performance.</seg>
<seg id=968> Clearly, it is legitimate to question a future Secretary for Health and Services humans (SSH) on its views on abortion.</seg>
<seg id=969> But it is totally inappropriate to submit the candidates who sit in scientific advisory committees tests political loyalty.</seg>
<seg id=970> Similarly, membership of examining the scientific proposals, a fundamental process for scientific progress, will undoubtedly be separate from all barriers that are unrelated to the professional qualifications.</seg>
<seg id=971> Unfortunately, scientists to the United States encounter increasingly often these barriers.</seg>
<seg id=972> During the autumn, the journal Science published several reports on the matter.</seg>
<seg id=973> One of these reports on was the replacement of members of the advisory committee massive the National Centre for environmental health, which is part of the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), without consultation of the director of the centre.</seg>
<seg id=974> There have also been observed in similar cases are an intergovernmental organisation Lead Poisoning and Prevention of the intergovernmental organisation CDC, we National Human Research Protections and the intergovernmental organisation it Genetic Testing.</seg>
<seg id=975> The current epidemic ideology, in which the advisory committees are dissolved then retrained with new members, and where the candidates are subjected to tests of loyalty, seems exceeded to some observers.</seg>
<seg id=976> The SSH referred to as a "fairly widespread practice".</seg>
<seg id=977> It is not a practice in America, or at least not until today.</seg>
<seg id=978> In any case, the fact that the Bush Administration makes testing the key service to determine their compatibility with its "values" is not really worrying.</seg>
<seg id=979> The most ominous development concerns the degree of importance of ideological investigations, which interfering in areas hitherto unaffected against such manipulation.</seg>
<seg id=980> Indeed, the most significant in this epidemic growing policy has perhaps concerned the reworking of belonging to the section of study of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, which evaluates subsidies to the study of injuries that occurred in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=981> The advisory committees could be vulnerable to an occasional overhaul of this kind in the past.</seg>
<seg id=982> After all, they have recommended the policies that politicians will take into account.</seg>
<seg id=983> But the sections of study?</seg>
<seg id=984> In October 2002, Science published a leader of David Michaels and several of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id=985> Many of them were former distinguished officials who participated in some of the committees concerned and they have made a valuable to the question, based on their personal experience.</seg>
<seg id=986> Their article was a case in itself, but the consequences it had were even more interesting.</seg>
<seg id=987> It has triggered a flock of letters in which scientists mentioned similar experiences.</seg>
<seg id=988> A candidate Coordinating Committee on Research Dystrophy Muscular from the National Institute of Health told me that an inquiry was conducted on it by a member of the White House.</seg>
<seg id=989> Having been invited to raise its views on the various policies of the Bush administration, which none of them did in connection with the work of the Committee, she had to say whether it supports the policy of President on embryonic stem cells.</seg>
<seg id=990> Another person, a professor of its distinguished told psychology and psychiatry has received a call from the White House on his appointment to the National Council on Drug Abuse.</seg>
<seg id=991> His interlocutor told him he was to make him to investigate whether his views could embarrassing the Chairman. "</seg>
<seg id=992> According to Professor, a series of issues was ensuivie, the representative of the White House taking a rating sheet.</seg>
<seg id=993> An example: "You secured two to three; the President is opposed to the exchange of intravenous drug users [for intraveineuses] for moral reasons, whatever the outcome."</seg>
<seg id=994> Then the conversation round took a more frightening.</seg>
<seg id=995> The representative asked the candidate had he voted for Bush and, after having received a negative response, he asked: "Why did you not supported the President?"</seg>
<seg id=996> This is a dictatorship, and not a democracy.</seg>
<seg id=997> The aim of scientific advisory committees is to provide impartial advice and consider the political process.</seg>
<seg id=998> There is nothing to gain and much to lose if a result desired policy is highlighted.</seg>
<seg id=999> That is why the determination of research projects to support has always been a matter to be examined objectively peer and not by politicians.</seg>
<seg id=1000> In fact, the law that applies here (the law on the federal advisory committees, the Federal intergovernmental organisation explicitly Act) requires that the committees are impartial and "uninfluenced inappropriately by the authority with the power to appoint '.</seg>
<seg id=1001> The US Secretary of Health and Services humans Tommy Thompson and the office of staff of the White House should set an example to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1002> They can accomplish very easily: respecting the law.</seg>
<seg id=1003> Murder in Moscow</seg>
<seg id=1004> It is time to put an end to the myth that the "dictatorship of law" of Vladimir Putin gave a postcommunist Russia itself more law-abiding.</seg>
<seg id=1005> The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one journalists among the best and most courageous Russia, a woman who dared to uncover the brutal murders committed by Russian soldiers in Chechnya, is the ultimate proof that President Putin runs a run-of-the-mill dictatorship ordinary showing contempt for the law.</seg>
<seg id=1006> It is time for the world to recognise this, particularly for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1007> The German Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on relations between Russia and Germany, which should endorsing indifference to the lack of respect for the law shown by Putin as national interests of the most powerful member of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1008> But indifference becomes conciliation when it encourages Putin to pursue this path in the international arena, as demonstrated by its current campaign to economically strangle Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1009> The assassination of Politkovskaya has a sinister taste of déjà vu: just as during the glorious days of KBG, in Russia of Putin people, simply disappear.</seg>
<seg id=1010> The assassination of Politkovskaya is the third seemingly murder in three week policy.</seg>
<seg id=1011> Enver Ziganshin, Russia's chief engineer BP, was killed by ball at Irkoutsk 30 September.</seg>
<seg id=1012> Andrei Kozlov Vice-Governor of the Central Bank of Russia who led a campaign against financial fraud, was murdered on 14 September.</seg>
<seg id=1013> The fact that the Prosecutor General Russia Yuri Tchaïka takes the investigation into the assassination of Politkovskaya, as it did for the Kozlov, is not a source of hope, as would be the case in real democracy if such a high official are involved in an investigation.</seg>
<seg id=1014> In fact, involve the highest levels of government in Russia is almost an assurance that the murderer will never be recovered.</seg>
<seg id=1015> The assassination of Politkovskaya is a particularly sinister omen when you consider the fact that it was strong criticism to the Russian President.</seg>
<seg id=1016> In its Rules for a few newspapers, independent of Moscow still Novaïa Gazeta, and in his book 'The Russia of Putin: life in a democracy faulty "and" A dirty war in Chechnya: a Russian journalist' Politkovskaya listed suppressing liberties which sign the Presidency of Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1017> As demonstrated by the fate of the old businessmen Boris Berezovski exiles and Vladimir Gusinki, and that of oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the fate of imprisoned enemies of Putin may take three forms: exile, prison or the grave.</seg>
<seg id=1018> I am not accuse the government of Putin having ordered the murder of Politkovskaya.</seg>
<seg id=1019> After all, as investigative journalist campaigning, it has also angry many other people, including the current Putin Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov is not least, she has accused of a policy of kidnapping against ransoms.</seg>
<seg id=1020> But even if the associates Vladimir Putin had nothing to do with the assassination of Politkovskaya shot in a lift its block in central Moscow, his defiance of the law has created a climate in which the murder was committed.</seg>
<seg id=1021> In the image of the murder of Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed with the clear conviction that the King would be satisfied.</seg>
<seg id=1022> Given what was Politkovskaja — the responsibility of a democratic press questioning the Kremlin and its policies — the government should ensure that he would come to nothing.</seg>
<seg id=1023> The Russia of Putin has already lost 12 prominent journalists, murdered during the last six years.</seg>
<seg id=1024> None of these crimes has been investigated, which would not be the case if the "dictatorship of law" of Putin was something other than a mere public relations strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1025> The six years since the arrival of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin were marked by deeply contradictory signals.</seg>
<seg id=1026> On one hand, the world sees a graduate young leader to modernize Russia, and particularly to align law enforcement and judicial practices on international standards.</seg>
<seg id=1027> On the other hand, the President just looks on say when his former colleagues of Russian security services FSB (the former KGB) do not protect those who are being murdered, and even launch a series of cases of espionage notorious against journalists, scientists and environmental activists.</seg>
<seg id=1028> Among these "néo-espions Gregori Pasko, journalist" are an expert on arms control Igor Soutiagine, the diplomat, scientist Valentin Moiseïev Valentin Danilov and others.</seg>
<seg id=1029> The supposément civilising influence is being a Western partner, chairing a G8 summit in St. Pétersbourg, for example, appears count for nothing in the Kremlin cabale of Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1030> Once again, contact with the values of the West gave birth to another Potemkin village; Russia has a facade of laws and democratic rules, but behind this stage of carton-pâte are arbitrary butes which rule.</seg>
<seg id=1031> Global the danger is that lawlessness demonstrated by Putin exported.</seg>
<seg id=1032> Almost Russian border, a form of diplomacy criminalised is taking root.</seg>
<seg id=1033> Think of how Putin has tried to rig the elections in Ukraine, and without cesses accusations levelled and withdrawn against the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko.</seg>
<seg id=1034> Consider the breakaway regions playing the mavericks simply in Moldova and Georgia, who only exist because they have the support of the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1035> Look at how the Kremlin is trying to sing its neighbours by threatening their energy supplies.</seg>
<seg id=1036> Everyone knows that when policemen ignoring the behaviour of criminals, they will become more adventurous.</seg>
<seg id=1037> It is high time that the world recognises Vladimir Putin for what he is: a man who bring Russia to the country of the shadows.</seg>
<seg id=1038> The world must now consider this old Latin saying that tacet consentere videtur, which is equivalent to assent, and whether it really is wise to make peace to the construction by Putin of an energy superpower where law does not.</seg>
<seg id=1039> A pipeline to strengthen the Russian Empire</seg>
<seg id=1040> Gerhard Schröder, less than a month ago, was still German Chancellor has agreed to become President of the company responsible for the construction of a “ gas pipeline from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea and Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1041> In many countries, Schröder would be easily accused of the crime of conflict of interest.</seg>
<seg id=1042> Its apparent mishap is moral amplified by the fact that, at the same time, Russia threatens to stop the gas supplies to Ukraine if not yielding tariff requirements gas giant Gazprom, the Kremlin state property.</seg>
<seg id=1043> The strategic goal of Russia is obvious. Currently, no longer distribute gas to Ukraine also means that much of Europe will not approvisionnée, because many larger pipelines cross Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id=1044> Bypassing Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic states, the new pipeline will strengthen the influence of the Kremlin trying again to assert themselves in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1045> The President Vladimir Putin and his government's clones ricin will have to care about the reactions of Western Europe when they decide how firmness press the post-communist neighbours of Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1046> Europe should actually give Putin imperialist of such weapons?</seg>
<seg id=1047> Worse still, Russia should use this weapon to put the EU in its energy boot-shaped?</seg>
<seg id=1048> What a former German Chancellor takes the management which will give Russia the way to manipulate the European economy demonstrates the sufficiency of Europe in tackling dangerous neo-imperial ambitions of Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1049> Of course, the Russian media are aware of the growing dependence of Europe's energy resources by reports of Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1050> They are going to be délecter Russian éditorialistes wrote: ‘ When we have incorporated and reinforced our energy trade with Europe, it must remain silent on the issue of human rights. '</seg>
<seg id=1051> Putin expresses this position more indirect undertaking to pursue what he calls a "policy of independence."</seg>
<seg id=1052> Thus, simply wish to say that Russia must remain ‘ independent ’ concerns on the ethics of western democracy and human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1053> It may be that some European leaders really believe that maintaining the gentle prosperity for the EU to be silent about human rights and other issues that cause annoyance the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1054> Of course, we must briefly comment on commercial ‘ ’, as expropriation of Yukos. But if the Kremlin were to pay our values or our criticism of him – as over Chechnya bloodstained – it seems that Europeans would rather keep quiet than to confront a potential energy prices, or even a blockade which Ukraine is currently experiencing.</seg>
<seg id=1055> While Putin's court reorganising the Duma, by submitting to its will, the EU hopes of seeing Russia become increasingly ‘ European ’ should be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=1056> Russia that Putin is building has gradually transformed. It has neglected its hopes to become a bulwark for freedom post-Soviet oil and gas in favour of the new elite ricin.</seg>
<seg id=1057> Indeed, Matthias Warnig, the director of the pipeline consortium chaired by Mr Schröder, is a friend of Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1058> Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Warnig, the director of the Russian arm of the Bank, is creating a ex-officier of the Stasi, the former secret police in East Germany, and met Putin in the late 1980s when the Russian President was KGB spy in East Germany.</seg>
<seg id=1059> What Russians accept a government formed former KGB men, where the lack of sympathy and the refusal of dissidence are the norm, reflects its exhaustion against the uproar of the last twenty years.</seg>
<seg id=1060> Now, the Kremlin believes that what is good for the basic Russians also to citizens independent nations. No compassion is given to small countries weak once Russia retains the means to isolate and intimidate, threaten to energy blockade.</seg>
<seg id=1061> As a former Head of State of the new independent Lithuania, I have often been exposed to such threats.</seg>
<seg id=1062> The European Union has signed many agreements with Russia, including a ‘ common area ’ freedom and justice.</seg>
<seg id=1063> The Kremlin is very much to pretend that idealism.</seg>
<seg id=1064> His control over Eastern Europe has always been imposed on the basis of ‘ treated friendship ’ and the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968 were fraternal ‘ missions ’.</seg>
<seg id=1065> But look at how Putin flouts this space 'common': barbaric treatment Chechens, imprisonment business Mikhail Khodorkovsky, harassment of foreign NGOs and the prosecution of Yuliya Tymoshenko, one of the Orange Revolution égéries, by the Russian military judges on trumped-up charges completely.</seg>
<seg id=1066> If Europeans sincerely believe in their common area of human rights and freedoms, they must nevertheless acknowledge that these values are not shared by the henchmen of Putin bear.</seg>
<seg id=1067> The same applies to regard to treat Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=1068> Is it conceivable that the homeland of the ‘ Red Terror ’, countless crimes committed to the Soviet era and still hands dirty Lithuanians blood on the Caucasians really can help combat the global threat wielded by Iran and North Korea?</seg>
<seg id=1069> It seems more likely that the Kremlin cold will exploit every crisis to increase their power of destruction and their influence.</seg>
<seg id=1070> For decades, the region of Europe that has been left to the mercy of evil.</seg>
<seg id=1071> That is why I cannot remain silent when Europe blindly trébuche in a new appeasement.</seg>
<seg id=1072> We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have learned of our history that behind every diplomatic act of Russia is an imperialist ambition.</seg>
<seg id=1073> The western Europeans, who have forgotten this history, should heed our warnings.</seg>
<seg id=1074> The dependence on Russia – even if it takes the form of so-called 'Gerhard Schröder charismatic, can only lead us into a wall.</seg>
<seg id=1075> against Iraq: shots of ballot papers</seg>
<seg id=1076> When the Iraq war began in 2003, the Bush administration caressait of ambitious projects: like Germany and Japan, a long and peaceful post-1945 occupation was seen, during which increased oil production would ensure greater wealth with the democratic structures are piece by piece bureaucracies.</seg>
<seg id=1077> The basis should be a post-modern liberal constitution, or top the guarantee of 25% of parliamentary seats insured women.</seg>
<seg id=1078> The current Iraq is neither peace nor prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1079> The constitution must be adopted on 15 October this includes the 25% rule, but did nothing Liberal.</seg>
<seg id=1080> The disposition-clé (Article 2) stating that no law cannot contradict the unchallenged "laws of Islam" violates the basic principles of parliamentary sovereignty, and prevents the legislation to meet international standards.</seg>
<seg id=1081> For example, the age of consent to sex for girls cannot be high over nine years, because Mohammed himself had a wife of nine years.</seg>
<seg id=1082> It follows that girls nine years are also adults in terms of criminal law and reasonable punishment for, for example, conversion to another religion.</seg>
<seg id=1083> The Shia can use this clause to put their ayatollahs above the elected parliament, as in Iran, because they alone are allowed to determine the "laws" of Islam.</seg>
<seg id=1084> Outsiders and the Iraqi liberal some particular worry about this of Islamic clause, but the opposition to the constitution, widespread among Sunnis, seeks other provisions: the exclusion of "Baath party saddamiste" of politics and government, and the federalist clauses that grant autonomy to 18 provinces Iraqi and allow them to join in regional governments.</seg>
<seg id=1085> The law of exclusion is a personal problem for the Sunni elites, which include thousands of businessmen, liberals, even artists, who, with a few exceptions, were all Ba'ath members.</seg>
<seg id=1086> In theory, the constitutional ban might not be retroactive.</seg>
<seg id=1087> In practice, the administrative laws are now implemented to exclude the members of the so-called "Baath high-ranking" of all forms of employment in government regards thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id=1088> The Sunnis accept probably the provisions federalists if they were applied to the Kurds.</seg>
<seg id=1089> They know that the alternative is not a return to centralism but the secession of three provinces of Kurdish majority of Dahuk, Arbil and As Sulaymaniyah to form an independent Kurdistan, with its own Treasury, its army (the Pesh Merga), and its oil production around Kirkuk, second largest reserves of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=1090> The Sunnis reject this same federalism for the Shia because they regard them as fellow Arabs who have always accepted the Sunni law in the past and will again, unless they have their own government.</seg>
<seg id=1091> That is what would the new constitution, because the southern provinces - which possess major oil reserves - for Iraqi Shiite majority could form their own regional government.</seg>
<seg id=1092> In the usual style of the East, Sunnis disappointed and disaffected leaders of the constitution now threaten to use violence.</seg>
<seg id=1093> But federalism is not the only reason why the supporters of the Sunni domination and the Islamists launch deadly attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1094> Their opposition is more basic: they do not accept the principle of democratic government by the majority.</seg>
<seg id=1095> Instead, they seek to restore the rule of the Sunni minority.</seg>
<seg id=1096> For the Islamists, all the Shia deserve death anyway, as apostates.</seg>
<seg id=1097> A Moqtada Sadr Shiite leader, also vehemently opposed to federalism.</seg>
<seg id=1098> His followers, largely illiterate, are the poorest and most violent Shiites slums of Baghdad and beyond, whose "mahdi militia" fought against US troops in 2004, even while the Americans protected Shia Sunni attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1099> As a young drift priest his authority of his father, a populist late Ayatollah himself, Sadr faces the opposition of Iraqi ayatollahs alive, who trample his ignorance and its violence.</seg>
<seg id=1100> Sadr absolutely cannot compete with them in terms of religious authority, it chooses to take a party arabe-nationaliste against them, recalling often that the highest Shiite cleric, the ayatollahs Sistani, is not Arabic but perse.</seg>
<seg id=1101> Similarly, it reminds supporters that Mr Hakim El, who lead the Supreme Council of the Islamic revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) and their militia "Badr" were subsidized exiles in Iran, which fought the Iranian side during the Iran-Iraq war long and bitter until the Americans' bring them back. "</seg>
<seg id=1102> Sadr is opposed to federalism because a regional government Shiite obéirait to its enemies, Sistani and SCIRI, and, he says, would fall under the aegis of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=1103> To highlight his message, Sadr sent his men fought successfully Badr militia in Baghdad, where many, but not mahdis in Najaf, where Sadr is haï after the destruction that it has caused last year until its men were massacred by the Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1104> It was difficult enough to tackle the villain Sadr. Now, a mere political calculation suggests that it will probably be the main person to decide the outcome of the vote on the constitution of October.</seg>
<seg id=1105> To reject the constitution and provoke new elections, opponents of a constitutional assembly need a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces.</seg>
<seg id=1106> The Sunnis are likely to prevail in two provinces, but if Sadr now instructing his supporters slums to Baghdad to vote not with the local Sunni, it will probably fall the capital in the hands of opponents of the constitution and ensure its defeat.</seg>
<seg id=1107> Like any political rogue, Sadr is naturally to sell.</seg>
<seg id=1108> Last year it was sought for murder.</seg>
<seg id=1109> Today it is seeking recognition as a statesman, he wants money, and, at least implicitly, the humiliation of Sistani and SCIRI.</seg>
<seg id=1110> It may very well receive proposals, and the negotiations have perhaps already begun.</seg>
<seg id=1111> But some Shia it attacks with words and bullets thousands of armed men have at their disposal and for them, it deserves that shot in return.</seg>
<seg id=1112> The end of secrecy</seg>
<seg id=1113> Transparency is not always an easy exercise in the new democracies of Eastern Europe. That is what has discovered the Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, when a registration in which he had the lies of his government has caused riots.</seg>
<seg id=1114> As Hungary, postcommunist Romania has tried to encourage openness and honesty in a society that used among the most closed in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1115> But the persistence of a culture of secrecy has been blown corruption and abuse of power.</seg>
<seg id=1116> It can nonetheless real progress towards transparency, evolution recognized by the European Union gave the green light to Romania for membership in spring 2007.</seg>
<seg id=1117> Apart from the establishment of what the EU is today for a "functioning market economy", the essential reforms in the political and legal area which I am responsible will strengthen the transparency and control of financing political parties to the reorganisation of the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id=1118> The judicial reforms help to eradicate corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1119> Are there ministers and former ministers, parliamentarians, judges, lawyers, and police, customs and other public bodies and private entrepreneurs were accused.</seg>
<seg id=1120> Moreover, new forms have been developed for the declaration of assets and financial interests by people in public office in government, parliament, in public administration and in the local and judiciary.</seg>
<seg id=1121> The new forms of declaration are most detailed in Europe, and especially they are made public.</seg>
<seg id=1122> The progress Romania are confirmed by a report published this month, that the people of Eastern Europe now have access to information and those of governmental settled democracies.</seg>
<seg id=1123> The report Transparency and Silence, the Open Society Justice Initiative (available on www.justiceinitiative.org), even says that the new democracies are sometimes better than the former Romanian government bodies: some respond to requests for more information than French or Spanish.</seg>
<seg id=1124> Specifically, 60% of applications are met in Romania, against 31% in France and 24% in Spain.</seg>
<seg id=1125> Among other good performers, one can cite Peru and Mexico, two countries which have passed legislation on freedom of information in 2002, shortly after Romania.</seg>
<seg id=1126> Yet it is not always easier to access to sensitive information in democracies in transition.</seg>
<seg id=1127> I worked as a lawyer in defence of human rights within the Committee Romanian Helsinki, and we have often had to take the courts to demand information, under Romanian legislation in 2001 for freedom of information.</seg>
<seg id=1128> For example, when we have officially obtained access to data on telephone tapping authorised by the public prosecutor, it has simply ignored this decision.</seg>
<seg id=1129> We have attacked the civilian, and the judge has established fines for each day late in the communication of information.</seg>
<seg id=1130> Only when the media are interested in the country, that the data - number of interceptions permitted during the previous ten years, people covered and duration of operations - have been made public.</seg>
<seg id=1131> Romania has now finally begun to turn our backs on a past characterised by the predominance of the Securitate.</seg>
<seg id=1132> I am now part of the government, and I realise that it is not always clear to share some information with the public.</seg>
<seg id=1133> But sometimes painful reforms are needed.</seg>
<seg id=1134> We would not have carried out the economic and political reforms which will enable us to enter the EU without submitting our policies to public scrutiny and accept the increased participation of citizens in decision-making accompanying inevitably such openness.</seg>
<seg id=1135> Indeed, access to information has become a prerequisite of democracy throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id=1136> When the United States has adopted the Freedom of Information Act in 1966, they were the only with Sweden and Finland.</seg>
<seg id=1137> Today, 65 countries have acquired such legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1138> In Romania, those who fought for a Free Information Act to take full advantage.</seg>
<seg id=1139> According to the study of Justice Initiative, people who write to the Romanian Government readily receive information that it would have been unthinkable to communicate a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id=1140> Thus, the Ministry of Defence has disclosed the number of soldiers who died in 2003 and the circumstances that (including 13 suicides, two deaths dead, and two died in battle in Afghanistan).</seg>
<seg id=1141> Another example, the Court of Bucharest has received a request concerning the number of judges a disciplinary procedure since the beginning of 2000, and the reasons for possible sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=1142> The Court sent this request to the Supreme Council of Magistracy, which gave a comprehensive answer: four pages listing all the magistrates punished, motives and action.</seg>
<seg id=1143> This process is both the fruit and the motor of further reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1144> The rulers have not always been very happy with openness, and the battle continues for the most sensitive documents.</seg>
<seg id=1145> But in the post-Communist countries, the benefits of transparency are undeniable.</seg>
<seg id=1146> Yet the experience of Romania shows that official secrecy is always a threat, no country is immune, and only constant vigilance can prevent undermining the foundations of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1147> The saving of life trees</seg>
<seg id=1148> Nobody can finish its day without having used a sideshow of the forest.</seg>
<seg id=1149> In a far more important than people give, the paper it writing, water flowing from our taps, medicines, which we are treating wood which our houses and our furniture are all factors have forests.</seg>
<seg id=1150> Forests are an fresh air we breathe and protect the endangered species.</seg>
<seg id=1151> They also offer leisure places, which is becoming increasingly important in the complexity of our world.</seg>
<seg id=1152> About 1.5 billion people living in the rural poor depend directly forests for their basic needs in food and firewood.</seg>
<seg id=1153> Yet deforestation is continuing.</seg>
<seg id=1154> Every year we lose 14.6 million hectares of forest, is an area nearly four times as much as Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id=1155> The irresponsible management of forests, exacerbated by regulations and too weak government bonds, and the markets which reward illegal slaughter all conspire to deny the world of its most precious forests and the greatest threat.</seg>
<seg id=1156> When forests are beginning to disappear, a series of environmental, social and economic problems are affecting us all usually somehow.</seg>
<seg id=1157> The island of Sumatra in Indonesia is a good example.</seg>
<seg id=1158> Companies of pasta and papers are an endemic and illegal destruction of forests which harbours greater diversity of plants in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1159> It is highly likely that unknown plants would disappear in endangered species such as rhinos and the elephant Sumatra and orang-outang.</seg>
<seg id=1160> When the forest Sumatra has disappeared, whole communities will also places of life without decent means or appropriate.</seg>
<seg id=1161> Moreover, the distortions that trade in illegal products and cheap products imposes upon world markets is causing difficulties for the people responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1162> Developing countries lost USD 15 billion of tax revenues every year to illegal slaughter.</seg>
<seg id=1163> To compound the all, wood for reconstruction, following the tsunami last year, has intensified an application already unsustainable towards the forests Sumatra.</seg>
<seg id=1164> The Territory ponds and the Congo are subject to similar threats.</seg>
<seg id=1165> A recent study, the UN millennium eco-systems Assessment (EM), shows that forests and other important regions have a serious decline because of their mismanagement and will continue to disappear if serious measures are not implemented.</seg>
<seg id=1166> The information published by the Brazilian Government show that the deforestation of forests in Amazonia irreplaceable the agricultural conversion, reached 2.6 million hectares last year, which is the total area of deforestation of the Amazon 17%.</seg>
<seg id=1167> Yet the battle against deforestation is not yet lost.</seg>
<seg id=1168> Various organisations, defence movements and businesses concerned about the global forest working together to reverse the phenomenon of deforestation and improve the management of forests.</seg>
<seg id=1169> For example, the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) and the World Bank have helped the Brazilian Government to launch an initiative to establish new areas of protection of forests on more than 17 million hectares in the form of national parks.</seg>
<seg id=1170> Cooperation WWF and the World Bank has also led other partners to establish a Trust Fund for managing these protected areas.</seg>
<seg id=1171> Similarly, a summit meeting of the leaders of the countries of the Congo Basin has enabled cross-border cooperation for the conservation of forests and their proper management.</seg>
<seg id=1172> All this has led subsequently to release USD 53 million from the US State Department to promote the conservation of forests in the Congo.</seg>
<seg id=1173> Since the first meeting of leaders in 1999, 3.5 million hectares of protected areas have recently been held in the Congo Basin.</seg>
<seg id=1174> Nevertheless, given the consequences of the Asian tsunami of December, the weight of the arguments provided by the EM and statistics on deforestation of the most critical regions, we must continue our efforts.</seg>
<seg id=1175> The World Bank and the World Wildlife Fund recently pledged to work towards the reduction of 10% of global rates of deforestation for 2010 and to work with the institutions of the public and private sectors to make ambitious conservation of forests.</seg>
<seg id=1176> Studies show that if WWF global forests are shared between various uses, including the protection of certain areas, commercial management responsibility and the restoration of forestry landscape, we can support in forestry products while maintaining global environmental and social values essential to our near future.</seg>
<seg id=1177> The leaders of companies, governments, civil society organisations must all play their part in achieving this vision.</seg>
<seg id=1178> The Saudis are they the extremists?</seg>
<seg id=1179> The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have led many to question the prospects of survival of the House of Saud and reigning to question whether the kingdom is fundamentally dysfonctionnel and destructive.</seg>
<seg id=1180> For some reason, it seems that the Saudi society has created a stream of violent fanaticism inspired by extreme religious orthodoxy.</seg>
<seg id=1181> The fact that 15 of 19 hijackers who contributed to the attacks of 11 September 2001 against the United States were Saudis has crystallised a deep-rooted perception of the kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.</seg>
<seg id=1182> In some ways, this perception is right, but it cannot be applied to the Saudi population as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=1183> On the contrary, it would be a serious mistake to assume that defines entirely fanatical Islamic attitudes toward Saudi religion.</seg>
<seg id=1184> Between 2001 and 2003, I was part of a team to undertake a large-scale study of values Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and Jordan.</seg>
<seg id=1185> Our findings have produced a remarkably nuanced picture Saudi attitudes.</seg>
<seg id=1186> In comparison with the respondents capita other countries of the East, the Saudis were the least of all religious in general, and their attitudes towards democracy and arranged marriages show a moderate underlying sentiment.</seg>
<seg id=1187> It is true that in the four countries, religiosity is widespread over 90% of respondents indicating collectively they believe in God, in life after death, and heaven and hell.</seg>
<seg id=1188> But the Saudis seem less religious than their Muslim faith.</seg>
<seg id=1189> 62% of the Saudis were described as individuals, against religious 82% of Iranians, 85% of Jordanians and 98% of Egyptiens.</seg>
<seg id=1190> The Americans also appear to be more religious than the Saudis, with 81%.</seg>
<seg id=1191> This variation can partly be explained by transnational differences on what the word 'religious prejudice'.</seg>
<seg id=1192> For example, the Americans can define religiosity differently of people in the Middle East, with perhaps a less pronounced attachment to religious beliefs that in Islamic countries.</seg>
<seg id=1193> This may also account partly of differences between the Muslim countries.</seg>
<seg id=1194> But the gap between the Saudis and the Iranians, Jordanians and Egyptiens of the other for religious prejudice autodéfinie, is so great that it makes the widespread perception of an extremely conservative and religious Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=1195> Indeed, the actions are more parlantes than words: just 28% of the Saudis declared they were attending weekly religious services, against 27% of Iranians, 44% of Jordanians, 42% of Egyptiens and 45% of Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1196> These conclusions, although contrary to popular perceptions Saudi culture, are less startling than they appear.</seg>
<seg id=1197> Sociologists religion have long supported in an environment monolithic religious, or when the religious institutions are closely linked to the State, religiosity decline of the global population.</seg>
<seg id=1198> It is reasonable to think that when the state authorities apply rigid behavioural codes, individuals tend to revolt and from religious institutions officially established.</seg>
<seg id=1199> It is thus hardly surprising that the Egyptiens and Jordan, living in countries where the State does not apply piété, are more religious than the Iranians or the Saudis, who must deal with the police "virtuous" supported by the local state.</seg>
<seg id=1200> Even on the issue of marriage, many Saudis have expressed opinions surprisingly liberal.</seg>
<seg id=1201> The respondents were split virtually equally on the issue arranged marriages, half supporting the idea that marriage must be based on consent, 48% against parental that considered love as marriage basis.</seg>
<seg id=1202> Given the gender segregation and the paternal dominance firmly, this looks reveal a strong desire to individual sharper in what has always been, traditionally, a family decision.</seg>
<seg id=1203> Finally, the Saudis are staunch supporters of democracy, contradicting once again the widespread picture of Saudi conservatism.</seg>
<seg id=1204> On all the Saudis interviewed, 58% regarded democracy as the best form of government that is, 23% were in disagreement and 18% have not.</seg>
<seg id=1205> The massive support for democracy in a country without secular history seems contre-intuitif and nationalist.</seg>
<seg id=1206> In fact, support for democracy reflects several other liberal attitudes which we have witnessed in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=1207> Advocates of democracy tend to be less religious centuries, more tolerant towards others, more critical of the actions of the public sector, and more worried by the Western cultural invasion.</seg>
<seg id=1208> Beyond the data of the study, history has shown that liberal ideas are becoming more widespread when a despotic monarch governs with the support of a religious institution.</seg>
<seg id=1209> A strong tide of liberalism arose at the end of the ninth century in Syria in response to the Ottoman despotism of Sultan religious Abdulhamid.</seg>
<seg id=1210> At the same time, a secular movement on behalf of the anti-clérical constitutionalism appeared in Iran, in response to the absolutist alliance between the shahs Quajar and the religious institution.</seg>
<seg id=1211> In the light of historical similarities between these precedents and the current conditions in Saudi Arabia, we should not rule out the possibility of reform.</seg>
<seg id=1212> The data from the study also suggest that the Saudis may well require a more transparent and less interventionist religion.</seg>
<seg id=1213> The European museum</seg>
<seg id=1214> At the end of the nineteenth century, Asia accounted for Europeans artistic inspiration or the target of imperialist ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1215> Conversely, Europe was a symbol of modernity - for the Japanese of the Meiji era – or decadence – for the Chinese.</seg>
<seg id=1216> A century later, thanks to the Japanese economic miracle, Europeans saw at least a small part of Asia as a centre of rapid technological and industrial progress.</seg>
<seg id=1217> Today, at the dawn of the 21st century, the mutual perceptions of Europe and Asia are changing radically, with booming Asian economies and a European Union in full identity crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1218> Some important Asian personalities, as the former Prime Minister singapourien Lee Kuan Yew, issued warnings to Europeans: if they continue on this path, their continent will soon have no interest for tourism and top-of-the-range property.</seg>
<seg id=1219> A Chinese influential businessman who share his time between Hong Kong and London, was even more precise.</seg>
<seg id=1220> He said a few weeks ago, during a private demonstration in Paris with political leaders and big businessmen: "You are becoming of developing countries. You are wasting your time with the Constitution, the welfare state, the crisis of funding of pensions, and you give systematically the wrong answers to questions raised".</seg>
<seg id=1221> The idea Europeans have of Asia in general, and China in particular, is more complex. It is adapting to a respectable lucid new competitor, the ideological rejection pure and simple.</seg>
<seg id=1222> In mai1968, some French students taken to the streets to invent a new world dreamt of China, Mao, a country in a senseless and brutal Cultural Revolution.</seg>
<seg id=1223> This was the result both absurd fascination of ignorance of the crimes of the Maoist regime, that slackness felt in a prosperous society close to full employment.</seg>
<seg id=1224> Today, their heirs openly criticizes the Asian capitalist model.</seg>
<seg id=1225> China, once anti-capitaliste star utopian revolutionaries became the enemy ultra-liberal shrink by a new generation of reactionary Utopians who defend the status quo in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1226> The students who demonstrated recently in the streets of Paris do not want to emulate the Chinese and Indians; they reject the logic of globalisation and the abandonment of hard-won social achievements.</seg>
<seg id=1227> The attitude of European economic elites is very different.</seg>
<seg id=1228> They have understood that their conceptions of nostalgia post-coloniales tribunal that China and India are large export markets and huge reservoirs of cheap labour, are obsolete.</seg>
<seg id=1229> These countries have become real competitors worthy of respect and admiration.</seg>
<seg id=1230> The quality, the costs and deadlines of delivery – in the car industry for example - are reaching the European level.</seg>
<seg id=1231> Europe retains an advantage in scientific disciplines, as for the pharmaceutical industry, but very efficient new firms, especially in India, manage to recruit graduates from the MIT and Harvard, and, through still lower wage costs – to remain competitive internationally.</seg>
<seg id=1232> Unfortunately, if the European leaders have realised Asian challenge, they failed to translate into a lesson of realism in a globalised world irresistible, or in a call to arms for social and economic.</seg>
<seg id=1233> In fact, the European politicians, with a few rare exceptions like Tony Blair, have taken too long to adapt to evolutions fulgurantes in Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1234> Dépourvus long-term strategy, and obsessed with short-term interests, the European politicians - unlike employers - have not won their Asian counterparts.</seg>
<seg id=1235> Yet, on a continent which has failed to bury the past and ending the spectre of nationalism, the EU is also a model of reconciliation, peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1236> But this image can survive a further decline?</seg>
<seg id=1237> For the Asians, the European model could become a political version of Venice: a place that we visit with nostalgia for a last greatness, as an admirable museum.</seg>
<seg id=1238> Red and blue</seg>
<seg id=1239> The appointment of Condoleezza Rice as US Secretary of State Colin Powell replacing shows that the recent presidential elections have yet powerful repercussions.</seg>
<seg id=1240> It is important that the Americans but above all the rest of the world understand what these elections showed in America.</seg>
<seg id=1241> The presidential election this year shows that the US démocracie is safe, and that certain things would gain from being improved.</seg>
<seg id=1242> Unlike the election of 2000, when President Bush had not received the support of the popular vote and barely won the vote of the electoral college, Mr Bush has prevailed 3.5 million votes this time.</seg>
<seg id=1243> While some Democrats remain bitter, the legitimacy of the victory of Mr Bush cannot be questioned.</seg>
<seg id=1244> America is deeply divided between Member States, and the red, Republicans, Democrats peacekeepers.</seg>
<seg id=1245> If 100 000 votes were moved into the Red State Ohio, John Kerry would become president (despite a popular vote minority).</seg>
<seg id=1246> The electoral college was incorporated in the US Constitution to protect small countries in the federal system and implies that the election campaign now focuses very largely on a dozen countries at most, battlefields where public opinion is closely divided.</seg>
<seg id=1247> Basically, there is something incredible in the election of Presidents without popular majority.</seg>
<seg id=1248> It is therefore time to discuss the amendment of the constitution to abolish the electoral college.</seg>
<seg id=1249> Some observers complain of the rhetoric and negative advertisements good to sow discord which have characterised this campaign.</seg>
<seg id=1250> This must be assessed in historical terms.</seg>
<seg id=1251> At the time of the founding fathers newspapers became easily party and George Wahsington was extremely dismayed by the harshness of language policy.</seg>
<seg id=1252> For most of its premium history, let alone civil war and the period of reconstruction, the country was closely divided than it is today and bitter rhetoric campaigns has always reflected this close competition.</seg>
<seg id=1253> Nevertheless, despite the negative advertisements on both sides, the three national debates televised raised important questions in a serious format and were largely followed.</seg>
<seg id=1254> In general, President-in-Office benefiting economic growth has every chance to be re-elected.</seg>
<seg id=1255> In this sense, the real surprise of the re-election of Mr Bush was the narrow margin of its majority.</seg>
<seg id=1256> In large part, this is due to the unpopularity of the war in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=1257> Mr Kerry has tried to transform the war, the low rate of employment, inadequate medical coverage and tax credits from Mr Bush towards the disadvantaged classes of the central issues in the campaign but some observers felt that it fails to send a clear message.</seg>
<seg id=1258> Mr Bush has nipped with security against terrorism and a cultural populism on issues such as abortion and gay marriage.</seg>
<seg id=1259> Finally, populism cultural and security won against economic populism.</seg>
<seg id=1260> The interpretation of elections was influenced by the polls exit polls where the voters would decide (after having voted) on the issues which ontle most pressing for them.</seg>
<seg id=1261> Most (22%) replied ‘ moral values ’, by comparison only 20% have quoted the economy and 19% terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=1262> The social conservatives have interpreted it as meaning that they had won the election of Mr Bush and his second term their programme should dominate.</seg>
<seg id=1263> However, the Pew poll conducted a week after the election indicated that the category of ‘ moral values ’ embrace a wide variety of issues and more rights to abortion and gay marriage.</seg>
<seg id=1264> In fact, the opinion polls show that 25% of the public defends marriage gay and 35% are in favour of statutory civil unions gay couples (position defended Mr Kerry).</seg>
<seg id=1265> Nevertheless, for the 37% who oppose gay marriage in particular in the country's soft centre, the question rally of supporters of Mr Bush to come to the polls.</seg>
<seg id=1266> The question is, overall, if the US are divided beyond hope.</seg>
<seg id=1267> The Member red and electoral card blue-eyed gave rise to the Internet jokes and designs humoristiques on the secession of the two shores of the blue Red centre.</seg>
<seg id=1268> Some appelent this ‘ Côtopie ’.</seg>
<seg id=1269> But the divisions are not so clear.</seg>
<seg id=1270> In both sides, many states have been won by a narrow margin and if we colore the cards by county rather than by State, most of the country is violet.</seg>
<seg id=1271> against suburbs and rural areas) would be a better description of the situation instead of Côtes against heart of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1272> Indeed, public opinion polls show that the majority of Americans are concentrated at the centre moderate political spectrum rather than two extremes.</seg>
<seg id=1273> But the political elites such as the political activists and members of Congress tend to be more extremist than the public.</seg>
<seg id=1274> At first glance this seems surprising, since they should feel attracted by the wealthy center voice.</seg>
<seg id=1275> However, many members of Congress represent districts that are granted to their advantage and the real threat to their primary standing for re-election, dominated by the parties most militants and extreme parties.</seg>
<seg id=1276> This trend is reinforced by the rise of cable TV, which draws viewers through programmes controversial of info-divertissement, and the Internet called Blogs chronic editors, starting in polemics persistent no filter editorial.</seg>
<seg id=1277> A reform that would change the borders of the districts of Congress to make them more competitive permettrer to respond to this problem, but few Members will vote for such changes that could increase the risk of their defeat.</seg>
<seg id=1278> The narrow margin of results suggest that Mr Bush does not really change the mandate he think have won.</seg>
<seg id=1279> Given the difficult issues in foreign policy, fiscal and dociale, it would be wise to look at the centre instead of reconciling its conservative basis, but the policy which prevails between the policy of conviction or pragmatic policy remains uncertain.</seg>
<seg id=1280> oil Décrochons!</seg>
<seg id=1281> The Chancellor Angela Merkel has made the fight against global warming the main priority of German presidencies of the European Union and the G8 which began in January.</seg>
<seg id=1282> Its practical proposal is general enough to deal with leaders and accept this, and quite clearly that other governments and businesses understands: at the next G8 summit, we must simply set a date from which diesel-driven vehicles are registered in the large industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg id=1283> This decision will have a considerable positive impact on economic and geopolitical levels.</seg>
<seg id=1284> Today, the real concern in energy is not linked to the reduction of global reserves of oil, but rather the decline of production within the largest consumers – Europe, the US and China, while the growing demand in Asia strike the market.</seg>
<seg id=1285> The available reserves will focus more on East, because other parts of the world will soon be dry.</seg>
<seg id=1286> Moreover, the major oil exporters are not prepared to submit their investment policies under market conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1287> The only Saudi Arabia wants to manage its oil production and, for its part, Iran scares potential investors with its bureaucratic obstacles and its corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1288> Iraq is a lack of security, while foreigners are frustrated every attempt to investment in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1289> These four states contain half of world oil reserves, which two thirds could potentially be exported.</seg>
<seg id=1290> These factors, besides production costs, high oil prices and the race for contracts in Africa and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1291> To believe that oil prices is good for the environment takes no account of basic data in international politics.</seg>
<seg id=1292> First, in most poor countries of Africa and Asia, the import of oil represents a larger proportion of national expenditure in industrialised countries, which means that economic growth and social development are compromised, and new debt crises.</seg>
<seg id=1293> The income of oil production hamper the reforms in the main exporters.</seg>
<seg id=1294> With the strengthening of their financial power, the regimes such as those of Venezuela and Iran feel less constrained by international rules.</seg>
<seg id=1295> The latest entrants among the big countries energy users, as China, reproduce the old habits of the West and their long tradition of industrialised condone violations of human rights, in order to guarantee lucrative contracts with the oil-rich and authoritarian regimes.</seg>
<seg id=1296> Only the political and economic lorries, the industrialised countries that remain by far the largest consumer of oil can make a start globally.</seg>
<seg id=1297> It is important to begin by the transport sector, which currently accounts for over half of oil consumption, which is set to rise in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1298> Therefore, the G8 countries must agree to stop registering new vehicles travelling at petrol by 2025.</seg>
<seg id=1299> This decision is not directed against individual mobility, but against the waste of a scarce resource intended primarily to produce synthetic materials.</seg>
<seg id=1300> Politicians must not prioritise any particular technology.</seg>
<seg id=1301> They should rather encourage the automobile industry to develop alternative technologies that use biofuels, the éthylène, hydrogen and even natural gas, for a transitional period.</seg>
<seg id=1302> Countries which paved the way for the political will here, as collateral benefit, national industries in first place in energy technology for the future markets.</seg>
<seg id=1303> The expected major reduction of CO2 emissions may eventually lead to the necessary progress of international climate policy.</seg>
<seg id=1304> Economic development is also at stake: if we soignons our ‘ dependence on oil ’, poor countries and less developed and the newly industrialised countries may be more, thereby bringing prices and calmerait energy competition.</seg>
<seg id=1305> In geopolitical terms, the benefits are equally evident, especially the major oil exporters would be far less able to blackmail the industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg id=1306> This turnaround would increase the strength of negotiation of the international community would strengthen the Middle East and social forces countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia, who seriously want to promote economic and political reform.</seg>
<seg id=1307> Greater car manufacturing and advanced high-technology countries, Germany is well placed to launch such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id=1308> Angela Merkel, who holds a doctorate in physical and began his political career as Environment Minister in 1995 – chairing the first conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change – would be more credible than any other of its Members of the European Union and G8 to tackle the problem.</seg>
<seg id=1309> It is time to make an act of bravery policy.</seg>
<seg id=1310> The Mythe of humanitarian aid and trade</seg>
<seg id=1311> Humanitarian aid and trade became fashionable words.</seg>
<seg id=1312> A humanitarian aid (an enhanced debt relief) and better access to markets of rich countries for products of poor countries: it seems to have taken the top of the international agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1313> In fact, the debate today is no longer on measures, but on the quantity of measures and how quickly.</seg>
<seg id=1314> Perdues with it: the clear lessons to learn from past five decades of economic development.</seg>
<seg id=1315> On top of these lessons, we discover that economic development is left largely in the hands of poor nations themselves.</seg>
<seg id=1316> Countries that have recently débrouillés managed through their own efforts.</seg>
<seg id=1317> Humanitarian aid and the markets have played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id=1318> Take the example of a developing country which enjoys preferential access to the market of its larger neighbour, which is also the most powerful economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1319> Assuming that the country is able to send millions of its citizens work across the border, receives a huge volume of foreign investment and is fully integrated into international production chains.</seg>
<seg id=1320> Moreover, the country's banking system is supported by its rich neighbour and its stated desire to act as lender of last resort.</seg>
<seg id=1321> Globalisation could come under better auspices than those?</seg>
<seg id=1322> Consider a second country now.</seg>
<seg id=1323> It has a trade embargo on the biggest world market, do not receive foreign aid or any form of support from the Western world is excluded from international organisations such as the WTO and cannot borrow at the IMF and World Bank.</seg>
<seg id=1324> If these external handicaps were not sufficiently debilitating, can be added an economy which interview itself barriers against international trade (in the form of state trade tariffs and import quotas).</seg>
<seg id=1325> As has been guess reader, these countries really exist: Mexico and Vietnam.</seg>
<seg id=1326> Mexico shares a border of 3 200 kilometres long with the United States, which offers not only privileged access to a market of goods and, but also a proportion of the US Treasury (as the experience of the peso crisis in 1995 has demonstrated).</seg>
<seg id=1327> However, America has maintained a trade embargo against Vietnam until 1994, has not restored diplomatic relations before 1995 and only granted the most-favoured-nation status of the Vietnamese imports that many years later.</seg>
<seg id=1328> The Vietnam has still not entered in the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1329> Let us now their economic performance.</seg>
<seg id=1330> Since the signing of NAFTA in December 1992, the Mexican economy has undergone an average annual increase of barely 1% per head.</seg>
<seg id=1331> Not only that figure is well below the rate champions of the Asian economy, but it is also only a fraction of clean growth performance in Mexico decades before the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).</seg>
<seg id=1332> The Vietnam, however, has experienced an annual increase of 5.6% per head since the beginning of its economic reforms in 1988 and the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with the US in 1995, and continuing rapid growth at a rate of 4.5% since.</seg>
<seg id=1333> Vietnam has witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty while Mexico fell real wages.</seg>
<seg id=1334> These two countries have experienced a pronounced take-off of international trade and foreign investment, but the picture is very uneven where it matters most: in improving levels of living, particularly poor populations.</seg>
<seg id=1335> What these examples show is that the internal efforts push all other elements in determining a country's economic fortunes.</seg>
<seg id=1336> All the US market had to offer Mexico was unable to offset the consequences of policy mistakes on the internal market, especially the inability to overthrow the real exchange-rate appreciation of the peso or extended productivity gains achieved in a narrow export sector of the rest of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1337> What matters most is a country's adoption of an appropriate strategy for growth.</seg>
<seg id=1338> Without any benefits which bénéficia Mexico, Vietnam has pursued a counteracted strategy on diversification of its economy and enhancing the productive capacity of local suppliers.</seg>
<seg id=1339> The global experience in post-war underpins proof that domestic policies are what is most important.</seg>
<seg id=1340> South Korea has got off to the early 1960s, not when foreign subsidies were at their height, but when they shape up to receive.</seg>
<seg id=1341> Taiwan has not benefited from subsidies or privileged access to foreign markets.</seg>
<seg id=1342> China and India, the economic superstars, have been very successful through their own efforts of economic reform.</seg>
<seg id=1343> It is tempting to account of foreign demand for their export products the few African success, Botswana and Mauritius (respectively diamonds and clothing), but this cannot go very far.</seg>
<seg id=1344> Obviously, these two countries would be much poorer without access to foreign markets.</seg>
<seg id=1345> But, as in all cases of successful development, which the exercises are not the external advantages they enjoy but their ability to exploit these advantages.</seg>
<seg id=1346> Consider how other countries have wasted the advantage that their purchase their natural wealth.</seg>
<seg id=1347> The word ‘ diamonds ’ is not specifically to create an image of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.</seg>
<seg id=1348> Similarly, little export processing zones proliférant throughout the world have seen the level of development that we observed in Mauritius.</seg>
<seg id=1349> This does not however absolve the rich countries of their obligation to help.</seg>
<seg id=1350> They can make life difficult for corrupt dictators, sharing best financial information and refusing to recognise international contracts that they sign.</seg>
<seg id=1351> Similarly, increasing the number of workers in poor countries allowed to work in the rich countries and a broader range of policies growth-driven through relaxation of WTO rules and conditions imposed by the United States could produce a greater impact on long-term development.</seg>
<seg id=1352> It is not proven that enlargement market access and subsidies is the best use to make the political capital of the northern hemisphere.</seg>
<seg id=1353> The development should focus on improving the political environment in poor countries, rather than on aid and trade.</seg>
<seg id=1354> Interdépendances</seg>
<seg id=1355> If the Argentine great economist Raul Prebisch was living today, there is no doubt that it would be if the world started to turn round.</seg>
<seg id=1356> His theory widely influential dependency argued that if poor countries are too depended on exports of raw materials, they would never the industrial level needed to support rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id=1357> They are embourberaient instead in a cycle of global decline in commodity prices and endless reduction of income.</seg>
<seg id=1358> The answer to Prebisch favourite, protectionism, has been disastrous for the many countries of Latin America and Africa that have followed.</seg>
<seg id=1359> But the fact is that for years, Prebisch seems to have been just about the reaction of trends in commodity prices in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=1360> The permanent gains in efficiency in the agriculture and the extraction of natural resources have lowers the prices of raw materials, especially in the 1980s and 1990s.</seg>
<seg id=1361> With few exceptions, countries which have focused on exports of raw materials have only achieved of poor results, whereas the Asian countries only have few resources made rapid progress.</seg>
<seg id=1362> Today, however, with the Asian giants, India and China, joining the world economy, the price of petrol, gold, cereals and practically all other raw materials collapsing.</seg>
<seg id=1363> Admittedly, there will still rounds (the price of oil, for example, will drop probably again before starting its rise) but the long-term trend many raw materials will remain clearly rising for some time yet.</seg>
<seg id=1364> What many trade negotiators and other decision-makers it did not recognise yet, whereas Prebisch would have understood immediately is that this sudden reversal of situation has enormous implications for the global balance of power.</seg>
<seg id=1365> Indeed, any other aspect of economic globalisation will not of big challenges to the leaders of the world over the coming decades.</seg>
<seg id=1366> There are many questions.</seg>
<seg id=1367> Rich countries today are prepared to enter a co-dépendance period in which they are equally desperately seeking commodities that developing countries are industrialised products and technologies?</seg>
<seg id=1368> Are they ready for the inevitable flow of power and influence towards the commodity-dependent countries as they will certainly?</seg>
<seg id=1369> How the two superpowers of the world, China and the United States, will manage the fact that major exporting areas of raw materials in Africa and the Middle East into Central Asia are covered to badly trained nation-states?</seg>
<seg id=1370> Certain self-styled prophets expose the problem as the natural reserves and claim that the most critical materials decreasing at an alarming rate.</seg>
<seg id=1371> Today, many adherents of the theory of the peak "Hubbert" of oil production that we have reached the upper limits of our production capacity, that sinks are assèchent and that the situation will deteriorate.</seg>
<seg id=1372> However, as indicated by the distinguished historian Dan Yergin oil, the ill-intentioned turned out that the black gold resources were about to receive at least four times already.</seg>
<seg id=1373> Each time, technological progress radicals have made these threats slip.</seg>
<seg id=1374> In the late 1800, oil extraction years implied by draguer with mulets.</seg>
<seg id=1375> Today, forer to 3 000 metres below sea soil is natural for everyone.</seg>
<seg id=1376> Such progress has also been made in the areas of the production of metals and agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=1377> No, the world is not facing a shortage of raw materials.</seg>
<seg id=1378> In fact, it happens that the integration of 2.5 billion people (China and India) in the world economy produces a shift of demand likely to put more pressure on the rising price of raw materials that no technological gains will probably capable of counterbalancing.</seg>
<seg id=1379> Therefore, and at least 50 to 75 years, and perhaps even until humans are forer on Mars over centuries to come, the price of many natural resources will rise.</seg>
<seg id=1380> The new balance of economic powers resulting world political will destabilise the situation?</seg>
<seg id=1381> The first World War was partly caused by the concern of Germany before the monopolising by other colonial powers of too much of the world's oil and raw materials.</seg>
<seg id=1382> Similarly, during the Second World War, Japan has feared for the stability of its supplies and other natural resources in oil coming from abroad.</seg>
<seg id=1383> Such tensions between China will appear uncertain resources (even water scarcity is problematic) and the West?</seg>
<seg id=1384> Fortunately, this does not seem likely to present, particularly in view of the pragmatic approach that also sober problems of resources of their country displayed by the Chinese leaders.</seg>
<seg id=1385> The Chinese turn to regions like Africa in the hope of finding stable trading partners.</seg>
<seg id=1386> They do not share the political évangélisme of Americans who do not only want to trade with exporters of raw materials, but also claim to convert.</seg>
<seg id=1387> Then there are those American leaders who still talk about making the USA self-sufficient in terms of energy resources.</seg>
<seg id=1388> This is a joke: enough, perhaps, but auto-suffisants, never.</seg>
<seg id=1389> Much of the Arab world understandably believe that the invasion of Iraq is the cornerstone of the US strategy to obtain stable energy resources.</seg>
<seg id=1390> If they are right, we can only hope that America has a fallback.</seg>
<seg id=1391> Meanwhile, the prices of raw materials will continue to increase, and the oil exporters constitute the largest contributors to the US yawning trade deficit.</seg>
<seg id=1392> Perhaps the real American strategy to try to cure on oil exporting countries so much money that they will become dependent on the happiness they provide the America!</seg>
<seg id=1393> This is a turning point that Prebisch should never expected.</seg>
<seg id=1394> The radical change in Iran</seg>
<seg id=1395> The choice of Iranians to bring to power the mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, radical risk of jeopardising relations with the West and intensify the country's isolation internationally.</seg>
<seg id=1396> Yet in terms of domestic policy, the Islamist regime will probably better if a more moderate candidate had prevailed.</seg>
<seg id=1397> It is clear that Ahmadinejad has a real basis of support.</seg>
<seg id=1398> The fact that he has presented as a populist, he has spoken of the poor, condemned the government and acted almost as an opposition candidate has no choice: it was the regime, and eventually receive an official aid including radical rivals.</seg>
<seg id=1399> The regime has shown great skill.</seg>
<seg id=1400> He has transformed the candidate somewhat more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani, disagree with certain government policies, in person in harmony with the established order, and his own rebel candidate.</seg>
<seg id=1401> The government has used the resentment against the attempts to consolidate its own power.</seg>
<seg id=1402> Since the former President Khatami, Mohammad, supported the reformist movement to me, I had little reckless and he has done nothing in it only to underline how leaders have returned to their advantage.</seg>
<seg id=1403> Ahmadinejad is a representative of the young activists of the anti-Shah revolution of 25 years ago.</seg>
<seg id=1404> It is directly involved in the American hostage in Iran, although we do not really know how to.</seg>
<seg id=1405> The most worrying is that it is close to the two main groups who represent the most extreme elements of Iran: the Corps of the Islamic revolution and the organisation Basij.</seg>
<seg id=1406> The first is an army parall to the pro-régime; the second is an organisation that as well as intimidating opponents and whoever is in search of a more open society.</seg>
<seg id=1407> But this concern to see Iran in the hands of radicals leaders still is mixed by two factors.</seg>
<seg id=1408> First, Ahmadinejad will probably focus on national, and I probl try - no one can predict its chances of succ - to improve the living conditions of the poorest Iranians.</seg>
<seg id=1409> to mement Deuxi faction since the revolution will continue to pursue ideological policies and étrang to re.</seg>
<seg id=1410> The President has less powers than it seems, and it is particuli to rement overshadowed by the ayatollahs supr to guide me Ali Khamenei.</seg>
<seg id=1411> Nevertheless, the election of Ahmadinejad clarifies cr lying to the challenge that Iran represents for Western policy and the stability of the East.</seg>
<seg id=1412> First, it sends out the signal to the most extremist elements of Iran and customers terrorists of that country, the Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Palestinian and several small groups acting against Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Arab countries, they have the green light to launch their attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1413> They will without doubt that Iran will support them, although they do.</seg>
<seg id=1414> Superficially, Iran has often been relatively cautious, while playing to cover the role of global murder of terror.</seg>
<seg id=1415> Iranian officials who have been acting individually to commission and coordinate specific operations, now feel freer.</seg>
<seg id=1416> Moreover, Ahmadinejad openly advocates an intensive programme for obtaining nuclear weapons.</seg>
<seg id=1417> Most of the Iranian politicians, especially those that allows the government to act, supports this programme, but favours a more cautious approach to and discr thee.</seg>
<seg id=1418> Rafsanjani, for example, the establishment of better relations with the West before the breakthrough on the nuclear front.</seg>
<seg id=1419> If President Ahmadinejad is a nuclear Iran, it is more likely to use weapons in a risky.</seg>
<seg id=1420> This does not mean that he would use them, but rather it would serve for diplomatic blackmail, rising threats to the levels of crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1421> Since the Iranian leaders proclaim daily their desire to wipe Israel off the map and to combat the US (Ahmadinejad landed on an American flag to vote), the risk of confrontation has increased.</seg>
<seg id=1422> Finally, Ahmadinejad may be emboldened endanger the stability of Iraq, and his victory will encourage radical Iranian officials and Iraqi extremists.</seg>
<seg id=1423> Iran already sent many agents in Iraq and supports clients who seek to transform this country into clone.</seg>
<seg id=1424> The Iraqis, including the Shiite Muslims, who follow the US-led version of Islam to me that the Iranians, generally reject such interference.</seg>
<seg id=1425> A more militant Iranian position will increase friction with Iraq, and will inspire more anti-American violence.</seg>
<seg id=1426> In short, the election result, Iran is dangerous to me depends on whether its destabilising potential acts of Ahmadinejad and the degree of power that will give Khamenei.</seg>
<seg id=1427> Moreover, having business an Iran as openly extremist - I am according to radical crit to res a regime already hard – will be a challenge not only for the US, but also for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1428> The European countries will continue to pretend that the militant rhetoric and the provocation of Ahmadinejad are not and that it is possible to find diplomatic solutions to Iran's nuclear ambitions?</seg>
<seg id=1429> With Rafsanjani, a true agreement or at least the appearance of cooperation would have been easy to maintain.</seg>
<seg id=1430> But, with Ahmadinejad, an immense dose of conciliation to maintain even the most minimal diplomatic procedure.</seg>
<seg id=1431> Some reformists and Iranian exiles like the election of Ahmadinejad, because they believe that his administration is more likely to show the true face of the regime and open Western of any hope of compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1432> But it can also succ to symbolize the regime to return to its advantage discontent caused by a quarter of whether to cle of r to radical Islamist gne.</seg>
<seg id=1433> Whatever the consequences, the victory of Ahmadinejad means for the West that everything related to Iran will become even more difficult.</seg>
<seg id=1434> Take the poor, the rich</seg>
<seg id=1435> The President Bush seems poised to destroy the US budget for the coming years.</seg>
<seg id=1436> When President Bush took office, the forecasts anticipated budget surpluses as long as might be imagined.</seg>
<seg id=1437> Today, with a mixture of irresponsible tax cuts launched by the Republicans, an economic slowdown, the bubble of the stock market and a massive increase in military expenditure, the horizon is dominated by large fiscal deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1438> Worse still, because the Bush administration and the Congress on preparing to aggravate the fiscal mess.</seg>
<seg id=1439> The disasters they will probably weaken the US and will increase the instability of the international economy.</seg>
<seg id=1440> Normally, the American Républicain party advocated balanced budgets.</seg>
<seg id=1441> That changed with the Reagan Administration, when the conservative Republicans are montrèrent favourable to tax reductions, even if it is paid through large budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1442> The President Reagan told the American people he could enjoy both tax cuts, the strengthening of the army and the continuation of their favourite spending programmes.</seg>
<seg id=1443> The outcome was, unsurprisingly, a series of significant budgetary deficits and whose elimination took several years.</seg>
<seg id=1444> The President George Bush Senior as President Bill Clinton last raise taxes to bring order into chaos of the Reagan era.</seg>
<seg id=1445> These tax increases have probably contributed to the defeat of President Bush Senior by Bill Clinton in 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1446> However, Clinton bravely decided to complete the process to restore the fiscal balance, partly to protect the long-term funding of social security pension schemes.</seg>
<seg id=1447> When Clinton quitta the presidency in 2000, the budgetary situation was at best for decades.</seg>
<seg id=1448> Then came to President George Bush son, ready to play the Reagan with substantial tax reductions, a considerable increase in military spending and the continuation and even the development of popular spending programmes.</seg>
<seg id=1449> The outcome was predictable.</seg>
<seg id=1450> In January 2001, the cumulative budgetary forecasts for 2002 to 2011 anticipated a budget surplus of 5.6 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id=1451> Mi-2002 anticipated surpluses, these were evaporated.</seg>
<seg id=1452> In the light of these new economic conditions, and the shadow of the war against Iraq, we might expect that the Bush administration and the Republican Congress are cautious in the defence of tax cuts.</seg>
<seg id=1453> But, their main priority is to introduce more tax cuts which only the wealthy classes largely benefit.</seg>
<seg id=1454> At the same time, the government demands considerable increases in military spending.</seg>
<seg id=1455> With the approach of the presidential election of November 2004, we can be sure that no significant reduction in expenditure in the budget non-military programmes.</seg>
<seg id=1456> It appears that the massive budget deficits are destined to continue.</seg>
<seg id=1457> If the domestic spending simply remain steady, at the level of a fraction of national income, the cumulative budgetary forecasts ten years anticipate a total deficit of 1.5 trillion dollars.</seg>
<seg id=1458> But this may be very optimistic, because it does not probably takes account of the cost of a war unlikely against Iraq, or another whole tax cuts, nor the risk of increasing interest rates for years to come.</seg>
<seg id=1459> Why is the Republicans montrent-ils so little affected by this muddle?</seg>
<seg id=1460> Some Republicans are more concerned tax cuts for the wealthy classes than anything else.</seg>
<seg id=1461> Others believe that deficits will lead to significant reductions force government expenditure, thus reducing the participation of the State, which is their most cherished hope.</seg>
<seg id=1462> The problem with this analysis is that most of the taxpayers are attached to social programmes and will not support easily large spending cuts.</seg>
<seg id=1463> The most intrigante remains of why the Americans vote for such policies when they should know that the likely outcome of problems.</seg>
<seg id=1464> One of the possible answers is that many voters do not see future budgetary problems.</seg>
<seg id=1465> A better answer is that most Americans did not actually voted for these policies.</seg>
<seg id=1466> The turnout of the election of 2002 was only 40% of voters, and only half of these 40% votèrent for the Republicans, approximately 20% of people entitled to vote.</seg>
<seg id=1467> Of course, the prospects must not necessarily be so bleak.</seg>
<seg id=1468> The war against Iraq may be avoided.</seg>
<seg id=1469> The pressenties tax cuts could be moderate or abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=1470> But I predict large budget deficits for the coming years and a growing sense of unease within the United States and abroad on America's macroeconomic situation.</seg>
<seg id=1471> Foreign investors could decide to reduce their funding and government budget deficit year favourably to America.</seg>
<seg id=1472> The dollar may diminish, and fear of inflation could become even more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id=1473> All this will lose confidence in US policy-makers who will be less flexible in their responses to economic shocks.</seg>
<seg id=1474> The disadvantaged classes, the US and abroad, could suffer most, since President Bush and Congress declare the American people and the world that there is no money available to address the issue of poverty, health and education, because of the large budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1475> If the American way does not pave the eye on these risks, the wealthy classes tax could have another gift of several billion dollars while the country and the world to bear the harsh consequences for the coming years.</seg>
<seg id=1476> Leçons to withhold America's fiscal nonchalance</seg>
<seg id=1477> George W. Bush has done much more to destroy the US economic policy than any other Speaker of American history, exceeding even its godfather, Ronald Reagan.</seg>
<seg id=1478> In just three years in office, it has destroyed a fragile political consensus that requested ten years of effort and might require another decade to be rebuilt.</seg>
<seg id=1479> Thus, Bush has risked economic health and social stability in the long term of America.</seg>
<seg id=1480> Since the long-term budget challenges that run the US in a very clumsy are not the only existing challenges, America's fiscal blunders offer some important lessons for other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1481> The main problem with fiscal policy is that politicians can easily be popular temporarily by cutting taxes and increasing public spending while accumulation of public debts and leaving their massive reimbursement budding elected.</seg>
<seg id=1482> This stratagem could last several years, but the budget deficits and public debt are growing earlier than expected a painful change of policy.</seg>
<seg id=1483> A cynic might buy his re-election, and perhaps be left off when the crisis comes.</seg>
<seg id=1484> One could imagine that after decades of similar episodes of political irresponsibility in the countries of the world, the voters are allergic to these sorts of tricks.</seg>
<seg id=1485> However, Bush applies it again today are buying a popularity distributing massive tax reductions whilst simultaneously increasing military expenditure and expenditure on education and health.</seg>
<seg id=1486> The budget deficit obtained amounts to more than 5% of GNP.</seg>
<seg id=1487> Worse still, the long-term budgetary outlook of America are already worrying before Bush starts to implement its policies careless.</seg>
<seg id=1488> The US population is aging, so that the costs of pension systems and healthcare financed by public funds will increase dramatically.</seg>
<seg id=1489> There in-depth calculations show that incomes are made thanks to the fiscal policies advocated by Bush may not achieve the dozens of trillions representing the costs of state pensions, health care and other fiscal expenditure expected by the population.</seg>
<seg id=1490> At some point in the future, it will greatly increase the recovery of taxes, drastically reducing public spending, or both, to alleviate the actions of Bush.</seg>
<seg id=1491> So why people support its policies?</seg>
<seg id=1492> Because it contains little these long-term consequences, or loses little, even if these consequences will eventually have an impact on the majority of Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1493> The richest taxpayers are naturally pleased because they have benefited from the bulk of tax reductions.</seg>
<seg id=1494> So strangely enough, the 5% wealthy American taxpayers have benefited from around half cutting taxes and these rich taxpayers expect clear that the other 95% (SMEs and poor) bear the majority of future expenditure cuts and increases taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1495> Meanwhile, Bush has convinced many voters poor and working-class voters that they should also be satisfied with their fate without saying they will pay their small tax reductions by cuts much further-reaching of future government services if policies of his administration prevail over the long term.</seg>
<seg id=1496> If the Americans had a political memory, they would understand that they have already gravi this ‘ roller coaster fiscal ’ in the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=1497> Ronald Reagan also took office promising massive tax cuts and considerable increases in military spending.</seg>
<seg id=1498> This ended by a huge budgetary deficit in the mid-1980s.</seg>
<seg id=1499> The Reagan tax reductions made extremely popular and enabled it to be re-elected in 1984.</seg>
<seg id=1500> It has been a decade (from the second term of office of the Reagan and George Bush, Sr. Bill Clinton) to return to a budget surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1501> Of course, this outcome has need approval further increases in taxes, which has cost his re-election to George Bush, Sr. and culminated in the 1990s polarised policy.</seg>
<seg id=1502> History has a great opportunity to repeat itself.</seg>
<seg id=1503> Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush Administration believes that the current budget deficits will ultimately a drastic reduction of social expenditure of government.</seg>
<seg id=1504> They hope to dismantle programmes such as Social Security and Medicare.</seg>
<seg id=1505> But the US population strongly supports these social programmes.</seg>
<seg id=1506> Thus the strategy is to reduce taxes so necessarily entail further cuts in social programmes is doomed to failure and must inevitably lead to increasing taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1507> Other ideologists of the Bush Administration argue that tax cuts play a crucial role in the US recession.</seg>
<seg id=1508> This argument is also wrong.</seg>
<seg id=1509> The America's economy could recover without tax cuts, and perhaps even more firmly.</seg>
<seg id=1510> In any case, it is a monumental mistake that basing long-term fiscal policies on the short-term economic cycle.</seg>
<seg id=1511> Other countries have two main lessons to be drawn from this situation.</seg>
<seg id=1512> The first is that the US impending budget deficits will sooner or later the international power of America.</seg>
<seg id=1513> The Americans supported the war in Iraq because they had not to subsidise by higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1514> When the Americans will be forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be less inclined to support expensive military operations abroad.</seg>
<seg id=1515> Indeed, the US will be deeply divided internally when the population is struggling with the fiscal mess left by Bush.</seg>
<seg id=1516> The second lesson is that the countries must plan their budgets according to the growing tax costs incurred by an ageing population.</seg>
<seg id=1517> The long-term budgetary conditions are rarely taken into account by the taxpayers or the parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1518> Governments must be persuaded to submit long-term budgetary assessments in their annual budget proposals to reduce the trend towards a short-term political manipulation of the budget.</seg>
<seg id=1519> The US can play the role of a warning to other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1520> The White House should give other countries the same advice as magicians to give their television viewers: "Do not try to do likewise home '.</seg>
<seg id=1521> The politicization of securities markets</seg>
<seg id=1522> Many economic and financial analysts complain that the securities markets of developing countries are often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more economic policies.</seg>
<seg id=1523> By contrast, a primitive force economic regulates securities markets in advanced countries and predict their performance in effect amounts to predict the growth of trees.</seg>
<seg id=1524> The description of securities markets in emerging countries is not false, just biased, because the same description applies to securities markets in advanced nations.</seg>
<seg id=1525> Indeed, the best analysts know that predict the performance of the securities market of any country is basically to predict the extent to which the government wishes that investors of securities markets are involved in the current political environment.</seg>
<seg id=1526> Take the US securities market, by far the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1527> The government lets companies alone and returns on investment in the US securities market reflect the fundamental forces of a solid capitalist economy.</seg>
<seg id=1528> This partly explains why the US attract portfolio investors of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1529> But the returns that make American securities markets so attractive reflect a fragile political balance.</seg>
<seg id=1530> In particular, the tax rates affecting securities have changed over time with the change of political pressures.</seg>
<seg id=1531> During the Second World War, for example, the political support to large fortunes has fallen and the government has sharply increased taxes on dividends and capital gains, high incomes in general.</seg>
<seg id=1532> When the Second World War has helped considerably to redress the economy weakened by Great Dépression of the 1930s, President Roosevelt and Congress introduced a tax on profits to ensure that shareholders do not constitute a benefit too.</seg>
<seg id=1533> By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but that the securities market was low, the American voters have elected Ronald Reagan, a man felt by many as too right to be president.</seg>
<seg id=1534> He asked, and obtained tax reductions on capital gains, dividends and incomes.</seg>
<seg id=1535> The political interference in the securities market not only deal with taxes on capital gains, dividends and incomes.</seg>
<seg id=1536> The corporate taxes, indirect taxes, import duties and taxes on sales, which are all paid directly or indirectly by companies, may impact magnified on company profits and thus on the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1537> It is no coincidence that wherever securities markets develop, governments should ensure that these lowering taxes maximum corporate profits after tax.</seg>
<seg id=1538> Indeed, the policies of securities markets do not stop the taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1539> Instead, almost every government activity affects company profits and subsequently the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1540> After the crash of 1929 securities markets, the US Government has suspended a large part of the anti-trust activity which allows companies to acquire a monopoly which would increase their value.</seg>
<seg id=1541> This policy has delayed reducing the rate of unemployment, but has not been enough to control the political forces deployed to support the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1542> Similarly, one of the most important actions taken by President Reagan was to destroy a large part of the remaining power unions of America, fighting for their industrial titbit.</seg>
<seg id=1543> The victory by Reagan in the air traffic controllers' strike in 1981 was a major turning point for the US trade union movement, and also for the securities market that launched a spectacular increase in 1982.</seg>
<seg id=1544> The US Government was particularly hard to support the securities market since the culmination of the illusion share prices in 2000, and especially to reduce interest rates repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id=1545> Of course, this measure was publicly justified in terms of boosting the economy, and not in terms of support for the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1546> But it is highly revealing of the magnitude of the American market securities that one of the most important factors affecting the economy is the price of actions falling.</seg>
<seg id=1547> Indeed, the authorities has not limited to a monetary stimulus.</seg>
<seg id=1548> The national accounts products and US income show that the actual rate of tax on company profits (the percentage of profits actually paid in government in the form of tax) has risen peaked at 33,7% during the first quarter of 2000 (the securities market and the economy in general) and has fallen to 20,2% von during the fourth quarter of 2003, when the market was low.</seg>
<seg id=1549> Much of this decline reflects the tax relief measures passed by Congress and the perception, among businesses, that in the current political and economic environment, they can be more combatives to avoid paying tax.</seg>
<seg id=1550> Moreover, after the crash of the securities market, maximum taxes on dividends paid on securities is increased from 35% to 15%, making a profit new long-term investors and intensifying the combined effect of reinvestment dividends after tax.</seg>
<seg id=1551> Again, this tax reduction was justified to stimulate the economy which can, of course, apply to almost any measure to support the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1552> But it is the balance of political forces which determines the credibility of this kind of justification.</seg>
<seg id=1553> Arguably that the same variables, including the hostility to high tax and a weak trade union movement, have worked in the US over the past 200 years and they should continue to operate in the future, producing high returns on the securities markets and attracting the influx of foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id=1554> Those who believe that investments in the US market will follow the same trend securities growth for decades may well be right.</seg>
<seg id=1555> But we must be clear about what we predicted.</seg>
<seg id=1556> The forecasts are primarily not only the economy, but also on politics, even on cultural values, which shape the political and economic performance.</seg>
<seg id=1557> The global market for real estate</seg>
<seg id=1558> There is no more local investment that property investment. The house bought is rooted in a specific location, as a tree, and is rife or languishes in local economic conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1559> The world has on our TV screens, but the property market, composed of almost exclusively local amateur, rarely crosses local geographical borders.</seg>
<seg id=1560> Soon, however, this could change.</seg>
<seg id=1561> By Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a month (WEC), together with my firm MacroMarkets, and with Fiserv Standard & Poor', and it will arrange options on long-term contracts house prices in ten US cities.</seg>
<seg id=1562> Contracts will be based on real estate price index S & P / Case-Shiller, established according to which my colleague Karl Case speculative research and myself conducted, almost twenty years.</seg>
<seg id=1563> For a long time we démarchons for a real estate market but, until now, no one wanted to use these indicators to create such a market.</seg>
<seg id=1564> The markets eventually house prices will allow worldwide investors to invest in American property indirectly, through these markets.</seg>
<seg id=1565> A buyer Rio de Janeiro or Paris, Tokyo will be able to invest in their homes occupied by their owners in New York and Los Angeles, Las Vegas, among others.</seg>
<seg id=1566> One of the fundamental principles of the financial theory – diversification or risk-spreading – means that interest in these new contracts will be.</seg>
<seg id=1567> Companies and the people of New York, for example, are surexposés to local estate risk, by selling their homes to end, they should manage to reduce these risks.</seg>
<seg id=1568> Investors in Tokyo will bear a proportion of long-term risks by buying housing in New York, if the price is right.</seg>
<seg id=1569> The New-Yorkais will continue to live in their homes, while the investment risks spread throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id=1570> The experience of a real long-term uni-familiales experts on the market has not been retentée since 1991, when the London Future and options Exchange (called now Euronext.liffe) has missed the launch of such a market.</seg>
<seg id=1571> This experiment has never generated large volumes of transactions.</seg>
<seg id=1572> The stock market has launched a concept which has not convinced anyone.</seg>
<seg id=1573> The British markets bets diversified house prices, as some retail markets, have never far reported either.</seg>
<seg id=1574> The different this time?</seg>
<seg id=1575> Of course, the launch of a new market remains uncertain. The people are interested in a tempting idea if it already many others; if nobody is seduced, it does not attract more.</seg>
<seg id=1576> The same applies to the markets. If there are no investors involved, will not be enough to generate profits transactions to attract others.</seg>
<seg id=1577> However, as with all ideas, we never know very well why they séduisent. So, we cannot contemplate the launch of this new market, but we know that sometimes the success is present.</seg>
<seg id=1578> The original indicators suggest that the growing interest in long-term transactions on real estate prices, particularly as the ambient discourse on building "bubble ', highlights the importance of risk diversification.</seg>
<seg id=1579> After announcing the WEC, one of its competitors, the Chicago options Exchange Board, declared its project of creating options on long-term contracts in the largest American regions, based on real estate prices means published by the National Association of Realtors (National Association of estate agents).</seg>
<seg id=1580> In addition to strong public interest to property investment and the coverage of risks, another thorny issue must be settled for the markets to end work well: prices must be openly exposed and investors must understand the meaning.</seg>
<seg id=1581> I believe that ‘ there are many opportunities for these markets soon lead to stop falling prices in certain American cities.</seg>
<seg id=1582> It will be subject to say ‘ déport ’ traders. Nowadays, the price to run on the market is lower than the price of immovable property.</seg>
<seg id=1583> Presumably, the déport does not appear from day property transactions, but it should happen after a few months.</seg>
<seg id=1584> We may need déport if some of these markets fulfill their duties.</seg>
<seg id=1585> Everyone knows that these cities have undergone enormous real-estate boom in recent years (this is a global phenomenon widespread).</seg>
<seg id=1586> The international investors do not seem very inclined to invest in these cities, without the prospect of a market-based price reduction in Tokyo. They have already been killed.</seg>
<seg id=1587> But if the déport is important enough, even investors who believe that the US housing market is declining can always expect a good return to term estate prices, because they already benefit from lower market prices.</seg>
<seg id=1588> Nevertheless, the New-Yorkais will require adjustments can be made to cover their own property investments, if they want to sell long-term contracts, resulting in lower prices.</seg>
<seg id=1589> They must be at the idea that the market has already anticipated this decline and cannot protect the tiny potential margin which exceeds this advance.</seg>
<seg id=1590> In fact, such adjustments in our thinking undoubtedly occur if we look at carefully the future of the market price.</seg>
<seg id=1591> Until now, the evolution of real estate prices has essentially been the result of various opinions.</seg>
<seg id=1592> When the market to create an international consensus about housing prices in all the major cities of the world, it will be easier to manage the risks they face in stabilising their economies, and our own living standards.</seg>
<seg id=1593> But what is wagging the markets?</seg>
<seg id=1594> Since 10 May around, most of the world markets have accused of strong cumulative déclins, particularly in the two weeks around 23 May, with an average residual prices downwards.</seg>
<seg id=1595> Falling worries about the world stock markets are synonymous with concern for the world economy?</seg>
<seg id=1596> Consider the extremely low.</seg>
<seg id=1597> Among the main countries, the most impressive crash is that of India, where prices have fallen by 16,9% between 10 May and 22 May.</seg>
<seg id=1598> The collapse of the other side of the world has taken almost all proportions. The ups and downs have had a few days of gap with those of India: Argentina, prices have fallen from 16.1% of FF 14.7%, Brazil and Mexico to 13.8%.</seg>
<seg id=1599> The European markets have also suffered huge losses.</seg>
<seg id=1600> In suède, prices have plummeted to 15.2% between 9 May and 22 May; almost on the same period, they have fallen from 9.7% in Germany, 9.4% in France and the UK and 9.3% in Italy.</seg>
<seg id=1601> In Asia, prices have fallen by 11.5% in Korea, 9.3% in Hong Kong and 8% in Japan roughly the same period.</seg>
<seg id=1602> Many commentators try to link these events to the American situation.</seg>
<seg id=1603> Yet the US courts have indicted that a reduction of 5.2% between 9 and 24 May.</seg>
<seg id=1604> China does not seem to be behind this global decline since the prices have risen there during this period.</seg>
<seg id=1605> The standard explanations economists affect monetary policies.</seg>
<seg id=1606> In the wake of the great fear of deflation in 2003, the world's central banks have cut interest rates, causing speculative explosions on the property markets and the stock market.</seg>
<seg id=1607> Today, according to this view, the rising interest rates are beginning to end, which brings new déclins on the markets.</seg>
<seg id=1608> There is undoubtedly an important element of truth in this argument.</seg>
<seg id=1609> The US Federal Reserve has increased its interest rates on 10 and its chairman, Ben Bernanke, has indicated that other increases could occur in future.</seg>
<seg id=1610> On 17 May, a worsening of American data has been reported, which suggests of future monetary durcissements.</seg>
<seg id=1611> Economists like to think that the world is logical and manageable, which means that they understand what is happening.</seg>
<seg id=1612> But they often exaggerate the role of central banks.</seg>
<seg id=1613> Indeed, the increase in American rates merely take a series of rate hikes – the 16th non-stop.</seg>
<seg id=1614> No other major central bank has increased its rate after the beginning of a decline in stock markets in May until around 7-8 June, when many were put (the European Central Bank, India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).</seg>
<seg id=1615> Another factor: the price of oil, which has increased by 24% between 22 March and 2 May, beating all records.</seg>
<seg id=1616> That would undoubtedly be a major event capable of influencing the markets worldwide.</seg>
<seg id=1617> The oil price rises play the role of the culprit in almost all economic recessions since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id=1618> Yet the sky high oil prices fall short when stock prices have fallen, most in mid-May.</seg>
<seg id=1619> Bringing that these increases have caused the déclins of markets means a discrepancy of several weeks.</seg>
<seg id=1620> But the stock markets are not very logical, and a response to the oil price shock out might be possible.</seg>
<seg id=1621> As with all the way in any financial market, always attracts increased attention.</seg>
<seg id=1622> When oil prices rise quickly, people watch the information talk and discuss them of these increases, creating by themselves to these new.</seg>
<seg id=1623> The Middle East crisis is linked to oil prices, and it has been the dominant information in May.</seg>
<seg id=1624> Signs of doom and the strong language used by various political personalities have been amplified in the spirit of investors by increases in oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1625> On 8 May, the deputy prime minister Shimon Peres, Israel in response to hostile statements Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, told that "the Iranian President should remember that Iran could also be wiped off the map."</seg>
<seg id=1626> Similarly, around the beginning of the stock market decline in May, Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia, the country with the largest number of Muslims in the world, and newspapers reported on 13 May it had received a standing ovation from students of two best universities.</seg>
<seg id=1627> This may have been interpreted as proof that the strategy on the verge of Ahmadinejad's nuclear political dividends, fuelling the perception that the tense situation in the Middle East could lead to other oil price rises.</seg>
<seg id=1628> These newspaper articles may seem to be more remote from the stock markets that monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=1629> But the public reaction they engender, and recent increases in oil prices, for good measure would enter into the changing market psychology.</seg>
<seg id=1630> The attitudes will change over time, and events such as the remarks of Ahmedinejad and Peres can rush these changes.</seg>
<seg id=1631> So, although these events are difficult to quantify, perhaps should analysts pay too much attention to the words of Ahmadinejad as Bernanke when they try to understand the direction of the world stock markets.</seg>
<seg id=1632> Economists like perhaps did not focus on the public's mentality and on the way it interacts with the price fluctuations, the new dynamic and the speculative world.</seg>
<seg id=1633> This would mean that economic events are less predictable (and economists less omniscients) that they would like to imagine.</seg>
<seg id=1634> However, it would be logical intuitif to do so.</seg>
<seg id=1635> What is really in charge of investors?</seg>
<seg id=1636> Ahmadinejad is a charismatic man, not Bernanke.</seg>
<seg id=1637> Ahmadinejad are embarking on an adventure, not Bernanke.</seg>
<seg id=1638> And, perhaps most importantly, Ahmadinejad has an influence, not destabilizing Bernanke.</seg>
<seg id=1639> Whatever their cause, stock market collapses in mid-May indicate a global market psychology unstable.</seg>
<seg id=1640> It is hard to believe that they were linked to views about possible monetary policies, and not deeper and wider issues, such as energy and political tension, which are the foundations of the performance of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id=1641> Why pay more for fair trade?</seg>
<seg id=1642> Marks and Spencer, the chain of supermarkets and clothes owner of 400 shops in Britain, has now announced that it will convert its full range of cafes and thés encompassing 38 different products to the "Fair Trade mark the symbol of the marketing 'ethical' production.</seg>
<seg id=1643> The only sells chain already tea and coffee designated as such in these 200 coffee shops ‘ Café Revive ’.</seg>
<seg id=1644> It also encourages the purchase of shirts and other goods produced from Fair Trade cotton.</seg>
<seg id=1645> This took place during the ‘ Fair Trade Quinzaine ’. During these two weeks of promotion of labelled products presentation meetings were held with producers in developing countries to explain the British how this form of commerce has helped their communities.</seg>
<seg id=1646> The movement towards a more ethical consumption is also a step in the US. The consumers look increasingly towards organic food products, such as locally or free-range eggs.</seg>
<seg id=1647> In the UK, a study has shown that over 50% of respondents recognised the symbol of fair trade and understood that products designated as such complying more working conditions of third-world producers.</seg>
<seg id=1648> Currently there is no comparable study in the US, but the data reported and from my discussions with my own students suggests that the figure would be lower for the Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1649> The traders wishing to obtain certification Fair Trade producers must pay a price covering the costs of a sustainable production and a living wage.</seg>
<seg id=1650> For example, the minimum price for a pound of coffee plus USD 1.26, regardless of the fall of the level of the market.</seg>
<seg id=1651> If the market price exceeds that figure, the fair trading price will rise to remain more 5 hundred / book.</seg>
<seg id=1652> For the small producers, they must organise themselves into cooperatives or other types of groups for democratic participation.</seg>
<seg id=1653> The plantations and factories can claim to be Fair Trade label if they offer a decent wage their workers, if they comply with health standards, environmental and safety, if they allow the trade unions or other workers' associations, if they provide a decent accommodation workers who work away from home and if they use or forced labour or child labour.</seg>
<seg id=1654> Yet everyone does not support fair trade.</seg>
<seg id=1655> Brink Lindsey, Director of the research centre on the Cato Institute, trade policies pro-marché body, believes that the campaign for coffee labellisé Fair Trade "is a deadlock paved with good intentions'.</seg>
<seg id=1656> It is in justifying that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices is not unreasonable profit-taking to by the multinationals, but in the considerable increase in production of coffee in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with the new skills culture caféière working less and less cost.</seg>
<seg id=1657> In the prospect of Lindsey, if we want to help the coffee growers, we must encourage them to abandon coffee to look for more profitable crops, he rightly insist here on trade restrictions imposed by the rich countries and on subsidies which are obstacles should be abolished, or products of high added value, such as special cafes which can be paid more expensive.</seg>
<seg id=1658> What is odd arguments in Lindsey, however, is that the campaign for fair coffee seems to do exactly what it recommends, namely encourage coffee growers to produce special cafes may be paid more expensive.</seg>
<seg id=1659> Economists pro-marché companies which do not stand openly using the attractiveness of luxury to promote their products.</seg>
<seg id=1660> If people are prepared to spend plus USD 48 per pound of coffee Jamaican Blue Mountain, because it is coffee preferred to James Bond, economists do not, in this case, that the market is distorted.</seg>
<seg id=1661> So, why be so critical of consumers who want to pay plus USD 12 for a book of coffee they know that it was cultivated pesticide-free in trees ombrageux favourable to the survival of birds, by producers who can now be fed and educated decently their children?</seg>
<seg id=1662> Economists could respond to it that if we want to help people to feed and educate their children, it is possible to buy a book of coffee non-équitable plus USD 10 and tastes identical to pay the remaining plus USD 2 to a charity which distributes food and scolarise poor children.</seg>
<seg id=1663> This is indeed a possible strategy. But fair trade presents real benefits.</seg>
<seg id=1664> Producers know that they will make a coffee appreciated consumers not only for his taste, but also for the way it is grown.</seg>
<seg id=1665> If their coffee sold well, they are proud to have produced a product sought in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1666> From the point of view of farmers, receive a premium by selling a product labellisé Fair Trade is preferable to a charity that they receive anyway, workers or not, whatever the quality of their production.</seg>
<seg id=1667> Payer more for a product labellisé Fair Trade is not more ‘ anti-marché ’ that spending more to buy a brand product positions.</seg>
<seg id=1668> Moreover, it reflects better ethical priorities.</seg>
<seg id=1669> It is not only a subsidy granted by governments, its success depends on the market demand and not of lobbysme policy.</seg>
<seg id=1670> Fortunately, in Europe, this request is growing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id=1671> Let us hope that it will reach quickly such levels throughout the developed countries, where consumers can decide on their own how to spend their money.</seg>
<seg id=1672> The calves, pigs and American democracy</seg>
<seg id=1673> Among the flood of securities on the return of the Democratic majority in Congress after the election of November, the result of an important ballot was largely overlooked.</seg>
<seg id=1674> Although he has highlighted the shortcomings of the American political system, it has also enabled me to think again to the sympathy of ordinary American citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1675> In Arizona, people can, if they have produced a sufficient number of signatures, submit a draft law direct to popular vote.</seg>
<seg id=1676> This year, one of the universal suffrage was a law to ban that sows gestantes, or calves bred for meat, are sanglés or locked in a manner that prevents them from moving freely lie or to extend their members.</seg>
<seg id=1677> Those who do not know the intensive farming methods will be astonished perhaps the need for such legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1678> The traditional method, as it applied worldwide fifty years, and in some countries still allows animals to travel and stretch.</seg>
<seg id=1679> Today, almost 90% of reproductive sows – mothers pigs reared and slaughtered for meat, bacon and ham – spend most of their lives in which measure stalls around 60 centimetres by 2.2 metres.</seg>
<seg id=1680> They can neither turn nor extend their hands once lying, or move forward over a step.</seg>
<seg id=1681> They are also sometimes sanglées to limit their movements.</seg>
<seg id=1682> Similarly, calves crammed their lives in the individual Boxes where they cannot go to bed, or stretch.</seg>
<seg id=1683> Essentially, these methods are intended to save on costs. They facilitate the management of animals and employ fewer workers, and less qualified.</seg>
<seg id=1684> They also prohibit animals wasting energy déplaçdant or to stand by them.</seg>
<seg id=1685> A few years ago, following protests of animal welfare organisations, the EU Commission has requested a report to the Standing Veterinary Committee of the EU on intensive farming methods.</seg>
<seg id=1686> The conclusions of the report indicates that animals suffer cannot move slackness and about the whole days.</seg>
<seg id=1687> Of course, the common sense allows us to reach the same conclusions.</seg>
<seg id=1688> As a follow-up to the report, the EU has set the dates from which the confinement of animals will be banned.</seg>
<seg id=1689> For calves, 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id=1690> The individual sow stalls, already banned in the United Kingdom and Sweden, will be banned from 2013 throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1691> Measures to improve the welfare of laying hens in battery cages, high in treillis without enough room to spread their wings, are also applied progressively.</seg>
<seg id=1692> In the US, nothing of the sort is envisaged.</seg>
<seg id=1693> Previously, when my European friends were asking me why the United States were accused such a delay in the welfare of animals in Europe, I knew that reply.</seg>
<seg id=1694> If they are insisting, I had to confess that a possible explanation was that the Americans did not least animals that Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1695> Then, in 2002, the animal protection organisations parvinrent to submit a proposal to ban the popular vote of individual sow stalls in Florida.</seg>
<seg id=1696> To the surprise, the proposal was accepted by 55% of voters.</seg>
<seg id=1697> Last month in Arizona, despite a generously financed by the agri-food industry opposition, the prohibition of containment Boxes for calves and pigs has also been approved, by 62% of voters.</seg>
<seg id=1698> Neither the Florida, nor the Arizona are particularly progressive states – both voted for George W. Bush against John Kerry in 2004.</seg>
<seg id=1699> The results of these two referenda thus strongly suggest that if all Americans were to decide on maintaining sows gestantes and calves in confinement, a large majority opposed.</seg>
<seg id=1700> Ultimately, it seems that the Americans are just as Europeans living conditions of animals.</seg>
<seg id=1701> To explain the difference between the welfare of animals in Europe and the United States, we must certainly compare political systems.</seg>
<seg id=1702> In Europe, the concerns of voters regarding the living conditions of animals were reflected among the members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, with the adoption of national legislation and EU directives to improve their fate.</seg>
<seg id=1703> In the US, however, these concerns have not had any visible effect on the members of Congress.</seg>
<seg id=1704> There is no federal legislation on the welfare of animals and virtually no legislation in member.</seg>
<seg id=1705> Àb my opinion, the tens of millions of dollars of the agri-food industry enjoyed by representatives seeking to be re-elected is for something.</seg>
<seg id=1706> The movement of protection of animals, despite strong popular support, is not in the arena of political lobbying and electoral donations.</seg>
<seg id=1707> In the US electoral shopping, more money than the views of voters.</seg>
<seg id=1708> The party discipline is weak and the delegates must bring themselves the most money necessary for re-election – in this case, every two years for the members of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id=1709> In Europe, where the party discipline is respected and where the parties, and not the candidates, fund electoral campaigns, the money plays a smaller role.</seg>
<seg id=1710> In the US, a country proud of its democratic tradition, calves and pigs are far not the only losers.</seg>
<seg id=1711> Be nine on the entirely new army comprising Afghans?</seg>
<seg id=1712> The assassination of the Afghan Minister of the Aviation by a crowd (perhaps led by members of the own interim administration of Afghanistan) shows that Afghan society remains deeply showing cracks.</seg>
<seg id=1713> The early reforms on the Afghan army will only exacerbate these divisions.</seg>
<seg id=1714> The Defence Minister Hamid Karzai temporary administration of Kabul has already appointed the senior officers of this new army.</seg>
<seg id=1715> The Minister, General Mohammed Fahim, is a Tadjik Panjshir district in the north, which became three months ago the leader of the Northern Alliance forces that have caught Kabul after the American bombers their have cleared the way.</seg>
<seg id=1716> As a group, its allocation is a direct challenge to the goal of reunification of the country of Mr. Karzai.</seg>
<seg id=1717> Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic nation, the largest group in the Pashtounes, representing the two fifths of the total population.</seg>
<seg id=1718> The Hasara and Tajiks respectively constitute a fifth of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1719> Of the 38 idolised officers of General by Mr. Fahim, thirty-seven are being a trente-huitième Tajiks, the Uzbek.</seg>
<seg id=1720> If, on the 15 to 17 million Pashtounes of the country, some are recruited as soldiers, they serve under a command structure almost entirely composed of Tajiks.</seg>
<seg id=1721> The language of Pashtounes differs from tajik, as the Spanish and English, and millions of Pashtounes reaching the age of military service were in better than certain notions of tajik.</seg>
<seg id=1722> The geographical profile of the new military authority is also restricts its ethnic composition.</seg>
<seg id=1723> Thirty-five on military officers 38 from a small area north of Kabul comprising the province of Parwan (where is the airport at Baghram) and the Panjshir Valley, near the bastion of the Northern Alliance.</seg>
<seg id=1724> In other words, the potential leaders from 27 of the 29 Afghan provinces have been excluded from the new military elite of their country.</seg>
<seg id=1725> A group if restricted could perhaps overcome the impression that its members are a clique if they represented a broad cross-section of the dozen political parties of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1726> But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id=1727> Eighteen 38 senior officers have just one party, the Jamiat-e-Islami, the Islamic faction that has long been led by Mullah Burhanuddin Rabbani and former teacher of theology.</seg>
<seg id=1728> It was this party that gouverna Kabul briefly the mid-1990s, creating the carnage and chaos which led most Afghans to welcome the arrival of the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id=1729> The Communists virtually among the number of members of the Jamiat in the military hierarchy.</seg>
<seg id=1730> Sixteen 38 officers have long line on this party whose tricks in the late 1970s led to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89 which claimed 2.5 million Afghan lives.</seg>
<seg id=1731> Most Afghans believe today the Communists with the same degree of sympathy for the Czechs and Poles earmark the National Socialists of Hitler.</seg>
<seg id=1732> It is true that Afghans, as elsewhere, joined the Communist Party for various reasons and that they were not all of hard-baked ideologues.</seg>
<seg id=1733> But in the case of General Fahim generals, six were the Communist Party professional workers and continued to serve the Party after the invasion of the Red Army.</seg>
<seg id=1734> These six men, plus three Communists who have served as in the Afghan army officers who worked actively during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which lasted a decade.</seg>
<seg id=1735> Imagine how the French would have reacted if a quarter of the French officers of the après-deuxième World War had fallen from the Wehrmacht while it was in their country.</seg>
<seg id=1736> In Afghanistan, the new travel quickly by the mouths to ear.</seg>
<seg id=1737> The Afghan nationalists (i.e. almost all Afghans) discover soon political reasons members of the cosy circle of General Fahim, if this is not done.</seg>
<seg id=1738> Even the overwhelming evidence of partiality and prejudice in the training of senior command of the new army could be outvoted if the generals insert a professionalism and a commitment to the patriotic values of national really armed forces in their task.</seg>
<seg id=1739> Unfortunately, only 38 promoted by Fahim ten officers have received a professional training military officers.</seg>
<seg id=1740> A eleventh served as a pilot.</seg>
<seg id=1741> By contrast, 24 on the general 38 (the training of the four remaining generals remain unknown) are civilians, who had a profession, ahead of the Communist Party's offices or, in a case, which have been Mullah.</seg>
<seg id=1742> What all these statistics mean in terms of everyday reality?</seg>
<seg id=1743> It means that when the Heads of international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, and the American diplomatic and military officials, meet the Afghan sous-ministre Defence Rashid Dostum, they encounter Abdul, a warlord Communist a notoriously corrupt and brutal and who stays in contact with old friends who are still the Red Army in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id=1744> This means that the leader of the Afghan army and the head of operations and the army intelligence service are also Communists, men whose loyalty remains uncertain and which many Afghans are wary.</seg>
<seg id=1745> This team has an opportunity to unify Afghanistan torn by war?</seg>
<seg id=1746> The presence in Kabul a dubious team if she opportunities to instil confidence among three-quarters of the Afghan population who are excluded from the military high command?</seg>
<seg id=1747> Or is it likely rather list of "victor" approach for the government is obliged (to some extent in the future) to spark off another bloody reaction by those whose legitimate national interests were cynically promoted?</seg>
<seg id=1748> The UN and the European and American politicians should ponder these issues before agreeing to a relentless power by a small minority unpopular.</seg>
<seg id=1749> Célébration of the irrational</seg>
<seg id=1750> Hourra for new Nobel Prize winners economics: Daniel Kahneman and Princeton University in Vernon Smith of the University of George Mason Virginia.</seg>
<seg id=1751> As many Nobel prizes, these recognise the crucial work undertaken by Messrs Kahneman and Smith, but also schools of thought they have helped to develop.</seg>
<seg id=1752> Mr Kahneman, psychologist, showed that people behave systematically with less than the classic traditional do economists believe.</seg>
<seg id=1753> His work shows that individuals sometimes act differently from standard economic theoretical predictions, but also that they regularly, systematically, and in a manner which can be understood and interpreted through different assumptions which compete with those used by traditional economists.</seg>
<seg id=1754> For most of market players, and indeed ordinary observers, this does not make much difference.</seg>
<seg id=1755> The Wall Street traders who traffic with actions that they can be bad exploit the irrational that Messrs Kahneman and Smith have demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id=1756> Much of the issues which mena the ballooning of markets was based on the exploitation of the psychology of investors.</seg>
<seg id=1757> In fact, this irrationality is not new for economists either.</seg>
<seg id=1758> John Maynard Keynes once décrivit the stock market as not being based on the struggle of individuals rational to discover the underpinnings of markets, but rather as a beauty contest in which the winner is the best possible those that judges will say.</seg>
<seg id=1759> The Nobel Prize this year famous criticism of the market economy simplistic, like that of last year (I have received with two other colleagues).</seg>
<seg id=1760> The winners last year attach importance to the fact that the various market players have information different (and imperfect), and that this asymmetry of information has a marked impact on the functioning of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1761> In particular, the winners of last year sous-entendaient that markets are generally not effective; it remains the governments play an important role.</seg>
<seg id=1762> The invisible hand of Adam Smith, the idea that free trade leads to efficiency as guided by an invisible hand, is invisible in part because it does not exist.</seg>
<seg id=1763> This, too, is not news for those who work effectively with the capital markets (and are taking this asymmetry of information and going beyond).</seg>
<seg id=1764> For more than twenty years, economists have lavish on these so-called "forecasts' of rational models that assumed that all players have the same information (even imperfect) and are acting perfectly rational, markets are fully efficient, there is never any unemployment (except when it is caused by the unions greedy or minimum wages imposed by governments), and there is never any rationing of funding.</seg>
<seg id=1765> Such models are dominate, particularly in the postgraduate courses in the United States, despite the contrary evidence which demonstrate the triumph of ideology on science.</seg>
<seg id=1766> Unfortunately, students in higher education programmes are now decision-makers many countries and they try to introduce programmes based on these ideas, what is now termed market fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id=1767> Let me be clear here: the models of rational forecasts have contributed considerably to economic theory apologists; rigour imposed on economic thinking has served to highlight the weakness of many underlying suppositions.</seg>
<seg id=1768> Any good scientific thinking knows acknowledge its limitations, but the prophets of rational forecasts have generally shown little modesty.</seg>
<seg id=1769> Vernon Smith is one of the leaders of the experimental economy, the idea that we can test many economic proposals in a laboratory.</seg>
<seg id=1770> One of the reasons why the economy is a complex issue, which also explains the many disagreements among economists, that economists cannot conduct controlled experiments.</seg>
<seg id=1771> Nature imbalance real-life experience, but in most cases, so many things can change quickly if it is often difficult to resolve the causes of consequences.</seg>
<seg id=1772> In principle, in a laboratory, can be experiments monitored, and thus make inférences more reliable.</seg>
<seg id=1773> Critics of the experimental economy expressed concern that the subjects of the experimental contexts thinking is determined outside experience, and thus inférences experiences and are not as clear and physical in science.</seg>
<seg id=1774> Nevertheless, the economic experiences provide some knowledge of a significant number of issues, such as design improved auctions.</seg>
<seg id=1775> Above all, irrationality of market players, the main issue of the work of Mr Kahneman, has repeatedly checked in the context of laboratories.</seg>
<seg id=1776> One of the most interesting results from the experimental economy is altruism and egoism.</seg>
<seg id=1777> It seems (at least in the experimental situations) that the trial subjects are not as self-serving economists believe that, apart from a group: that economists itself.</seg>
<seg id=1778> Is it because the economy is a discipline which attracts individuals who are inherently selfish or because the economy makes shaping individuals so more selfish?</seg>
<seg id=1779> The answer, certainly, is surely a bit of both.</seg>
<seg id=1780> There is no doubt that the experimental research and the future work will resolve this issue of the relative importance of these two hypotheses.</seg>
<seg id=1781> The Nobel Prize shows how important it is to study individuals and economies as they are and not as we want to see them.</seg>
<seg id=1782> If we understand better real humanity that we can hope to devise policies which will also improve the functioning of our economies.</seg>
<seg id=1783> Bush and his energy policy of bad faith</seg>
<seg id=1784> An episode of more outlandish happened, this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, where experts of the oil industry have explained that the melting of the polar skullcap – much faster than all the forecasts announced ­ - is not only a problem, but also a chance in that huge new quantities of oil will now available.</seg>
<seg id=1785> Similarly, these specialists have recognized that the US refusal to sign the Law of the Sea, the International Convention which determines the access to sources of offshore oil and other sea mineral resources, represents a risk of international conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1786> But they also stressed the benefits: the oil industry, in his ceaseless quest for new reserves, does not need to beg the Congress to obtain the right to plunder Alaska.</seg>
<seg id=1787> The President George W. Bush has a strange ability not to understand the important messages.</seg>
<seg id=1788> For years, it is increasingly clear that its energy policy is amiss.</seg>
<seg id=1789> Some members of his party relate even to a former energy bill produced by the oil industry, as being very advantageous to all lobbyists.</seg>
<seg id=1790> As for the virtues of the market economy, the sole aim of Bush is to give huge subsidies to the oil industry, despite increasing deficits facing the country.</seg>
<seg id=1791> However, the market does not work properly when it comes to energy. The government should make sense totally opposed to that the Bush administration has proposed.</seg>
<seg id=1792> The fact that Americans are not paying the price of pollution, and especially of their huge production of greenhouse gases, resulting from their energy waste devaluation produces energy prices, and the excessive consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1793> The government should encourage energy saving. His intervention on prices, mainly through energy taxes, is an effective method.</seg>
<seg id=1794> But, instead of promoting energy saving, Bush persists in a policy of ‘ first drain America ’ of its own resources, making it in future even more dependent on external oil resources.</seg>
<seg id=1795> Whether a strong demand to oil prices and thus creates a godsend for many countries of the East, which are not the best friends of America.</seg>
<seg id=1796> Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it seems that Bush has finally taken the measure of the increasing energy-dependence of America. It became difficult for him not to realise the consequences of widespread rising oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1797> But, again, the gestures hesitant of his government will aggravate the problems in the immediate future.</seg>
<seg id=1798> Bush refuses even to act in favour of energy saving and ultimately spent very little money to support his continued request of technological salvation.</seg>
<seg id=1799> What, then, the recent statement by Bush on his commitment to reduce, in the 25 years, America's oil dependency on the Middle East by 75%?</seg>
<seg id=1800> As investors, the message is clear: all party boundaries no longer in the new Middle East reserves, which are the least expensive oil resources of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1801> But if there is no new investment in the Middle East reserves, the unbridled growth of energy consumption in the US, China and elsewhere means that demand exceeds the supply.</seg>
<seg id=1802> And if that Bush, the threat of sanctions against Iran could provoke an interruption of supplies of one of the largest producers of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1803> With a world oil production almost to maximum price and having almost doubled since the war in Iraq, this suggests that even higher prices and even greater profits for the oil industry, the only real winner of the Middle East Bush policy.</seg>
<seg id=1804> In any case, nobody should blame Bush for having acknowledged that there is a problem.</seg>
<seg id=1805> But, as always, its proposals are merely a little trick of his administration.</seg>
<seg id=1806> Apart from his refusal to admit global warming, to encourage energy saving or to allocate sufficient funds for further research, the great promise of Bush to reduce US dependence on Middle East oil does not mean much.</seg>
<seg id=1807> With only 20% of the American oil extracted in the Middle East, the aim of Bush could simply be achieved by increasing modestly supplies from other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1808> The Bush administration must realise that the benefits of world oil.</seg>
<seg id=1809> Even if America was completely independent of oil from the Middle East, the reduction of energy production in this region would have devastating effects on world prices and especially on the American economy.</seg>
<seg id=1810> As is often the case with the Bush administration, there is no clear explanation of the official policy.</seg>
<seg id=1811> Bush is playing with politics waving the feeling anti-arabe and anti-iranien of Americans?</seg>
<seg id=1812> Or is yet another example of incompetence and confusion?</seg>
<seg id=1813> Depending on what we saw in the last five years, the answer is certainly more than just a bit of bad faith and of mere foolishness.</seg>
<seg id=1814> The Roadmap to China</seg>
<seg id=1815> China is about to adopt its 11th five-year plan, setting the stage to extend what is probably the most remarkable economic transformation of history, while improving the welfare of almost a quarter of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id=1816> Never before the world had experienced a sustainable growth; never before were there been such a reduction in poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1817> The explanation of long-term success of China takes part in its unique association of pragmatism and vision of the future.</seg>
<seg id=1818> While much of the rest of the developing world, following the Washington Consensus, was launched in a quest to increase of GDP worthy of Don Quixote, China has again made clear that it wished increases sustainable and fairer real living standards.</seg>
<seg id=1819> China finds it entered a phase of economic growth imposing enormous environmental requirements which cannot continue.</seg>
<seg id=1820> Unless we change of course, living standards will be compromised.</seg>
<seg id=1821> That is why the new five-year plan really puts the emphasis on the environment.</seg>
<seg id=1822> Many of the most backward regions of China have grown so fast that the crierait wonders whether other parts of the country were even more rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id=1823> While this phenomenon has reduced poverty, inequality has increased, with growing disparities between urban and rural areas and between coastal and inland regions.</seg>
<seg id=1824> This year's report of the World Bank World Development Report explains why inequality, and not just poverty, should raise concerns and the 11th five-year plan of China frontalement tackles the problem.</seg>
<seg id=1825> The government mentions a more harmonious society for several years, and the plan described the ambitious programmes for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id=1826> China also recognises that this separating the least developed countries of the most developed countries is not only a disparity of resources but also of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1827> It has therefore established bold projects to reduce these disparities and create a basis for independent innovation.</seg>
<seg id=1828> China's role in the world and in the world economy has changed, and the plan also reflects this situation.</seg>
<seg id=1829> Its future growth must be based more on domestic demand than on exports, which implies an increase in consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1830> Indeed, China suffers from a rare problem: an excessive savings.</seg>
<seg id=1831> People are saving partly due to weaknesses in the social insurance programs of government: strengthening social security (pensions), public health and education simultaneously reducing social inequalities, increase the sense of wellbeing and encourage widespread consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1832> If it were (and until now China has almost always surpassing one 's own limitations even its own high expectations) these adjustments could impose enormous pressure on a global economic system already destabilized by the enormous fiscal imbalances and US trade.</seg>
<seg id=1833> If China is at least save – and if, as has announced its representatives, it pursues a diversified policy investment of its reserves, which will finance the trade deficit of over 2 billion US dollars a day?</seg>
<seg id=1834> This is a subject to address another day, but this day is not too distant.</seg>
<seg id=1835> With a clear vision of the future, the challenge will lie in the implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1836> China is a big country, which could not succeed as well without sweeping decentralisation.</seg>
<seg id=1837> But decentralisation raises its own problems.</seg>
<seg id=1838> The greenhouse gases, for example, are global problems.</seg>
<seg id=1839> While America proclaims that it lacks the resources to do anything about this, the most senior Chinese officials acted more responsibly.</seg>
<seg id=1840> In the space of a month after the adoption of the plan, new ecological taxes on cars, petrol and wood products have been imposed: China uses the market mechanisms to solve its environmental problems and those of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1841> But the pressure on local government leaders to create economic growth and jobs will be enormous.</seg>
<seg id=1842> They will be tempted to say that if America is not capable of producing way to protect our planet, how could they?</seg>
<seg id=1843> To translate this vision into action, the Chinese Government will need strong policies, particularly significant increases in taxes on the environment.</seg>
<seg id=1844> While China became a market economy, it could develop some problems which are the scourge of developed countries: special interests concealing self-interest under a mask of market ideology.</seg>
<seg id=1845> Some will mention the simple trickle-down effect where you make: do not for the poor, ultimately everyone will benefit from growth.</seg>
<seg id=1846> Others disagree competition policies and strict corporate governance laws: let the Darwinism make its wonders.</seg>
<seg id=1847> Arguments of growth will be made to counter strong social and environmental policies: for example, increase taxes on petrol kill our car industry.</seg>
<seg id=1848> Such policies do not only so-called pro-croissance fail to provide growth, they would threaten the entire vision of the future of China.</seg>
<seg id=1849> There is only one way to avoid this: the open discussion of economic policies to expose sophistry and provide the means to implement creative solutions to the many challenges that China faces today.</seg>
<seg id=1850> George W. Bush has shown as it is dangerous to abuse of secrecy and to restrict the decision-making to a close circle of sycophantes.</seg>
<seg id=1851> Most people outside China do not realise how its leaders, conversely, engaged in deliberations extended and extensive consultations (even with foreigners) when they have fought to solve the enormous problem they face.</seg>
<seg id=1852> The market economies are not auto-régulatrices.</seg>
<seg id=1853> They cannot simply be left autopilot, especially if we want to ensure that the benefits are widely shared.</seg>
<seg id=1854> But manage a market economy is not easy.</seg>
<seg id=1855> It is a balance which must constantly react to economic changes.</seg>
<seg id=1856> The 11th five-year plan of China provides a roadmap in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1857> The world opened their eyes, full of hope and fear, while the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to be processed.</seg>
<seg id=1858> The lessons on democracy de Tocqueville</seg>
<seg id=1859> Because of the war in Iraq, 200 years after the birth of Tocqueville, the world is discussing the nature of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1860> Tocqueville is rightly renowned for having rejected the reactionary nostalgia claiming that democracy was our destiny, warning us about the dangers it presents for freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1861> Should we share his concern?</seg>
<seg id=1862> Tocqueville did not regard democracy as a political system, but primarily as an intellectual system which shapes the customs and habits of society, and to a psychological and sociological dimension.</seg>
<seg id=1863> Tocqueville believed that the democratic regimes guide our thoughts, our hopes and our passions.</seg>
<seg id=1864> Similarly, there was the Renaissance man and XX ° century Latin homo sovieticus, "democratic rights" is a form of humans.</seg>
<seg id=1865> For Tocqueville, the systemic effects of democracy can bring the citizens to stop their faculty of reasoning.</seg>
<seg id=1866> They can only pretend to judge the events and values by themselves, whereas they simply reiterate the views of the majority réductrices.</seg>
<seg id=1867> What Tocqueville called the stranglehold of "social power" on the general is probably stronger in democratic systems - a view that the level of expectation populism and manipulation by the media in the modern world.</seg>
<seg id=1868> Tocqueville believed that in the long term, nothing can really object to this trend.</seg>
<seg id=1869> Neither local democracy, nor small groups within society nor the opposition, and civil rights cannot prevent the decline of critical thinking that democracy is cause.</seg>
<seg id=1870> The school is at best an enclave immune from the irresistible influence that society has in mind.</seg>
<seg id=1871> Similarly, Tocqueville believed that the pursuit of virtue in the way of Ancients or religious faith can sometimes raise the soul, but both are incompatible with the democratic ideal when they are imposed by the authorities in public life.</seg>
<seg id=1872> In this sense, the theoreticians néo-marxistes of school in Frankfurt and Hannah Arendt who feared above all the disappearance of reason in modern societies are the heirs of thought de Tocqueville.</seg>
<seg id=1873> We can also note that the French philosopher, Marcel Gauchet has called one of these recent books Democracy against itself.</seg>
<seg id=1874> For these authors, the democratic lifestyle tends to eliminate any original thinking and to prevent the emergence of a culture of good level, yielding to a mediocrity which leaves people vulnerable to the enemies of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1875> If history is full of criminal regimes supported by the masses intimidated and manipulated, the greatest risk of democratic countries is that their citizens sink into indifference and merely a short-term thinking, in search of their immediate interests.</seg>
<seg id=1876> The past - despite the rituals intended remembrance of historic events - is masked by the dependence on the moment and hype.</seg>
<seg id=1877> Even the ruling class, supposed well educated, is a victim of this grip.</seg>
<seg id=1878> The main problem mentality lies in its lack of democratic historical consciousness.</seg>
<seg id=1879> As stated in Tocqueville, the shortcomings of democracy pessimism were the only road - resigned realistic but unacceptable - which we?</seg>
<seg id=1880> I think not.</seg>
<seg id=1881> There are ways to combat what might be called the "democratic stupidity" that spread today.</seg>
<seg id=1882> The first of these resources is to develop an educational system which form of real criticism, especially through education largely neglected materials (nowadays) that are literature, history and philosophy.</seg>
<seg id=1883> If we want to educate people informed and able to think for themselves, which is essential to the functioning of democracy, our schools should stop chasing the latest forms underway and begin to develop analytical capabilities.</seg>
<seg id=1884> Because of their tendency to grow the superficial and distraction, the mass media are the main obstacle to such an education.</seg>
<seg id=1885> Today, many people spend more time during their lives in the papers that in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id=1886> The passivity show that the mass media is exactly the opposite of the active involvement of citizens, necessary to democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1887> But it is difficult to imagine that the mass media (except newspapers of quality) willingly accept the tools to become education which would develop critically of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1888> This focus on the mass media is not an elitist contempt for popular culture.</seg>
<seg id=1889> It is not just a question of popularity - Mozart was a popular and coins of Shakespeare attiraient poor and rich - but the mass culture of questioning and cause.</seg>
<seg id=1890> The result is a widespread apathy and public passivity.</seg>
<seg id=1891> For some time, a globalised media culture is increasingly also, unable to generate the slightest criticism or raise feelings.</seg>
<seg id=1892> Because of its disinterest in these matters is a culture which threatens democratic freedoms because it does not create a sense of duty towards society, of history or community.</seg>
<seg id=1893> Is it too late to defend themselves against a culture which émousse so people?</seg>
<seg id=1894> Tocqueville méprisait elites of its time because of their complacency about the dangers of mass democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1895> The short-sightedness of our leaders will promote the achievement of its worrying prophecy?</seg>
<seg id=1896> A Europe for all</seg>
<seg id=1897> The members of the European Union seem to doubt the future of the European Union, but Ukrainians watch the European Union with some hope and some admiration.</seg>
<seg id=1898> The basic aim of our foreign policy is to integrate the European progress, because Ukraine has discovered that national self-determination is not an end in itself but a mere beginning.</seg>
<seg id=1899> Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when a nation suffers ostracism, no nation is free.</seg>
<seg id=1900> We are Europeans, all interlinked by a link with which we cannot escape, linked by a single destiny.</seg>
<seg id=1901> All aspects of culture that we share, not to mention the century of suffering which we share, we confirm this.</seg>
<seg id=1902> Anything which affects a European directly affects us all indirectly.</seg>
<seg id=1903> We can never again afford to live with the narrow notions of two Europes, a Europe of haves and have-nots, a Europe of elected banned.</seg>
<seg id=1904> Anyone who live on the European continent today cannot, in fact, must be considered a foreigner in the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1905> The large Europa Pax today, just as the current pan-European prosperity, depends on it.</seg>
<seg id=1906> Some will say that Ukraine is not part of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1907> What they come to Kiev and meet its inhabitants, young and old, workers, the wives of farmers, lawyers and doctors and teachers who rose and remained standing in the cold and snow for weeks to defend their freedoms last winter.</seg>
<seg id=1908> Are they not join those who rallied around the General de Gaulle within the French Résistance?</seg>
<seg id=1909> Do they do not bodies with those who moururent the fight in defence of the Spanish Republic in the 1930s, those who libérèrent Budapest in 1956 and mirent end fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970s?</seg>
<seg id=1910> Are they not inspired the same spirit as Polish trade union Solidarnösc and peaceful masses which amorcèrent the Velvet Revolution in Prague in 1989?</seg>
<seg id=1911> This is the real soul of Europe and certainly cannot destroy it.</seg>
<seg id=1912> Anyone who consider that Ukraine is too slow to join the Union, I would say: they have just visited my country and also see mothers who stay in office to teach their children for the use of computers in their offices.</seg>
<seg id=1913> What they attend language courses of each village and town where our youth is preparing for Europe learning French, German and English.</seg>
<seg id=1914> Those who doubt the European vocation of Ukraine should understand that Europe is not just a question of equipment and motorways: the craving of freedom, prosperity and solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=1915> I believe that our future is also promising that Europe's past is proud, and that our aim is not that of a land border forgotten in a troubled region but an influential part of peace and unity of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1916> Self-determination is not synonymous with isolation because reach national independence nowadays simply means the return on the world stage with a new Statute.</seg>
<seg id=1917> The new nations with their former occupiers can build the kind of productive relationship that France has established with Germany: a relationship based on equality and mutual interests.</seg>
<seg id=1918> That is the type of relationship that my government wishes to establish with Russia, that is how we can help to expand the area of peace in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1919> It is premature, of course, to go beyond the indication of the utmost importance that we attach to the possibility of joining the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1920> We know that our role in this great building will not come about overnight.</seg>
<seg id=1921> We know that the major projects of European unification are not limited to documents and declarations but rooted in innovative action designed to improve living standards and provide security for all Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1922> Building a worthy of Ukraine joining the European Union will not be easy or rapid, or without effort.</seg>
<seg id=1923> But just as the European Union itself, and this will happen.</seg>
<seg id=1924> We know that the challenge is huge but this is worthwhile and Europe must understand that this is our objective.</seg>
<seg id=1925> The renovation of Ukraine is in part by an innovative battle to end a nightmarish century in which fascism and communism, ideologies born at the heart of Europe, have had to take power.</seg>
<seg id=1926> In the Ukrainian quoted a few months ago, parents and other children armed troops, dogs grondants and even death.</seg>
<seg id=1927> A few years ago, a young journalist, Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public about corruption of our former regime, was brutalized and beheaded by the henchmen of the regime.</seg>
<seg id=1928> Our Orange Revolution, last winter, has proved that Ukraine and its people can prevail.</seg>
<seg id=1929> Thus, despite the doubts and difficulties, I still have a complete confidence in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1930> I refuse to accept the final answer despair as the ambiguities and horrors of the history of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id=1931> I refuse to accept the idea that Ukraine is so tragically condemned to live at the heart of the night without stars of the communist legacy to see the day never power of peace and a genuine European unity.</seg>
<seg id=1932> When the European Union citizens think about the place of Ukraine in Europe they will look very closely and look beyond the knowledge that we will face them.</seg>
<seg id=1933> Seeing beyond the devastated areas that has inflicted communism, apart from poverty and social divisions through which our former leaders today répudiés sought to extend their control.</seg>
<seg id=1934> They must consider carefully the face of our president, Viktor Ioutchenko, ravaged by poison it was administered during the electoral campaign last year, and remember the words of that great French André Malraux, who was that ‘ the finest faces are those which are injured. '</seg>
<seg id=1935> The civil war Muslim</seg>
<seg id=1936> The gap between Sunnis and Shia in the Middle East is it far more profound that the conflict between Israel and Arabs?</seg>
<seg id=1937> One might think seeing the reaction of some Arab governments to Hezbollah attacking Israel.</seg>
<seg id=1938> While the Israeli bombs fall in Beirut and Tyr, Saudi Arabia, perhaps the most conservative Muslim Arab state of all, has openly condemned the Shiite Hizbollah acts which initiated the conflict against Israel.</seg>
<seg id=1939> Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, which regards itself as the leader of the Muslim Arab people had supported Israel so openly.</seg>
<seg id=1940> Moreover, the break-up of Saudi Arabia with Hezbollah is not unique.</seg>
<seg id=1941> The Egypt and Jordan have also categorically condemned Hezbollah and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, for their Sheikh adventurism.</seg>
<seg id=1942> What is behind this astonishing situation?</seg>
<seg id=1943> Are we experiencing a fundamental change in relations between the Arab nationalism and Islamic bigotry?</seg>
<seg id=1944> The Sunni government of Saudi Arabia ressent-il greater fear and anxiety in Shiite Islam it implies in the Arab unity and the Palestinian cause?</seg>
<seg id=1945> The kinds of Hezbollah by Arabs suggest that the Muslim sectarian divide, already evident in the daily violence in Iraq, and widens intensifies throughout the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1946> The will of President George W. Bush to destroy the societies frozen in the Arab world was condemned to draw up the forces of modernisation against the traditional elements Arab and Islamic societies.</seg>
<seg id=1947> It seems to have freed the most atavistic forces in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1948> The opening this Pandora's box could lead to an even more dreadful era of widespread violence, which cannot be described without doubt that "Muslim civil war."</seg>
<seg id=1949> The gap chiite-sunnite since the dawn of the history of Islam, but geographical isolation and ethnic non-arabe Shiite Iran and the domination of their minorities Sunni, Shia by Arab countries has generally left underlying this rivalry.</seg>
<seg id=1950> These tensions have fallen further at the vague "of Islamicisation" created by the Iranian revolution, because in its wake identity sectarian Sunni Arabs was more relegated to the background to measure that was a widespread 'Islamic' assertion.</seg>
<seg id=1951> All this Al Qaeda has changed when a Sunni terrorist group, which is largely based on ideology and Saudi personnel wahabbites, launched its attacks on America last September 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1952> A branch of Islam was Sunni specifically campaigner under way.</seg>
<seg id=1953> When the US has launched wars against the Taliban in Afghanistan and against the Sunni Iraqi Sunni regime, this new trend has become more adventurous Sunni radical yet.</seg>
<seg id=1954> The region's Sunni Arabs, who have now gained self-confidence, see Israel and the West as a single threat, another comprising the so-called "- the" arc of growing Shia lands which stretches from Lebanon to Iran via Syria and Iraq, populated by the supposed Shiite sinners.</seg>
<seg id=1955> The leaders of Saudi Arabia, as guardians of the sacred sites of the Muslim faith of Mecca and Médine, feel the most acute threat.</seg>
<seg id=1956> For the Sunnis, Shiites are not confined to dominate the oil-rich regions of Iran, Iraq and regions of the east of Saudi Arabia, they are also trying, by acts of Hezbollah, to usurp the role of "protective" the central dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cause.</seg>
<seg id=1957> This is because the Saudi royal family derives its legitimacy from a strict form of Islam questioning the Sunni and Shiite loyalty of its population that the kingdom differs Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id=1958> The irony of the thing is that America, protector of Saudi Arabia, has made the responsibility by toppling Saddam Hussein Shiite possible and with Shiite parties in power in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=1959> The Bush administration seems to appreciate what she has done; as the Shiite arc stands in the Arab Muslim world is, the US is trying to consolidate their protection of the Sunni arc, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia – west of the region.</seg>
<seg id=1960> Israel, previously implacable enemy of the Arab cause, now seems encastré in this defensive structure.</seg>
<seg id=1961> But such a defensive position is necessarily unstable, by the mere fact of panarabes sentiments.</seg>
<seg id=1962> Today, the Saudi citizens do not fly ordinary from Al Jazeera and other Arab TV satellite networks to monitor events in Gaza and in southern Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id=1963> They see Arab bloodshed (not only), and Shiite Hizbollah respond.</seg>
<seg id=1964> For them, Hezbollah has become a heroic model of resistance.</seg>
<seg id=1965> This situation plunges the Saudi state to widen the schism sunnite-chiite.</seg>
<seg id=1966> After the formal condemnation of Hezbollah by the kingdom, the Saudi state has asked its official Wahhabi clerics issuing fatwas condemning Hezbollah as heretical Shiite and déviant.</seg>
<seg id=1967> Such condemnations can only exacerbate divisions sectarian within Saudi Arabia and in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1968> Given the worsening of these confrontations, the Sunni regimes increasingly global world believe that they need their own Hezbollah to fight in their corner?</seg>
<seg id=1969> If they come to this conclusion, they will not need to look far away, because the fighters of this kind have already followed Al Qaeda - without being trained by.</seg>
<seg id=1970> Why Europe cannot ignore Georgia</seg>
<seg id=1971> The time when Europe can rely on America to make war, restore peace and democracy in its own court is over.</seg>
<seg id=1972> With the enlargement of the European Union, and as the recent gas crisis in Russia, the court now includes not only Ukraine but also Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1973> Indeed, as in Georgia, Ukraine, democracy is being tested and Europe cannot afford to ignore.</seg>
<seg id=1974> Georgia was the first country to operate its post-Soviet space "black revolution 'and as proof, with dignity and maturity, the choice of his people in favour of democracy and European values.</seg>
<seg id=1975> The flags of the European Union which, on public buildings since then show the Georgian natural attachment long-standing and its history, for the ancient Greeks, which was part of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1976> Prometheus, Médée amazones, and in neighbouring Armenia Noah's ark, are all signs that the Europe of our myths starts here.</seg>
<seg id=1977> For its history, culture, old traditions, but also more recently, when Georgia was full of other republics of the former USSR, by its independent criticism, even somewhat maverick, Georgia is probably still the place of this area where the democratic transplant can take at best.</seg>
<seg id=1978> It is therefore all the more worrying democratisation of the country threatened.</seg>
<seg id=1979> Everything seemed started well enough.</seg>
<seg id=1980> Thanks to launch without dissent from a policy of reforms, privatisation, fight against corruption, the search for new frameworks and thus unscathed of shady deals with the previous regime, the implementation of a foreign policy marked by a return to Europe in the Georgian game.</seg>
<seg id=1981> The totalitarian mindset has resurfaced among those leaders who proclaims themselves the representatives of the majority, have increasingly suitable powers.</seg>
<seg id=1982> This is a cast which Hydra in such a thousand is dying and rise from the ashes.</seg>
<seg id=1983> They and their methods of power "Rose Revolution that the November 2003 was once and for all bowdlerise have reintroduced into the heart of power, with their networks, with contacts including externally, their considerable financial burden, their skill scheming and manipulation of political and electoral systems.</seg>
<seg id=1984> This is a power which does not sufficiently respect the essence of democracy is not in the ballot box but in the separation and the balance of power.</seg>
<seg id=1985> Every day, the government is involved in the legislative, the vast majority of laws are written in the presidential Chancellery; the parliament wants to control the daily exercise of government policy, including, in my case, the nomination of ambassadors and their everyday operations.</seg>
<seg id=1986> Finally, and this is the worst, the judiciary does not always come out of the tutelage of the executive and accounts or even for the citizen or the investor guarantor and protector, without which there is no rule of law or economic freedom</seg>
<seg id=1987> This is a society which to be democratic in its head, is not yet in its feet. It is still reluctant to engage in politics leaving the scene to those who are too long.</seg>
<seg id=1988> Because this democracy is in danger of collapsing, but because it is still been deeply entrenched in the population, in civil society organisations, in a press which seeks but which does not loses his faculty criticism...</seg>
<seg id=1989> It is time for Europe to save democracy in order not to annihilate all these hopes.</seg>
<seg id=1990> The United States has already done what they have been, since independence, and they are alongside Georgian stability.</seg>
<seg id=1991> The stability was identified democracy under Edouard Shevardnadze, former Soviet Foreign Minister that the rosy Revolution was removed from President of Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1992> But the Americans have invested very generously in the survival of the Georgian elites and in their path to democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1993> The criticism initiatives Soros the buzzword seems utterly groundless: the Revolution of November was not created invented by the Americans, not withstanding propaganda Russian nationalists too accustomed to the intervention to think differently, but the substratum which has enabled democratic has certainly been stoked, encouraged and supported by subsidies Soros Foundation.</seg>
<seg id=1994> The direction that must be taken today for Georgia evacuates his body – this time définitivement- totalitarian evil, is a complex stage which calls for support, that other Europeans are better able to provide.</seg>
<seg id=1995> The models which must be proposed for the balance of powers, the institutions of the rule of law, the functioning of the judiciary or of local democracy must take Europe closer forms of the Georgian reality that the Anglo-Saxon model, American variant.</seg>
<seg id=1996> If Europe today rejected this task, it will be betraying its fundamental duty towards this country, small, flexible, Mediterranean, long historical tradition, where democracy has much more successful than in Ukraine, which is both vast and Soviet still in its spirit, not to mention Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1997> Not to help Georgia is to accept that the Democracy and stability are so long to come not only to Tbilisi, but also to Kiev, Minsk, to say nothing of Moscow.</seg>
<seg id=1998> This is especially take a very serious risk.</seg>
<seg id=1999> Moscow which, with ups and downs of endless prevarication, an internal was torn apart, began to resign itself to the idea of the inevitability democratic, at least at its borders, not without abandoning their dreams and their instruments of imperial dominance, could suddenly change its perception.</seg>
<seg id=2000> Such resignation dithering, this acceptance normality in its relations with its neighbours, who was in its infancy, can be washed away by a sudden erupting of the irrationality of the Russian power of this infamous ‘ Derjava ’ to resist the attraction of weakness, the feeling of empty, the temptation to again be not equal, but the fittest.</seg>
<seg id=2001> This explains the recent Russian gas crisis.</seg>
<seg id=2002> All of retreating democracy, slowing the democratic tide, will be taken by Moscow as a hope crazy reversibility where Russia is gradually accoutumait to stop believing it.</seg>
<seg id=2003> This is Europe's responsibility to convince Russia that it is up to its hope for a return to the past.</seg>
<seg id=2004> Europe has this responsibility for itself, to its future energy independence. It also has this responsibility to show that there is a strong European values – freedom, democracy, justice between peoples.</seg>
<seg id=2005> For that Europe needs instruments of its policy: a great private public foundation for Europe and democracy, a university for training managers tomorrow democracies which are surfacing again, a police, army of judges and magistrates who live near models of societies that we want to convert.</seg>
<seg id=2006> Europe has a great need of conviction.</seg>
<seg id=2007> If Europe does not convint itself that it is the fate of its neighbours, of democracy and the future of its values and their spread, which therefore going into it tomorrow?</seg>
