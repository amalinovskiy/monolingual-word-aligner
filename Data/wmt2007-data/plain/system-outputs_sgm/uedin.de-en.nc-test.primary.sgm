<seg id=1> After races house divided Europe</seg>
<seg id=2> A common feature of the extreme right in Europe is their racism and the fact that they use the immigration problem as a political lever.</seg>
<seg id=3> The Lega Nord in Italy, the Vlaams block in the Netherlands, Le Pen's supporters of the National Front in France, are examples of parties and movements that have formed the rejection of the common theme: immigration and call for a simplified policy to deal with them.</seg>
<seg id=4> While individuals like Jörg Haidar and Jean-Marie Le Pen and may soon (unfortunately not to be), the racial one will disappear from the European policy not soon.</seg>
<seg id=5> An aging population increase domestic and ever more open borders, the racist fragmentation in the European countries.</seg>
<seg id=6> The big parties of the left, right and centre, did the problem, in which they are put its head in the sand and hoped that all prospects will soon.</seg>
<seg id=7> But this is not, as the history of racism in America shows.</seg>
<seg id=8> The race relations were in the United States on decades - and still do - at the heart of the political debate, to the extent that segregation was as important as income, if not even more important - to redefine political zuneigungen and attitudes.</seg>
<seg id=9> The first step to deal with the racial one is to understand the cause and effects of racist hostilities, even if this means to unpleasant facts.</seg>
<seg id=10> That have done in the US, a large number of research in the economy, sociology, psychology and. But this research were trust each other, that people of different race much less.</seg>
<seg id=11> The White are less inclined to support spending, because they think they are more racially divided societies minorities have less efficient governments, corruption and nepotism, more crime and less public benefits per dollar tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id=12> This does not mean that the answer should be to remove the diversity and racial similar communities, but we must recognise the realities behind this question, in order to be able to draw up a sound public policy in relation to the race relations.</seg>
<seg id=13> Of course, there is no agreement Americans how this is to be done.</seg>
<seg id=14> Some affirmative action to prefer to minorities in the allocation of jobs, access to the colleges of higher education and public contracts.</seg>
<seg id=15> These measures will be as a kind of compensation for injustice done sooner. They should, more importantly, help shape rollenmuster Shell and perhaps unintended discrimination.</seg>
<seg id=16> Others reject such action and say that it not only needs a policy that respects races in connection with a free market values and families, in order to create jobs for minorities and to help the families of the color stay together.</seg>
<seg id=17> The latter is crucial for any policy, because one of the main causes of poverty in the United States is the dissemination of households (i.e. single parents mothers) among the color.</seg>
<seg id=18> Despite the right answer to the question of how to deal with the races, a prominent role in the US.</seg>
<seg id=19> Of course, minorities have made progress towards integration and better economic success.</seg>
<seg id=20> In the 1950's people were not even take place in the bus, two of the most important players are people of US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id=21> Nevertheless, we can be certain that right-wing politicians in America on the ,rassen-karte, "as a tactical resources.</seg>
<seg id=22> Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, the former assistant of the Reagan Nixon and, at the last presidential elections as an independent.</seg>
<seg id=23> He put recently published a book entitled: "the death of the West, as dying sections of the population and the invasion of immigrants our country and our civilisation."</seg>
<seg id=24> But for every book as this, there is a serious analysis of the ten other with racial one in America.</seg>
<seg id=25> Political analysis and debates on the race relations are terrible behind in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=26> In most cases, the question is closely in relation to European entrance quotas, and grenzregelungen the limit, and the related social problems and the opportunities arising from an increasingly racial joint Europe.</seg>
<seg id=27> Of course, immigration policy is needed to prevent the accumulation of illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id=28> But it is not everything. Controls on the border with Mexico are not everything that has to say the American policy of racial one in the country.</seg>
<seg id=29> Europe is rich and rapidly ageing; the Europeans are served more generous abgepolstert is not "dirty work," we say in agriculture or in the leather industry.</seg>
<seg id=30> The increased immigration is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=31> The Europeans are quickly, however, prepared to blame the United States every mistake in their policy on minorities and any signs of racism across the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id=32> When I read the European press is often in the rassenfragen überlegenheitskomplex with the United States: the Americans have problems with racism; we are, apart from a few insane neo-Nazis, skinheads and so on.</seg>
<seg id=33> In the last few weeks in Europe is that the rassenproblem from Paris to Amsterdam much deeper and, as in the United States - the sad fact that are inherently difficult race relations and not hinwegkommt a close and cooperative approach on rassenschranken easy.</seg>
<seg id=34> If Europe's great parties do not start to investigate and to understand the rassenspannungen in Europe and ,rasse ", one of its main priorities, individuals like Le Pen will have to fill the gaps with their message of hatred. Alesina Alberto is a Professor of economic havard; at the university Professor Francesco giavazzi, the economic Bocconi University in Milan on the part of the group of economic advisor to the President of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=35> The French exceptions combat.</seg>
<seg id=36> The attention in Europe today is right to enlargement and the Constitution, which is being drawn up between the Member States of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=37> But the result of some jousts galliens with the European Commission will determine the fate of the new and enlarged Europe scarcely less serious.</seg>
<seg id=38> France has unilaterally decided to ignore the Stability and wachstums-pakt by adopting a vorausgesagtes deficit, which is well above the limit of 3% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=39> The French to keep the rational strict their thinking to good, but if it is not a lack of transparency, Descartes appropriations, but is needed.</seg>
<seg id=40> France was one of the leading critics of Ireland, the Irish Government in the year 2000 reduced their budget surplus was, at the time of 4% of GDP, only 0.5%.</seg>
<seg id=41> Other countries have breached the Stability Pact, but France is the first country that did so with open hämischer contempt.</seg>
<seg id=42> But this should come as no surprise to anyone.</seg>
<seg id=43> France is simply to the EU its persistent habits to their own culture as something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id=44> For example, France) prevented by its veto on reform of the common agricultural policy (gea.</seg>
<seg id=45> Indeed, as children are the gea means a worthy and totally unverdientes gift to the rich European (particularly French farmers) at the expense of struggling farmers in developing countries and consumers in the EU.</seg>
<seg id=46> France again tried to resort to an old policy to private companies is unprofitable on the brink of their zusammenbruches with the taxpayers' money.</seg>
<seg id=47> The Commissioner for competition, Mario Monti, must not lose sight of this fight: it needs the support of those who believe in the market and the equal treatment of all.</seg>
<seg id=48> In this case, it is quite simple.</seg>
<seg id=49> The French Government has the company to entsetzten Alstom, which has developed a number of high-tech goods, including the TGV, but the French hochgeschwindigkeitszeug, recently went bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id=50> The French Government claims that it will never to save in your plan, a plan, Alstom regulation, with all the familiar dirigisme reasons: safeguarding jobs, the protection of investors, etc.</seg>
<seg id=51> Moreover, the French Government, because it is a high-tech-firma Alstom, research and entwicklungskarte and investment in R & D are good for growth.</seg>
<seg id=52> To save Alstom by the nationalisation of the company is clearly wrong.</seg>
<seg id=53> The company is in many different parts. Some bring profits, others are bankrupt: what we have to do is obvious to dismantle the company.</seg>
<seg id=54> The more profitable parts, such as the tgv-werk will be easy; no buyers works in order to gain, should be closed.</seg>
<seg id=55> The French taxpayer money will be better for the support of the workers dismissed as for subsidies to keep unprofitable companies.</seg>
<seg id=56> It is important that the European Commission does not allow in France, the competition policy, it seems, as with his special budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=57> The Commission must put an end to public aid to private companies in France, just as it has in any other Member State subsidies of this kind.</seg>
<seg id=58> The Commission has made some progress on this front, as you know, Germany, regierungsbürgschaften forced to lift public banks.</seg>
<seg id=59> In particular, Alstom and France in general should be no exceptions; they should have to adhere to the same standards.</seg>
<seg id=60> If the Commission fails to act, the EU will be more like the French government officials playground.</seg>
<seg id=61> France has already taken on a leading role in the EU foreign policy, and Foreign Minister dominique-de Villepin is more and more like the Foreign Minister in Europe as well.</seg>
<seg id=62> At the same time, France is essential provisions of the common economic policy and the award of public aid to private companies.</seg>
<seg id=63> The European Commission what is left to lose its credibility, and finally, as a secondary district in Paris?</seg>
<seg id=64> The defeat of the Alstom affair would have far-reaching consequences for Europe and not only for its competition policy.</seg>
<seg id=65> The oil war</seg>
<seg id=66> For decades, America has been under democratic and republikanisch presidencies held a number of clear objectives on energy, namely the weltölpreis as stable as possible; to reduce the consumption in the country, without pain as a way to reduce the dependence on foreign imports, wherever this is possible; and the oil divide in several countries of origin.</seg>
<seg id=67> Even if it seems to be the case under the Bush administration has been changed, none of these objectives.</seg>
<seg id=68> Many observers believe that Bush have embarked on a new course, because the invasion of Iraq seems to run counter to these objectives.</seg>
<seg id=69> A large increase in the oil in Iraq will increase the dependence of the United States of oil in relation to other sources of energy, as well as a result of the weltölpreise extra supply will likely.</seg>
<seg id=70> This would in exchange for an increase in the us-abhängigkeit, particularly on imported oil from the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=71> The irony here, however, is that the US will do in the vorkriegsprogramm of the UN, ,öl for food "(in the UN and not Saddam Hussein certain the level of Iraqi ölverkäufe abroad) to a greater control over the Iraqi oil sector, and they have the future in a democratic Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=72> If the Bush administration stable, secure and cheap imports have sought by many sides, it would simply lift the embargo against countries such as Libya, Iran, Iraq, Sudan and the oil from there can hereinschwabben.</seg>
<seg id=73> But the American interest in the Iraqi oil was not of its economic or energy policy.</seg>
<seg id=74> The Bush administration realized that the Iraqi oil is above all a crucial geopolitical levers.</seg>
<seg id=75> Who controls the Iraqi oil, dominated Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=76> Saddam's power was based on his control over the second largest oil reserves in the world.</seg>
<seg id=77> He understood the role played the oil for his power.</seg>
<seg id=78> With the possibility of invasion and defeat Saddam, was the oil fields – that we should light in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=79> A large part of the future and looting and destruction of Iraqi öleinrichtungen pipelines reflects the widespread recognition that the control of the oil is the rule on Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=80> In the us-invasionsplänen securing the oil fields were given a key priority.</seg>
<seg id=81> The aim was not to extend the aid and to reduce prices for the Americans, but Saddam and his power and to stabilise a new Iraqi Government.</seg>
<seg id=82> Iraq's future depends directly from the fate of the Iraqi oil production.</seg>
<seg id=83> But the vagaries of the ölgeschäftes, particularly in such circumstances, it is difficult to see, as the Bush administration within the next few years will be able to achieve their goals in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=84> The logic is simple.</seg>
<seg id=85> The US must use the revenues to facilitate the American taxpayers the burden of the financing of regime change in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=86> In the long term wiederaufbaupläne all depend on the ability of Iraq to export oil in large quantities.</seg>
<seg id=87> If Iraq must not be oil, President Bush cannot deliver on his promises to the Iraqi people, the US and the international community.</seg>
<seg id=88> Before the invasion of Iraq's oil production capacity to three million barrels per day.</seg>
<seg id=89> Iraq will be able to its production within the time-scale, leads to establish an Iraqi government, not to raise this level.</seg>
<seg id=90> Any increase in the Iraqi oil production is to develop the oil fields, which means considerable investment, a legitimate representative government, and political stability.</seg>
<seg id=91> Not even the Bush administration believes to meet these requirements.</seg>
<seg id=92> Indeed, political stability is the most important condition for the increase in the production capacity.</seg>
<seg id=93> Historical examples from Iran, from Kuwait, Russia, and even the Iraq show that it takes the recovering 'political stability around three years, significantly and increase the capacity of what has been achieved, higher levels.</seg>
<seg id=94> Iraq needs several years to write a new constitution, a legitimate and democratic government to negotiate the distribution of oil revenues to its various regions, to adopt new investitionsgesetze, and to make its economy to foreigners.</seg>
<seg id=95> We still need time to negotiate with the international oil companies and neighbouring countries, technical feasibility studies and rebuild its oil fields, and to explore.</seg>
<seg id=96> Thus, even a period of three years as optimistic, because it means that will put an end to the occupation in this period, the Iraqis have set up their own democratic government and a political stability.</seg>
<seg id=97> There is no need to mention that the situation can develop.</seg>
<seg id=98> The tensions can remain for years to come.</seg>
<seg id=99> No one should be surprised if the Iraqi oil suddenly even under a democratic government.</seg>
<seg id=100> Historical experience suggests that disputes and similar problems, which can prevent the oil production in democratic countries, a greater threat than in undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id=101> If Iraq does not increase its so quickly in the next few years, this will affect both the us-außen- and its energy policy.</seg>
<seg id=102> As the United States want to finance the reconstruction of Iraq in the long term?</seg>
<seg id=103> Who is going to have to pay a shaky Iraqi democracy alive?</seg>
<seg id=104> The US can maintain its occupation, if they cannot offer the Iraqi people food, health care and other basic services?</seg>
<seg id=105> These are difficult issues. Unbeantwortbar in principle, as long as they remain a stable, democratic regime in Iraq cannot identify and ensure the constant flow of oil exports.</seg>
<seg id=106> Murderers as guardian of human rights</seg>
<seg id=107> It would not be so profoundly sad, it should be: Libya was elected President of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=108> As caligula horse to be made, not least in the klebte hoofed.</seg>
<seg id=109> Of course, the process was perfect legal: the Presidency rotiert each year by a part of the next.</seg>
<seg id=110> This year has been to Africa, the chairman and appointed Libya.</seg>
<seg id=111> Only the United States and Canada voted against it.</seg>
<seg id=112> Their of shame for the European countries have abstained.</seg>
<seg id=113> It is significant for the state of the moral corruption of the UN that this decision was taken precisely at this difficult time for the organisation.</seg>
<seg id=114> President Bush has called on the UN to prove that it is serious about their implements, otherwise they will suffer the same fate as the League of Nations, humiliating faced in the 1930's Nazi Germany and the aggressive policy of Fascist Italy totally powerless.</seg>
<seg id=115> Libya to choose just now in the Presidency of the UN, which is responsible for human rights is a negative impact on the legitimacy and the moral authority of the whole organisation.</seg>
<seg id=116> Let us remember that Libya is a totalitarian tyranny, head of state, al-gaddafi often's links with unpredictable behavior extremist policy by supporting the dictators of the world.</seg>
<seg id=117> It is one of the most repressive regimes in the world in which there is not even the pretence of elections and where opposition is crushed immediately.</seg>
<seg id=118> Under his rule Libya terrorist organisations throughout the world - supported by the IRA to various Palestinian extremist groups.</seg>
<seg id=119> The UN sanctions for the role of the country of the am-passagiermaschine Lockerbie pan played on a decade ago, Scotland, are still not lifted.</seg>
<seg id=120> In the last ten years, the UN has been undermined as a symbol of the ideal of a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id=121> She was completely incapable of preventing the wars in the Balkans and in at least one case - Srebrenica, a Dutch peacekeeping force the worst massacre in Europe since 1945, did the Bosnian Serbs murdered 6 000 defenceless Muslims.</seg>
<seg id=122> A Dutch aufklärungsausschuss later admitted that the Dutch UN force was involved in this war crimes.</seg>
<seg id=123> Rwanda genocide, began the responsible for the peacekeeping operations, un-funktionär ordered the withdrawal of troops from the country and left the field to the bloodiest massacres racist since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id=124> The name of this is funktionärs Kofi Annan.</seg>
<seg id=125> The false, probably - attempt by the UN, in the Iraq crisis now give the impression that they speak with the voice of reason and the international legitimacy is only depressing and pathetic.</seg>
<seg id=126> But at a time when the un-waffeninspekteure seem in Iraq as the Salvation Army, the sending to dig a gangsterbande, the fact that Libya, the Presidency will pass on the Commission on Human Rights, go down in history as the mistake that marked the failure of the organisation, which was created with so much hope.</seg>
<seg id=127> Organisations are normally not - and it is surely too much raison d 'to ensure that the UN schleppt.</seg>
<seg id=128> But it is only a shadow of what it should be, and could be.</seg>
<seg id=129> The UN today is nothing more than a different word for hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id=130> On the March authoritarianism</seg>
<seg id=131> Last Thursday, I condemned the judges of the Indonesian zentralgericht in Jakarta to a year in prison.</seg>
<seg id=132> As the pace of weekly news magazine, I am, in accordance with the ruling, to have a wirtschaftsmagnaten tomy winata name, I would have made possible by its involvement in the event of a fire in the South-East Asian textile market in Jakarta and I am to have been found guilty by spreading lies riots.</seg>
<seg id=133> My case and other similar cases is already a reference to the end of a more democratic short-lived experiment in Indonesia?</seg>
<seg id=134> The "riots" supposedly fueled, I took place in March last year, two hundred rioters as the expenditure as winatas supporters, the office of attacks, to put it on fire, almost drangsalierten threatened the workforce and a reporters wounded.</seg>
<seg id=135> In an attempt to resolve the situation peacefully, I was persuaded to go to talk to the central to my horror in Jakarta police station. But under the control of the police station mob.</seg>
<seg id=136> I was wegsah and, while the police.</seg>
<seg id=137> Fortunately, many journalists and with tonbandgeräten cameras were.</seg>
<seg id=138> The publication of their photographs caused a public outcry again Parliament, the obligation to hold a public hearing.</seg>
<seg id=139> The chiefs of the country and the Jakarta have been invited, and the leaders of the mob, with massive public pressure, accused of criminal law.</seg>
<seg id=140> However, winata brought a police investigation, and the only acted as he claimed that his supporters would be without prior knowledge and its approval.</seg>
<seg id=141> He then cut back to the tables and even cases against Ahmad taufik, the author of the article, the editor teuku iskandar Ali, the redigierte him and against me.</seg>
<seg id=142> The years of trial was marked by a number of suspect developments, all winata beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id=143> First of all, have been presented in the case of the police and the public prosecutor, which were forged documents were so obvious that the police indicted two responsible.</seg>
<seg id=144> However, the Court was our request for verfahrensaufschub until the legal clarification of the Public Prosecutor and the police have case.</seg>
<seg id=145> The proceedings against the two policemen seems to be delayed.</seg>
<seg id=146> One of the police commander was promoted to the newly created (and the United States) anti-terror-einheit financed from Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id=147> The other is to be a fortbildungslehrgang for police officers have been sent.</seg>
<seg id=148> Then, in the six months of the procedure, the chairman of the richtergremiums three-member has been appointed to the chefin a stadtgerichtes, this is an hour from Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id=149> One of my lawyers said that it happened 35-jährigen him, in his career in court that we exchanging Presidency leading judges during a procedure.</seg>
<seg id=150> Indeed, the judge was, despite its transport in another case in the same House as chairman.</seg>
<seg id=151> In our procedure a judge took over the presidency, had previously taken in winatas zivilrechtsverfahren a verdict on pace.</seg>
<seg id=152> Finally, in its statement from winata presented a meineid when he denied to have given an interview pace.</seg>
<seg id=153> A bandaufzeichnung of telefoninterviews has taken place; the reporters, had the interview, and two editors from said as witnesses under oath; the official record of the telephone company has been brought before the courts as evidence of the call a experts and came to the conclusion that the voice in the tape myself was tomy winata.</seg>
<seg id=154> However, the judges of the motion at a pace, arrest and prosecute winatas because of meineid and urged us to report, and we did so.</seg>
<seg id=155> The judge also assigned to postpone our request, the Court's decision to resolve winatas meineidfall.</seg>
<seg id=156> In the face of a lack of such a process, and the prison sentence was little surprising.</seg>
<seg id=157> However, I am confident that we will prevail in the end, if speed appeal to higher courts.</seg>
<seg id=158> The Indonesian courts of the higher level are clean and the President of the Supreme Court is a staunch advocates of democracy and freedom of the press. The case pace could become a path-breaking victory for our democracy, as the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of the New York Times against Sullivan.</seg>
<seg id=159> The challenge for defamatorische charges. This decision was sure that American journalists can draw public people to account.</seg>
<seg id=160> No country in the world, we know better than in Indonesia that freedom of expression and freedom of the press reported indicators belong to the development of democracy, and that the criminalisation of journalists is an early signs of authoritarianism.</seg>
<seg id=161> In the 1950's to Indonesia was a liberal democracy. In 1956 then President Sukarno spoke with the support of the military drastic measures against the press.</seg>
<seg id=162> Critical voices have been raised, which was the consolidation of uncontrolled power. In July 1959 decree Sukarno was the "managed democracy".</seg>
<seg id=163> In the early years sukarnos fall in 1966, all standards produced a real democracy, including the freedom of the press again (except for the Communists.</seg>
<seg id=164> But in the early 1970's President Suharto began to act against the press and to ban, and many different media to imprison journalists.</seg>
<seg id=165> It was brought under control, as the press were quickly other political rights and the Indonesian democracy failed.</seg>
<seg id=166> Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia is the third largest democratic country in the world and the largest Muslim democracy in history.</seg>
<seg id=167> Two parliamentary elections and two direct presidential elections, including the recent runoff - were free, fair and peaceful and were proof that Islam and democracy exist side by side.</seg>
<seg id=168> The enemies of democracy, sleep.</seg>
<seg id=169> Radical Islamic groups have indiscriminate bombing and groups with strong authoritarian tendencies have managed to the heart of President Megawati circles.</seg>
<seg id=170> However, Mrs Megawati suffered a defeat in the presidential election.</seg>
<seg id=171> Will the newly elected President susilo journalists to continue?</seg>
<seg id=172> My condemnation and the procedures and condemnation of colleagues will mark the end of the hard-won third democracy in Indonesia?</seg>
<seg id=173> The answer lies in the support, the pro-democracy activists in Indonesia and abroad.</seg>
<seg id=174> The loss of Indonesia, a potential beacon of hope for all pro-democracy activists throughout the Muslim world - would be a terrible failure.</seg>
<seg id=175> The morality of the death penalty</seg>
<seg id=176> The us because of its refusal to abolish the death penalty, often criticised.</seg>
<seg id=177> Many argue that the abolition of the death penalty is a prerequisite for a civilized criminal justice system.</seg>
<seg id=178> Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker.</seg>
<seg id=179> The European governments are strictly -- against the death penalty -- in the European Union, it is prohibited altogether and some Europeans see the use of the death penalty in the United States than barbaric.</seg>
<seg id=180> Many European intellectuals argue that not only the death penalty in general, but has a deterrent effect on criminals.</seg>
<seg id=181> While Europe to deal with crime levels, which could assist in the last 50 years, America's far below those were for a long time, the majority of crime relatively "mild", there was in the last twenty years to a dramatic increase in crime rates.</seg>
<seg id=182> On the contrary, these figures are made in America, in part because of a broader use of penalties.</seg>
<seg id=183> The death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=184> I am for the execution of some as murderers of sentenced persons, because only -- -- and because I believe that other killers to be deterred.</seg>
<seg id=185> I would not be convinced, I would oppose the death penalty, because revenge and other possible motives should not be used as a basis for the policy of a state.</seg>
<seg id=186> Empirical research on the death penalty in the United States with a pioneering Isaac's study, which was published in the American economic 1975.</seg>
<seg id=187> In some subsequent studies of the deterrent effect has been described as much less than in others.</seg>
<seg id=188> The available data are, however, quite limited, so we should not draw its conclusions solely on the basis of econometric evidence.</seg>
<seg id=189> Of course, it is possible to political decisions on any form of punishment is not wait until this evidence.</seg>
<seg id=190> But these limited quantitative data reason to believe that the death penalty has a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id=191> Most people, especially murderers, fear the death, in particular, if it happens quickly and with some confidence in the Commission of a murder.</seg>
<seg id=192> Mr Hume said in his essay on that no one wegwarf suicide "was given a life worth the effort.</seg>
<seg id=193> Because our natural fear of the death penalty is so great... "schopenhauer similarly, put it as follows:" when it is that the horror of life outweigh the horror of death, will put an end to the human life.</seg>
<seg id=194> But the horror of death make considerable resistance... "</seg>
<seg id=195> The opponent of the death penalty, often claim that the State would have no moral right to take someone who lives, not even a hideous murderers.</seg>
<seg id=196> For anyone who believes in the deterrent effect of the death penalty, that is, however, a completely wrong conclusion.</seg>
<seg id=197> To understand why, we believe that for any executed (for example, rather than lebenslänglicher sentenced to prison) can be prevented murderers three murders, and it is a smaller number than in the discourse's or other work on the subject of deterrence.</seg>
<seg id=198> This means that for every three innocent victims should not executed murderers their lives.</seg>
<seg id=199> Indeed, the government would therefore indirectly many lives "," If you do not set up the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=200> The saving of three of innocent lives for each person executed person seems to be a very interesting value and even if two per execution save lives, which seems a good cost-benefit ratio.</seg>
<seg id=201> Admittedly, the argument for the death penalty with a smaller number of geretteten life is less powerful.</seg>
<seg id=202> But even if only one per execution lives could be saved, which still a proper value would be saved if it is much better than it was, as it is usually the case.</seg>
<seg id=203> Many people oppose a balance between the geretteten - and the quality of life.</seg>
<seg id=204> But I see no reason to such a comparison.</seg>
<seg id=205> One need only think of a berufsverbrecher, deprived of a people and kills. The victim of a respectable life and leaves a number of children and a spouse.</seg>
<seg id=206> We are, it would be possible to protect the life of an innocent victim of the execution of this kind of criminal.</seg>
<seg id=207> It is clear to me that it must have more weight to save the lives of the victim and to take a criminal life.</seg>
<seg id=208> Of course, not all cases are clear, but the comparison with regard to the quality of life must be part of any sensible social policy.</seg>
<seg id=209> It also helps to explain why the death penalty is not only in the case of murder, but in smaller crimes.</seg>
<seg id=210> If executions in exchange for is to be achieved, for example, a reduction in the diebstahlsfälle, is far more for a lesser form of punishment.</seg>
<seg id=211> Despite massive attacks as cruel murder, rape, in terms of schweregrades are quite naturally calls for the will of the death penalty, I am not in these cases.</seg>
<seg id=212> A convincing argument that apply the death penalty only in mordfällen is "marginal deterrence."</seg>
<seg id=213> Would be attacks on the death penalty, the perpetrators would have an incentive to kill their victims to be taken not (that is one of the main reasons why the severity of penalties should be linked to the seriousness of the crime in general).</seg>
<seg id=214> The problem is that threatened by the death penalty murderers go further to escape their arrest, which in turn would increase the todeszahlen.</seg>
<seg id=215> While the marginal deterrence an important factor is, I believe that the attempts of the murderer to escape his arrest, may at the expense of their own lives - an indirect evidence that criminals fear the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=216> Of course, the risk to execute, may I innocent.</seg>
<seg id=217> My approval of the death penalty will be weakened, when the number of innocent would indeed be executed as great as is often said.</seg>
<seg id=218> I believe, however, that the appeal in the US offer an exceptionally high level of protection, not so much against unjustified convictions, but against unjustified executions, so that, if anything, very few cases are of innocent people executed.</seg>
<seg id=219> With the development of the dna-identifikation this protection was expanded enormously.</seg>
<seg id=220> Once again, the debate on the death penalty) is essentially a debate about deterrence (losing their effect in the face of ill-defined appeal.</seg>
<seg id=221> I understand that some people are sceptical about the evidence, although I believe that they are wrong, both in this respect, and the common sense on this issue.</seg>
<seg id=222> The idea of a people, even a murderer, life is worrying, but sometimes very unpleasant measures are needed to prevent even worse behaviour, which cost the lives of innocent victims.</seg>
<seg id=223> The people against Putin</seg>
<seg id=224> I have been involved in the selection of Vladimir Putin's successor to Russia's first democratically elected President Boris Yeltsin.</seg>
<seg id=225> Now kgb- mafia-strukturen governance and Russia and the judicial system is supposed to manipulate, Yeltsin wanted to choose his successor, in order to avoid a future persecution.</seg>
<seg id=226> But we identified, Putin had the task of finding someone, in order to protect Yeltsin's reforms, and not for him and his family.</seg>
<seg id=227> Yeltsin was certainly not without fear and aimed at his personal survival, but the survival of the democratic idea, which he introduced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=228> However, this idea is now because of us elected successor at risk.</seg>
<seg id=229> I do not the responsibility for the support of President Putin.</seg>
<seg id=230> We were not close friends, but he and I worked together in critical situations, and I have no doubt of his sincerity.</seg>
<seg id=231> Putin is after his convictions.</seg>
<seg id=232> The problem is that his beliefs -- including his belief that Russia can flourish only if it is governed by a single machtquelle -- wrong.</seg>
<seg id=233> This is a great mistake of Russia in the political will.</seg>
<seg id=234> Of course, no one in this spitzenamt to make mistakes, even without fundamental, and this is particularly true in turbulent times.</seg>
<seg id=235> Yeltsin was no exception, but its mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=236> He resigned in 1999 on New Year ’ s Eve, he asked, for example, to ensure that he had started the war in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id=237> Putin, on the other hand, seems unable to recognize and acknowledge his mistakes and adheres to a policy, long after the failure of the world.</seg>
<seg id=238> Yeltsin's mistakes was a failure to adopt a moral priorities at the top of its agenda.</seg>
<seg id=239> Russia would regret Stalinism and the gulag-system.</seg>
<seg id=240> Without exception, the whole nation must feel remorse would have seen as the German since 1945 remorse.</seg>
<seg id=241> This failure is important, because Putin's unskilled believe in a central authority could lead to the state has been managed by the security services.</seg>
<seg id=242> In fact, the national regret the gulag-ära should have meant as a direct result of the ban on the Communist Party and the exclusion of the former colonel of political institutions.</seg>
<seg id=243> Although such political checks in the Postcommunist societies are complex, both because of the victim and widespread collaboration and the borders between were often vague, a good solution could be found -- as in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id=244> Nothing was done, Russia's security structures remained intact and could be a political comeback that they have been achieved.</seg>
<seg id=245> The political resurrection of the kgb-strukturen under Putin and their efforts to bring the different opinions have transformed Russia in a country of the defector.</seg>
<seg id=246> It is impossible to independent politicians and independent media to silence, without independent sources, which is why the Kremlin Putin has focused its attacks on the so-called "oligarchs".</seg>
<seg id=247> Mikhail Khodorkovsky's arrest and were orchestriert process, for this very reason.</seg>
<seg id=248> The security services, the Kremlin, hope to destroy by the removal of the sources of independent political life in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=249> Without independent intellectuals bases in a climate of fear spread.</seg>
<seg id=250> But fear is not only degrading, it also promotes a bad governance.</seg>
<seg id=251> Yeltsin understood intuitively that fear and a centralised decision-making from the top down are no way to run a modern country, so it was to reform the relationship between citizens and the state.</seg>
<seg id=252> Putin understands that is still not a centralized political system is just as incapable of understanding and correcting mistakes, such as in the Soviet era.</seg>
<seg id=253> Not much better educated than men Putin in Russia and more honesty deterioration in the same accompanying the collapse of the Soviet state that.</seg>
<seg id=254> The people are beginning to understand this.</seg>
<seg id=255> They recognise that Putin's desire to create a strong and effective modern state cannot be implemented because a modern state is not governed by the top but informed citizens, the force of their leaders, and correct its mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=256> Putin seems to have the failure of his government.</seg>
<seg id=257> This is one of the reasons why more recently, Russia has been so aggressively against its neighbour, Ukraine and Georgia, and is trying to keep its military presence in places like the breakaway region of Transnistria and Moldova.</seg>
<seg id=258> When it makes its influence in Russia's foreign distance, the Kremlin thinks that the Russians at home of his omnipotence.</seg>
<seg id=259> Given the narrow debates in Russia and the ability of the Kremlin to manipulate elections, a change of government is the only option for those who want to keep the democratic idea in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=260> There is no point to illusions.</seg>
<seg id=261> Those who opposed Putin, have to decide what they want, and say that they have, if the regime does not adhere to the Constitution, the right to force it by any means necessary.</seg>
<seg id=262> The issue of power in Russia today can no longer be decided solely at the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id=263> As in Ukraine, Lebanon and Kyrgizstan, it will be decided on in the streets.</seg>
<seg id=264> Please raise taxes and spending ()</seg>
<seg id=265> Excessive tax incentives to reduce and prevent growth.</seg>
<seg id=266> Too little taxation, however, cannot do the same.</seg>
<seg id=267> Governments, which have a feeble tax revenues, have no money to asking basic public goods.</seg>
<seg id=268> Worse still low in poor countries are less tax revenue due to low rates rather than steuereinhebungssysteme defective, also be unproductive companies.</seg>
<seg id=269> In India the importance of a well thought-out tax system.</seg>
<seg id=270> In Bangalore hi-tech-firmen cherished in grünanlagen world-class universities have built in hochgeschwindigkeitsdatennetze.</seg>
<seg id=271> Outside this universitätsgelände open sewers, not entsorgter waste and urgent reparaturbedürftige roads, however, make the picture.</seg>
<seg id=272> While technologiefirmen send in a moment terabytes data in remote continents, local public transport will move with almost medieval speed.</seg>
<seg id=273> For this reason, businesses in Bangalore their own bus routes, water have treaties with private providers and have their own generators, in order to protect itself against the losses in the public electricity network.</seg>
<seg id=274> The state cannot remove the chaos, because it is bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id=275> The Indian staatschulden exceed 70% of GDP, more than half of the tax revenues should be used to zinsentilgung.</seg>
<seg id=276> The debt is not excessive expenditure in the past.</seg>
<seg id=277> The public expenditure in India will be around 15% of GDP, compared to an average of 40% of GDP in the OECD countries used for public spending.</seg>
<seg id=278> The financial difficulties in India are drawn up in a flawed and badly managed tax system.</seg>
<seg id=279> Compared with international standards, and the fiscal provisions einkommenssteuersätze seem to individuals and companies.</seg>
<seg id=280> Nevertheless, the tax revenue of the Indian Government only income taxes 3.7% of GDP. This value is half of the revenue from South Korea and other Asian tigers.</seg>
<seg id=281> About a quarter of GDP in agriculture, but not even wealthy farmers pay taxes.</seg>
<seg id=282> Export-oriented businesses in the software industry and other sectors have exemptions for their profits, even though the staff in these firms pay resource-use very well.</seg>
<seg id=283> Despite the appropriate tax evasion is widespread.</seg>
<seg id=284> This fraud can take place, because the government in staff to invest in spying systems of steuerhinterziehern, which often have to reckon with a sentence and often enough with bribes its way out of trouble.</seg>
<seg id=285> The direct income tax evasion in the "and" gewinnsteuern reflects the chaos in the "" indirect taxes collected production and consumption.</seg>
<seg id=286> Over 60% of indirect taxes on excise duties in India's share of indirect taxes on gesamtsteuervolumen is, in turn, 60%.</seg>
<seg id=287> The basissteuersatz was established with 16% of the produktionswertes a company.</seg>
<seg id=288> In addition, there are still a number of advantages, exemptions and surcharges jointly fixed.</seg>
<seg id=289> As a vergünstigter rate of 8% in categories, such as food, baumwollgarn into matches, and computers.</seg>
<seg id=290> In addition to polyesterfasern products containing, collected in cars, air conditioning and mature) a special tax "(sed of 8%.</seg>
<seg id=291> The "additional tax" (aed, not to be confused with the SED) on goods "of particular importance."</seg>
<seg id=292> In addition, many complex exemptions from which gesamtjahreseinkünften companies with less than 10 million rupees and firms in difficult or backward regions.</seg>
<seg id=293> Overall, this immunities are prepared in 70 broad categories, in turn, are in) 259, 52 conditions and 7 lists, each of which, in turn, contains a number of points.</seg>
<seg id=294> A tax on the abuse.</seg>
<seg id=295> To a certain price officials to considerable discretion in the application of the conditions rangniedrige, be persuaded to interpret the rules.</seg>
<seg id=296> Goods subject to a high rate (polierter stone, for example) as goods with a lower rate (not sold) polierter stone, for example.</seg>
<seg id=297> The evasion of duties is more than those of profit and income taxes.</seg>
<seg id=298> Hinterzieht a company taxes and the rate in the industry compared to the profits from high tax, the competition is forced to fraud, if it is to survive.</seg>
<seg id=299> In the governments are increasing tax evasion "additional" or "" special taxes, and propose to even more tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id=300> Similarly, the suffering has direct taxes.</seg>
<seg id=301> The tax officials for a favourable classifications paid bribes, create the difference between the value of not polished and polished stone and the actual receipts secretive "dirty money ', which can be presented in any einkommenssteuererklärung.</seg>
<seg id=302> The indirect tax evasion is not only the State in the provision of public goods, but the fundamental is also the incentive to introduce more productive technologies which have a greater need for production style.</seg>
<seg id=303> But as indirect taxation can be evaded easier in the operation of many small production units are not as a large, to achieve economies of scale.</seg>
<seg id=304> In this context, it is worth noting that Indian companies in the software industry, where all companies are exempt from indirect taxes economies, effectively.</seg>
<seg id=305> India could follow the example of China, where the rationalisation of indirect taxes succeeded in 1994, the conditions for a large boom?</seg>
<seg id=306> In a strong democracy or coalition governments to such reforms are not in a position?</seg>
<seg id=307> Last year, the BJP's government has led to a drastic reduction of the budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id=308> A working party has been set up, which had to produce the necessary changes in taxation and expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=309> In July of this year, the working party proposed to raise taxes (and not reduced expenditure), by, among other things, most exemptions be removed from indirect taxes.</seg>
<seg id=310> The new government under the leadership of the Congress Party seems to welcome these proposals.</seg>
<seg id=311> If the Congress Party and the opposition to this end, they will set a far-reaching step for the sustainable economic development of the country and have dispelled the idea that democracies are not in a position to implement the measures that are needed to promote development.</seg>
<seg id=312> What is wrong with Turkey?</seg>
<seg id=313> On 16 December Orhan Pamuk, one of the most famous writer Turkey, before a court in Istanbul, the charge, "the insulting" national identity, after the open discussion of the Turkish genocide of Armenians in 1915 and 1.5 million following.</seg>
<seg id=314> Pamuk should expect to three years in prison.</seg>
<seg id=315> Turkey's efforts to punish those who confront the official line, with fine and imprison, convinced me that I was right when I rejected the accession negotiations on the country's membership in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=316> In December 1999, the European Council gave the status of Turkey's EU applicants, which meant that Turkey will join the Union, not set at a later date.</seg>
<seg id=317> The Council has asked the European Commission then until October 2004 to decide whether Turkey meets the political criteria for membership sufficient -- including democracy, the rule of law and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg id=318> This was one of the most recent decisions which took the Commission under Romano Prodi, of which I was a Member.</seg>
<seg id=319> Of its 29, 30 Members said that Turkey has fulfilled the criteria sufficiently, to continue.</seg>
<seg id=320> I was the only one who disagrees with.</seg>
<seg id=321> The report of the Commission on Turkey, which was drafted by the responsible for enlargement, Mr Verheugen, beeinflusste my decision.</seg>
<seg id=322> This report has been mentioned that in 2003, for example, 21.870 asylgesuche Turks were adopted in the EU through which 2127.</seg>
<seg id=323> In other words, the governments of the EU itself recognised 2003, that the Turkish government had 2000 on their own citizens.</seg>
<seg id=324> Meanwhile, the Commission published a progress report on Turkey, said that the reforms are under the more "Islamic government continued by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, albeit at a slower pace.</seg>
<seg id=325> But the report presented some serious concerns, human rights violations, including torture, continued; the influence of the military to which the freedom of speech has not been respected everywhere, non-Muslim religious and cultural minorities have been discriminated against, and violence against women, was not strong enough.</seg>
<seg id=326> It has not changed much since the accession talks have started in this October.</seg>
<seg id=327> In addition to the current persecution pamuks there are plenty of examples of unacceptable behaviour.</seg>
<seg id=328> In March 2005, the police force unterbrach a demonstration to mark the International Women's Day.</seg>
<seg id=329> In May to inform the 14 million Kurds in Turkey in their mother tongue was the greatest lehrergewerkschaft because they fought.</seg>
<seg id=330> Indeed, intolerance is to the top of the Turkish Government.</seg>
<seg id=331> The Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said recently come from a press conference in Copenhagen, when he erspähte a Kurdish journalists in the public and the Danes failed, hinauszuwerfen this.</seg>
<seg id=332> Such actions and attitudes justify my vote against in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id=333> But even if these problems will be solved, Turkey should not be included in the EU, because it is not a European country.</seg>
<seg id=334> Christianity, feudalism, Renaissance, education, democracy and industrialisation have made us who we are Europeans, but they have not made the Turks to what they are.</seg>
<seg id=335> That is why I am not convinced that the reforms in Turkey, at the insistence of the European Commission would continue following accession.</seg>
<seg id=336> I suspect that they would be withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id=337> Furthermore, the accession of Turkey would inevitably lead to Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova were joining, and perhaps Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.</seg>
<seg id=338> The first three of these countries are certainly European and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=339> It is the three Caucasian Republics of the former Yugoslavia, but includes, it would mean that an EU with approximately 35 Members.</seg>
<seg id=340> What would be the Union?</seg>
<seg id=341> The EU is not simply a freundschaftsclub.</seg>
<seg id=342> It is based on the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.</seg>
<seg id=343> The Commission, as guardian of the Union Treaties protect these four basic freedoms, which means that they must sometimes and force the Member States, if necessary, to change their legislation.</seg>
<seg id=344> The alcohol policy in Sweden, the law Volkswagen in Germany and the discrimination against foreign investment funds in France are fallbeispiele with which the Commission has made unpopular.</seg>
<seg id=345> But they were necessary.</seg>
<seg id=346> When I left the Commission, I was at the bottom of the pile of 1500 such infringement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id=347> In short, the EU membership means that a State must accept radical measures, in its internal affairs.</seg>
<seg id=348> It will be impossible to a different Members.</seg>
<seg id=349> The EU would victims of what the historian Paul Kennedy called "imperial overstretch."</seg>
<seg id=350> The EU would be excessive profits.</seg>
<seg id=351> That is why the former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing feared that Turkey's accession to the EU, and the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: "the accession of Turkey would be more than the EU could accommodate."</seg>
<seg id=352> But the most important reason against the accession of Turkey is a question of democracy, the majority of the population of the EU simply do not want it.</seg>
<seg id=353> Bolivia's crisis, Latin America's failure</seg>
<seg id=354> Bolivia is in no sense a typical Latin American country.</seg>
<seg id=355> Apart from Haiti, it is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, it is even greater instability and has a history of over 200 coups d 'état since independence.</seg>
<seg id=356> In a region with a strong indigenous past and present a disruptive and isolated Bolivia Guatemala is perhaps the only country in Latin America, the indigenous peoples in the majority of the population.</seg>
<seg id=357> His topographie and ethnic division produce autonomous and even abspaltungsbestrebungen forces that threaten national unity on more than in other countries.</seg>
<seg id=358> It is also, together with Paraguay, of course, the only nation on the subcontinent without access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id=359> So it would be extremely unwise, Bolivia's current crisis transfer to the rest of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=360> Generalisations are far too simple: in other countries, the institutions are much more poverty -- particularly extreme poverty -- has fallen, and the fight for natural resources is resolved.</seg>
<seg id=361> Even in countries such as Venezuela with large reserves of oil and traditionsbewussten a nationalist government, the current practice has to foreign investment in energy resources, eight years of the government of President Chavez Hugo survived.</seg>
<seg id=362> Although -- of Chiapas "araucania 'Amazonia is the following ayacucho exist in many countries -- indigenous movements in Latin America, they represent a real threat to national unity.</seg>
<seg id=363> Bolivia is therefore not a warning crisis, removing time-honoured ", the" dominotheorie seems afterwards both Lyndon Johnson Che Guevara and, in the case of Bolivia, valid or more or less sensible.</seg>
<seg id=364> Nevertheless, Bolivia's current crisis points to the "democratic deficit" haunts Latin America at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=365> In Ecuador and Bolivia, Haiti plunged into the elected leaders for various reasons.</seg>
<seg id=366> In Cuba, Mexico, and Nicaragua is flawed democracy either religious or not, and in Venezuela and Colombia is threatened by different reasons.</seg>
<seg id=367> None of these cases is exactly the other, they are in varying degrees, harmful or conciliatory.</seg>
<seg id=368> The question is, what can be done in this situation different from the expressions of views, which only a few years ago, the picture.</seg>
<seg id=369> At the last meeting of the Organization of American States in Florida lauderdale continue in the United States of a good idea of other and you have expressed in your support.</seg>
<seg id=370> History began a few years ago, when the former Foreign Minister caputo Dante Argentina and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) were asked to draw up a draft report on democracy in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=371> They concluded that an early warning system for democratic crises would help to act in the region before the things as in Bolivia, to get out of control.</seg>
<seg id=372> Caputo and the UN team in parts of the Chilean President Ricardo Lagos, and take the initiative to promote with some of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id=373> He was, but the initiative was not very far.</seg>
<seg id=374> Even in the 2004 UNDP report on democracy in Latin America, it was hardly mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=375> The United States and the new Secretary-General of the OAS Chilean, José Miguel insulza plan, the oas-treffen in Florida again rejected it, but because of the legitimate concerns of the Latin American countries would be directed against the idea of Venezuela, with the anachronistic fears of Latin Americans to break the sacrosanct principle of non-interference.</seg>
<seg id=376> Although the continent was unable to agree on the principle, the idea of an early warning system deserves attention.</seg>
<seg id=377> At present there is little probably what the US companies with regard to the situation in Bolivia, and the situation is, however, a certain number of risks for all.</seg>
<seg id=378> Evo Morales, opposition leaders and leader of the kokapflanzenanbauer, may also be bad if an honest, beratener, democratic leaders, but his supporters are completely free of authoritarian aspirations?</seg>
<seg id=379> Hugo Chavez may not be financed Morales and the other Bolivian critics of the regime, but are not Venezuela and Cuba actually trying to interfere in the affairs of the country in which Che Guevara died almost 40 years as guerrilla leader?</seg>
<seg id=380> Perhaps the Bolivian businessmen from Santa Cruz is not the threat of secession, but they will share the oil and gas reserves in their region of the indigenous population in the Highlands of São Paulo industrial than with Brazil?</seg>
<seg id=381> Before the events such extremes reached the OAS (not to intervene in the United States).</seg>
<seg id=382> The region is still dependent on this intervention -- in time, consistent and a proper democratic basis to intervene in a different from the traditional US intervention traditional indifference -- and Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=383> The decline of France?</seg>
<seg id=384> The French are sensitive, if not defensive as regards the image of France in the world.</seg>
<seg id=385> The French State is a lot of money for the promotion of the French language and culture, but the French are painfully aware that the global position of their country is not the same as before.</seg>
<seg id=386> So it is no surprise that the publication of a report by the European Commission has been over the last presidential elections in the that France is in economic terms of European countries like in a period of ten years from the third to the tenth, led to a conscience and controversy. Soon President Jacques Chirac was his rivals Lionel Jospin 'for the decline of France. "</seg>
<seg id=387> The OECD and Eurostat, the European Office for such data, this aspect of the debate held by their presentation that France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom put an end to all in the same per capita living standards for.</seg>
<seg id=388> But the public controversy.</seg>
<seg id=389> This year's demonstrations against pension reform, increasing disputes with the European Commission on the fiscal policy and bickering with America because of the war in Iraq, discussions about the "EU" French decline.</seg>
<seg id=390> It meistverkaufte sachbuch in France) is an argument of nicolas baverez, la tombe qui France (France in decline.</seg>
<seg id=391> Baverez 'book a host of quotations of de Gaulle and Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id=392> The author, France has achieved its past achievements in the 1970's, with the introduction of the schnellzuges TGV and the Airbus.</seg>
<seg id=393> It castigates both Mitterrand and Chirac for their "common talent to win elections and to make France for the losers."</seg>
<seg id=394> The success of the book is itself a reference to a kind of "malaise."</seg>
<seg id=395> But what kind of abuse?</seg>
<seg id=396> Baverez 'show of degeneration is not as convincing as he believes.</seg>
<seg id=397> It is, for example, the butcher them of jobs in the industry as a flagrant evidence of the decline of France.</seg>
<seg id=398> The deindustrialisation, however, is common to all developed countries.</seg>
<seg id=399> France is even better than most of its rivals in the rich countries, and it has maintained, unlike Germany, the United Kingdom or the United States, the same global market share in the industrial sector, at the beginning of the 1970's.</seg>
<seg id=400> The foreign investment, a better level of competitiveness, France is also very well.</seg>
<seg id=401> A recent report by the Council of economic analysis, the investment in France have increased in 2001 to EUR 60 billion, almost twice as much as in Germany.</seg>
<seg id=402> The prices of improved competitiveness (France) by 20% in the last three decades of increased productivity, triggered by the rapid lohnwachstum.</seg>
<seg id=403> At the heart of the long-term economic problems, however, France is the fear of the loss of industriearbeitsplätzen.</seg>
<seg id=404> In traditional sectors such as the car or space France is still a strong industrial power; in innovative markets in which smaller companies, however, there is the spread of new technologies.</seg>
<seg id=405> For example, France is only 30 billion dollars a year on the edge of R & D, compared with 51 billion dollars in Germany, 98 billion dollars in Japan and 265 billion dollars in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=406> In short, is simply baverez 'analysis in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id=407> During the last twenty years, France has undergone a number of crucial reforms: economic and financial liberalization, the abolition of prices and small, the end of restricting, European liberalisation, inflation and trade deficits, the introduction of the euro and the forced globalization of businesses reduced the country.</seg>
<seg id=408> The French malaise has nothing to do with all this.</seg>
<seg id=409> France's problem is that it fails to recognise the new world, it is already a part.</seg>
<seg id=410> The French staatskapitalismus is dead and France find it difficult to come to terms with its demise.</seg>
<seg id=411> France seems to be the only country in which a Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, feel obliged to apologise a day later on television for his statement that "the state is not omnipotent."</seg>
<seg id=412> There are many reasons for this French schizophrenia, one of the crucial, however, has to do with the political events of the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=413> In France, until there has been a clear distinction between left and right.</seg>
<seg id=414> Since then, both the governments Mitterrand and Chirac have reduced their ideological, in order to respond to the difficult process of adapting to Europe and globalization.</seg>
<seg id=415> A round "shock therapy" à la Margaret Thatcher twenty years may have created a new political awareness.</seg>
<seg id=416> But the implementation of reforms kleckerweise unanimously made it possible for the French people to live in a world and to think in a different.</seg>
<seg id=417> This is one of the key reasons for the devastating political revolution that has taken place over the last before the presidential election campaign, when the extreme right-wing Jean-Marie Le Pen's leader reached before the current Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, the second round of the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id=418> The rise of the extreme left, which has achieved during the election campaign for 10% of the vote, is proof of this political failure.</seg>
<seg id=419> France is a more political than a economic revolution, if it is to accept the reality, the reality is that the decline of France '"is a fear, the French people themselves.</seg>
<seg id=420> The value of European values</seg>
<seg id=421> The European governments have the talks on an EU Constitution, after this last December were terminated by a dispute about voting procedures.</seg>
<seg id=422> These differences are, of course, resolve by compromise, the most likely to be found.</seg>
<seg id=423> What it needs to be agreed, however, is a clear idea of what is to be achieved by the European Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=424> European integration is based on two fundamental principles: solidarity and subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=425> Both are on the interface between philosophy, politics, economics, sociology, right.</seg>
<seg id=426> For years, you will find the legal and institutional framework of the European Union - in the Treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (where they are referred to in the preamble and in the current draft Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=427> Both these principles are laid down in history and in the ideals of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=428> But what really mean solidarity and subsidiarity?</seg>
<seg id=429> If we look at the first solidarity, which can be interpreted in two ways: at least as a static solidarity, it is only the distribution of income and wealth and the broader concept of dynamic solidarity, in which the production of income and wealth.</seg>
<seg id=430> In the history of European integration, after the second world war in the first phase of the European Coal and Steel Community solidarity - the dynamic, both in the economic reconstruction and development () in the vertragswerken, especially in the Treaty of Rome.</seg>
<seg id=431> But that does not mean that the dynamic solidarity was not more: the European Monetary Union, for example, is an expression of this dynamic solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=432> Although some countries had no immediate benefits from the introduction of the euro, they agreed to, because they were convinced of the long-term positive effects of the single currency.</seg>
<seg id=433> In other words, dynamic in solidarity, it is strategies which aim to promote investment, innovation, economic growth and the creation of jobs.</seg>
<seg id=434> However, as the figures show of GDP growth in the EU, solidarity was the dynamic in the last ten years.</seg>
<seg id=435> In this context, particularly worrying is the backlog of Europe in the areas of research and development.</seg>
<seg id=436> In the year 2000 the implementation of the Lisbon strategy adopted by the European Union, from the European Union the most competitive economy in the world, however, is threatened by a growing static shift in the direction of solidarity, which is reflected in high costs for the welfare state and high taxes to its funding.</seg>
<seg id=437> The the solidarity they lie in the ageing of the population, as well as the slower growth leads to a structural imbalance in the budgets.</seg>
<seg id=438> One of the greatest challenges of the future of the EU will be lösungsmodellen to change the prevailing static solidarity, focusing on the old people, for a dynamic solidarity, is at the heart of the young people.</seg>
<seg id=439> Ultimately cannot afford the Union that the current consumption is still on the level of investment, which is necessary in order to guarantee the prosperity in the future.</seg>
<seg id=440> The principle of subsidiarity is the concept of solidarity so as to allow: the two interpretations of vertical and horizontal subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=441> The vertical subsidiarity describes the division of powers between the different levels of government and the supremacy: between the EU, the Member States, regions and local authorities.</seg>
<seg id=442> The best-known application of this principle of federalism.</seg>
<seg id=443> In the European Treaties this vertical subsidiarity is clearly established.</seg>
<seg id=444> But that is sufficient to cover the emerging institutional and constitutional framework of the Union?</seg>
<seg id=445> The horizontal subsidiarity describes the responsibility and freedom of the people and social and economic power.</seg>
<seg id=446> The relations between the state, society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=447> However, the society and the market on its own rights and hoheitsbereiche that cannot be provided by the state.</seg>
<seg id=448> The problem is therefore in securing the autonomy of each sector.</seg>
<seg id=449> An example of horizontal subsidiarity is the single European market created a new type of economic freedom and increased competition between companies, by the state mechanisms have been abolished for these companies.</seg>
<seg id=450> Horizontal subsidiarity means that the state in the company in the economy, which would violate individual freedom and responsibility to respect them to the greatest possible extent.</seg>
<seg id=451> Moreover, horizontal subsidiarity means that a "power" there has to provide support, where the individual freedom and responsibility is not enough, in order to achieve the objective of respect for human dignity.</seg>
<seg id=452> This support should be implemented in a way that promotes the natural resources of the individual, of society and of the market.</seg>
<seg id=453> However, this is only possible if the role of the horizontal subsidiarity is clear, which is not in the European Treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights or in the work of the European Convention.</seg>
<seg id=454> In short, solidarity means more redistribution growth (such as the current generation of its solidarity with future generations to subsidiarity means today) and the distribution of political power and not careful distinction between the state of civil society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=455> Today, both values will be defined in such a way that the State is the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id=456> The concentration of market-based growth will be interpreted as identification with the halb-fremden American values.</seg>
<seg id=457> But these values are deeply rooted in Europe and should also be brought to the surface.</seg>
<seg id=458> The EU should restore their economic dynamism, followed by a model of solidarity and subsidiarity, which favours the market and society and the socio-economic impact of the State.</seg>
<seg id=459> State institutions should be responsible for the provision of public goods (such as defence, justice and fiscal and monetary policy) society for social goods) (such as culture, education and help people in need and the market for goods (the economic benefits, growth and employment in connection).</seg>
<seg id=460> In the 21st century Europe must be to win back to the principles, the values of solidarity and subsidiarity back - if it is to achieve its historic objective of integration: freedom and prosperity are needed in order to overcome the differences and political divisions, which provoked the disasters in the 20th century.</seg>
<seg id=461> This is the spirit in which the European Constitution must be written.</seg>
<seg id=462> The politics of values</seg>
<seg id=463> The debate about the American elections has still not diminished.</seg>
<seg id=464> As President George W. Bush has managed to get more than three million votes Senator John Kerry and also to vote in two chambers of Congress a Republican majority?</seg>
<seg id=465> The answer, but there is little agreement on two issues in many statements.</seg>
<seg id=466> This is a personality.</seg>
<seg id=467> At a time of uncertainty and threats to the people have more confidence in the President, they knew as a candidate that seemed not yet proven.</seg>
<seg id=468> The second issue are values.</seg>
<seg id=469> The people voted for a package of values, and not for a specific policy.</seg>
<seg id=470> Indeed, some were reported) (will agree with Kerry's policy, however, yet Bush gave voice, because they felt with its general attitudes "."</seg>
<seg id=471> The United States are currently divided in the run-up to the elections.</seg>
<seg id=472> A barrel blue) (democratic countries in the East and West, North embraces a huge area (republican) in the middle and in the South.</seg>
<seg id=473> Moreover, the division is also reflected at local level.</seg>
<seg id=474> Wahlkreisschiebungen -- i.e. the move from wahlkreisgrenzen to encourage a certain political party -- are no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id=475> Indeed, people tend to learn in areas where other parts of their values, republikanisch or democratically.</seg>
<seg id=476> Exactly what these values?</seg>
<seg id=477> They are supposed to God gun gays, "and" -- to do with God, weapons and gay.</seg>
<seg id=478> Religion plays a role, including the literal truth of the Bible, when it comes to the genesis.</seg>
<seg id=479> The possession of a weapon is the crucial individualismustest, and the use of weapons in wars is nothing repugnant.</seg>
<seg id=480> Gay and other 'modern' practices rejected as excessive.</seg>
<seg id=481> As the political scientist Andrew hackers recently put it: "Bush's candidacy is so that it is the majority, it helps by approximately 60 million people to be satisfied with itself."</seg>
<seg id=482> It is an American phenomenon, or is there in places other similar trends?</seg>
<seg id=483> The answer is that the politics of values can produce American phenomenon currently as a majority, but this is not universal.</seg>
<seg id=484> Europe and other parts of the world are equally divided.</seg>
<seg id=485> Personality is important, and below the obvious political differences value choices that are not yet to hide.</seg>
<seg id=486> But traditional political differences, based on fundamental disagreement about values play an ever smaller role in the elections.</seg>
<seg id=487> For example, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, which is the next election is a great leader, at the map "and" personality speaks of politics, but it is above all a structure of values of the middle class.</seg>
<seg id=488> He speaks of arriving "modernisation" and "in the 21st century," it manages to send a positive, however strange mixture of change and stability.</seg>
<seg id=489> The Conservative opposition was no effective response.</seg>
<seg id=490> Even in matters such as tax cuts and stricter values in the asylum system not be brought into play as the republican party that has in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=491> A similar picture in Germany, where the obvious influence of the wertepolitik is even less.</seg>
<seg id=492> The debate in Germany is largely a political debate.</seg>
<seg id=493> If the opposition to the government talks or offering health care reform -- most recently, to combat unemployment, the competition, rather than have to values.</seg>
<seg id=494> But there are Great Britain and Germany in the fields of political debate in wertekonflikte as elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=495> The parties are fighting for those who can be used to "be satisfied with itself, but they do not recognise that may be, it is only partly a question of policy.</seg>
<seg id=496> It is unlikely that religion is in the European policy on an important factor. Opinion polls show that the religious observance of rules is one of the few large differences between Americans and Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=497> Another weapons also take place in the European awareness. Most Europeans see their absence as important.</seg>
<seg id=498> In Europe, there is also a clear by pacifist values.</seg>
<seg id=499> But the issue of political correctness ") (" gay also plays a role in Europe has been underestimated.</seg>
<seg id=500> Europe in particular, shares the Europeans, because the question "national" in all European States.</seg>
<seg id=501> This is a werteproblem that caused by fear.</seg>
<seg id=502> The people want to know where they are, and against the United States and Europe, or against Europe and to their own country.</seg>
<seg id=503> In any case, we left the field of policies, and even the politics and enter the dark empire of symbols and myths.</seg>
<seg id=504> This is in any case, the main danger awaiting the democratic countries, because the politics of values is a dangerous development.</seg>
<seg id=505> In democratic societies, the greatest achievement was precisely the banishment of fundamentalism from the policy, it is once again a fundamental divisions.</seg>
<seg id=506> An enlightened public debate must be a debate about policy is determined by a set of values.</seg>
<seg id=507> To insist that is a primary objective of the policy of freedom.</seg>
<seg id=508> The time is approaching the interest rates</seg>
<seg id=509> One swallow does not make a summer and a month normal arbeitsplatzwachstums and rising prices in the United States does not mean that the US bundesaufsicht would have lost out of fear of the economic situation and deflation.</seg>
<seg id=510> But the time will come to start to rise in interest rates in the world, because central bankers in preparing inflationstendenzen emerging.</seg>
<seg id=511> Whenever there will continue to be so far - whether in this autumn, in 2005 or 2006 or 2007, America and the world economy will be faced with financial vulnerabilities that reflect the success of monetary stimulationsmaßnahmen over the past three years on the control of produktionsrückgängen and the easing of unemployment.</seg>
<seg id=512> Short-term interest rates for loans are astonishing: only 2% in the euro zone, only 1% in the United States and zero in Japan.</seg>
<seg id=513> The expansionary monetary policy has been successful, but only the interest rates on historic lows driven by - and by investors were convinced that the credit for a long time at their current levels.</seg>
<seg id=514> The most important result of the monetary initiative was a inflation in asset prices: everything from profits, a dividend or rent pay will be much more attractive geldlich - and thus far more valuable - if interest rates are very low and probably remain very low.</seg>
<seg id=515> This explains the great differences between the current for real estate prices in the United States, securities in New York, London and Frankfurt and long-term bonds everywhere and what we normally should keep their fundamental values.</seg>
<seg id=516> So what will happen to increase interest rates when the central banks?</seg>
<seg id=517> In 1994, raising interest rates for short-term loans zinsanstiegen led to the long term - and falling prices for long-term bonds - who were at least the double standard prognosemodelle epidemic could at the time.</seg>
<seg id=518> Moreover, interest rates in the more peripheral economies of the world to the developing countries, much as interest rates in the major industrial nations.</seg>
<seg id=519> The first risk that we must, therefore, for the year 2005 and beyond idea - if interest rates will rise in the world - is likely to be another wave of financial crises in entwicklungsmärkten.</seg>
<seg id=520> For countries such as Mexico, Turkey, Argentina, Brazil, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, has shown the record of the 1990's, that zinsspannen to grow and capital flows can be reversed remarkable quickly, regardless of how good iwf-vertreter analyses of big banks and evaluate the policy of a country.</seg>
<seg id=521> The zinsspannen the schwellenmärkte are currently unusually low.</seg>
<seg id=522> International financial flows, apart from zuflüssen in the United States are not - at levels, which would bring with "irrational überschwänglichkeit", but this could happen before the start rising interest rates.</seg>
<seg id=523> These are alarming prospects, because if the 1990's, have shown that no one should overestimate the stability of international financial flows.</seg>
<seg id=524> The second risk stems from high asset prices within the large industrial nations.</seg>
<seg id=525> The prevailing attitude within the bundesaufsicht - I agree with the US, it is obvious that the information technology revolution is that the growth of the potential output is very high in the United States and the output gap is relatively high.</seg>
<seg id=526> We must conclude that interest rates remain over a considerable period might actually very low.</seg>
<seg id=527> Moreover, the confidence in the US bundesaufsicht of high and the last remnants of the risk of inflation in the 1970's interest rates have been herausgepresst.</seg>
<seg id=528> As a result, interest rates in the 1980's and 1990's, will remain low, even after its full potential produktionsstände.</seg>
<seg id=529> These are, of course, all good news for those who have assets as long-term bonds, stocks and real estate.</seg>
<seg id=530> Because the prospect of long-term assets was exactly the point of lowering interest rates: a shareholder value in the US, in particular immobilieneigentümer stimulating the expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=531> The bad news is that, even if this means that the time will remain a low interest rates, they will not be indefinitely so low.</seg>
<seg id=532> In a word: if interest rates rise, the assets fall.</seg>
<seg id=533> It is the times, especially when assets and a rapid decline in which we see our central bankers, as well as its primary task to fulfil: the reduction of financial volatility and the promotion of economic stability.</seg>
<seg id=534> We are also during periods, as many people, real estate long-term bonds or shares have to do so, not because they believe that the current prices are measured by the key figures, but because prices have risen in recent years.</seg>
<seg id=535> This is a crucial issue for policy makers, because those who have acquired long-term assets apparently as a result of rising prices are also those who sell them, as soon as the preistrends apparently contrary to develop.</seg>
<seg id=536> In particular, the US current-account deficit is a massive threat as a source of instability, prices for long-term assets should be clear.</seg>
<seg id=537> The challenges facing the world economic decision-makers will be over the coming years, are no other than the faced since the collapse of the nasdaq-blase.</seg>
<seg id=538> The risks connected with inflation are probably less dangerous than those caused by zusammenbrechende production and the threat of deflation.</seg>
<seg id=539> As we have learned in the 1990's, however, this does not mean that the difficulties to be overcome.</seg>
<seg id=540> America's contradictory future</seg>
<seg id=541> I recently expressed in an interesting experience: in America finanzökonomen with international and national circumstances macroeconomists focused almost contradictory -- -- have very different views on the possible consequences of the American leistungsbilanzdefizits.</seg>
<seg id=542> The finanzökonomen outward-looking a financial crisis, followed by a painful and prolonged recession in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=543> By contrast, the national macroeconomists according to a decline in the dollar as a crisis, but as an opportunity to speed up the economic growth.</seg>
<seg id=544> The macroeconomists like this: the situation at some point in the future foreign central banks will be no longer willing to buy dollar-denominated securities en masse in order to support the American currency.</seg>
<seg id=545> If you stop their voluminous dollarkäufe, the value of the dollar will fall -- and landing is hard.</seg>
<seg id=546> With the decline in the value of the dollar, however, the us-exporte macroeconomists, for other countries become more attractive and employment in America will improve there are more people in the emerging export sector.</seg>
<seg id=547> The development would be just as in Britain, as the währungsbindung abandoned and the British pound has been devalued against the German mark or, as in the United States in the late 1980's, when the dollar against the pound has been devalued the Deutsche Mark and, above all -- against the yen.</seg>
<seg id=548> The outward-looking finanzökonomen see the future much bleak.</seg>
<seg id=549> In their eyes, the end of the dollarkäufe by the central banks will not only lead to a devaluation of the dollar, but also a peak in the long-term interest rates in the US, the spending and a short time later, the investment will be reduced.</seg>
<seg id=550> Of course, the finanzökonomen expect that the us-exporte benefit from a decline in the dollar, but by the delay in the exportanstieg demand is one or two years after the decline in consumption and investment.</seg>
<seg id=551> The jobs of eight to ten million people will be moved from the services sector in the export and the importkonkurrierenden area, which will be an increase in the structural unemployment.</seg>
<seg id=552> Moreover, it might be a's large financial institutions, with their liabilities short-term and long-term assets, it will be difficult to cope with a sharp rise in long-term dollar-zinssätze.</seg>
<seg id=553> It can just as easily lead to financial pressure and bankruptcy as during the crises in Mexico and East Asia in the 1990's, and a few years ago in Argentina, as the imbalance between the local currencies in keeping the banks and their dollar-verbindlichkeiten led to financial congestion and ultimately the bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id=554> If international finanzökonomen geared to respond to the drafting of this scenario, all macroeconomists on a case of incapable of monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=555> Why America's Federal Reserve should allow long-term spitzenzinssätze, not only because other central banks dollarkäufe?</seg>
<seg id=556> The fed intervene and should not simply buy even long-term US Treasury bills, and thus contribute to a long-term interest rate that is compatible with the full employment?</seg>
<seg id=557> The finanzökonomen respond by saying that the fed do not have the force.</seg>
<seg id=558> If it has the choice between full employment and price stability, the finanzökonomen, because the memory of the rampant inflation in the 1970's, are still very presence will determine the fed for price stability.</seg>
<seg id=559> As a decline in the dollar will lead to an increase in import prices and is therefore a negative shock to the supply side of the economy, the fed must increase and reduce interest rates and not buy bonds, but not sell.</seg>
<seg id=560> On both sides in this debate serious economists, which I very much appreciate involved.</seg>
<seg id=561> I am not wise enough to decide which side is right, but I know exactly what I hope that it is wrong.</seg>
<seg id=562> Europe 'free-riders'</seg>
<seg id=563> In the United States, which have a lack of budgetary policy must count on penalties.</seg>
<seg id=564> Their bonds are less value than those from the better States.</seg>
<seg id=565> The higher the debt, the poor -- have to do is to a certain extent -- disciplinary action against the temptation to spend the money and to foot the bill later.</seg>
<seg id=566> Of course, the discipline of the market is not perfect: "The future is raising us" implicit pension liabilities (such as promised).</seg>
<seg id=567> Yet these forced discipline in combination with the budgetmaßnahmen of individual States that helped in the United States since the great depression haushaltskrisen large no more.</seg>
<seg id=568> Let us now look at Europe.</seg>
<seg id=569> Before the introduction of the euro in individual countries of southern Europe budgetkrisen to high inflation.</seg>
<seg id=570> Because of the single currency, however, is the way to solve a time to inflation, now that the European Central Bank (ECB) on monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=571> Although the European countries cannot get their finanzdefizite more on inflation, allows the single currency, the schuldenkapazität, for the other EU members, and expand their ausgabenorgien to live in a time saus and braus and political responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=572> This means putting a stop to the Stability and Growth Pact was created: the public deficits must be below 3% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=573> Last week, Germany now -- once the most disciplined budgetary vorzeigeland the EU -- the rules of the Pact for the fifth time in succession without great) (excuses.</seg>
<seg id=574> Finance ministers peer Steinbrück was to understand that they expect the European Commission sanctions against Germany, because otherwise the credibility of the Pact is at stake.</seg>
<seg id=575> Unlike Germany two and a half years should therefore not against the sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=576> Steinbrück made clear, however, that he expect the sanctions will be the forecast deficit of 3.4% of GDP, mostly symbolic and no penalties, which the government or economy with significant costs.</seg>
<seg id=577> The Stability and Growth Pact works -- -- still nowhere near as, as originally intended.</seg>
<seg id=578> What is the market discipline?</seg>
<seg id=579> The willingness of the German government deficits accumulate more and more debt is being reduced, because the market is punished those States and accept a weakening of its fiscal position?</seg>
<seg id=580> The answer is' no '.</seg>
<seg id=581> The interest rates in the euro denominierten public debt of the twelve Member States of the euro zone are all very similar.</seg>
<seg id=582> The market, it does not seem to care so that the countries have different ways to stimulate exports from those of the financial flows and current forecast for various or state quotas would be needed.</seg>
<seg id=583> Willem Buiter of the University of Amsterdam and Anne sibert think of the University of London that the willingness of the ECB to accept all ultimately debts of the eurozone as guarantees, the market's ability to act as a driving force undermines budgetary prudence.</seg>
<seg id=584> As long as a small part of the German debt as security for a short-term credit or can serve as a wertpapierpensionsgeschäfts to improve the liquidity, its value will be much more determined by those conditions, what the ECB to accept this as a security, as his real value.</seg>
<seg id=585> The fact that the ECB all these debts liquiditätsquellen treated as equals is more important than all the analyses on the differences in national long-term risks.</seg>
<seg id=586> In the long run, this is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=587> To maintain a reasonable chance of long-term price stability, it is both market discipline and sound budgetary management.</seg>
<seg id=588> The rapid punishment of the market for a behaviour, which can then degenerate into sidelined or recklessness, lacks institutional arrangements, in order to give a future generations, with serious risks to -- is perhaps not today or tomorrow, but at some point and then for a long time.</seg>
<seg id=589> Over the years, the introduction of the single currency and the way that has led to an increasing unease.</seg>
<seg id=590> The policy in the euro zone is too deflationary.</seg>
<seg id=591> We failed to carry out transfers, which would be needed to make the single currency for those regions, whose position is deteriorating and who are already in recession, if the ECB intensified its policy.</seg>
<seg id=592> The institutional foundations for undermine a stable long-term budgetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=593> And now Buiter and sibert convincing note that the ECB should allow the market too little room to reward the economical and punish the squanderers.</seg>
<seg id=594> There are no fault lines and for the next time is not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id=595> But if things do not change in the euro could well movement.</seg>
<seg id=596> Milosevic and Hussein: a mockery of justice</seg>
<seg id=597> Convened were once a serious matter.</seg>
<seg id=598> One remembers the photographs of Herman göring and Rudolf heß in Nuremberg, working on the dock.</seg>
<seg id=599> After a number of Nazi leaders were relatively recently, but fair process even hanged.</seg>
<seg id=600> Today, the trial of the verworfensten world leaders are degenerate into a farce.</seg>
<seg id=601> The trial of Saddam Hussein and his cronies from the Ba'ath party is characterised by a continuing series of embarrassing.</seg>
<seg id=602> The defendants try to a farce and Hussein is any form of contempt of court, but the judge the butt stark.</seg>
<seg id=603> It is hard to imagine a result that the Iraqis or in the eyes of the world will be legitimate.</seg>
<seg id=604> Alldieweil the trial of Slobodan Milosevic has changed the funeral after four years -- boring of evidence and a waste of more than $200 million.</seg>
<seg id=605> In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government for almost a decade haggle about how to make the survivors elements of the Khmer Rouge.</seg>
<seg id=606> The mass murderers who came to power in the 20th century, were to be -- if they do not verstarben, while they were still in power -- doomed, people were killed or for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id=607> Who can be proud of the fact that the last Communist leaders, ceauşescu Nicolae Romania, and his wife were shot without the appearance of a fair trial?</seg>
<seg id=608> The formal ceremony real courts is better than the vigilantism, even if at the end of the death in both cases.</seg>
<seg id=609> Today, there are two credible methods to combat ousted a tyrant.</seg>
<seg id=610> A nation can demonstrate its former leaders even before a court, as did the Argentines in the 1980's, with the for the disappearance of more than 5 000 of its citizens responsible generals.</seg>
<seg id=611> At international level, for future processes continues to adopt the Nuremberg -- under the dubious circumstances, however, that siegermächte sometimes impose penalties for crimes, such as' crimes against humanity '-- for the time when they have been committed, a proper definition.</seg>
<seg id=612> There was a time in the benefits of both national and international processes were clear.</seg>
<seg id=613> On the ground processes which enabled the local communities to make Freud's formula close involvement in the process.</seg>
<seg id=614> As judge and jury the people of the defendants have also bring greater sensitivity in the assessment of the blame, because they were aware of the difficult circumstances in which the outgoing dictator took its decisions.</seg>
<seg id=615> Argentina's proceedings against the generals, who was a successful ritual difficult by the military junta in the transition to democracy, but the experience and self-doubt ended in tears.</seg>
<seg id=616> Even after its condemnation of the generals were strong enough to enforce the processes and then the pardon by the next President.</seg>
<seg id=617> Today the Argentine politics by the consequences of the 20 years ago caused processes is complications.</seg>
<seg id=618> At international level, the decision by the UN Security Council was welcomed the establishment of the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) with great confidence.</seg>
<seg id=619> The ICTY took, led by Antonio Cassese, a number of fundamental choices.</seg>
<seg id=620> But then the judges have had the misfortune to achieve their wildest dream -- the negotiation, in their own courts, against the erzschurken Slobodan Milosevic.</seg>
<seg id=621> It is not clear how the Serbs in a process in their own country would be dealt with Milosevic.</seg>
<seg id=622> Much of the political party, which would have been controlled justice.</seg>
<seg id=623> At international level, there was a surplus of policy, but right.</seg>
<seg id=624> Milosevic's trial should more than fair, a symbol for the fairness of the UN.</seg>
<seg id=625> So it was allowed Milosevic to defend themselves -- one from the point of view of the length of the procedure and efficiency.</seg>
<seg id=626> The number of witnesses, which called for the charge, always to pay the same odious history of Serbian aggression and brutality, knew no borders.</seg>
<seg id=627> It will take months to determine what went wrong, and why the process scandalous lasted for four years.</seg>
<seg id=628> My instinct tells me that could affect the well-meaning gerichtsbeamten too much of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission -- a model proclaimed in the legal faculties as an alternative to vergeltungsjustiz desirable.</seg>
<seg id=629> In the South African procedure was not the most important issue for the future of the accused, but in the past, the victims.</seg>
<seg id=630> Every victim was encouraged to tell and its history, the accused heard.</seg>
<seg id=631> In the case of the massacre in the course of the twentieth century, they can such a process for decades.</seg>
<seg id=632> The victims to talk to encourage and then the defendants that right to delay by its own political merits praise the procedures, to a recipe for interminable delays as well.</seg>
<seg id=633> The lesson we have learned from the trials against Milosevic and Hussein, is that we should not men or women, in order to make their charismatic conditional attractiveness to an end.</seg>
<seg id=634> They will take the procedure to -- especially if you will allow them to defend themselves and use the courtroom to justify their careers.</seg>
<seg id=635> Only tyrants should be taken to court if they are defeated.</seg>
<seg id=636> Ironically, it was an advantage of the Nuremberg courts that they were filled with the representatives of the siegermächte.</seg>
<seg id=637> This was a constant reminder of göring, heß goods and their supporters, had to say that the allies of the Nazis defeated and the inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=638> The aim of the procedure has always been the punishment of those guilty, not the influence of future history.</seg>
<seg id=639> The tragedy of the trial of Milosevic and Hussein state is that the "i" of history in this case, the absence of a history -- and even before the courts.</seg>
<seg id=640> The uncertainties imposed by the responsible -- led international and national procedures -- facilitated fancy of rehabilitation and return.</seg>
<seg id=641> In the case of Hussein fantasy even this may become a reality.</seg>
<seg id=642> Economic divisions in Iraq</seg>
<seg id=643> Iraq is all observers as a Shia, Sunnis, Kurds and divided state.</seg>
<seg id=644> But a fundamental divide runs along the growing gap between rich and poor, a line has contributed to the current insurgency as religiously motivated battle, opposition to the head of the US military occupation.</seg>
<seg id=645> As Iraq has been liberated, many hoped, particularly poor people to a charismatic leader who would save them from the harsh reality of their everyday life.</seg>
<seg id=646> These people have grown up in fear and had no idea of how the democracy in their society would have bürgerrechtsbewegungen or human rights groups and to make a contribution to the development of the future.</seg>
<seg id=647> We soon in Iraq was confronted with a new social divide.</seg>
<seg id=648> On the one hand, those who had understood, as we were in a democracy, power and achieved its objectives.</seg>
<seg id=649> They learning the language of democracy, as it is in the process of money and influence and how independent organisations is to defend the rights and privileges.</seg>
<seg id=650> On the other side of the line, however, the vast majority of helpless Iraqis, including the widows of abandoned or woman by their men and women who have not provides for them and their children.</seg>
<seg id=651> For these people do not mean democracy and human rights.</seg>
<seg id=652> They have no education, are poor, sick.</seg>
<seg id=653> As the victims of an education system which collapsed more than a decade ago, they have only a small number of knowledge, which could help them in the fragile Iraqi economy to find a employment.</seg>
<seg id=654> During the Saddam's rule, there have been no effort to improve the standard of living of the poor.</seg>
<seg id=655> I visited the huge shanty towns in Iraq and found families living in homes, where there was hardly a roof over his head, which were affected by and by insects and where the waste were widely leaked under the door.</seg>
<seg id=656> When they are in a day and night.</seg>
<seg id=657> These families need a reasonably acceptable food, housing, and the prospect of a job, but they are waiting for the death and are afraid of the their children are starving.</seg>
<seg id=658> When I met with the women in these homes, and you give me überhäuften with questions: democracy is the US Food and homes?</seg>
<seg id=659> They will have to make their men, women?</seg>
<seg id=660> Our children will be the citizenship?</seg>
<seg id=661> We will then have a right to divorce by their husbands, who have left us?</seg>
<seg id=662> My response to all these questions was "yes".</seg>
<seg id=663> Yes, the democracy gives you the right to a decent housing, education and work, your children will obtain citizenship, and you will put your men.</seg>
<seg id=664> However, you will work hard and must make every effort to your rights.</seg>
<seg id=665> The answer was: 'women Saddam has eingebläut us 35 years to live without jobs and aufzumucken in fear.</seg>
<seg id=666> What can we do now? "</seg>
<seg id=667> In these poverty-stricken areas, where the majority of the Iraqi people bitter temptations.</seg>
<seg id=668> Many of them are not in politics or the government.</seg>
<seg id=669> They fall into violence, theft and sabotage.</seg>
<seg id=670> Inspired by the lure of a wrong heldentums that they have not been able to during the long dominated Saddam's rule, it is the money to carry out of poverty.</seg>
<seg id=671> Poverty, exacerbated the trauma of the horrors of war, and violent history of Iraq, which has allowed our people to kill.</seg>
<seg id=672> Although many young men carried away by the conditions in Iraq to violence, I am convinced that we ask you only proper jobs and shelters to dissuade them.</seg>
<seg id=673> Above all, jobs would help young people to make their lives by serious work.</seg>
<seg id=674> We must not the armies of the unemployed by fictitious, so-called no-work-jobs.</seg>
<seg id=675> We must give people jobs that give them the opportunity to contribute to the reconstruction of the country.</seg>
<seg id=676> Everyone is inherently to be a valuable member of society.</seg>
<seg id=677> But the culture, the flourished under Saddam, convinced that the Iraqis political compounds are the only way to get money, power, and to put an end to this end it takes time and a dynamic economy.</seg>
<seg id=678> That in turn means that the power of the new Iraqi Government must be limited to facilitate the growth of the private sector, and at the same time, a wide understanding of democracy and human rights must be encouraged.</seg>
<seg id=679> Religious groups are prepared to make a contribution to this process.</seg>
<seg id=680> We can also the technocrats, served under Saddam, rehabilitate, so that you will have the opportunity to serve their country.</seg>
<seg id=681> Last but not least, we must give poor families loans, which will allow them to build a respectable life.</seg>
<seg id=682> Above all, the government must leave no effort to show the Iraqis of the values of democracy and freedom and to convince them of the importance of a constitution for the realisation of their dreams of a better life.</seg>
<seg id=683> This is simply not in a country where many people consider the recognise law-breaking than heroic act.</seg>
<seg id=684> We have learned Iraqis, however, that the power must not be concentrated in the hands of a few people and the establishment of fair conditions requires the fight against all forms of corruption.</seg>
<seg id=685> If the Constitution is to serve as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, the Iraqis must learn to make the fight to their fight.</seg>
<seg id=686> Islamic identity</seg>
<seg id=687> Today, as we always see Islam as a political force () used and abused.</seg>
<seg id=688> Some Muslims use it as a call to action, many in the West and elsewhere) (see him as a "other" demand for division and exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=689> I am a Turk, both sides of this debate.</seg>
<seg id=690> The reason why the Islam to the point of view of the West as a "other" religion, is that the West has experienced a systematic entinstitutionalisierung religion.</seg>
<seg id=691> Religion is not, of course, disappeared from the modern western life, much more to raise the claim that it is the religious institutions on the behaviour of the individual.</seg>
<seg id=692> In the modern world religion is a much more personal experience and spirituellere than ever before.</seg>
<seg id=693> But within Islam a process of entinstitutionalisierung will take place religious experience.</seg>
<seg id=694> The politicisation of Islam is the authority of the religious classes of Islam, the ulema.</seg>
<seg id=695> As in the west of the religious is personal experience in Islam.</seg>
<seg id=696> One result is the interpretation by the individual Muslim religious texts, including the political combatants, intellectuals and women.</seg>
<seg id=697> Another the vergröberung of religious knowledge, and the lesson of the Koran and taken out of context to support political objectives.</seg>
<seg id=698> Who will decide what is allowed in Islam and what?</seg>
<seg id=699> Anyone who has the authority to interpret religious texts?</seg>
<seg id=700> Who can impose a fatwa "or a" Jihad "?</seg>
<seg id=701> Terrorism today activism and provide a new source of legitimacy, or the necessary.</seg>
<seg id=702> Thus, where Islam or does not mean decide, and they do without the authority of religious schools and a spezialausbildung.</seg>
<seg id=703> Indeed, the Islam is cited today, primarily by political parties and movements of cultural and religious institutions.</seg>
<seg id=704> This entinstitutionalisierung enabled Islam, will continue to be a local and national social bond, feel, to forge an imaginary link between all Muslims everywhere where they oppressed and harassed.</seg>
<seg id=705> Therefore, the rise of Islam, which were previously deeply divided, can unite: spiritual sufi and law-abiding Sharia, Sunnis and Shia Muslims; the Conservative Saudi Arabia and the revolutionary Iran.</seg>
<seg id=706> At the same time, as its believers left in the towns and rural areas, including in the west of the left, Islam is also.</seg>
<seg id=707> Many seems this development as a negative, and stress that the people were to be socially, and alienation for some to terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=708> But social mobility is also a prerequisite to win a modern perspective.</seg>
<seg id=709> Of course, as a result of the brain drain Muslims have a sense of distance of, or even a complete break with their social background.</seg>
<seg id=710> So are deprived of their religious experience of a new kind of all gemeindlichen and theological and state institutions.</seg>
<seg id=711> The religious experience will instead to develop into a form of social idea in which people to a point in the new and unfamiliar surroundings Islam.</seg>
<seg id=712> The alienation of modern life, but the approach to this is the reference to religious identity.</seg>
<seg id=713> Indeed, the radicalism is usually in groups, because of mobility and expulsion, with the secular political thinking and urban life in the West.</seg>
<seg id=714> By the ungewohnte environment, you will find their support in Islam.</seg>
<seg id=715> But this support can prove themselves, Islam to rid itself of modernity in view of its traditional, and mild servile passive attitude.</seg>
<seg id=716> A veil by Bart, or the right to ask for your prayer in the workplace or in special schools and food, be open to Muslims.</seg>
<seg id=717> They show that any in the environment that they comply with firm and their religious duties more than those that limit their religion on their private life.</seg>
<seg id=718> For example, in the wearing of the veil non-Muslims usually see a sign of humiliation and oppression of Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id=719> Instead of the veil stigma for Muslims is now to the positive commitment to their Muslim identity.</seg>
<seg id=720> Young Muslim women in Europe this transformation right.</seg>
<seg id=721> Girls in French and German schools, the headscarf is in many ways (the youth culture, modebewusstseins and language) their mitschülern closer to the gefesselten as their home, uneducated mothers.</seg>
<seg id=722> Unwittingly, by the headscarf in Europe in the public, change this girls, the symbol and the role of the Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id=723> This trend extends far beyond the headscarf.</seg>
<seg id=724> All Muslims in the West have a double zugehörigkeitsempfinden, a double cultural capital.</seg>
<seg id=725> They define themselves by their religion, but they have acquired a comprehensive, secular knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=726> Because they have a dual cultural capital, they can move freely and fairly between different activities - between the homes, schools, and the new URBAN activities.</seg>
<seg id=727> Islamic fundamentalist Muslim and to be, is not the same thing.</seg>
<seg id=728> What we are witnessing today, the transformation of the Muslim identity is an Islamic.</seg>
<seg id=729> The religious even of the individual Muslims shifted from the private in the public sector.</seg>
<seg id=730> The question is whether all the search for identity can be met with and wearing a broad public acceptance of religious practices of Islam, or whether the positive commitment to Islam requires a fundamental rejection of modernity.</seg>
<seg id=731> A new era for the Islamic science?</seg>
<seg id=732> As science and mathematics enjoyed a few hundred years, a period of great inventions, was a region of the world.</seg>
<seg id=733> The master this revered medicine disciplines, have been made rapid progress and the durchschnittsmensch was curious to know how the nature of work.</seg>
<seg id=734> Unsurprisingly, respect for the region in the world.</seg>
<seg id=735> On the other half of the well-known planet scientists were punished even murdered.</seg>
<seg id=736> As gottlos mathematics was outlawed and absurd and later of religion.</seg>
<seg id=737> The standard of living.</seg>
<seg id=738> The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, while a further ignorantes Europe was poor.</seg>
<seg id=739> Both regions were determined by the religion) (historians have different views on the role and the nature of religions in this context, science erblühte in only one of the two.</seg>
<seg id=740> Now the roles of the Islamic Middle East and West are reversed, of course.</seg>
<seg id=741> Since the Second World War, the United States are world leaders in science.</seg>
<seg id=742> During this period were taken the gescheitesten students from their countries of forschungsuniversitäten superior and better ways.</seg>
<seg id=743> Until recently, more than half of the university students in the United States was born in mathematics, science and engineering abroad.</seg>
<seg id=744> Many of these talents remained after the degree, and both industry and its government took advantage.</seg>
<seg id=745> Islamic cultures, in a historic period in which the science was equated with Western influence and shunned.</seg>
<seg id=746> Even in countries where revenue could promote research considerable, Arab rulers have not been able to promote such an investment, with the result that their societies are not progressed as far as they had.</seg>
<seg id=747> Recently moved a greater political respect Islamic nations to invest in technology, something that the atomambitionen Pakistan and Iran.</seg>
<seg id=748> Such weapons have political weight, science behind it is self-evident, and old.</seg>
<seg id=749> The respect, created by the papers of knowledge is much more relevant than the products from discoveries of the past.</seg>
<seg id=750> Imagine the influence that would involve a Pakistani commitment to produce Institute, which is the world leader in cancer.</seg>
<seg id=751> The political rhetoric would, if researchers identified in Oman a key to fight AIDS?</seg>
<seg id=752> This is a wasted opportunity.</seg>
<seg id=753> However, there is another, and not just for Islamic societies.</seg>
<seg id=754> The United States have done in the recent past serious errors.</seg>
<seg id=755> Science has been replaced throughout the government, the President, "down with" religious matters.</seg>
<seg id=756> The reports by spitzenforschern were amended by political leaders, if the facts objected to the official conviction.</seg>
<seg id=757> Encouraged by a religious beeinflusste government, education shift its focus of science in the "values".</seg>
<seg id=758> Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 entry visas are less and have become more difficult as the flow of American universities discourages young talent.</seg>
<seg id=759> Great scientific organisations have protested.</seg>
<seg id=760> At the same time, the tax laws have been changed to investors in the short term, to bring vermögenszuwächse on long-term discourage investment in research.</seg>
<seg id=761> Half a billion dollars was provided for the war in Iraq, a sum which in some of the support of the whole of research in the last thousand years ago.</seg>
<seg id=762> Even if the United States have a fundamentalist Middle Ages, you risk losing their dominance in the world of research.</seg>
<seg id=763> Japan has recognised the link between political power and science in the 1980's.</seg>
<seg id=764> Japan's leading industrial akio morita, the President of the rechtsstehende Sony, and politicians shintaro ishihara considered a number of speeches, which have been collected in 1986 and published a book entitled the Japan that can say no.</seg>
<seg id=765> It was a national strategy that emerges from influence on the world leadership in science.</seg>
<seg id=766> The basic idea was that military power could be made obsolete, when the "food chain of military technology" controlled by other nations.</seg>
<seg id=767> The title of the book is Japan's plan to say "no" to the American military power, as soon as Japan's vital military technology.</seg>
<seg id=768> It is clearly possible to build a knowledge-based economy through the use of oil wealth.</seg>
<seg id=769> So, as the most southern North American States, once was poor and economically understood in decline.</seg>
<seg id=770> Although it was in possession of revenue, the flow of dollars in an economy growing prosperity could not as strong as it.</seg>
<seg id=771> Thus ölgeld Texas be decided to use a ausbildungsstiftung.</seg>
<seg id=772> Today, this funding is something of Harvard University and will be distributed on 15 universities.</seg>
<seg id=773> The result is striking: the production in the field of aeronautics and space is disappeared from California, however, is in Texas.</seg>
<seg id=774> In the area of telecommunications and research centres consortia in droves Texas, even after the Canadian companies -- nortel telekommunikationsriesen.</seg>
<seg id=775> Although the manufacturing industry in the United States is in crisis, Texas produktionsorientierten has one of the strongest economies in the world.</seg>
<seg id=776> There is no reason why the same result could not be achieved in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=777> First, the Islamic world must find their pride heritage and make it.</seg>
<seg id=778> Iran's debates on Iraq</seg>
<seg id=779> No country in the Middle East concentrated more on the events in post-war Iraq and Iran.</seg>
<seg id=780> With his western neighbours combine Iran the geographic proximity, a long history of bloody conflicts with the Saddam Hussein's Iraq, religious and emotional ties with the Iraqi Shia and concern about the policy of the United States in the region.</seg>
<seg id=781> In view of the continuing tensions with the United States, Iran is especially in view of a possible longer concerned us-präsenz in Iraq and because of the dominant America's role in shaping the future of Iraq, Saddam Hussein.</seg>
<seg id=782> To outsiders, it is probably difficult to follow the internal debates in Iran, but these discussions and will, even if it is a major international public opinion is not at first sight.</seg>
<seg id=783> In this debate on Iraq under Saddam Hussein three basic approaches.</seg>
<seg id=784> The pragmatists are of the opinion that Iran must cooperate with the United States in Iraq under Saddam, even if it is to safeguard the rights of the Iraqi Shia.</seg>
<seg id=785> For this reason, we should give Iran that a new leadership in Iraq will not hostile to deal with this section of the population and a kind of bilateral relations.</seg>
<seg id=786> Further to the fundamental interests of pragmatists the preservation of the territorial integrity of Iraq and the repatriation tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees in Iran.</seg>
<seg id=787> The Moderate pragmatists want the Iranian government exerts pressure on America, in Iraq (Mujahedin-e Khalq living members of the MKO) will be extradited and dismantle the organisation.</seg>
<seg id=788> In return, the Iranian Government should offer its support for the preservation of peace, stability and security in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=789> In a word, the iranisch-amerikanischen relations would reduce the pragmatists on an agenda which is mostly national affairs of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=790> This approach is generally supports conservative forces in Iran.</seg>
<seg id=791> Another approach of Iran, provides a more active role in the reconstruction of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=792> The advocates of this is the view that could facilitate Iran because of his well established and institutional infrastructure links to the reconstruction of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=793> Eventually, it is the United States and the international community will see the value of Iranian cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=794> In return for the Iranian cooperation should be destroyed infrastructure of the MKO in Iraq, perhaps a promise of Iran could be linked to even harder activities against Al Qaeda and make their living in Iran Members.</seg>
<seg id=795> It is primarily the advocates of this position, however, that the country that is not the aim of American military Iran is guaranteed by the American side.</seg>
<seg id=796> In short, it is the proponents of an open and clear cooperation agreement: Iran supports the stabilisation in the current transitional phase in Iraq and promises, cooperative relations with the Iraqi Government, which should come into being, and to maintain the commitment to improve its regional and international role.</seg>
<seg id=797> This view is mainly by Iranian reformers, both inside and outside the government - and outward-looking technocrats and business.</seg>
<seg id=798> Finally, the radical for the possibility of cooperation with the United States is sheer fantasy.</seg>
<seg id=799> They believe America would only serve to undermine the safety of Iran and endanger its national interests.</seg>
<seg id=800> In the eyes of the us at least impose more radical changes to the Iranian foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id=801> In the worst case, it is said, the Americans will vigorously for regime change in Iran.</seg>
<seg id=802> You are going to turn against the acquisition of nuclear know by Iran and may even try to weaken the entire military potential of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=803> This radical look at the American invasion of Iraq as a part of the American strategy, Iran einzukreisen.</seg>
<seg id=804> So, they must respond with Iran aggressively defend its interests, strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers, and use its influence in Iraq to avoid a pro-American, anti-iranische government in Baghdad.</seg>
<seg id=805> This approach hardliners support from all groups.</seg>
<seg id=806> The overthrow of Saddam's regime, was the easiest exercise in the Iraq crisis.</seg>
<seg id=807> Now the difficult part: to guarantee peace and stability to win the war against terrorism and the Muslim communities that it is not the intention of America's occupation of Iraq, abzusaugen oil and equal to the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=808> Meanwhile, the refusal of the United States in the form of suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism is likely to increase.</seg>
<seg id=809> Iran should remain a great power in the region, because his political dynamism and its Muslim identity find echoes of large throughout the Muslim world.</seg>
<seg id=810> What happens in Iraq has a great impact on Iran and the United States would be well advised to see this fact.</seg>
<seg id=811> The American threats or the hints of a new war in Iran fan resentment and frustration and strengthen the most radical forces.</seg>
<seg id=812> If the United States wish to avoid such a development, they should restrict the influence of their own radical and recognise that the American interests are best served in Iraq through greater cooperation with Iran.</seg>
<seg id=813> The road from Iraq</seg>
<seg id=814> Finally in Iraq is the point where all the same apparently want: the withdrawal of troops from the country.</seg>
<seg id=815> The recently from the British Ministry of durchgesickerte report of a document to the withdrawal of troops underlines this desire.</seg>
<seg id=816> The only question is how to respond to it.</seg>
<seg id=817> As long as the coalition forces, the violence is escalating.</seg>
<seg id=818> But it will also come to an escalation, more quickly.</seg>
<seg id=819> The real question is how we have reached a point at which the Iraq can provide the police and the army, which are trusted to maintain law and order.</seg>
<seg id=820> There is still a long way to achieve this goal is only around.</seg>
<seg id=821> Despite the courage of the many Iraqis who join the army or police, no one should be surprised if motives, some of which are not quite.</seg>
<seg id=822> In northern Iraq old scores and be paid in areas such as irbil that were traditionally ethnically mixed, a de facto ethnic division.</seg>
<seg id=823> In other areas of Sharia law is enforced.</seg>
<seg id=824> As Iraq can establish uniformed services that one can have an effective and impartial application of the law, without taking account of ethnicity, religion and sex?</seg>
<seg id=825> The traditional response is to recruit and train people and give them the "right" values.</seg>
<seg id=826> But it is not enough time.</seg>
<seg id=827> Other options are necessary.</seg>
<seg id=828> Without a profound values enshrined Iraq needs civil society organisations on the ground, the police and the army.</seg>
<seg id=829> This may take various forms, but the really important thing is that they will involve the people at local level and supported by the power to township level, at regional and national level, if you tell abuse.</seg>
<seg id=830> If there is a local review, whose value is reinforced national and recognised, most Members will be uniformed -- and probably the services, if they do not do so, they can be identified easier and treated as such.</seg>
<seg id=831> That may sound like high hopes, but in Afghanistan, a country that Iraq is in many ways, there are working groups on this objective.</seg>
<seg id=832> The cooperation for peace and unity (cpau) is a model of how this can be done.</seg>
<seg id=833> Just as in Iraq, the reduction of violence to the ordinary people in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=834> The cpau has worked in the last three years throughout the country to set up this committee for peace on the support of friedensräten township level in nearby villages.</seg>
<seg id=835> The initiative has to do with a culture of violence is so deeply rooted in that children are used by learned, they were sowjetsoldaten deaths.</seg>
<seg id=836> The committee therefore trying to bring together all parts of the Community, including teachers, leaders, religious leaders, women, the police, soldiers and businessmen, judges in order to find new ways to peaceful conflict resolution.</seg>
<seg id=837> Even though monitoring was not formally part of the role of the Committee (this is planned for the future), the simple fact is that the police, the army and the judiciary Committee, you are in contact with the rest of the Community, it provides feedback and inspires confidence.</seg>
<seg id=838> Some results are remarkable.</seg>
<seg id=839> In a workshop of local militärkommandant over came out of courtesy for a few hours and remained at the end of the week.</seg>
<seg id=840> Finally, he apologized for his violent past and undertook to disarm its strong privatarmee 2000.</seg>
<seg id=841> Now he regularly visited the offices of the Committee.</seg>
<seg id=842> In Iraq at the moment, projects such as the humanitarian liaison Center (start humanitarian community centre) in Kirkuk, a supervisory role, providing the ethnically mixed local populations the opportunity to put their problems, and to help resolve.</seg>
<seg id=843> But too often judicial decisions, even if they have not been adopted, as a result of intimidation.</seg>
<seg id=844> By American and British forces much good work has been done to the strengthening of civil society.</seg>
<seg id=845> There is nothing about the workshops authorising of women or the successful organisation of small-scale local elections throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id=846> But the mobilisation of civil society is an enormous challenge, particularly if they, as in Iraq, must be done quickly and on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id=847> Military forces are still, however, incentives to disarm, is the prospect of economic opportunities that there is a crime and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id=848> Fortunately, the development of civil society capabilities as cheaply as important.</seg>
<seg id=849> The humanitarian liaison Center quite Kirkuk at an annual costs of $75 000.</seg>
<seg id=850> With $10 million 100 such centres could be created, and would be "politics."</seg>
<seg id=851> The challenge is to undertake this approach, and extend it to take full support to the courageous people to accept the challenge of the powerful.</seg>
<seg id=852> Otherwise, it is unlikely that the Iraqis have the security they need after so many years of suffering so.</seg>
<seg id=853> Democracy Nile came into effect on?</seg>
<seg id=854> The decision by the Egyptian President Mubarak hosni for a revision of the Constitution, which is a directly elected President in several candidates, could prove in Egypt and throughout the Arab world as a major step towards democracy.</seg>
<seg id=855> For people in the West used to pluralist democracies, it is difficult to understand what may be a huge change in a country that is for more than 50 years under military rule.</seg>
<seg id=856> In the current system should all Egyptian citizens only six years on the day of the presidential elections to the ballot box and the single name on the ballot papers their approval or not.</seg>
<seg id=857> This explains why, as someone has Mubarak every time over 90% of the vote, albeit in different.</seg>
<seg id=858> It was Syrian and Iraqi leaders with such systems. Aufzuscheinen because, and this will undoubtedly addresses the electorate to any ballot papers.</seg>
<seg id=859> In many cases, to participate fully in Egypt was argued that the democratisation process in the Middle East will not progress.</seg>
<seg id=860> Egypt was able to follow the path of democracy, but not without changing the constitution -- the powers of his phenomenal President and to limit its term of office.</seg>
<seg id=861> Mubarak is at least 24 year in his term as President.</seg>
<seg id=862> His announcement is to ensure a presidential election with multiple candidates, an important first step.</seg>
<seg id=863> The regime is perhaps from being able to use this process to their advantage, but the course of events may not be so easy to monitor, if people have the feeling to be equipped with power.</seg>
<seg id=864> The flaschengeist democracy would have left the bottle.</seg>
<seg id=865> In any case, Egypt is not the only country problembeladenen in this region, which has now on the path to democracy.</seg>
<seg id=866> Turkey, on the one hand, the Middle East, and Morocco are already on the other.</seg>
<seg id=867> This is the real pressure from the strict timetables and the positive results of the recent elections in Iraq, in Palestine and, to a lesser extent in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=868> In the unprecedented demonstrations against the Syrian occupation in Lebanon, in the aftermath of the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri seems no end in sight.</seg>
<seg id=869> Egyptian opposition groups have also in the last few weeks increasingly risky marches and other forms of civil disobedience.</seg>
<seg id=870> Their anger was fuelled by the arrest of a health oppositionschefs eiman only at the end of January.</seg>
<seg id=871> The ruthless approach the government led to a revival of the national "kifaya-" (enough) movement, which calls for an end to the mubarak-regimes.</seg>
<seg id=872> Suddenly, the widespread belief that Egyptians were passive and activities zurückscheuten seemed to have no longer sustainable.</seg>
<seg id=873> An alliance of local, regional and international forces together against the daily tyranny on the banks of the Nils.</seg>
<seg id=874> The recent air burst out of the population seems to have shaken the regime.</seg>
<seg id=875> Indeed, just a month ago Mubarak demands for a constitutional reform as a "no".</seg>
<seg id=876> But what kind of events led to his conversion, an initiative to amend the right should be welcomed.</seg>
<seg id=877> This is a necessary -- albeit inadequate -- first step to modify the stalemate in the political system in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id=878> The Egyptians are already sceptical about alibireformen à la Tunisia, where langzeitpräsident be al-abidin Ben Ali created a caricature of a constitution, which is fundamentally competitive elections, but has led to a scheinwahlgang, in a few "candidate selected took."</seg>
<seg id=879> In earlier presidential election in Tunisia Ben Ali routinely reached 99% of the vote in this election, it was 96%.</seg>
<seg id=880> Let us hope, therefore, that is, with its Mubarak serious reform.</seg>
<seg id=881> It is a sign of the immediate release of eiman and take measures to put an end to the for 24 years of a state of emergency, the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id=882> Moreover, Mubarak should commit itself to limit the period of two to five years.</seg>
<seg id=883> We also need confidence-building measures, including an open and equal access to the media, which are currently under state control.</seg>
<seg id=884> I announced that I intend to stand in the forthcoming presidential elections, to bring about a debate on these fundamental reforms.</seg>
<seg id=885> However, I would be pleased to withdraw my private life, if free and open elections guaranteed in this autumn.</seg>
<seg id=886> In serious implementation of these measures would be Mubarak's legacy in a different light.</seg>
<seg id=887> Together with the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine could be a long overdue in the spring of freedom.</seg>
<seg id=888> Historical elections in Egypt?</seg>
<seg id=889> On 7 September, the Egyptians choose its new President, the ten candidate for 24 years of the incumbent President Mubarak hosni.</seg>
<seg id=890> Although his re-election is almost no doubt, you the electoral process in many places, but with great interest.</seg>
<seg id=891> In this election observers 6 000 national preparing and hundreds of foreign journalists into this week in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id=892> Although the additional criteria with a real fair elections, important aspects of the lack of credibility, however, grossly.</seg>
<seg id=893> Despite the promises of equal opportunities is a thousand miles.</seg>
<seg id=894> Mubarak still has many disproportionate cards: wiedererkennungswert, a de facto monopoly on the government-controlled media and electronic about 85% of the written press.</seg>
<seg id=895> A week before the elections are some opposition candidates in the influence of their wahlwerbesendungen in Egyptian television.</seg>
<seg id=896> All Members of the electoral commission has been appointed for the presidential election of Mubarak and with the new electoral rules, we independent herausforderern every opportunity.</seg>
<seg id=897> After a judgment by the Supreme Court of the 8 000 Egyptian judges must confirm the elections since the year 2000, and the results.</seg>
<seg id=898> This judgment was an important step in the direction of fair elections, because the situation of judges in the last 50 years managed to maintain their independence reasonably well against the zugriffsversuche of the executive.</seg>
<seg id=899> So the mubarak-regime had to use various tricks, auszubooten the richtervereinigung.</seg>
<seg id=900> It took in, for example, the judiciary "fair" thousands of government officials who have an end in law, but no experience in court, so that we had committed the real judges, because in the hands of a protest by a boycott of their supervision requirements, this task is once again, the police or the infamous Ministry.</seg>
<seg id=901> In the past, the richtervereinigung with added foreseeable effects.</seg>
<seg id=902> In the parliamentary elections in 2000, the ruling party in the Mubarak's real constituencies judges monitored about 38% of the vote, while the intents where the quasi-richter were at work, on 86%.</seg>
<seg id=903> This year it promises to be very different.</seg>
<seg id=904> In the spring of the judges held a national assembly. It was agreed that the forthcoming presidential elections (or parliamentary elections) to monitor only if the Government recognizes the full independence of judges and the exclusive control of the wahlvorganges.</seg>
<seg id=905> On 2 September, they expressed their final demands: the election should be monitored by civil society groups, the definition of who is a legitimate judges for electoral purposes, must not be changed, and no vote must be removed, without the vote has been held a legitimate judges and endorsed the result of this and.</seg>
<seg id=906> Up to now there appears to be a stalemate, because the chairman of the electoral commission has publicly stated in the Egyptian television that he is opposed to any form of monitoring of the electoral process by citizens.</seg>
<seg id=907> Another interesting development on the eve of the election is the strong public debate about whether we vote or boycott the presidential election.</seg>
<seg id=908> Several Members have asked their opposition parties, the election in protest against the overly restrictive among the Mubarak electoral rules, a huge advantage to the other candidates.</seg>
<seg id=909> On the other hand, the supposedly most einzelopposition in Egypt, for the Muslim Brotherhood, their supporters to vote and calls on it to take a conscience, not to support any "despotic, corrupt rulers."</seg>
<seg id=910> This is an implicit but nonetheless clear Mubarak's, the absolute rejection of the last 24 years.</seg>
<seg id=911> Some 34 civil society organisations for the government, despite repeated objections thousands of young Egyptians on the monitoring of elections.</seg>
<seg id=912> These groups are of the opinion that the national and international monitoring of the elections should be no problem if the government does not opt to manipulate ballot.</seg>
<seg id=913> The regime counters that would be any monitoring by a violation of the Egyptian Foreign observers national sovereignty and an affront to the integrity of the judges.</seg>
<seg id=914> This argument in the richtervereinigung was their support for the civil observers know immediately from the basis.</seg>
<seg id=915> Whether it is mubarak-regime because of the growing demands at home and abroad for free and fair elections in panic, or whether we are simply incapable of the Party abzugewöhnen the drinking fraud, the signs are present for the vote on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id=916> Meanwhile, the Egyptians, for the first time, is an exciting foretaste of opposition to the tyranny and enjoy some newly discovered area of freedom.</seg>
<seg id=917> Europe dollar-neid</seg>
<seg id=918> In the monetary focus not only commercial transactions but also diplomatic and political squabbles.</seg>
<seg id=919> If that happens, economic transactions are more and more uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id=920> The politicisation of money in the interwar period of depression had economically devastating.</seg>
<seg id=921> But it is also in our time to quite unpleasant währungskriegen.</seg>
<seg id=922> In the 1960's, the international financial regulation was at the heart of the political stalemate.</seg>
<seg id=923> Each side of what was happening, very different theories and statements.</seg>
<seg id=924> The Europeans, particularly the French - charged on what General Charles de Gaulle called "exorbitant privilege of the US dollar."</seg>
<seg id=925> The general and finanz-guru, Jacques rueff, claimed that the US would use the status of the dollar as hauptreservewährung under the Bretton Woods regime of fixed exchange rates, to allow such deficits and to pay for their overseas military adventurism () in Vietnam.</seg>
<seg id=926> France responded with a reputation: reform, to put an end to the whole of the dollar, and tried to revive the gold standard largely discredited.</seg>
<seg id=927> The Europeans began a long discussion on the advantages of monetary union in order to be able to look forward with this achievement in the eyes of the dollar.</seg>
<seg id=928> But the American position from the international role of the dollar was a trap.</seg>
<seg id=929> Other countries have been able to change their exchange rates and in this way for greater competitiveness is maintained in exports.</seg>
<seg id=930> The US Government was undervalued powerless in the face of maintaining the yen and believe that the rest of the world would be used against the dollar, America's productive base.</seg>
<seg id=931> The government Nixon came to the conclusion that the only way to save the American economy is the monetary unilateralism, such a drastic geldausweitung that other countries are forced to adapt their exchange rates.</seg>
<seg id=932> This long forgotten fighting suddenly appear to be very topical.</seg>
<seg id=933> The world is no longer under the fixed exchange rate regime, but the dollar remains the major reserve currency - a kind of floatendes Bretton Woods.</seg>
<seg id=934> Americans for the role of the dollar as a reserve currency is a potential threat, while it is nicht-amerikanern as a case of neo-imperial search for American hegemony.</seg>
<seg id=935> In this decade China has taken place that Japan in the 1960's. It is low growth rates, to promote its exports.</seg>
<seg id=936> Consequently, China is to impose objective of us complaints about unfair competition and their efforts to exchange rates, would prevent the Americans, Chinese toys, equipment, and to buy clothes.</seg>
<seg id=937> The manufacturers in the United States have decided that made in China büstenhalter pose a threat to the American way of life.</seg>
<seg id=938> The Europeans complain (particularly the French) on the great us-defizit, de Gaulle and the argument that the rest of the world has to pay for America's wars, is back in fashion.</seg>
<seg id=939> Some Europeans propose Asian central banks should be a major part of their reserves in euros. This is an echo of the unsuccessful attempt, with the general America wanted to force through the purchase of gold against the dollar.</seg>
<seg id=940> The 1960's ended with the collapse of the "system and greater turbulence, in addition to a more inflationist increase in the güterpreise.</seg>
<seg id=941> All have been damaged, and America's role in weltangelegenheiten was shocked.</seg>
<seg id=942> A similar collapse would probably have different effects.</seg>
<seg id=943> The system is now more free exchange rates and the burden of adaptation will be distributed differently.</seg>
<seg id=944> The majority of Americans do not suffer from the clear dollarabsturz, because the seller from abroad must adapt their prices on the American market.</seg>
<seg id=945> The Asian economies to grow strong and in their central banks demands to the United States.</seg>
<seg id=946> They will probably continue this policy, because the alternative would be a sudden setback for the competitiveness of its ausfuhrsektoren on the very important for us.</seg>
<seg id=947> The United States is a long time addressing its deficit, which can be maintained in the long term, not.</seg>
<seg id=948> The economically dynamic regions of the world, North America and Asia - are in this way in a pact, which will ensure the central role of the American dollar until further notice.</seg>
<seg id=949> The Americans will continue to accumulate debt, because the Asians wish of them.</seg>
<seg id=950> The Pact would, against the interests of both sides.</seg>
<seg id=951> This is not an American unilateralism, because it represents the cooperation with Asia.</seg>
<seg id=952> But for Europeans, who are excluded from this Pact, it looks like monetary and wirtschaftsunilateralismus.</seg>
<seg id=953> In the meantime, the rise of the euro against the dollar is a great pain in the European güterexporteuren.</seg>
<seg id=954> Europe cannot do much to gain.</seg>
<seg id=955> Indeed, Europe will be in the new währungskämpfen the greater will suffer.</seg>
<seg id=956> Answers trumpeted in the 1960's, the revival of the goldstandards, or the introduction of a single European currency - do not seem to be very helpful.</seg>
<seg id=957> Only to have a common currency, has proved to be no significant protection.</seg>
<seg id=958> Only the old form of European response psychologists call it "- could dollar-neid" - will increase.</seg>
<seg id=959> There will be appeals to the European Central Bank, the monetary base, as if the counterfeiting of the dollar, the answer to all industrial, structural and demographic problems, the threat of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=960> But brief reflection should remember that Europe's problems are not währungsmanipulationen.</seg>
<seg id=961> A protest against the exorbitant American geldprivilegs should be seen as what it is, a way to come to terms with the real European powerlessness.</seg>
<seg id=962> So it will remain in the dollar-neid, and it will increase the value of global greenbacks, and it is no adverse impact on the people they produce and use.</seg>
<seg id=963> The political influence the disease</seg>
<seg id=964> As well as citizens of other countries in the world, the Americans have taken note that the policy of occupation plays an important role of public services.</seg>
<seg id=965> Only a few are surprised) (although sometimes disappointed if the appointment of a judge or high-ranking diplomats is that once its loyalty to certain political principles of the Party of the President or Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id=966> However, it is almost complete agreement that science is a special place. The United States are in this respect, however, to give an example for the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=967> Appointments in the area of science should be based on objective criteria such as education, skills and performance.</seg>
<seg id=968> Of course, it is legitimate to ask a future American health for his opinion on abortion.</seg>
<seg id=969> But it is totally inappropriate to scientific beraterstäbe members of a test of their political loyalty.</seg>
<seg id=970> Similarly, the membership in peer-review-gremien - should be a central body for scientific progress, totally free of beitrittshindernissen that are not with scientific qualifications.</seg>
<seg id=971> Unfortunately, scientists in the US are faced with ever more obstacles of this kind.</seg>
<seg id=972> Last autumn the Journal science published several articles on this issue.</seg>
<seg id=973> In one of these contributions, there was a complete reorganisation of an American National Centre for health and the environment, a unterabteilung of the centre for disease control and prevention and prevention (CDC), without prior consultation with the head of the institution.</seg>
<seg id=974> Similar cases involved the Advisory Council of the CDC to bleivergiftungen and prevention, and the advisory committee on human bioethikkommissionen national research and protections advisory committee on genetic testing.</seg>
<seg id=975> At the moment, the foot-and-mouth epidemic political influence in the wake beratergremien will be filled completely new and subject to a loyalitätstest candidates for some observers, seems to be an old hat.</seg>
<seg id=976> The US Department of officials call it the "common practice."</seg>
<seg id=977> Now, it is not common practice in America - at least it was not.</seg>
<seg id=978> In any case, not really worrying that the Bush administration is considering candidates on its compatibility with their "values".</seg>
<seg id=979> The most worrying aspect of this development, as this profound ideological examination in areas that were immune to this kind of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id=980> Perhaps the most glaring example of the disease spreading political influence was the reorganisation of the American Institute for Health, which was concerned with the financing of studies on breaches in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=981> Beratergremien suffered in the past may sometimes this type of influence.</seg>
<seg id=982> After all, they recommend strategies to implement the politicians or not.</seg>
<seg id=983> But for studienfinanzierung competent bodies?</seg>
<seg id=984> In October 2002, a leader David michaels of science and some of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id=985> It was part of the former high-level officials, some of these bodies. On the basis of their personal experience they provided valuable information on this issue.</seg>
<seg id=986> Their contribution was a history, but what has followed, was interesting.</seg>
<seg id=987> There was a flood of letters, where scientists reported by similar experience.</seg>
<seg id=988> A candidate for the export of the American research institutes of health from muscular dystrophy told, as it has been examined by a Member of the White House.</seg>
<seg id=989> Having made on their opinion on various strategies of the Bush administration, the fact of not had something to do with the work of the Committee, it has been asked if they support the President's policies on embryonic stem cells.</seg>
<seg id=990> Another sender, a respected professor of psychiatry and psychology reported by a telephone call from the White House in which we him on his nomination for the American National Council against drug abuse.</seg>
<seg id=991> The number stated that he should it a review, "to ascertain whether he any views represent the for the President would be unfortunate."</seg>
<seg id=992> According to the remarks of Professor and the officials of the White House, a punktestand him constantly raised a number of questions.</seg>
<seg id=993> One example: "they now have two of three points. The President is without taking into account the consequences for moral reasons for nadelaustauschprogramme dependent intravenös consumption of drugs."</seg>
<seg id=994> The survey was a unerfreulichere.</seg>
<seg id=995> The officials asked the candidates, Bush whether he would have chosen. He told that this was not the case, to put it: "why they did not support the President?"</seg>
<seg id=996> This is in line with the procedure in dictatorships and not in democracies.</seg>
<seg id=997> Scientific beratergremien are there to make balanced and thoughtful consideration for the policy.</seg>
<seg id=998> If the desired result is political in the first place, we have won, but not lost.</seg>
<seg id=999> For this reason, the decision to support projects, which are a matter of objective assessment was challenge and not by politicians.</seg>
<seg id=1000> Indeed, this is crucial in this respect American law - the federal advisory committee act - that bodies must be balanced composition and "not unduly influenced by the interim authority."</seg>
<seg id=1001> The American health Tommy Thompson and devoted to the White House for the rest of the world should set an example.</seg>
<seg id=1002> It is very simple: by applying the law.</seg>
<seg id=1003> Murder in Moscow</seg>
<seg id=1004> It is time to give up the illusion that the Postcommunist Russia would have been by Vladimir Putin's "dictatorship of law" less unlawfully.</seg>
<seg id=1005> The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of the most courageous and Russia's best journalists, a woman who dared to bring the brutal killings of Russian troops in Chechnya to the public that the final proof that President Putin has not established more than an ordinary dictatorship, with all the usual disregard for the law.</seg>
<seg id=1006> This recognition is in time for the world, especially for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1007> The German Foreign Minister is working on a strategy for the russisch-deutschen relations, in which the indifference to Putin's lawlessness is as the national interest of the most powerful Member of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1008> This indifference to appeasement, if you will, however, Putin encouraged to move its lawless methods on the international stage, as at present, in his campaign, Georgia to ruin.</seg>
<seg id=1009> The murder of Politkovskaya has triggered a unheimliches déjà vu: as was the time when the KGB, at the height of its power, Putin's Russia people disappear.</seg>
<seg id=1010> The killing politkowskajas is the third political murder measures within three weeks.</seg>
<seg id=1011> Enwer siganschin chefingenieur BP, Russia, was shot on 30 September in Irkutsk.</seg>
<seg id=1012> Andrei Kozlov, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Russia, a campaign against fraud, was murdered on 14 September.</seg>
<seg id=1013> The fact that the Russian Public Prosecutor Yuri tschajka kozlow investigations, as in the case of the murder of Politkovskaya, there is no reason to great hopes in real democracies, as this would be the case if high representative justizkreise be added.</seg>
<seg id=1014> Indeed, the involvement of the highest Russian Government is almost a guarantee that the murderers are taken.</seg>
<seg id=1015> The murder of Mrs Politkovskaya is a particularly grim omen, given that it is one of the most powerful kritikerinnen was the Russian President.</seg>
<seg id=1016> In its articles one of the last independent newspapers in Moscow, novaya gazeta, and in its books "in Putin's Russia and Chechnya. '" for the truth about the war Politkovskaya, "wrote about the collapse of freedom, which has become a characteristic feature of Putin's Presidency.</seg>
<seg id=1017> Both the expulsion of the former medienzaren Boris beresowsky and Vladimir Gusinsky's arrest and show the tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, which is Putin's enemies, exile, or the grave.</seg>
<seg id=1018> I do not accuse Putin's government to have killed on a auftragsmörder Politkovskaya.</seg>
<seg id=1019> As enthüllungsjournalistin Politkovskaya, not only in Putin, but also in many other unpopular has made, not least in the current Prime Minister ramsan Chechen leader Kadyrov, the accused them to pursue a policy of kidnappings for ransom.</seg>
<seg id=1020> But even if Vladimir Putin's people with the murder of Politkovskaya have to do so in the lift their gates centre in Moscow, Putin's contempt for the laws created the atmosphere in which this murder.</seg>
<seg id=1021> As well as the murder of Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Beckett in the cathedral many centuries ago the crime was committed clear in the belief that it would please the king.</seg>
<seg id=1022> In view of what Politkovskaya -- was to call into question the responsibility of a democratic press, the Kremlin and his policy -- the government would ensure that the journalist zustößt nothing evil.</seg>
<seg id=1023> Putin's Russia has lost over the last six years ago by 12 leading journalists murder.</seg>
<seg id=1024> None of these crimes has been investigated. It would be different if Putin's "dictatorship of law" would be more than a public relations strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1025> The six years since Vladimir Putin's Kremlin were deeply in a time of conflicting signals.</seg>
<seg id=1026> On the one hand, the world is looking at a young, well-educated Head of State, which promises to modernize Russia and the country, especially in terms of gesetzesvollstreckung and legal practice to international standards.</seg>
<seg id=1027> On the other hand, the President is silent if its former colleagues in the Russian security FSB (the former KGB) the offer life and limb threatened safety and a number of well-known spionagefälle against journalists, scientists and environmentalists put.</seg>
<seg id=1028> These "neo-spionen" of the journalist Grigory Pasko, waffenkontrollexperte Igor sutjagin, the diplomat moisejew Valentin, the physicist Valentin danilow and others.</seg>
<seg id=1029> The supposed civilizing influence the role of the West of Russia as a partner -- as his presidency at the G-8 summit in St. Petersburg, for example -- seems to have any effect kreml-kabale in Mr Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1030> The confrontation with Western values has promoted a Potemkin village. Russia presented a facade of laws and democratic institutions, behind this backdrop, however, are in the same rohlinge arbitrary manner.</seg>
<seg id=1031> The threat to the world is that Putin's lawlessness.</seg>
<seg id=1032> In the entire Middle abroad a form kriminalisierter diplomacy is gaining ground.</seg>
<seg id=1033> We see in this respect, Putin's attempt to manipulate the presidential election in Ukraine or have withdrawn regularly and criminal charges against the opposition leader yuliya Tymoshenko.</seg>
<seg id=1034> Think of the situation in the breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia, therefore, it can only be because the Kremlin supported that.</seg>
<seg id=1035> Consider, as the Kremlin attempts to blackmail its neighbors, he threatened by its energy supply.</seg>
<seg id=1036> Everyone knows that criminal police are becoming more boldly if criminal behavior is ignored.</seg>
<seg id=1037> It is high time that the world is that Vladimir Putin recognizes as what it is, a man of Russia in the darkness.</seg>
<seg id=1038> The world must remember the old Latin principle qui tacet consentire videtur -- remains silent, who seems to agree -- and it must ask itself whether it makes sense to tolerate the creation of a lawless energiesupermacht Putin by in silence.</seg>
<seg id=1039> The Russian empire pipeline</seg>
<seg id=1040> Gerhard Schroeder was less than a month ago German Chancellor has agreed to be aufsichtsratsvorsitzender of the company that is building a gas-pipeline by the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany and by Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1041> In many countries would Schroeder now because of a conflict of interests.</seg>
<seg id=1042> Its obvious moral sense is reinforced by the fact that Russia is at this very moment, the gas supplies to Ukraine, if the country of the preisforderungen state gas giant Gazprom, the Kremlin's.</seg>
<seg id=1043> Russia's strategic mandate is obvious: the supplies of gas supplies to Ukraine also means of Europe, largely because some of the largest European gas pipelines by the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id=1044> In Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic States will, of course, the new pipeline the Kremlin is even greater influence, while this is trying to maintain regional.</seg>
<seg id=1045> President Vladimir Putin and his government in the former KGB cronies must decide how hard it exclude Russia's Postcommunist neighbors, not worry more about Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1046> Indeed, Putin Europe should provide this new imperial weapon?</seg>
<seg id=1047> Worse still, Russia could possibly this weapon against a focus on energy are EU?</seg>
<seg id=1048> That lead to a German ex-kanzler the company that Russia could be a means to manipulate the economy of Europe is dangerous indifference, Putin's neoimperialistischer ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1049> There is no doubt that Russia's media on the European growing dependence on Russian energy.</seg>
<seg id=1050> They even revel: having unified our Community and Russian gas leader writer letter, Europe is to human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1051> In Putin this attitude is mediated by his commitment to pursue a policy of "independent".</seg>
<seg id=1052> He understands that Russia, including the moral and human rights concerns of Western democracies' is to be independent. "</seg>
<seg id=1053> Perhaps some European leaders believe that the maintenance of the cozy prosperity of the Union to justify our human rights and other issues, which are the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1054> Of course, we can, in short, to be "business" Affairs relate to adopt positions, such as the expropriation of YUKOS, but if the Kremlin our values such criticism of Russian -- or bad example in Chechnya with blood-stained -- the Europeans, seem willing to keep their mouths shut than higher energy prices, or even a blockade, such as the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id=1055> During Putin umbildet his court and the Duma, his desire to the hopes of the EU should be abandoned a growing "Europeanisation 'Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1056> Russia is that Putin, in the post-Soviet hopes for freedom in an oil and gasbollwerk be converted new model of the former kgb-elite.</seg>
<seg id=1057> In fact, the Director-General of the pipeline-konsortiums Matthias warnig, chairing the Schröder is an old friend of Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1058> In the Wall Street Journal has been reported in this year, and that the warnig, the Russian branch of the Dresdner Bank officer was the Stasi, Germany, and the secret police, Putin has learned in the late 1980, when the Russian President in East Germany was stationed as kgb-spion.</seg>
<seg id=1059> The Russians are a government of former kgb-mitarbeitern, the lack of sympathy and intolerance towards dissent for the standard reflects its exhaustion of commotion in the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=1060> Now the Kremlin seems to think that what is good for ordinary Russians for independent nations is good: small and weak countries not demonstrated, once Russia is the tools to intimidate them to isolate and to threaten them with the prospect of a energiesperre.</seg>
<seg id=1061> As a former head of the newly independent Lithuania, I have received such threats often.</seg>
<seg id=1062> The EU has signed a number of agreements with Russia, including one for a common area of freedom and justice. "</seg>
<seg id=1063> The Kremlin is very well, such a idealism.</seg>
<seg id=1064> Its control of Eastern Europe was always made on the basis of "freundschaftsverträgen", and the Soviet invasion in 1956, Hungary and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were "brotherly 'operations.</seg>
<seg id=1065> But in abused Putin, like this: "common" barbarous treatment of the Chechens, the businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky in prison, foreign NGOs, one of the mitanführerinnen the Orange Revolution of last year, yuliya Tymoshenko, accused of Russian militärstaatsanwälten for invented.</seg>
<seg id=1066> If Europeans take their common area of human rights and freedoms seriously, it must recognize that these values are not shared by the berechnenden pöstcheninhabern in Putin's Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1067> The same is true if Russia is seen as an ally in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=1068> It is conceivable that the country of the "red terror" with countless unpunished crime from the Soviet era, which is trail of blood in its wake of Lithuania to help in the Caucasus, reliable, Iran and North Korea from threatening the world?</seg>
<seg id=1069> It is likely that the heads of the Kremlin's only kalkulierenden will exploit every crisis as an opportunity to increase its destructive power and influence.</seg>
<seg id=1070> For decades, my European region was at the mercy of evil.</seg>
<seg id=1071> I can therefore not taking place, while Europe blindly in a new hineinstolpert appeasement.</seg>
<seg id=1072> We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe were taught by our heritage that Russia's imperial ambitions hiding behind every diplomatic action.</seg>
<seg id=1073> Western Europe was spared the heritage should listen to our warnings.</seg>
<seg id=1074> The dependence on Russia, even if it is now in the face of the so-called "charismatic" Gerhard Schroeder, will only into the abyss.</seg>
<seg id=1075> Bullets and elections in Iraq</seg>
<seg id=1076> As the war in Iraq began in 2003, the Bush administration had very ambitious plans for, as in Germany and Japan after 1945 was a long and peaceful occupation, while expanding oil production should ensure a growing prosperity and democratic structures were bit by bit.</seg>
<seg id=1077> Should be the basis of a liberal, even post-modern constitution, women 25% of the seats in Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1078> In Iraq today there is no peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1079> The Constitution, which will be voted on 15 October, the 25% rule, but it is far from liberal.</seg>
<seg id=1080> The schlüsselbestimmung (Article 2) that "No law can contradict the undisputed rules of Islam," goes against the principle of parliamentary sovereignty and prevent the legislation to meet international standards.</seg>
<seg id=1081> For example, the age of sexual emancipation in girls cannot be put to more than nine years because Mohammed even had a nine years old.</seg>
<seg id=1082> It follows that, after nine years of girls are also emerge as criminal law and subject to the death penalty, for example, a different religion for the transgression.</seg>
<seg id=1083> In the broader context, the Shia their ayatollahs through this provision as in Iran on the elected Parliament, because this alone have the right to determine the rules of Islam. "</seg>
<seg id=1084> Outsiders and the few Iraqi liberal are mainly on this Islamic provision, but the widespread Sunni resistance to the Constitution is directed against other provisions: the exclusion of the "saddamistischen Baath Party 'from the political life and from the government and the federalist provisions that would allow the Iraqi 18 provinces autonomy and allow them to join together to regional governments.</seg>
<seg id=1085> The ausschlussregel is a personal matter for the Sunni elite -- including thousands of businessmen, experts, artists and even with a few exceptions, because they were all baath-mitglieder.</seg>
<seg id=1086> In theory, the ban could be interpreted in the Constitution that it only applies to the future.</seg>
<seg id=1087> But in practice the regulations are applied at present that so-called 'high level' baath-mitglieder are excluded from any government, and thousands are affected.</seg>
<seg id=1088> The Sunnis would accept the federalist provisions, if they gälten only for the Kurds.</seg>
<seg id=1089> They know that the alternative is not a return to the centralism, but the secession of the three predominantly Kurdish provinces, dahuk Arbil and as sulaymaniyah, an independent Kurdistan treasury, with its own army (the peschmerga) and order, with the second largest Kirkuk oil reserves in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=1090> The Sunnis reject the same federalism for the Shia, because they regard it as relatives Arabs, who have accepted the Sunni domination in the past and will continue to do so, unless they have their own government.</seg>
<seg id=1091> This would enable the new Constitution, because the provinces with Shiite majority in the South, which have the largest part of the Iraqi oil reserves, their own regional government.</seg>
<seg id=1092> In the usual nahost-stil disappointed sunnitenführer who are dissatisfied with the Constitution, the threat of violence.</seg>
<seg id=1093> But not the federalism is the reason why Sunni extremists and Islamists who lethal attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1094> It is fundamental: they do not accept the principle of a democratic mehrheitsregierung.</seg>
<seg id=1095> Instead, they want to restore the rule by the Sunni minority.</seg>
<seg id=1096> For the Islamists deserve all the Shiites in death, as well as apostates.</seg>
<seg id=1097> A Shi'ite leader muqtada Sadr, are also vehemently opposed to the federalism.</seg>
<seg id=1098> His supporters are largely uneducated, the poorest and most violent Shia from the shanty-towns of Baghdad and environment, whose "mahdi-milizen weiterkämpften" 2004, even against the American troops, as the Americans protected Sunni, Shia attackers.</seg>
<seg id=1099> As the very young priest, deriving its authority of his late ayatollah-vater -- even a populist -- is despise Sadr living in the face of opposition from the ayatollahs of Iraq, the his ignorance and brutality.</seg>
<seg id=1100> With regard to the religious authority, Sadr can make it impossible to them, so it is a arabisch-nationalistische stance against them and often reminded that the highest Shiite cleric Ayatollah, is sistani, Persians, and no Arabs.</seg>
<seg id=1101> It calls his supporters in the same way that the El hakims for the Supreme Council were the Islamic revolution in Iraq (sciri), and "their" badr-milizen subsidized exiles in Iran, many of which in the long and difficult Iran-Iraq war fought for Iran, the Americans have returned to "them".</seg>
<seg id=1102> Sadr is against the federalism, because a regional Shia government obey its enemies and the sciri and sistani, he says, indeed, Iranian influence.</seg>
<seg id=1103> To emphasize its message Sadr gave his men to attack the badr-milizen what he was in Baghdad, where the mahdi's return, have succeeded in Najaf, where Sadr is scorned the destruction caused last year, he was a success, but his men from the Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1104> It was bad enough to be with Sadr as bandits, but now a simple political account is that it will probably be the central figure for the outcome of the elections to the Constitution in October.</seg>
<seg id=1105> Rejecting the Constitution and to impose new elections for a national assembly opponents need a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces.</seg>
<seg id=1106> The Sunnis likely to win in only two provinces, but if Sadr his supporters in the slums in charge of Baghdad, together with the local Sunni vote "no", would probably the capital of the Constitution, which guarantee the rejection of the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=1107> As a political crook Sadr is, of course, prepared to be bought.</seg>
<seg id=1108> Last year it was looking for murder.</seg>
<seg id=1109> Now he wants to be recognised as a statesman, money, and at least implicitly, the humiliation sistanis and the sciri.</seg>
<seg id=1110> He will probably be available, perhaps the bargaining has already begun.</seg>
<seg id=1111> But some Shia, which he with words and bullets, thousands of armed and believe that should be offered only bullets.</seg>
<seg id=1112> The decline of secret police</seg>
<seg id=1113> As Prime Minister Ferenc gyurcsany Hungary had to say, as a aufgezeichnetes acknowledgement that his government led to log riots in new democracies of Eastern Europe, is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id=1114> Just as Hungary, Romania has made communism to increase transparency and honesty in the verschlossensten societies in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1115> While we have been closed, the continued to a sudden extension of corruption and abuse of power.</seg>
<seg id=1116> But it has finally been -- a real move towards greater openness. This progress has been recognised by the European Union, as Romania's accession to the European Union for the beginning of 2007.</seg>
<seg id=1117> In addition to achieve what the EU has for a functioning market economy ", there are important legal and political changes, I as a Minister for Justice and the monitoring of the different sectors include such as increased transparency and control in the formation of political parties, or the complete reversal of the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id=1118> Reforms are to eradicate corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1119> Former and current cabinet ministers, members of Parliament, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police, customs and other employees of the directors of private and public service has.</seg>
<seg id=1120> It has also introduced new standardised forms, on which each State of an official position in the government, in Parliament, in the public or local administration and the judicial system, and its financial interests.</seg>
<seg id=1121> The new explanations are the most detailed in Europe, and above all they can be published.</seg>
<seg id=1122> Romania's progress in this month, published a report shows that citizens' access to public information in Eastern Europe is now as well as in long-established democracies.</seg>
<seg id=1123> Indeed, the report is transparency and silence) (transparency and silence, which the open society justice initiative (rechtsinitiative for an open society, drafted www.justiceinitiative.org), that the new democracies can provide the old, in some cases, certain public authorities were in Romania, a rather than comparable to requests for information of the public authorities in France or Spain.</seg>
<seg id=1124> Particularly in Romania, 60% of the archivierten questions have been answered, compared with 31% in France and 24% in Spain.</seg>
<seg id=1125> Among the other countries that performed well and Mexico, Peru, were adopted in 2002, both in Romania, legislation on the obligation of public institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1126> But it is not in übergangsdemokratien always easier to obtain sensitive information, as I know from my previous work as menschenrechtsanwältin the Romanian Helsinki Committee.</seg>
<seg id=1127> Often we had to go to court in order to force on Romania's freedom of information act of 2001, the publication of information.</seg>
<seg id=1128> Even if we had won, for example, a case in which access to the record abgehörter telephone calls, which were approved by the public prosecutor, the Court.</seg>
<seg id=1129> We did a civil against the prosecutor and judge a fine imposed on every day, the information was withheld.</seg>
<seg id=1130> Only when we had the attention of the media, we received the data -- which, as in many lauschangriffe had been approved in the last ten years, against whom were and how long.</seg>
<seg id=1131> With the publication Romania has begun to distance itself from its securitate-beherrschten past.</seg>
<seg id=1132> Now that I am even in the government, I know that it is sometimes difficult to share information with the public.</seg>
<seg id=1133> But if painful reforms are necessary, there is no alternative.</seg>
<seg id=1134> We would not have had the economic and political reforms that can not qualify for membership, if we do not have the subject to the supervision of public policy, public participation in decision-making, with this openness, accepted.</seg>
<seg id=1135> This is an indispensable condition to become democratic governments throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id=1136> As the United States decided to 1966 their law on public services, they were in the exclusive society Sweden and Finland.</seg>
<seg id=1137> Today, 65 countries have such a law.</seg>
<seg id=1138> In Romania, those who have fought for freedom of information, a law to have this.</seg>
<seg id=1139> As part of the study of justice initiative, requests for information to the Romanian Government has issued publication and information which would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id=1140> The Romanian Defense published, for example, the number of troops, 2003, the causes of death, and whose (including 13 suicides, two shootings and two deaths in Afghanistan).</seg>
<seg id=1141> Similarly, the Court of Bucharest asked about the number of judges, who had received since the beginning of 2000, penalties, including the reasons for any sanctions imposed.</seg>
<seg id=1142> The Court handed over the question of the Supreme richterrat, provided a full answer: a list of four pages sanctioned judges, with all the details of the reasons and penalties.</seg>
<seg id=1143> This is both a product of the continuing reform as a driving force for this.</seg>
<seg id=1144> It was not always convenient for the government, and still is a game of confidential documents.</seg>
<seg id=1145> However, the benefits of the transparency in the former Eastern bloc cannot be denied.</seg>
<seg id=1146> At the same time, Romania's experience shows that the confidentiality of the authorities is still a threat to the very values and democratic regimes that can prevent in both established and young democracies only permanent vigilance that this secrecy likes.</seg>
<seg id=1147> Saving the lebensbäume</seg>
<seg id=1148> No one is by the day without using a product comes from a forest.</seg>
<seg id=1149> In much more than most people, the paper on which we, the water flows from the remark, the drugs, the cure the wood from the US, we are building our houses and furniture and from the forest.</seg>
<seg id=1150> Forests provide us with the fresh air that we breathe, and provide habitats for endangered species.</seg>
<seg id=1151> They also offer us the opportunities in our complex world.</seg>
<seg id=1152> The poorer 1.5 billion people around the world are directly dependent on forests to meet their basic needs for food and firewood.</seg>
<seg id=1153> Nevertheless, the deforestation is continuing.</seg>
<seg id=1154> Every year we 14.6 million hectares of forest -- an area that is approximately four times the size of Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id=1155> Irresponsible forest management, strengthened by state lax rules and enforcement, and markets, illegal logging, abandoning its most of the world together and most vulnerable forests.</seg>
<seg id=1156> As soon as forests to disappear, usually do a lot of environmental, social and economic problems that affect all of us in various ways.</seg>
<seg id=1157> The Indonesian island Sumatra is a good example of this.</seg>
<seg id=1158> Zellstoff- and papierunternehmen is currently unbridled and illegal destruction of forests, which pflanzenvielfalt the richest in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1159> It is likely that not discovered plants and vulnerable species such as the sumatranashorn, the sumatra-elefant or the orang-utan to disappear.</seg>
<seg id=1160> If the forests sumatras disappear, the people will find themselves from the whole communities without a proper housing and without a decent livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id=1161> Moreover, from the distortion of global markets by the trade in illegally and disadvantages produce cheap products for responsible companies.</seg>
<seg id=1162> Illegal logging annually by developing countries are lost income of $15 billion.</seg>
<seg id=1163> The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the increased demand for wood for reconstruction following the tsunami last year, the requirements already indefensible sumatras forests.</seg>
<seg id=1164> Similar threats to the amazonas- forests and Congo Basin.</seg>
<seg id=1165> The recent millennium-ökosystemstudie (the United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, ma) shows that forests in these and other regions are critical for serious and disappearance of mismanagement, if not serious measures to be taken.</seg>
<seg id=1166> Information from the Brazilian Government shows that the deforestation of an irreplaceable amazonaswälder (that is, among other things, by the transformation in agricultural land) for the last year to 2.6 million hectares, which will increase the total entwaldete the Amazon to 17%.</seg>
<seg id=1167> But the fight against deforestation is not lost.</seg>
<seg id=1168> Various organisations, environmentalists and societies that are concerned about the state of the forests around the world are currently close to reverse the deforestation and to improve the forest management.</seg>
<seg id=1169> For example, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the World Bank have supported Brazil's Government to launch an initiative, has on 17 million hectares of new protected forests in parks.</seg>
<seg id=1170> The alliance of WWF and World Bank has expressed its partners to set up a trust fund to manage this protected areas.</seg>
<seg id=1171> Similarly, the result of a summit between the leaders of the countries in the Congo Basin an extraordinary, cross-border cooperation for waldschutz and good management.</seg>
<seg id=1172> This led to an initiative of the Foreign Ministry of the United States in support of the waldschutzes in the Congo, with a budget of $53 million.</seg>
<seg id=1173> Since the first meeting of the leaders of 1999 3.5 million hectares were in the Congo Basin created new areas of outstanding natural beauty.</seg>
<seg id=1174> In view of the effects of the tsunami in Asia last December and in view of the importance of the data provided by the ma and the entwaldungsstatistiken from the main forest areas, our efforts must be continued.</seg>
<seg id=1175> The World Bank and the WWF insured recently that they will work together to reduce global entwaldungsrate 10% by 2010, and that they will work with other public and private institutions to implement the waldschutz ambitious objectives.</seg>
<seg id=1176> Wwf-studien show that we cover world consumption needs to waldprodukten and at the same time, important environmental and social values can remain in the foreseeable future, if the global forest resources allocated uses and various types, including reserves, commercial and responsibly managed nutzwäldern aufgeforsteten waldlandschaften.</seg>
<seg id=1177> Big businessmen, governments and NGOs must play their role in the implementation of this vision.</seg>
<seg id=1178> The Saudis fanatics are?</seg>
<seg id=1179> Terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have not only led to the opportunities of the al-saud royal family weiterbestandes of question, but also raised the question of whether it is the Kingdom of a fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive state.</seg>
<seg id=1180> It appears that the Saudi society had a wave of violent extremism, which draws its inspiration from the extreme religious orthodoxy.</seg>
<seg id=1181> The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers was the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States in Saudi Arabia, the long cherished strengthened, the UK would be a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.</seg>
<seg id=1182> In many ways, this is true, but it is not at the public at large in Saudi Arabia be transferred.</seg>
<seg id=1183> On the contrary, it would be a serious mistake to think that the attitude of the Saudis was determined to the religion of Islam fanatical entirely.</seg>
<seg id=1184> Between 2001 and 2003, a team, I was launched in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt and Jordan in a major wertestudie.</seg>
<seg id=1185> Our results show a surprising nuanciertes picture of the werthaltungen in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=1186> Compared to the people polled in the Middle East in general, saudi-araber were less religious and their attitudes to issues such as democracy and arranged marriages reveal a moderate tone.</seg>
<seg id=1187> Of course, the religion is enshrined in all four countries. Over 90% of the respondents said that they believe in God, to a life after the death and heaven and hell.</seg>
<seg id=1188> However, the Saudis appear to be less than the religious Muslims in other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1189> In comparison with 82% of the Iranians, 85% of Jordanians and 98% of the Egyptians only 62% of the Saudis to describe as religious.</seg>
<seg id=1190> The Americans seem to be far religious than in America. Saudi-araber declare itself as a religious 81%.</seg>
<seg id=1191> Some of these derogations may be due to differences in country-specific religiosity is defined.</seg>
<seg id=1192> Americans may not be as, for example, religious people from the Middle East, and Americans have perhaps a weaker commitment to their faith as people in Islamic countries.</seg>
<seg id=1193> In part, this could also differences between the Muslim countries.</seg>
<seg id=1194> However, the gap is on the selbst-definierten religiosity between the Saudis, on the one hand, and the Iranians Jordanians Egyptians, and on the other hand, is so great that you wanted to the prevailing idea of Saudi Arabia as highly conservative and religious society.</seg>
<seg id=1195> Indeed, the practice is more than mere words: only 28% of the Saudis were to take part in weekly mosque worships while 27% of the Iranians, 44% of Jordanians, 42% of the Egyptians and 45% of Americans known.</seg>
<seg id=1196> Although these results with the traditional concept of the Saudi culture, they are less surprising as it seems.</seg>
<seg id=1197> Religionssoziologen have argued for a long time that the general religiosity, if the environment is strong religious or religious institutions are strongly linked to the state.</seg>
<seg id=1198> If state authorities impose strict rules of engagement, people to rebellion and alienation of officially sanctioned religious institutions involved.</seg>
<seg id=1199> So it is no surprise that Egyptians and Jordanians living in countries without state's piety, religious are as Iranians, or saudi-araber living with a "tugendpolizei supported by the State".</seg>
<seg id=1200> Even before the issue had many Saudis surprising Liberal views.</seg>
<seg id=1201> On the question of arranged marriages an almost balanced distribution. Half was of the opinion that should be closed before the agreement among parents, while 48%, as the basis for a privileged before.</seg>
<seg id=1202> In view of the deep inequality and the dominance of the Patriarchate this outcome seems to show a strong need for more individual freedom of choice in decisions that are the responsibility of the traditional family.</seg>
<seg id=1203> Finally, the Saudis proved to be a strong advocate of democracy, which is contrary to the general idea of the Saudi conservatism.</seg>
<seg id=1204> For 58% of respondents Saudis democracy is the best form of government, 23% were not this view, and 18% have not.</seg>
<seg id=1205> That is a country in which there is no secular and nationalist tradition, a majority for democracy, seems illogical.</seg>
<seg id=1206> Indeed, the support of democracy with a number of other liberal attitudes we found in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=1207> Advocates of democracy tend to less religiosity, more secularism more tolerance, a critical assessment of the Community and to greater concern about the Western kulturinvasion.</seg>
<seg id=1208> Beyond the surveys that liberal ideas will gain popularity, if a country governed by a despotic monarch and the religious establishment has emerged in the course of history.</seg>
<seg id=1209> A strong liberal trend developed in the late 19th century in the Ottoman Syria as a response to the religious despotism of Sultan abdulhamid.</seg>
<seg id=1210> At the same time, a antiklerikale secular movement, on behalf of the constitutionalism, in response to the absolutist alliance between the Shah of kadscharen-dynastie and the religious establishment unfolded in Iran.</seg>
<seg id=1211> In view of this agreement between historical precedents and the current situation in Saudi Arabia, we should not rule out the possibility of reform.</seg>
<seg id=1212> Today umfragedaten also show that the Saudis can begin to want more transparency in the policy and a less interventionist religion.</seg>
<seg id=1213> Museum Europe</seg>
<seg id=1214> In the late 19th century Europe, Asia predominantly either as a source of inspiration for its artists or focus its imperial ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1215> The Asians, on the other hand, either in Europe, as in Japan, during the meiji-zeit as a model of modernity and in China as a barometer of the decline.</seg>
<seg id=1216> A century later, the Japanese economic miracle was transformed the image of Europeans of at least a small part of Asia to a place technological and industrial progress.</seg>
<seg id=1217> Right now, in the early years of the 21st century, are thriving change the way in Asia, Europe and Asia are perceived in Europe, Asia. Economies, while the European Union is going through a deep identity and zuversichtskrise.</seg>
<seg id=1218> Prominent Asians, such as the former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, warn the Europeans that -- they should retain its present course -- Europe is rapidly becoming in all areas in tourism and real estate irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id=1219> A well-known Chinese businessman dividing the time between Hong Kong and London, was even more.</seg>
<seg id=1220> At a meeting of private entrepreneurs and politicians in Paris, a few weeks ago, he said: "you Europeans developed into a other third world country spends its time with the false your topics -- constitution, welfare state, pensions crisis -- and systematically give the wrong answer to the questions aufwerft it."</seg>
<seg id=1221> Europe's views on Asia in general and China in particular are complex and rich by a clear adaptation to a new and respected competitors to purely ideological justified.</seg>
<seg id=1222> As the students took to the streets in May 1968 in France to invent a new world, they dreamt (or at least some of them) by the Maoist China -- a China, which was in the midst of the brutal and pointless cultural revolution.</seg>
<seg id=1223> Their absurd and Baroque anmutende betörtheit was also a product of their ignorance of the crimes of Mao as the result of boredom within a prosperous society, in which unemployment was practically unknown.</seg>
<seg id=1224> By contrast, their heirs open today criticise the Asian capitalist model.</seg>
<seg id=1225> Yesterday, China was an anti-capitalist lodestar for utopian revolutionary; today, it has become an ultra-liberal nemesis for a new generation of utopian reactionary -- the defenders of the status quo in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1226> The recently in the streets of Paris demonstrating students do not want to be as the Chinese and the Indians; they reject the logic of globalization and refuse to give up their hard-won social guarantees.</seg>
<seg id=1227> Europe wirtschaftseliten China and India are very different.</seg>
<seg id=1228> They are now fully aware that their easy nostalgic post-colonial view of these countries as a major export markets and comprehensive reservoirs of cheap labour has been overtaken by events.</seg>
<seg id=1229> China and inden are become real competitors that respect, if not sheer reverence.</seg>
<seg id=1230> Quality, costs and lead times in automobiles, for example, are rich at the European level.</seg>
<seg id=1231> Europe has received an advantage in terms of theoretical sciences, for example in the pharmaceutical industry, but weltklasseunternehmen are emerging in India increasingly able to recruit or Harvard and graduates of people to maintain its lower labour costs and their global competitiveness.</seg>
<seg id=1232> Unfortunately, the political leaders of Europe have recognised the from Asia's challenge, failed to take this up as a realitätstest within the process of globalisation and -- in social and economic terms -- waffenruf.</seg>
<seg id=1233> Indeed, we can say in a balanced view that the European politicians have, apart from a few exceptions, such as Tony Blair, adjusted their vision of the world revolutionary to slow the pace of change in Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1234> Caught between their lack of a long-term strategic vision and their fixation on short-term interests, Europe's political leaders, have failed to win the respect its Asian colleagues -- contrary to the European companies which are in the Asians much respected.</seg>
<seg id=1235> Of course, the EU in Asia -- a continent that has failed to bury its past, and to the ghosts of nationalism, the door is often regarded as a model of reconciliation, peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1236> But this perception will survive if Europe's economic performance declines further?</seg>
<seg id=1237> Perhaps the Asians, then the European model as a kind of political venedigs -- to a place that we visited nostalgic for his previous Glorie and the less we admired museumsartigen because of its nature.</seg>
<seg id=1238> The red and the blue</seg>
<seg id=1239> The replacement as US Secretary of State Colin withdrawal by Condoleezza Rice shows that America's last presidential election continues to produce strong echoes.</seg>
<seg id=1240> But it is not only important for Americans, and this election on America, but also for the world.</seg>
<seg id=1241> This year's presidential election demonstrates that America has a healthy democracy, but something that could be better.</seg>
<seg id=1242> In contrast to the election of 2000, President Bush failed and the majority vote won a victory in the electoral college, this time with a margin of EUR 3.5 million votes.</seg>
<seg id=1243> Although some democrats are still embittered, there are few serious doubts about the legitimacy of Bush's victory.</seg>
<seg id=1244> America) remains divided in red States (Republicans) and blue States (democrats.</seg>
<seg id=1245> If) 100,000 votes in the red Ohio State changed, John Kerry President would be (albeit with a minority of the popular vote.</seg>
<seg id=1246> The electoral college was included in America's constitution, in order to protect small States in a federal system, it is now, however, that the election campaign focuses mainly on around a dozen States disputed territory in which public opinion is divided.</seg>
<seg id=1247> A fundamental problem is that it is inappropriate to elect the President without a majority of votes.</seg>
<seg id=1248> So it is time for a serious discussion on a change to the abolition of the electoral college should.</seg>
<seg id=1249> Some observers also complain about the polarisierende negative rhetoric and advertising yourself used the campaign.</seg>
<seg id=1250> But this should be seen from a historical perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1251> At the time of the founding fathers were extremely biased newspapers, George Washington and was struck by the anti-immigrant political language.</seg>
<seg id=1252> In its early history has divided the country for a long time in just opportunistic majorities, as now, the rhetoric of a vigorous campaign was closely competition -- without, at the time of the civil war and reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=1253> At the same time, the three broadcast nationwide discussions languages, despite the negative wahlwerbung on both sides in a serious and important points format persecuted in large.</seg>
<seg id=1254> In general, it is likely that a President-in-Office being re-elected in growing economy.</seg>
<seg id=1255> In this sense, Bush's reelection surprised at how little its majority.</seg>
<seg id=1256> This is largely due to the unpopularity of the Iraq war.</seg>
<seg id=1257> Kerry tried to make the war, the slow pace of job creation, the lack of health care and Bush's tax cuts for groups with higher incomes of the key points of the election campaign, but some observers have had the feeling that arose from a clear message.</seg>
<seg id=1258> Bush konterte with safety in relation to terrorism and kulturpopulismus on issues such as homo-ehe and abtreibungsrecht.</seg>
<seg id=1259> At the end of security and kulturpopulismus stachen from the wirtschaftspopulismus.</seg>
<seg id=1260> The interpretation of the election was influenced by (after the vote) surveys carried out in which the voters were asked what were the most important issues.</seg>
<seg id=1261> Most (22%) answered with a "moral values" compared to 20%, the economy, and 19% to terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=1262> These results suggested Conservative supporter of social policy, so that they have won the election for Bush, and that its programme dominate its next term.</seg>
<seg id=1263> But a pew-umfrage, a week after the elections, indicating that the category included "moral values" alongside abtreibungsrecht homo-ehe and a large area.</seg>
<seg id=1264> Indeed, surveys show that 25% of the population support the homo-ehe and 35% legal eheähnliche communities homosexual couples (support the position adopted by Kerry).</seg>
<seg id=1265> Nevertheless, the 37% of the homo-ehe, particularly in the red centre of the country is that the subject to mobilise the bush-anhänger contributed to the elections.</seg>
<seg id=1266> A more important question is whether the United States are divided.</seg>
<seg id=1267> The geographical voter ’ s card with red and blue States led to internet-witzen comics blue and on the two shores of the red lie, the centre of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1268> Some call this "coastopia."</seg>
<seg id=1269> The separation, however, is not so clear.</seg>
<seg id=1270> In many countries, only two camps have been won by a narrow majority, the card dyes at the level of the districts, and not the Member States, a large part of the country is more violet.</seg>
<seg id=1271> Urban and rural areas suburbs "against" to describe the situation better than "against" Coast centre.</seg>
<seg id=1272> Indeed, public opinion polls show that the majority of Americans gather in the middle of the political spectrum, and not at the external two margins.</seg>
<seg id=1273> But political elites, such as parteiaktivisten and kongressmitglieder, tend to be more than the public.</seg>
<seg id=1274> It appears that they should be confusing for an incentive to move in the Middle stimmenreichen.</seg>
<seg id=1275> But many kongressmitglieder represented districts for their political parties, and their re-election is threatened by innerparteiliche elections, dominated by the aktivistischeren and more extreme parteiflügeln.</seg>
<seg id=1276> This trend is reinforced by the spread of development assistance, which viewers' infotainment-sendungen controversial receiving ", and internet-blogger involved in bitter controversies without any editorial filter.</seg>
<seg id=1277> Reforms to change the borders of the kongressbezirke to strengthen competition, would help to improve the problem, but few sitting Congressman will vote for those amendments which increase the risk of their defeat.</seg>
<seg id=1278> The narrow outcome suggests that Bush was elected less for change, as he seems to believe.</seg>
<seg id=1279> Given the difficult issues in the foreign, fiscal and social policy would be wise to him, rather than to appease the centre, his conservative basis. But remains unclear whether a policy of convictions or of pragmatism will prevail.</seg>
<seg id=1280> Liberation from the dependence on oil</seg>
<seg id=1281> Chancellor Angela Merkel the focusing of climate change has given high priority on Germany's agenda for the EU and g-8-präsidentschaften, starting in January.</seg>
<seg id=1282> Here is a concrete proposal, so that the political leaders in the world take it into consideration and accept and so clear that other governments and businesses can take it up to the next G8 summit are allowed to set a date, from the benzinbetriebene cars in large industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg id=1283> Such a decision would have a very positive economic and geopolitical effect.</seg>
<seg id=1284> The real reason for the energiesorgen today are not the dwindling global oil reserves, but that the domestic production by the spitzenverbraucher -- Europe, the United States and China will decline -- at the moment the growing Asian demand the market is under pressure.</seg>
<seg id=1285> Available reserves will increasingly be concentrated in the Middle East, because there will be exhausted in all other regions.</seg>
<seg id=1286> Moreover, the major ölexporteure are not prepared to make the investment needs of the market.</seg>
<seg id=1287> Saudi Arabia is trying to maintain its oil production, while Iran from potential investors in red tape and corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1288> Iraq is suffering from a lack of security and foreign investors in Russia is a constant.</seg>
<seg id=1289> These four countries have confirmed half of the world's oil reserves and two thirds of which could potentially be exported.</seg>
<seg id=1290> All this, not the production costs, behind the high oil prices and the fight for gave oil contracts in Asia and Africa.</seg>
<seg id=1291> In the belief that high oil prices are good, because they serve the environment, some basic facts of international politics.</seg>
<seg id=1292> Firstly oil imports from in many of the poorest African and Asian countries have a significantly higher proportion of spending as in developed countries, which means that economic growth and social development, while developing new debt crises.</seg>
<seg id=1293> Hinder earnings from oil reforms in the major exporting countries.</seg>
<seg id=1294> Thanks to your geölten financial strength regimes such as those in Venezuela and Iran are increasingly international rules.</seg>
<seg id=1295> The laggardly consuming nations, such as China, are well known to overlook violations of human rights, authoritarian lucrative trade in order to ensure oil-rich regime and imitate the old habits of the industrial West.</seg>
<seg id=1296> Only the political and economic heavyweights in the world, the large industrial nations, which continue to be by far the largest consumers of hydrocarbons, will be able to set a change at global level.</seg>
<seg id=1297> The change must begin in the transport sector, for more than half of the current oil consumption is a share of the responsibility, will likely increase in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1298> The G8 countries are taking should agree, therefore, with no new by 2025, benzinbetriebene cars.</seg>
<seg id=1299> This decision would not be directed against the individual mobility, but against the waste of scarce raw material, the urgent need to restore synthetic materials.</seg>
<seg id=1300> The political leaders should not certain technology.</seg>
<seg id=1301> Instead, they should create incentives for the car industry to develop alternative technologies, based on fuel from biomass, ethylen hydrogen during a transition period, and even natural gas.</seg>
<seg id=1302> Countries that a political lead, the domestic industry, as an added value, a leading role in the technology and secure future markets.</seg>
<seg id=1303> The key is likely to reduce CO2 emissions could bring the breakthrough in international climate policy.</seg>
<seg id=1304> But the economic development comes into play: the "cure our dependence on oil and poorer, less developed countries, and more force prices down and the geopolitical energiewettbewerb.</seg>
<seg id=1305> The obvious advantages geopolitical similar, since the ability of the great ölexporteure would much less developed countries to blackmail.</seg>
<seg id=1306> This could improve the negotiating position of the international community in the Middle East and strengthen the social forces in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia, to the serious political and economic reforms from within.</seg>
<seg id=1307> As highly sophisticated technology and one of the big car manufacturers Germany is well positioned to bring about such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id=1308> Merkel, which will be started in physics and their political career, as the Minister for the Presidency in 1995, it was the first conference of the UN klima-rahmenkonvention -- has perhaps more credibility to raise this issue than any other EU and their g-8-kollegen.</seg>
<seg id=1309> The time for a courageous action from the leadership has come.</seg>
<seg id=1310> The myth of trade and aid</seg>
<seg id=1311> Trade and aid have become international modewörtern.</seg>
<seg id=1312> More aid (including debt) and greater access to the markets of rich countries for products from poor countries seem to be at the top of the global agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1313> Indeed, the current debate is not about what is to be done, but how much to be done and how quickly it.</seg>
<seg id=1314> The lessons have been clear from the past five decades of economic development.</seg>
<seg id=1315> The most important of which is that economic development in the hands of the poor nations itself.</seg>
<seg id=1316> Countries that have provided in the recent past, were good performance in this effort.</seg>
<seg id=1317> Aid and access to rarely have played a decisive role.</seg>
<seg id=1318> We take a developing country, which has a free and preferential access to its largest neighbour, which is also the most powerful economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1319> We also assume that this country can send millions of citizens as workers over the border, on a large scale and foreign investment is completely in international production chains.</seg>
<seg id=1320> Moreover, the banking system of the country is supported by the has shown its willingness to intervene in rich neighbours, in the worst case, as a lender.</seg>
<seg id=1321> Much better globalisation can hardly be?</seg>
<seg id=1322> We now have a second country.</seg>
<seg id=1323> The country is facing a trade embargo on the largest market in the world, neither foreign aid, or any other support from the West, is excluded from international organisations such as the WTO and is being prevented from, the IMF and the World Bank loans.</seg>
<seg id=1324> As if the external disadvantages), this is not enough schwächend economy (even their own high barriers to international trade, in the form of state, and trade restrictions.</seg>
<seg id=1325> As the reader may have guessed that there is real countries: Mexico, and Vietnam.</seg>
<seg id=1326> Mexico shares a 3,000-kilometer border with the United States, which is not only for a privileged access for goods and people, but also for a claim on the resources of the US Treasury (and the peso crisis in 1995.</seg>
<seg id=1327> Against America has maintained a trade embargo against Vietnam and 1994, 1995 was only diplomatic contacts and Vietnamese imports granted years after that no nation.</seg>
<seg id=1328> Vietnam is still excluded from the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1329> We are now their economic performance.</seg>
<seg id=1330> Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed in December 1992, Mexico's economy has grown at an average of little more than 1% per capita and per year.</seg>
<seg id=1331> This is not only far below the growth rates of economic superstars Asia, it also represents only a fraction of Mexico's own wachstumsleistung in the decades before the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).</seg>
<seg id=1332> Vietnam's economy is the beginning of its economic reforms, however, between 1988 and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the us up to 1995 5.6% per year per capita. Since it continues to grow at a fast pace of 4.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1333> Vietnam has undergone a dramatic reduction in poverty in Mexico, while the real wages have fallen.</seg>
<seg id=1334> Both countries have registered a surge in international trade and foreign investment, but the poor, where it is most of all, completely different images of the rising living standards, particularly for.</seg>
<seg id=1335> These examples show that the efforts of a country to its economic fate is much more important than anything else.</seg>
<seg id=1336> All the opportunities offered by the US, Mexico, the consequences of the political error could not in their own country, particularly for the failure of the real value of the peso-wechselkurses, and the inability to extend the in a small area of exportaktivitäten productivity gains achieved on the rest of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1337> Most, it is important for a country to choose the right strategy for growth.</seg>
<seg id=1338> Without the benefits of Mexico's Vietnam, a strategy to its economy, to spread and the capacity to increase domestic suppliers.</seg>
<seg id=1339> The experience of the post-war period supports the conclusion that the internal policy is the most important.</seg>
<seg id=1340> South Korea the breakthrough in the early 1960s, not as the foreign aid was at its peak, but as they were.</seg>
<seg id=1341> Taiwan did not or preferential access to foreign aid.</seg>
<seg id=1342> China and India, the economic superstars today, flourish, mainly due to their own reform efforts.</seg>
<seg id=1343> It is tempting to attribute the few African successes, Botswana and Mauritius, the demand for their exports (diamonds or clothing), but history is being made.</seg>
<seg id=1344> Obviously, both countries without access to foreign markets are considerably poorer.</seg>
<seg id=1345> But, as in other cases of successful development it is not their external benefits withdrawals from other, but it is their ability to make use of these benefits.</seg>
<seg id=1346> Witness the ruins, have made the other countries from its wealth of natural resources.</seg>
<seg id=1347> In Sierra Leone, the word 'diamond "is hardly pictures of peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1348> As only a few of the free industrial zones, the spread of the world have produced results that have been observed in Mauritius.</seg>
<seg id=1349> None of this gives to help the rich countries from its responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=1350> They can make the world for corrupt dictators arrogance, for example by financial information exchange and international treaties that sign these dictators, not recognise.</seg>
<seg id=1351> Similarly, an increase in the number of workers from poor countries would be able to work in rich countries, and more room for establishing pro-growth policies have a by a relaxation of the WTO rules and the dependence on the United States to the more long-term development.</seg>
<seg id=1352> It is not clear that an extension of the market and the increase in aid to the most productive use of valuable political capital from the North.</seg>
<seg id=1353> Development should not focus on trade and aid, but to improve the political environment in poor countries.</seg>
<seg id=1354> Who is now by whom?</seg>
<seg id=1355> If the great economist Argentine Raul prebisch would still alive today would no doubt whether it is because the world.</seg>
<seg id=1356> His enormously influential "dependenztheorie" assumed that the poor countries that are too much on rohstoffexporte, those who can never be industrial penetration for a sustainable economic growth.</seg>
<seg id=1357> Instead, they are caught in a cycle of falling steadily declining commodity prices, and global einkommensanteile.</seg>
<seg id=1358> Prebischs priority political reaction of protectionism in the many Latin American and African countries that joined his views, catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id=1359> The fact is that prebisch over many years in relation seemed to be on the long-term trends in the prices of raw materials, however, is the right one.</seg>
<seg id=1360> Ruthless efficiency in agriculture and in commodity prices inflating the exploitation of natural resources, particularly during the 1980's and 1990's.</seg>
<seg id=1361> Apart from a few exceptions, the economy in those countries that have focused on rohstoffexporte, while many Asian countries, rohstoffarme pushed forward.</seg>
<seg id=1362> Today, however, where there are Asian giants, India and China -- in the world economy, the price of oil explode, gold, wheat and practically all the others, raw materials.</seg>
<seg id=1363> While there will always be cycles -- for example, oil prices will probably -- before they start to rise, but the long-term trend for many raw materials will clearly show for a long time.</seg>
<seg id=1364> What do not understand many of the actors in the trade negotiations and other political leaders seem to be prebisch -- while this would immediately -- that this turn of events is enormous impact on the balance of power in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1365> Indeed, no other aspect of globalisation may ask the leaders of our world in the coming decades, greater challenges.</seg>
<seg id=1366> The questions are many.</seg>
<seg id=1367> The rich countries of the day are ready for an era of kodependenz, in which they desperately need not even less than the developing countries, the industrieimporte of raw materials and technology?</seg>
<seg id=1368> Are you prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to the producers of raw materials, because they are now much richer?</seg>
<seg id=1369> As the world's two superpowers, China and the United States will deal with the fact that important -- rohstoffexportierende regions of Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia -- composite littered with bad nation states?</seg>
<seg id=1370> Some even prophets appointed is the problem as a limited natural resources, with what the world at an alarming rate were critical raw materials.</seg>
<seg id=1371> Today there are many supporters of the hubbert's theory of oil production, which says that we have reached the upper limit so that the dry up the sources and that everything is only now worse.</seg>
<seg id=1372> However, as the leading ölhistoriker dan yergin, the prophets of doom will already have at least four times the world declared that there was no oil.</seg>
<seg id=1373> Every time had radical technological advances that this threat to disappear into thin air.</seg>
<seg id=1374> The end of the 19th century, have been used in the maultiere still for the ausschachtungen.</seg>
<seg id=1375> Today, no one thinks something to drill for oil 3 000 metres below the sea bed.</seg>
<seg id=1376> Similar progress has been made in the area of agriculture and the metallbergbaus everywhere.</seg>
<seg id=1377> No, the world is not that the raw materials.</seg>
<seg id=1378> On the contrary, what is happening is that the inclusion of two and a half billion people (in China and India can only a nachfrageveränderung) in the global economy, is a much stronger aufwärtsdruck on commodity prices, and it will have to compensate for all technological progress.</seg>
<seg id=1379> That is why the commodity prices -- at least for the next 50 to 75 years and, perhaps, the people begin until sometime in the next centuries ago with the mining on Mars.</seg>
<seg id=1380> Had the formation of a new balance of economic power will destabilise politics?</seg>
<seg id=1381> The first world war was clear in Germany, ensuring that the other colonial powers have to a large proportion of the world's oil and rohstoffvorräte.</seg>
<seg id=1382> Similarly, Japan was in the second world war, the stability of its supplies of oil and other natural resources from abroad.</seg>
<seg id=1383> There will be similar tensions between the resource-poor (where China itself is a problem of water) and the West?</seg>
<seg id=1384> Fortunately, this is not now seems likely, particularly in view of the sober and pragmatic approach of the Chinese leadership to resolve their ressourcenprobleme.</seg>
<seg id=1385> The Chinese in the direction of regions such as Africa and hope to find stable trading partners.</seg>
<seg id=1386> They do not share that political sense of mission of the Americans, who simply want to do not only with the trade exporters of raw materials, but also promote the true faith.</seg>
<seg id=1387> Then there are the American leaders who are still assuming that the United States in relation to the energy supply.</seg>
<seg id=1388> But this is all in all, a joke: may never overused apart.</seg>
<seg id=1389> Understandably, a large proportion of the Arab world, the invasion of Iraq as a cornerstone of the Union to ensure the stability of its energy supply.</seg>
<seg id=1390> If this is true only hope that America has a plan B.</seg>
<seg id=1391> In the meantime, the commodity prices will rise further, while the ölexporteure now make the largest amount to America's trade deficit klaffendem.</seg>
<seg id=1392> Perhaps the real American strategy is to try to make large debts to the rohstoffexportierenden that these countries feel obliged to keep America happy?</seg>
<seg id=1393> But this is a phrase prebisch would never anticipated.</seg>
<seg id=1394> Hard line in the elections in Iran</seg>
<seg id=1395> The election of the hardliners known as Mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the next President of Iran probably will worsen relations with the West and strengthen international isolation of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1396> With regard to the internal affairs, however, is that the Islamic regime to be better than an moderateres result.</seg>
<seg id=1397> Ahmadinejad clearly has a broad basis of followers.</seg>
<seg id=1398> But the fact that it was a populist campaign, to help the poor, the performance of government and listing condemned to almost as a candidate of the opposition is irrelevant: it was the choice of the regime and, in the end, it was even against other rival representatives of the hard line under the candidates official aid.</seg>
<seg id=1399> The regime has played its tide.</seg>
<seg id=1400> It was the something more pragmatic hashemi Rafsanjani -- recognize that was not agree with some of the current political measures, as a figure of the "establishment" and has its own man to rebel.</seg>
<seg id=1401> The government has used the anti-establishment-gefühl to revive his own rule.</seg>
<seg id=1402> The fact that the last President Khatami Mohammed, was, was a timid reform -- if, in the end, nothing, but only the rulers have a revolution in the political situation.</seg>
<seg id=1403> Ahmadinejad is a representative of the young activists of the revolution against the Shah, a quarter of a century ago.</seg>
<seg id=1404> He was directly involved in the abduction of American hostages in Iran, although the exact extent of its participation remains controversial.</seg>
<seg id=1405> Most of the fact that it is the two groups, which are the main representatives of the most extreme elements in Iran, the guards corps of the Islamic revolution and the basidsch-organisation.</seg>
<seg id=1406> The first is a parallel regime army, the second an organisation to intimidation of opponents, and all the others who want a more open society.</seg>
<seg id=1407> Nevertheless, the concern that an even more radical leadership in Iran came to power, offset by two factors.</seg>
<seg id=1408> Firstly, Ahmadinejad will probably focus on home affairs and try to raise the standard of living of the poorest people -- what success is unclear.</seg>
<seg id=1409> Secondly, the same group, which is since the revolution in power, continue the ideology and foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id=1410> The President has less than it appears, over and above all by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</seg>
<seg id=1411> All the same, Ahmadinejad's power, which is a challenge for Iran to the western policy and stability in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1412> First, they, especially the most extreme elements in Iran and the terrorist customers of the country (the Lebanese Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad and various small groups) action against Iraq, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries that they have the green light for attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1413> They are probably that Iran, what do you.</seg>
<seg id=1414> Seen from the outside, Iran is often relatively cautious, although it is the world's leading terrorsponsor.</seg>
<seg id=1415> Sometimes individual Iranian officials have perhaps ordered alone in certain operations, and now they are still feel free to do so.</seg>
<seg id=1416> Secondly, Ahmadinejad open the Iranian crash-programm for the production of nuclear weapons.</seg>
<seg id=1417> Most of the Iranian politicians -- at least, the government, which has been open to work -- support the programme, however, prefer a calmer and more prudent approach.</seg>
<seg id=1418> Rafsanjani made, for example, the establishment of better economic relations with the West over a push in the nuclear front.</seg>
<seg id=1419> As with President Ahmadinejad of Iran, it is more likely that nuclear weapons are used in a bizarre.</seg>
<seg id=1420> This does not mean that he would firing them, but that he will use them under circumstances for the purpose of diplomatic blackmail and increase threats to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1421> Since the Iranian leaders daily explain their desire to wipe Israel off the map and to fight the United States (Ahmadinejad came into force on his way to vote on a picture of the American flag), has increased the risk of confrontation.</seg>
<seg id=1422> Finally, Ahmadinejad is likely to erode the stability in Iraq to dreistere and victory will encourage radical Iranian officials and extremists in Iraq itself.</seg>
<seg id=1423> Iran has already sent agents in Iraq and customers who want to turn the country into a clone.</seg>
<seg id=1424> The Iraqis, including the Shiite Muslims who believe in the same direction of Islam as the Iranians, this interference in general.</seg>
<seg id=1425> A militantere Iranian attitude will strengthen the friction with Iraq and anti-American may further violence.</seg>
<seg id=1426> In short, the result of the elections in Iran is dangerous, even though his exact destabilizing effect will ultimately depend on how Ahmadinejad is and how much power will be given him Khamenei.</seg>
<seg id=1427> Moreover, the dealing with Iran, which is measured extremely open and even to the standards of the strictest regimes radical, not only for the US is a challenge, but also for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1428> The European countries will try to do so, Ahmadinejad's bellicose rhetoric and regardless of provocation and as a diplomatic solution could be found of Iran's nuclear ambitions?</seg>
<seg id=1429> With Rafsanjani it would have been easy to make a real agreement or maintain the appearance of cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1430> But Ahmadinejad with a high degree of appeasement will be necessary in order to continue even the smallest diplomatic processes.</seg>
<seg id=1431> Some Iranian reformers and exiles have talked about the election of Ahmadinejad, with the argument that his government shows the true face of the regime and destroyed all western hopes for a compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1432> However, the success of the regime is also reflected to neutralise the dissatisfaction with a quarter of a century of radical Islamic rule.</seg>
<seg id=1433> Regardless of the outcome of Ahmadinejad victory means that everything that has to do with Iran, probably even more difficult.</seg>
<seg id=1434> From the rich to the poor.</seg>
<seg id=1435> President Bush seems to be to disrupt America's budget for years to come.</seg>
<seg id=1436> With President Bush's office we saw as far as the eye was only budget surpluses.</seg>
<seg id=1437> This huge deficits are on haushaltshorizont and as a result of gemisches from irresponsible, introduced by the republicans tax cuts, from the malaise of the economy, the bursting of the stock-market bubble and a massive increase in defence expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1438> It is even worse, because Bush administration and Congress under the leadership of the republicans are to haushaltsmisere.</seg>
<seg id=1439> The damage they cause, the United States and will contribute to the world economy.</seg>
<seg id=1440> Traditionally, for America's republican party was balanced budgets.</seg>
<seg id=1441> This changed under the Reagan administration. In Conservative Republicans also supported him tax cuts at the expense of large budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1442> President Reagan promised the American people, both tax cuts and military arms race and the continuation of the choice of spending and all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id=1443> The result was not surprising - a number of large budget deficits, the claim to back years.</seg>
<seg id=1444> Both President George Bush, both senj. and Bill Clinton to weed new taxes, the legacy of the Reagan era.</seg>
<seg id=1445> The tax increases are probably in President Bush's. Senj Bill Clinton to defeat in 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1446> However, Clinton decided, on the road to a balanced budget. Weiterzuschreiten he did this partly in order to ensure the long-term funding of its social programmes.</seg>
<seg id=1447> When Clinton schied in the year 2000, the budgetary situation was the best for decades.</seg>
<seg id=1448> President George Bush jr. appeared to revive Reagan by and large tax cuts, with huge increases in the military and the continuation or even extension of popular spending.</seg>
<seg id=1449> The result was predictable.</seg>
<seg id=1450> In January 2001 was the cumulative budgetary outcome for the years 2002-2011 or a surplus 5.6 trillion dollars.</seg>
<seg id=1451> In 2002, this had already been extinguished planned surpluses.</seg>
<seg id=1452> In view of the changing economic situation and the shadows, the vorauswirft a possible war in Iraq have been expected, the Bush administration and the Congress, under the leadership of the republicans tax cuts for more cautious with recommendations.</seg>
<seg id=1453> But no, you put their highest priority on further tax cuts that are primarily the rich.</seg>
<seg id=1454> At the same time, the government is significant increases in military expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1455> After the attention returning to the presidential elections in November 2004, will certainly be no meaningful concessions on military spending programme.</seg>
<seg id=1456> So, it seems that it will remain in the massive budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1457> Even if the internal expenditure continue to maintain the same proportion of national income, the cumulative budgetary outcome should be free in the next ten years to a deficit of 1.5 trillion dollars.</seg>
<seg id=1458> But this could still be too optimistic, because they probably the cost of the Iraq war does not take sufficient account, not even a further round of tax cuts and not the risk of higher interest rates in the years ahead.</seg>
<seg id=1459> Why the republicans as little concerned about the mess that they are doing?</seg>
<seg id=1460> Some republicans are tax cuts for the rich more important than almost anything else.</seg>
<seg id=1461> Others believe, high deficits more force in the domestic government spending and reduce the influence of the state, in what they want.</seg>
<seg id=1462> The problem of the latter view is that most of the internal programmes taxpayers promises and therefore greater constraints on how we are going to support.</seg>
<seg id=1463> A much exciting question is: why the Americans for such political programs, where they should know what difficulties, they are likely to vote.</seg>
<seg id=1464> The answer is that many voters do not see the threat of budgetary problems.</seg>
<seg id=1465> A better answer suggests that the majority of Americans have not voted for such programmes.</seg>
<seg id=1466> The turnout in the elections in 2002 was only. 40% of the votes cast about half of the Republicans, was only around 20% of the electorate.</seg>
<seg id=1467> Of course, the prospects must not be so dismal.</seg>
<seg id=1468> The war in Iraq can be prevented.</seg>
<seg id=1469> The proposed tax cuts to be watered down or abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=1470> But I predict huge budget deficits in the coming years and in the United States and abroad growing unease about the macroeconomic situation in America.</seg>
<seg id=1471> Investors from abroad should not decide to finance the budget and budget deficits to continue to America's so favourable conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1472> The dollar is unlikely to become weaker and could inflationsängste.</seg>
<seg id=1473> All of this will be less confidence and the us-politiker respond flexibly to the economic shocks.</seg>
<seg id=1474> The poor, both within the United States as well as the most likely to suffer if President Bush to inform the Congress and the American people, and the world that no more money because of the large budget deficits, the problems of poverty and in the health and education.</seg>
<seg id=1475> If the ordinary Americans do not wake up and take seriously the risks, not the rich will be able to do with a gift of billions of dollars, will have to contribute to the country and the world in the next few years to the consequences.</seg>
<seg id=1476> Lessons from the stupidity of the US financial</seg>
<seg id=1477> George W. Bush has done more than any other President in American history, to the economic policies of the United States, and even exceeded his mentor, Ronald Reagan.</seg>
<seg id=1478> Only three years in office, he has destroyed a fragile political consensus that had to be taken a decade and to build another decade.</seg>
<seg id=1479> Bush has set in America's long-term economic health and social stability.</seg>
<seg id=1480> Since the long-term challenges for the budget, which the United States do not as disastrous, can be learned from America's fiscal schnitzern important lessons for other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1481> The main problem of monetary policy is that politicians on tax cuts and an increase in public spending will bring about a temporary increase its popularity by making massive public debt, which is paying for the future.</seg>
<seg id=1482> This ploy can operate a few years; sooner rather than later, rising budget deficits and public debt impose a painful political U-turn.</seg>
<seg id=1483> However, a cynical politicians can buy his re-election and possibly at the beginning of the crisis in retirement.</seg>
<seg id=1484> We should think that the voters in the world for hundreds of such episodes of fiscal irresponsibility react in recent decades, an allergic reaction to this kind of tricks.</seg>
<seg id=1485> But Bush is this: he bought popularity today by distributed huge tax breaks and at the same time, the military spending, and even the spending on education and health.</seg>
<seg id=1486> The result is a deficit of more than 5% of the gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg id=1487> Worse still, the long-term prospects for the American budget worrying before Bush began his rash policy.</seg>
<seg id=1488> The average age of aspire to for the future; it is a sharp increase in costs in the public health care and pensions.</seg>
<seg id=1489> Cautious calculations show that fall below the on the basis of Bush favors erzielbaren future tax revenue the cost of pensions, health care and other public spending by the public expected to a number of 10 trillion dollars.</seg>
<seg id=1490> At some point in the future a sharp increase in the deep tax cuts in public expenditure or both together will therefore be needed to correct Bush's actions.</seg>
<seg id=1491> Why the public supported his policy?</seg>
<seg id=1492> The reason is that the public has little understanding or interest for the long-term consequences, although the majority of Americans will eventually suffer from them.</seg>
<seg id=1493> Of course, the richest taxpayers are satisfied, because they benefit most from this tax cuts.</seg>
<seg id=1494> It is unbelievable, but almost half of the tax cuts that will benefit the richest 5% below the American taxpayers, and this rich taxpayers expect clear that the other 95% - the middle class and the poor are, of the largest part of the future ausgabesenkungen and increases.</seg>
<seg id=1495> Meanwhile, Bush convinced many voters missing from the middle class, and that they can be satisfied - without saying that they must pay for its small tax cuts with much larger cuts in the future public services, if the policy of its government will prevail in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=1496> The Americans have a political memory, you would be aware that they have this tax, ",achterbahnfahrt over the last 20 years already experienced.</seg>
<seg id=1497> When Ronald Reagan was elected, he promised also massive tax cuts and a significant increase in military spending.</seg>
<seg id=1498> The result has been a huge budget deficit in the 1980's.</seg>
<seg id=1499> The tax cuts made enormously popular Reagan and contributed to his re-election in 1984.</seg>
<seg id=1500> It then took over a decade of gargantuan Reagan's second term on the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George Bush to turn, the budget deficit in a budget surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1501> Of course, this was the new tax increases, which George Bush senior re-election and the cost to the polarized political landscape of the 1990's.</seg>
<seg id=1502> History will almost certainly repeat itself.</seg>
<seg id=1503> Some right-wing ideologues within the Bush administration believe that the budget deficits days will ultimately compel our deep cuts in public expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1504> They hope to a dismantling of programmes such as the social security and medicare.</seg>
<seg id=1505> In the American public, however, these social programmes have broad support.</seg>
<seg id=1506> The strategy of the right to reduce the tax cuts in order to force then social programmes will fail, and taxes will ultimately have to rise again.</seg>
<seg id=1507> Others within the Bush administration argue that tax cuts are important to learn from the United States of recession.</seg>
<seg id=1508> This argument is wrong.</seg>
<seg id=1509> America's economy would have recovered without the tax cut, perhaps even more sustainable.</seg>
<seg id=1510> Independently, it is a great mistake, a long-term fiscal policy at the short-term economic cycle.</seg>
<seg id=1511> For other countries on the two basic lessons.</seg>
<seg id=1512> The first is that the emerging budget deficits will, sooner or later, the United States of America's international influence.</seg>
<seg id=1513> The Americans have supported the war in Iraq is only because they have not had to pay for it with increases.</seg>
<seg id=1514> As soon as the Americans must decide whether they want to finance its auslandsabenteuer through higher taxes, you will be far less expensive prepared to support military operations abroad.</seg>
<seg id=1515> In fact, it will come in the wake of the public debate about the bush's fiscal mess left to an in-depth internal division of the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1516> The second lesson is that the rising costs of an aging population should take into account, in their planning.</seg>
<seg id=1517> The long-term budgetary situation is often not aware of the taxpayers more clearly to Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1518> Governments should be obliged to submit to absorb, together with their annual assessments of the long-term budget in order to counteract the trend towards the short-term political manipulation of the budget.</seg>
<seg id=1519> The US can be used by other countries as early warning.</seg>
<seg id=1520> The White House should other, the same warning to their wizards on television viewers: ,versuchen at home, they do not. "</seg>
<seg id=1521> The political stock market</seg>
<seg id=1522> Many economic and financial analysts complain that the stock markets of emerging countries are often manipulated by their governments and are more politically and economically.</seg>
<seg id=1523> In contrast, the force of an economic nature and a prediction made their effectively is therefore with a similar growth forecast for trees, seems to be in the stock markets in the industrialized countries, it.</seg>
<seg id=1524> This description of stock markets in developing countries is not only wrong, biased, because the same description applies to stock exchanges in developed countries.</seg>
<seg id=1525> The best analysts know that a survey of the stock market is effectively means of each country essentially predict how good it investors in the stock market to the will of the government launched in the current political environment.</seg>
<seg id=1526> The stock market, the United States, are by far the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1527> The general opinion remain companies by the government and the returns on investments in the US exchange reflect the fundamental forces of a strong capitalist economic system.</seg>
<seg id=1528> This is one of the reasons why the United States has an magnetic appeal to portefeuille-investoren from around the world.</seg>
<seg id=1529> But the profits, which would be the American stock markets are so attractive, a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id=1530> In particular, the rates vary influence shares, have veränderndem under political pressure in the course of time.</seg>
<seg id=1531> For example, during the Second World War has diminished the political support for great assets, and the government has increased taxes on capital gains dividends, and high incomes in general.</seg>
<seg id=1532> As the second world war was thorough recovery of the great depression of the dreißigerjahre President Roosevelt, and the Congress of excessive profits to ensure that would benefit not shareholders.</seg>
<seg id=1533> In 1980, on the other hand, when there was no war, but in the stock market was one of the lowest us-wähler Ronald Reagan, a man, and many people considered to the right wing angehörig in order to be elected President.</seg>
<seg id=1534> He called for - and - capital gains tax cuts on dividends, and incomes.</seg>
<seg id=1535> Political interference in the stock market is not limited to gains taxes on dividends and incomes.</seg>
<seg id=1536> , wealth taxes, excise duties and VAT - all of which will be paid directly or indirectly - in an extended level of companies can operate on company profits, and therefore the stock market.</seg>
<seg id=1537> Flourish wherever rich stock markets, it is no coincidence that governments to ensure that, in so far as to make profits for withdrawal of taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1538> The policy of the stock markets does not end in taxation.</seg>
<seg id=1539> On the contrary, almost every regierungsaktivität, and in exchange for company profits on the stock market.</seg>
<seg id=1540> After the stock market crash in the year 1929, the US Government suspended many activities of the competition authorities and has made it possible to obtain monopoly power companies, which would increase their value.</seg>
<seg id=1541> This policy delayed the recovery of high unemployment, but even this is not enough to keep in check the political forces involved in favor of the support of the stock market.</seg>
<seg id=1542> It was one of the most important things that President Reagan did to destroy large parts of the remaining power of the American trade unions, the fight unternehmenskuchen on their way.</seg>
<seg id=1543> The fluglotsenstreiks of Reagan was a turning point for the American trade union movement, and for the stock market spectacular stocks, which began in 1982.</seg>
<seg id=1544> Since the speculative increase the share prices reached its peak in the year 2000, the US administration has supported the stock market, particularly in particular by repeated reduction of interest rates.</seg>
<seg id=1545> This was, of course, publicly justified as a measure to stimulate the economy, not to support the stock market.</seg>
<seg id=1546> However, it is more a reference to the importance of the US exchange that the aktienkursverfall was thought to be one of the most important factors on the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1547> The response of the authorities do not limited to monetary stimulationsmaßnahmen.</seg>
<seg id=1548> The economic accounts of the US shows that the tax on company profits (the percentage of profits, indeed, in the form of taxes to the government in its peak reached 33,7% in the first quarter of the year 2000 - the peak of the stock market and the economy in general, was in the fourth quarter 20,2% in 2003, when the market has had a very low level.</seg>
<seg id=1549> This decline reflects to a large extent, was marked by Congress to tax measures, as well as the opinion of companies that they can avoid taxes in the current economic and political environment aggressive.</seg>
<seg id=1550> Moreover, the maximum tax on dividends from the börsencrash shares has been reduced from 35% to 15% for long-term investors has given a major new advantage and the zinseszinseffekt increased in wiederanlage dividends.</seg>
<seg id=1551> This was justified as konjunkturanreiz taxes to support what we can say, of course, virtually every measure, the aim of the stock market.</seg>
<seg id=1552> It is, however, the balance of political forces which decides on the credibility of this kind of justification.</seg>
<seg id=1553> It could be said that the same variables, including the negative attitude towards high taxes and the weakness of the trade union movement, in the United States since the last 200 years at work, and we can therefore assume that they so in the future, and high stock market gains produce and attract huge inflows of foreign investment.</seg>
<seg id=1554> Those who believe that investments in the US stock market done remain the same strong for decades, have increased growth might is right.</seg>
<seg id=1555> We should, however, be clear about what we had predicted.</seg>
<seg id=1556> In fact, it is not only economic developments, but policy - and even cultural values, economic policy and -leistung.</seg>
<seg id=1557> The global home</seg>
<seg id=1558> Of all investment homes are most committed to a particular place, for better or for worse and made subject to the local economic conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1559> We have on our televisions worldwide developments at lightning speed, but our eigenheimmarkt, which is almost exclusively in the hands of local affairs enthusiasts, is enshrined in our own backyard.</seg>
<seg id=1560> However, this could change.</seg>
<seg id=1561> Within a month will produktbörse the Chicago mercantile exchange (CME) in cooperation with my macromarkets companies and fiserv and standard & poor's futures and optionskontrakte on home prices in ten American cities on the market.</seg>
<seg id=1562> The basis of this contracts are the s P & / case-shiller-immobilienpreisindizes -- a development of scientific work, which my colleague Karl case and I was almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=1563> We have immobilienfutures for many years, but until now no stock market wanted to create a futuresmarkt on the basis of these indicators.</seg>
<seg id=1564> The futuresmärkte will investors to invest in the world, by acquiring shares indirectly in US homes.</seg>
<seg id=1565> A investors in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo to invest in New York and in Los Angeles, las vegas homes, inhabited by their owners.</seg>
<seg id=1566> Because of a fundamental principle of financial theory -- "diversification" or "risks" --, it may be that the interests of the new kontrakten will be high.</seg>
<seg id=1567> So, for example, people and companies are in New York excessive local immobilienrisiken. They should reduce this risk through the sale of futures on home prices in New York.</seg>
<seg id=1568> At acceptable prices of these people are in Tokyo by buying New York on home prices futures part of the risk.</seg>
<seg id=1569> The New York is still live in their home, but their anlagerisiko you now have spread throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id=1570> A genuine futures market to homes since 1991 there was no more than the London termin- and optionsbörse (the firmiert now under the name of euronext.liffe) failed in such a market in the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id=1571> At the time, it was unable to reach a sufficient trade.</seg>
<seg id=1572> The stock market schmiss a party, but none.</seg>
<seg id=1573> The British spread-betting-märkte and some online-handelsmärkte could achieve sustainable success.</seg>
<seg id=1574> It will be different this time?</seg>
<seg id=1575> Of course, the launch of a new market is always a dangerous enterprise. People go only to parties, if there are many other people.</seg>
<seg id=1576> No one is not to issue, and it is in markets with a few investors.</seg>
<seg id=1577> There are too few transactions to achieve returns are needed to attract enough investors, as well as great parties in the success of new markets is sometimes a mystery, but we do know that it from time to time doing very well.</seg>
<seg id=1578> There are signs of a growing interest in trade with futures on home prices, especially as the debates about a "real-estate bubble 'stress the importance of the risikodiversifikation.</seg>
<seg id=1579> After the CME announced plans, one of its mitbewerberinnen said, that it intends optionsbörse the Chicago futures, and optionskontrakte for the most important regions in the United States in the market, are the basis for the American association of the medianpreise issued for homes.</seg>
<seg id=1580> But apart from the strong public interest in property investment and the protection of immobilienrisiken is to clarify the success of futuresmärkten a crucial point: prices must be open and investors need to focus on the importance of this prices.</seg>
<seg id=1581> I believe that it will count on many of these futuresmärkte soon with a considerable, within the next year fall campaigning in some American cities.</seg>
<seg id=1582> The prices of traders are known as "backwardation", which means that the price of a futures market today is lower than the current price of eigenheims.</seg>
<seg id=1583> This backwardation is perhaps the first day of trade with futures, but very probably within a few months.</seg>
<seg id=1584> This backwardation on some markets could be needed if these are to be their role.</seg>
<seg id=1585> All know that it has (in many of these cities and elsewhere) over the last few years, a huge immobilienboom.</seg>
<seg id=1586> International investors will probably not want to invest in the cities, if there are no futuresmärkten expectations, as the inhabitants of a fall in Tokyo ’ s know from bitter experience.</seg>
<seg id=1587> If this backwardation, however, is strong enough, investors who believe that the us-immobilienmarkt is declining expect the eigenheimfutures a good returns could also because they buy them futuresmarkt at a lower price.</seg>
<seg id=1588> Nevertheless, the New York to protect their property investment to some extent must change when it comes to sell, futureskontrakte, which is already a fall in prices changes.</seg>
<seg id=1589> They will have to get used to the idea that the market prices and that they can protect themselves on the part of the future of any reduction, which go beyond these expectations.</seg>
<seg id=1590> Such a change will likely emerge if we know the future market prices.</seg>
<seg id=1591> Until now, the future development of real estate prices was a matter entirely different opinions.</seg>
<seg id=1592> When the markets can establish an international consensus on the future home prices in the city in the world, we will also deal with the risks cities in this way to stabilize their economies, and our own lives.</seg>
<seg id=1593> The news induce the markets?</seg>
<seg id=1594> The stock markets in much of the world have since the clear exchanges roughly 10 May. Most of them over the two weeks by around 23 May, on average, however, the fall in prices.</seg>
<seg id=1595> Those problems on the international markets to problems of the world economy?</seg>
<seg id=1596> Let us look at the most exchanges.</seg>
<seg id=1597> The most important national indexes crash, the largest in India, where the prices of 10 to fell 16,9 may 23%.</seg>
<seg id=1598> The debacle on the other side of the world was almost as great and the maximum and tiefststände from wichen only two days of those in India: in Argentina 16% of the courses blinked in Brazil 14,7% and Mexico to 13.8%.</seg>
<seg id=1599> The European markets suffered heavy losses.</seg>
<seg id=1600> In Sweden, the exchange rates between 9 and 22 May fell by 15.2% in the same period; they were at 9.7% in Germany, France and Great Britain and 9.4% in Italy 9.3%.</seg>
<seg id=1601> In Asia, the courses in almost exactly the same period of relative highs fell on relative lows -- in Korea 11.5% in Hong Kong, in order to reach 9.3% and 8% in Japan.</seg>
<seg id=1602> Many commentators are trying to define these events in developments in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1603> But in the United States, the shares between 9 and 24 May only fell by 5.2%.</seg>
<seg id=1604> Just as the courses during this period there have even China seems to fall behind the world.</seg>
<seg id=1605> The standarderklärung economists of the monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=1606> In the wake of the great deflationsangst of the year 2003, the central banks in the world and implemented interest rates have spekulationsbedingte booms, both in the stock and the häusermarkt.</seg>
<seg id=1607> Now, however, this view, rising interest rates, which make unpleasant for the future kursrückgänge expect further.</seg>
<seg id=1608> This is undoubtedly an important element of truth.</seg>
<seg id=1609> The US Federal Reserve mentions the interest rates on 10 May, and its chairman Ben bernanke, indicated the possibility of further interest rate hikes.</seg>
<seg id=1610> On 17 May deteriorating inflationsdaten were asked, which indicates that a further tightening the monetary policy is in the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id=1611> The economists see the world to be a logical and manageable -- and imply that they understand what is in it.</seg>
<seg id=1612> But they do, they often on the role of the European Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id=1613> Indeed, the increase in the United States was only one in a whole series of -- 16 in the interest rate hikes.</seg>
<seg id=1614> No other important central bank has increased on the kursverlusten in the stock markets until 7 and 8 June, the interest rates, and several did (the European Central Bank and the central banks of India, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1615> Another factor is the increase in the price of oil, and between 22 March 2 May by 24% and failed to several absolute highs.</seg>
<seg id=1616> This was an important event, and it stands to reason that it could have an impact on the stock markets around the world.</seg>
<seg id=1617> Oil-price increases have contributed to practically all economic recessions since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id=1618> However, the oil-price increases in the middle of may not be window of opportunity, as the most nachgaben indexes.</seg>
<seg id=1619> Those who argue that rising oil prices on the stock exchanges that caused the stock markets reacted with mehrwöchiger delay implies.</seg>
<seg id=1620> Now stock markets are not necessarily very logical and a delayed reaction to the oil price shocks.</seg>
<seg id=1621> As with all the other prices on the financial markets, too, there is increasing attention.</seg>
<seg id=1622> If oil prices shoot, people with respect to oil prices coherent news and talk about what the price of oil -- a growing awareness of such news.</seg>
<seg id=1623> The crisis in the Middle East, the dominated news in May, with the oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1624> Perhaps the investors ominous indications and because of the oil-price increases the looming choice of political actors have strengthened.</seg>
<seg id=1625> The Deputy Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, on 8 May help in response to statements made by the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: "The President of Iran should remember that Iran can be swept from the map."</seg>
<seg id=1626> Similarly, the newspapers reported on 13 May, such as the beginning of the kursstürze in the stock market, Ahmadinejad during his visit to Indonesia -- the most populous majority Muslim country in the world -- has been of students by two of the topuniversitäten of the country with a.</seg>
<seg id=1627> This report may be interpreted as evidence that Ahmadinejad's confrontation in the nuclear issue for the political will, which may have been the idea that the tense situation in the Middle East could lead to even higher oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1628> These bases may appear to be much further away from the stock market than the monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=1629> But the public reaction to it, together with the recent rise in oil prices -- may be a good part of the amendment of the marktpsychologie.</seg>
<seg id=1630> Take the lead to change over time, and events such as Ahmadinejad's and Peres' statements such changes.</seg>
<seg id=1631> Such things happen in difficult quantifiable manner, should be analysts in their attempt to predict the development of the world, the stock markets may Ahmadinejad's comments as much attention as those bernanke's.</seg>
<seg id=1632> It may not like the economists, to focus its attention to the position of the public and their interaction with the world price, and spekulationsdynamiken bases.</seg>
<seg id=1633> Finally, they would admit that economic events (less predictable and economists are even less allwissend), as they would like.</seg>
<seg id=1634> But such a centre is a intuitively sense.</seg>
<seg id=1635> What moves investors?</seg>
<seg id=1636> Ahmadinejad is a charismatic and bernanke is not.</seg>
<seg id=1637> Ahmedinejad pursues a course bernanke adventure; it does not work.</seg>
<seg id=1638> And, perhaps most important: a destabilising influence is bernanke Ahmadinejad, it is not.</seg>
<seg id=1639> Indeed, the world stock exchanges in May, which may be its final cause points to an unstable marktpsychologie.</seg>
<seg id=1640> It is hard to imagine that there is it only to the views on the impending monetary policy and not to wider and deeper profound, for the global economy fundamental problems -- including the supply and political tensions.</seg>
<seg id=1641> Why should pay more for fairness</seg>
<seg id=1642> Marks & Spencer, and with a supermarkt- euro discount 400 branches across Britain recently announced that it would all their coffee and teepalette, as a whole, 38 produktlinien Fairtrade, for a marketingsymbol 'ethical' to convert production.</seg>
<seg id=1643> The chain sold in its 200 café-revive-kaffeestuben exclusively with fairtraide-siegel already tea and coffee.</seg>
<seg id=1644> They also to increase their einkaufsmenge shirts and other goods from fairtrade-baumwolle.</seg>
<seg id=1645> The announcement was made during the "Fairtrade fortnight," a two-week fairtrade-produkte in the campaign for, among other things, told the British farmers from developing countries to speeches, in different places, such as the Fairtrade has helped their communities.</seg>
<seg id=1646> The move towards a ethischeren consumption has gained importance, in the United States, to turn the consumers increasingly grown locally manufactured, organic food and free-range eggs.</seg>
<seg id=1647> In Britain, a survey showed that half of the respondents recognized the fairtrade-symbol and knew that it relates to products offer the farmers in the third world better business conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1648> There is no comparable us study, but similar data and discussions with my own students indicate that the number would be much lower.</seg>
<seg id=1649> The fairtrade-siegel traders, the request that manufacturers should pay a price which cover the costs of sustainable production and a minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id=1650> For example, the minimum price for coffee is $1.26 per pound, no matter how deeply the market price.</seg>
<seg id=1651> If the market is on the value of the fairhandelspreis, so that it is five cents per pound higher.</seg>
<seg id=1652> Farmers need to organise themselves in cooperative or other groups for democratic participation.</seg>
<seg id=1653> The fairtrade-siegel plantations and factories, if they can use their workers paying decent wages, health, safety and environmental standards, unions, or other forms of would allow provide good housing, if not the workers at home, not even in forced labour and child.</seg>
<seg id=1654> Not all of the Fairtrade take place.</seg>
<seg id=1655> Brink Lindsey, Director of market _ based approaches Cato Institute's Center for trade policy studies, believes that the campaign for a fairtrade-kaffee "well-meaning impasse."</seg>
<seg id=1656> Some legitimacy argue that the real cause is not the case of the coffee prices for multinational companies, but the enormous increase in the kaffeeproduktion in Brazil, and Vietnam, in combination with new technologies, which will make it possible to coffee with fewer workers and therefore grow.</seg>
<seg id=1657> Of lindeys point of view, we should encourage the coffee planters, if we want to help them, either to abandon the planting coffee and grow gewinnbringendere plants and it is right to point out that the rich countries are trade barriers and obstacles to achieve must be abolished, or better quality products, for example, the spezialkaffees higher prices.</seg>
<seg id=1658> In lindeys argument that the campaign for this can be regarded as fairtrade-kaffee exactly what he recommends is strange: the coffee planters are encouraged to produce a spezialkaffee, made a higher price.</seg>
<seg id=1659> The representatives of the free market have nothing against companies that quite openly snob-appeal used to promote their products.</seg>
<seg id=1660> If people want to pay for a $48 £blue-mountain-kaffee Jamaica said, because it is lieblingskaffee James Bond, economists have nothing against the fact that the market is distorted.</seg>
<seg id=1661> Why are you will be critical if consumers -- choose a $12 to spend £coffee, which they know that it has been produced without a shadow of toxic chemicals show trees, where farmers, the survival of birds can afford to feed and to send their children to school?</seg>
<seg id=1662> Economists, the answer is that if we want to help the people to feed their children, and $10 can pay for a fairly traded coffee, which provides, and then the gesparten $2 to a charity, the poor children with food and education.</seg>
<seg id=1663> This is a possible strategy, but fair trade has certain advantages.</seg>
<seg id=1664> The farmers know that they must provide a product like that consumers, both in terms of the connection in the anbauweise.</seg>
<seg id=1665> If their product sold well, you can be proud to have produced something that is sought after in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1666> From the point of view of producers, it is better to have a premium by the sale of a fairtrade-produkts to receive a charity as they received, regardless of whether or not they have worked, and despite the quality of the product.</seg>
<seg id=1667> A higher price to pay for a fairtrade-etikett is not "of anti-competition," as a higher price to pay for a gucci-etikett, and it reflects better ethical priorities.</seg>
<seg id=1668> The Fairtrade is not a state subsidies.</seg>
<seg id=1669> Its success is the demand on the market, not of our political.</seg>
<seg id=1670> Fortunately, the growing demand on the European market.</seg>
<seg id=1671> It is to be hoped that they will be able to all developed countries and everywhere where people choose their expenditure, soon be equally high.</seg>
<seg id=1672> Pigs and calves American democracy</seg>
<seg id=1673> In all the headlines about the victory of the democrats in the American Congressional elections in November an important result of these elections almost disappeared.</seg>
<seg id=1674> And although this teilergebnis highlighted the shortcomings of the political system in the United States, it has made my belief in the sympathy of American citizen.</seg>
<seg id=1675> In the state of Arizona citizens can provide a sufficient number of unterstützungsunterschriften a proposal to direct vote.</seg>
<seg id=1676> In this election was to integrate the ban on pregnant sows or zuchtkälber pigs or buffalo sheds that prevent the animal to move freely lie down or by its limbs.</seg>
<seg id=1677> Those who are not familiar with the methods of modern agriculture industry, may ask why such legislation will be needed.</seg>
<seg id=1678> Under conditions of rampant 50 years ago in the welfare and how they are applied everywhere in many countries today, all animals have enough room to move, and to reach out.</seg>
<seg id=1679> Today, however, 90% of all American breeding sows -- the mothers of piglets reared for the production of pigmeat ham, and spend around imprisoned and killed, the bulk of their lives in kastenständen that are no more than 60 times 220 cm.</seg>
<seg id=1680> You can put it, not just embracing limbs or or more than a step backwards.</seg>
<seg id=1681> Other sows be linked to chains, so that they can also be turning.</seg>
<seg id=1682> Even in the calves veal production are closed their lives in small verschläge individually, where they are not just put or can hold out.</seg>
<seg id=1683> This is arbeitsersparnis animal-rearing -- and facilitate the tiermanagement the position of thousands and thousands of animals under one roof. Or less qualified staff are needed.</seg>
<seg id=1684> This also means that the animals by too much movement or fighting each other waste energy.</seg>
<seg id=1685> After animal protests by the European Union in a few years ago, the Scientific Veterinary Committee, a report on this type of farming.</seg>
<seg id=1686> In the report of the Committee we came to the conclusion that the animals suffer, you have to be able to move freely and not to do anything at all.</seg>
<seg id=1687> We could have come to this conclusion, of course, using the normal in-house experts.</seg>
<seg id=1688> After the publication of this report, the EU, by the time of the animals should be banned.</seg>
<seg id=1689> Zuchtkälber approaches to the ban on 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id=1690> Einzelkastenstände for breeding sows in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and are already prohibited throughout the EU illegally from 2013.</seg>
<seg id=1691> Gradually to implement measures to improve the living conditions of laying hens, be kept closely in drahtkäfigen usually concentrated in which they can spreizen not even to their wings.</seg>
<seg id=1692> In the United States bundesweite measures of this kind are nowhere to be seen.</seg>
<seg id=1693> When asked me my European friends in the past, why Europe lagging behind the United States in terms of animal protection, as far as I knew no answer to this.</seg>
<seg id=1694> The questions were desperate, I had to admit that a statement is perhaps the fact that the Americans animals are less than the Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1695> In 2002, animal in Florida, however, have a legislative proposal on the banning of kastenständen for sows the vote.</seg>
<seg id=1696> To the surprise of many of the proposal has been adopted by 55% of the electorate.</seg>
<seg id=1697> Last month in Arizona costly gegeninitiativen the agricultural industry, despite the prohibition of small kastenständen adopted for sows and calves, with 62% of the vote.</seg>
<seg id=1698> Neither Florida or Arizona are particularly progressive States -- in both George W. Bush defeated 2004 John Kerry its competitors.</seg>
<seg id=1699> The results of votes to the conclusion that the majority of Americans, they would have the opportunity to vote on it - would ban the position of trächtigen sows and calves in close buffalo sheds.</seg>
<seg id=1700> The Americans seems to be a matter of concern for animal welfare, as well as the Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1701> So, in order to explain the gap between Europe and the United States in terms of nutztierschutz, we should take the political system.</seg>
<seg id=1702> In Europe it to communicate the concerns of voters in the area of animal welfare to sit in the various countries and to the members of the European Parliament. Tierschutzgesetzen that led to the national and European directives that take account of these concerns.</seg>
<seg id=1703> On the contrary, in the United States in the area of animal welfare concerns not measurable impact on the US Congress.</seg>
<seg id=1704> Yet neither on at the level of the Member States there is legislation on the protection of animals.</seg>
<seg id=1705> The reason for this is, in my view, on that representatives of the industry are able to pass millions of dollars into the pockets of the US Congress, which would like to be re-elected.</seg>
<seg id=1706> In the field of lobbying campaign contributions and the tierschutzbewegung could not keep up with these guidelines, despite widespread public support.</seg>
<seg id=1707> In the American electoral system money is more important than the opinion of the electorate.</seg>
<seg id=1708> The party discipline is weak and they must find the money for their re-election itself -- and elections are in the case of the House of Representatives every two years.</seg>
<seg id=1709> In Europe, where the party discipline strong and not the candidate, but the parties campaigns, money is a smaller role.</seg>
<seg id=1710> In the US, where we are so proud of its democratic traditions, pigs and calves are probably the only losers.</seg>
<seg id=1711> What is new about the new Afghan all-parteien-armee?</seg>
<seg id=1712> (the murder of the Afghan luftfahrtministers by a mob instigated by the Afghan Interim Government itself shows that the Afghan society is deeply divided.</seg>
<seg id=1713> The first reforms in the Afghan army will deepen these divisions.</seg>
<seg id=1714> In the Defence Minister Hamid Karzai's government in Kabul has appointed the highest this new army officers.</seg>
<seg id=1715> The Minister, General Mohammed fahim, a tadschike from the northern region pandschir revenue, three months command of the troops of the Alliance, the Kabul, after you had opened the way for American bombers.</seg>
<seg id=1716> His appointment as a direct threat to Karzai's intentions to unite the country.</seg>
<seg id=1717> Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic state, in which the Pashtuns with two-fifths form the majority of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1718> One fifth of the population and hezaras Tajiks.</seg>
<seg id=1719> Of the 38 by fahim's officers in the generalsrang thirty-seven Tajiks, and a usbeke.</seg>
<seg id=1720> All the members of the military eingezogene 15 to 17 million ethnic group will serve the Pashtuns, under a command structure, the almost exclusively consists of Tajiks.</seg>
<seg id=1721> The language of Pashtuns is different from that of Tajiks, however, just as much as English of Spanish and millions of Pashtuns at best fit for fragmented knowledge of the language of Tajikistan.</seg>
<seg id=1722> The geographical origin of the new military leadership is closely, as well as its ethnic profile.</seg>
<seg id=1723> Thirty-five 38 of officers from the region Kabul, to the north of the province of parwan (where the airport Baghram is), and the Middle pandschir-tal, the former stronghold of the Northern Alliance.</seg>
<seg id=1724> In other words, this means that a total of 27 rulers remained closed twenty-nine Afghan provinces the doors to new military leadership of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1725> Perhaps a limited group could the impression that it is to bring about a clique, even if they are at least one representative of the more than a dozen Afghan parties.</seg>
<seg id=1726> But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id=1727> Eighteen 38 of the highest officers come from the jamiat-e-islami, an Islamic Party, led by the former, for a long time theologieprofessor ousted Mullah burhanuddin Rabbani, classify me.</seg>
<seg id=1728> This party ruled the mid-1990s of the last century for a short time in Kabul and the chaos and bloodshed, the most Afghans led to welcome the arrival of the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id=1729> Almost as many Members of the armeeführung come from the Communist camp.</seg>
<seg id=1730> Of the 38 sixteen officers were associated with this party whose tricks in the late 1970s of the last century to the Soviet invasion between 1979 and 1989, which claimed the lives of two and a half million Afghans.</seg>
<seg id=1731> Today, the Communists in Afghanistan are as popular as Hitler ’ s Nazis in the Czech Republic and Poland.</seg>
<seg id=1732> Of course, the people of Afghanistan joined, as elsewhere, the Communist Party, for all sorts of reasons, and were not all convinced ideologues.</seg>
<seg id=1733> But six of fahim's generals were professional staff of the Communist Party and the invasion of the Red Army in the services of the Communists.</seg>
<seg id=1734> These six men and another three communists who served in the Afghan army officers, as in the ten years of collaborating with the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=1735> Imagine, as the French would have reacted if a quarter of the French integrated officer corps after the Second World War kollaboriert during the Wehrmacht with the occupation of France.</seg>
<seg id=1736> In Afghanistan news by mundpropaganda spread fairly quickly.</seg>
<seg id=1737> So Afghan nationalists (which almost all Afghans) soon on the political background of fahim's generals know if they do not do so already.</seg>
<seg id=1738> Even this overwhelming evidence for the prohibition of unilateralism and selective armeekommandos could, at least if the generals must professionalism and commitment to patriotic values in their work.</seg>
<seg id=1739> Unfortunately, but only ten fahim 38 of the individual officers have a military background.</seg>
<seg id=1740> A pilot was previously.</seg>
<seg id=1741> By contrast, twenty-four (the background of four generals is unknown in the civil field, either from the academic from Communist parteistuben or, in the case of a former mullahs, from the religious area.</seg>
<seg id=1742> What are the consequences of these statistical data on the reality?</seg>
<seg id=1743> First, it means that the commander of the international peacekeeping troops in Afghanistan, American military and diplomatic will take in the event of a meeting with the Afghan vizeverteidigungsminister, dostum Abdul Rashid, for his brutality and corruption and communists notorious warlords still with old friends in the Red Army in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id=1744> It means that the Afghan commander-in-chief of the armed forces, as well as the chief of staff and the head of the Enlightenment, Communists loyalties are uncertain and which most Afghans distrust.</seg>
<seg id=1745> It is a with such a team of this war zerrissene country?</seg>
<seg id=1746> The presence of such dubious team in Kabul is likely to win the confidence of three quarters of the Afghan population, which remained in the appointment of the armeekommandos,?</seg>
<seg id=1747> Now, or whose interests have been so cynically is not that list of appointed), the expression of a führungsstils after the 'everything for the winner? "is not such an approach to the risk of (at some point in the future, a bloody reaction of?</seg>
<seg id=1748> Before you agree with this unscrupulous quest for power by a small minority and unpopular, the United Nations should look European and American leaders on the answers to these questions.</seg>
<seg id=1749> The irrationality to Honor</seg>
<seg id=1750> Yet a high on the new Nobel laureate economist, Daniel kahneman and princeton University's Vernon Smith of George mason university in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id=1751> Like many other Nobel prizes to pay tribute to those not only the work of befruchtende kahneman and blacksmith itself, but also the schools, whose leaders to help.</seg>
<seg id=1752> Kahneman is psychologist. He has shown how people behave far less rational systematically than you suggest orthodox economists.</seg>
<seg id=1753> His research not only demonstrates that individuals are sometimes very different than it the prevailing theory, but also that it regularly, and to do so in a way that we understand other hypotheses and interpret these hypotheses can compete with those who use the orthodox economists.</seg>
<seg id=1754> For the majority of operators, particularly for simple observers -- and this seems to be a great news.</seg>
<seg id=1755> The broker on Wall Street, which are with shares they know that they exploit the irrationality waste, have been set out, kahneman and blacksmith.</seg>
<seg id=1756> A large proportion of the obsession that led to the financial bubble in the economy, was based on exploiting the psychology of investors.</seg>
<seg id=1757> Indeed, this irrationality is no news for berufsökonomen.</seg>
<seg id=1758> John Maynard Keynes described are not long ago the stock market as an area in which individuals rational trading, to the foundations of the market, but rather as a kind of beauty contest, in which the best guess is that the panel will decide.</seg>
<seg id=1759> The Nobel Prize this year is one of the criticisms of the simplified marktwirtschaftslehre, just as it was the price in the last year of the three winners I (a).</seg>
<seg id=1760> The winner of last year, that different operators have different) (and imperfect information, and that the inequality of their informationsstandes has a huge impact on the functioning of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1761> In particular, the winner of last year showed that markets do not work efficiently in general, and therefore remains an important role to play the government.</seg>
<seg id=1762> Adam Smith's invisible hand -- the idea that free markets led by the invisible hand is not -- on sound, because you zumteil, at least, there is not.</seg>
<seg id=1763> This is nothing new (for the working day after day in the market and to make their assets that it from the inequality of market development to draw benefits or by this).</seg>
<seg id=1764> For more than 20 years, so-called "models rational" in the right approach economists. The models assume that all operators can have the same (if not a perfect information act) and rational that the markets are fully efficient, and that there are no unemployment (if not trade unions) greedy or governments such as the establishment of minimum wages; never before a kreditverknappung in them.</seg>
<seg id=1765> Such models that particularly in the universities, despite all the rebuttal of America's concern about science shows that ideology with triumphed.</seg>
<seg id=1766> Unfortunately, such aufbaustudienprogramme students are now in many countries as politicians to try and because of ideas, so that we called it market fundamentalism to implement programmes.</seg>
<seg id=1767> To put it bluntly, the models rational expectations have contributed to the fundamental economic theory; the consequence of their supporters have applied to the economic thinking, helped to identify the weaknesses of many fundamental hypotheses.</seg>
<seg id=1768> Good Science recognises its own borders, but the prophet models rational expectations are not usually see such a modest.</seg>
<seg id=1769> Vernon Smith was a leader in the development of the economy, experimental is based on the idea that we can be many wirtschaftstheoretische claims in certain arrangements in the laboratory.</seg>
<seg id=1770> One reason is that the economy is such a difficult and that there is so little agreement among economists that economists are not controlled experiments, therefore.</seg>
<seg id=1771> Nature provides natural experiments. But in most cases they change in so many things so quickly that it is often difficult to unravel the cause of what was.</seg>
<seg id=1772> In principle, we can in a laboratory conduct controlled experiments more reliable and draw conclusions.</seg>
<seg id=1773> The critics of the experimental economy to remember that the subjects in the experimental situation bring thinking, from outside the versuchssituation. They believe that the experiments are therefore not as clean and the conclusions so clearly not as in science.</seg>
<seg id=1774> Nevertheless, economic experiments provide insights into a number of important issues, such as the improved management of auctions.</seg>
<seg id=1775> The most important result was that the irrationality of market participants, was at the heart of the work, kahneman's has repeatedly confirmed in the context of laboratory examinations.</seg>
<seg id=1776> The results of the economy rather amusing experimental are those who, on altruism and selfishness.</seg>
<seg id=1777> It shows (at least in experimental situations that people are not being selfish, such as the question of economists call it - with the exception of a group - is the economists of itself.</seg>
<seg id=1778> This is because the economy attracts discipline as individuals who are selfish, or because the economy contributes to the power to individuals and egoistic?</seg>
<seg id=1779> The answer is very security: a bit of both.</seg>
<seg id=1780> Probably to resolve the issue under the weight of the two hypotheses in relation to help each other future experimental research.</seg>
<seg id=1781> The Nobel Prize stresses how important it is that people and to study entire economies, as they are and not as we would like it to be.</seg>
<seg id=1782> Only if we understand the actual conduct of the people, we can hope to draw up a policy, which means that our economies work better.</seg>
<seg id=1783> Bush's evil intentions in energy policy</seg>
<seg id=1784> In one of the surrealeren meetings of this year's World Economic Forum in Davos declared experts from the oil industry that polar melting ice -- is the faster than someone predicted, not only a problem, but also a chance: large amounts of oil are now available.</seg>
<seg id=1785> Similarly, these experts acknowledge the fact that the United States (the International Convention on the law of the sea, which determines who has access to offshore-öl, and other rights of raw materials in the sea have not signed), a risk is with international conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1786> But they point to the benefits: the oil industry must ask not in their never-ending Congress seeking further oil reserves the right to plunder Alaska.</seg>
<seg id=1787> President George W. Bush has a sinister talent for the great message.</seg>
<seg id=1788> For years, is increasingly clear that something is not right with its energy policy.</seg>
<seg id=1789> By a former energiegesetz, which was dictated by the oil industry, members of his own party said that it was not a lobbyist "forgotten."</seg>
<seg id=1790> While it embraces the benefits of free market, Bush is only too happy to the energiebranche huge handouts, even if the United States are high deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1791> The market is failing in energy, but the government should in precisely the opposite direction, as the Bush administration has proposed.</seg>
<seg id=1792> The fact that the Americans -- not pay the full cost of the pollution resulting from their profligate use of energy -- particularly from their contribution to greenhouse gases, means that energy under price is offered, which in turn accept the excessive consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1793> The government must promote the protection of the environment, the system of prices and taxes -- by -- are an effective way.</seg>
<seg id=1794> But rather than the protection of the environment, Bush has pursued a policy that America auslaugt first and it is in the future dependent on foreign oil.</seg>
<seg id=1795> It is the demand that the major oil prices for windfall profits for the level and for many in the Middle East, which are not to America's friends is irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id=1796> Now, four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, Bush seems to be finally woken up in the reality of the growing dependence on America; in the soaring oil prices, it was difficult for him to say the consequences.</seg>
<seg id=1797> But the balance of his government steps to make things worse in the near future.</seg>
<seg id=1798> Bush still refuses to do something for the environment, and it has provided the technology to be permanent prayer will save us with very little money.</seg>
<seg id=1799> What are we to think of Bush's recently declared commitment to make America within 25 years to 75% of oil from the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id=1800> The message is clear: for investors to invest more in the development of reserves in the Middle East, with the ölquelle by far the least cost the world.</seg>
<seg id=1801> But without new investment in the development of reserves in the Middle East, the rise of energy consumption in the United States, China and elsewhere, that is the offer.</seg>
<seg id=1802> As if that were not enough, Bush danger, with its threat to impose sanctions against Iran in the supply of one of the greatest ölförderer interruptions to the world.</seg>
<seg id=1803> Since the weltölförderung has achieved its full capacity and prices are already more than twice as high as before the Iraq war, it is even higher profits for the ölbrache towards -- the only clear winner in Bush's Middle East policy.</seg>
<seg id=1804> After all, we should give Bush that he recognised that there is a problem.</seg>
<seg id=1805> But, as always, a more detailed analysis of his proposals is a further sleight of his government.</seg>
<seg id=1806> Not enough that he -- refuses to recognise the importance of global warming, to promote environmental protection and to provide sufficient resources to research, to make a real difference, Bush's superb promise to reduce the dependence on oil from the Middle East, is less important than it seems.</seg>
<seg id=1807> Because only 20% of the us-öls come from the Middle East, it could be achieved by a slight shift its einkaufspolitik.</seg>
<seg id=1808> But you would think that the Bush administration must certainly say that oil is in a global market.</seg>
<seg id=1809> Even if America to 100% would be independent of the nahostöl, a decline in the supply of oil from the Middle East could have devastating effects on the world price -- and on the American economy.</seg>
<seg id=1810> As so often in the Bush administration, there is no flattering explanation for the official policy.</seg>
<seg id=1811> Bush makes political trickery, it makes anti-Arab and antiiranischen sentiments in America?</seg>
<seg id=1812> Or is this just another example of incompetence and confusion?</seg>
<seg id=1813> After what we have seen in the last five years, the answer is probably that more than a little evil intentions and sheer incompetence.</seg>
<seg id=1814> The Chinese road map</seg>
<seg id=1815> China has adopted its eleventh five-year plan. Opens the way for the continuation of the probably most notable economic change in history.</seg>
<seg id=1816> At the same time, the welfare of almost a quarter of the world's population is promoted. The world has never seen such sustainable growth, and never before has been reduced poverty in such a scale.</seg>
<seg id=1817> Part of the long-term success of China is due to his almost unique combination of pragmatism and vision.</seg>
<seg id=1818> While much of the developing countries, through the Washington consensus unrealistic increases in the direction of GDP, China once again made it clear that it is a more sustainable and fair distribution of raising living standards.</seg>
<seg id=1819> In China it recognizes that it has reached a phase of economic growth, in which there is huge -- and unacceptable -- burden on the environment.</seg>
<seg id=1820> Without changes in the standard of living is at risk.</seg>
<seg id=1821> For this reason, a focus of the new five-year plan is on the environment.</seg>
<seg id=1822> Even more backward areas of China's growing in a speed that would, if not a miracle other parts of the country were to grow faster.</seg>
<seg id=1823> While it could be reduced poverty, inequality, however, with the growing differences between town and country and between coastal and inland.</seg>
<seg id=1824> This year's report on human development from the World Bank explains why not only poverty, but also the inequality should be a cause of China and the eleventh five-year plan is determined to this problem.</seg>
<seg id=1825> The government has discussed several years of a more harmonious society and the plan sets ambitious programmes, in order to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id=1826> Moreover, it is in China, that the difference between developing and developed countries is not only in a gap of resources, but in a gap of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1827> So it is bold plans drawn up in China, not only to close this gap, but also to create a basis for independent innovation.</seg>
<seg id=1828> China's role in the world and the world economy has changed, and this will also be taken into account in this five-year plan.</seg>
<seg id=1829> The future growth will not so much on exports, but on the domestic demand, hence the need to boost consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1830> Indeed, China has to contend with a rare problem: a glut savings.</seg>
<seg id=1831> China's people save in part because of the weaknesses in the state social security system, a strengthening of the social security) (pensions and health and education system will also contribute to reducing social inequalities, improve the well-being of the citizens and the current consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1832> If -- and, until now, China has even surpassed its own ambitions almost always -- these changes could lead to enormous burden on a world economic system by the huge American fiscal and trade deficits is already unbalanced.</seg>
<seg id=1833> If less savings in China, and if, as announced of a broad range of investment strategy for its reserves -- who will finance the us current-account deficit of about $2 billion a day?</seg>
<seg id=1834> This issue is not at present, but it could be soon.</seg>
<seg id=1835> Despite the clear vision the challenge lies in the implementation of the strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1836> China is a great country, and it would not have come this far, if it were not for the widespread decentralisation.</seg>
<seg id=1837> However, its own problems arise from the decentralisation.</seg>
<seg id=1838> Greenhouse gases, for example, are a global problem.</seg>
<seg id=1839> While America says that it could not afford to do something about it, the Chinese authorities have acted more responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1840> Within one month after the adoption of the plan new taxes on cars were introduced, petrol and wood products, China is used market-based mechanisms in order to tackle the problems of the country and the world.</seg>
<seg id=1841> The pressure on local government officials, economic growth and jobs to produce, but it will be enormous.</seg>
<seg id=1842> They will be subject to the temptation to say that, if America cannot be environmentally friendly production, as it is to function in China?</seg>
<seg id=1843> In order to implement vision, the Chinese Government will need sound policies, including the imported taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1844> With the development of China in the way of a market economy, the country had to conceal problems which have developed countries: the selfish interests, arguments thin from behind a veil ideology.</seg>
<seg id=1845> Some of the so-called "trickle-down-economy", for a system in which the prosperity of top-down leaked to the poor: we do not worry, because, ultimately, all benefit from economic growth.</seg>
<seg id=1846> Others will turn against competition policy and strict unternehmensführungsgesetze: we will only Darwin's selektionstheorie perform its miracles.</seg>
<seg id=1847> In order to tackle strong social and environmental strategies that are wachstumsargumente: higher fuel taxes, for example, would destroy our emerging car industry.</seg>
<seg id=1848> With such strategies are supposedly, growth-oriented would not only lead to a growth, but also the whole vision of China's future threat.</seg>
<seg id=1849> There is only one way to prevent the: open discussions on economic policies to expose errors and room for creative solutions to the many challenges facing China today.</seg>
<seg id=1850> George W. Bush of the dangers of excessive secrecy and a decision-making have demonstrated in a small zirkels of kriechern.</seg>
<seg id=1851> Contrary to Bush's tactics to the extent of the extensive discussions and meetings of the Chinese leadership to foreigners) (even in search of solutions for the enormous problems, not by the majority of people outside China not really appreciated.</seg>
<seg id=1852> Market economies are not self-executing.</seg>
<seg id=1853> It is not simply on automatic pilot, especially if the benefits to achieve the greatest possible visibility.</seg>
<seg id=1854> The management of a market economy, however, is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id=1855> It is a balancing act, which has constantly to respond to economic change.</seg>
<seg id=1856> China is the eleventh five-year plan should have a roadmap for these reactions.</seg>
<seg id=1857> The world is looking in awe in China and hope, as the lives of 1.3 billion people will change.</seg>
<seg id=1858> Tocquevilles democratic lessons</seg>
<seg id=1859> It is only reasonable that the world today debated, 200 years after the birth Alexis de tocquevilles, because of the war in Iraq on the nature of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1860> Tocqueville deserves the glory that he rejected the reactionary yearning for the past and the triumph of democracy as our destiny -- and at the same time, the risks warned that democracy for freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1861> We should share his concern still?</seg>
<seg id=1862> Democracy is shaping Tocqueville, not only as a political herrschaftsform, but primarily as an intellectual laws that the habits and customs a society in general. So that it gave the concept of a social and psychological dimension.</seg>
<seg id=1863> Democratic systems, argued Tocqueville, our thoughts, desires and passions.</seg>
<seg id=1864> Just as the Renaissance, and in the 20th century, the sovieticus at the "democratic" man is a form of human being.</seg>
<seg id=1865> Tocqueville was of the opinion that the systemic effects of democracy means that the citizens reject the common sense.</seg>
<seg id=1866> They would only claim that events and values to assess independently, in reality, however, only the brute simplizistischen opinions and the masses.</seg>
<seg id=1867> Indeed, as Tocqueville "social called," the power to public opinion in democratic systems, probably most severe -- a view, the increase in the number of demagogy and medienmanipulation modern away.</seg>
<seg id=1868> Tocqueville believed that it is not in the long term, effective ways to curb this trend.</seg>
<seg id=1869> Neither democracy nor small local societies, mutual state control rights could stop the decline of the critical thinking, seem to democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1870> Schools could be little more than enclaves within the corrosive power of the social impact on the functioning of the thinking.</seg>
<seg id=1871> Similarly, if there is also Tocqueville believed that the pursuit of virtue in terms of ancient or a religious believe the soul, a conflict between two and the democratic ideal, if they were imposed on public life.</seg>
<seg id=1872> In this sense, the neomarxistischen theorists schools, and the Hannah Arendt fearful of all, above all else, the collapse of reason in modern societies are tocquevilles intellectual heirs.</seg>
<seg id=1873> Indeed, the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet) was a recently published book entitled elle-même contre la démocratie (democracy against itself.</seg>
<seg id=1874> The democratic way of life, argue that authors, tends to destroy the independent thinking and to suppress the "high culture"; the result is a mediocrity, the citizens vulnerable to the enemies of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1875> But while the history is full of murderous regimes, which eingeschüchterte and getäuschte masses, just like the greater danger for democratic nations is that their citizens to withdraw a direct satisfying their needs in apathy and short-term thinking.</seg>
<seg id=1876> The past is, despite the rituals, a reminder of the historic moments blurred -- by looking for the present and the new.</seg>
<seg id=1877> Even the supposedly educated ruling class is this betörung.</seg>
<seg id=1878> At the heart of the democratic spirit is its lack of historical awareness.</seg>
<seg id=1879> The lack of democracy, the only -- that is, as Tocqueville said, but realistic unsustainable -- way that is open to us, a schicksalsergebener pessimism?</seg>
<seg id=1880> I think not.</seg>
<seg id=1881> There are ways to combat what we could call "as a growing democratic stupidity."</seg>
<seg id=1882> The first line of defence is trying to an education system that is genuinely critical heads of today) (mostly neglected subjects of literature, history and philosophy.</seg>
<seg id=1883> If we want wohlinformierte and critical people be used as democracy needs them, must stop our schools, the latest modeerscheinungen and begin to raise the analytical capabilities of pupils.</seg>
<seg id=1884> The greatest obstacle to the road to this form of education are the media with their tendency to cultivation of superficial and meet.</seg>
<seg id=1885> Many people spend a more of their lives in front of the television than in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id=1886> The passivity, encourage the mass media, is diametrically opposed to that active commitment to the democratic era of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1887> However, it is difficult to imagine that the mass media would be (by demanding newspapers apart from its own initiative to instruments of education, the ability of the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1888> This concern with regard to the media is not just a elitistische disregard for the popular culture.</seg>
<seg id=1889> The question is not only the popularity, in its time Mozart was popular Shakespeare's lockten plays and the poor and the rich -- but the refusal to challenge the culture and to provoke the thinking.</seg>
<seg id=1890> The result of this failure is a general indifference and passivity of the audience.</seg>
<seg id=1891> Indeed, a globalised literacy unable to promote the ability to critical thinking is or producing higher feelings, for a long time on the march.</seg>
<seg id=1892> It is a culture that afford threatened by their democratic freedoms, because they failed to produce any form of -- there is a sense of responsibility towards society, or the history of the Community.</seg>
<seg id=1893> It is too late to do something about a culture that being the spirit in this way?</seg>
<seg id=1894> The elites Tocqueville disparaged its time for complacency in view of the entwurzelnden power of the massendemokratie.</seg>
<seg id=1895> The short-sightedness of our leaders to let its worrying prophecy reality?</seg>
<seg id=1896> A Europe for all</seg>
<seg id=1897> Entrenched members of the European Union now seem to have doubts about the future of the Union, on the other hand, we look with hope and admiration in Ukraine to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1898> The basic objective of our foreign policy is to participate in the progress of the EU, because Ukraine has stated that national unity does not end, but a beginning.</seg>
<seg id=1899> The European unity is indivisible: if a nation is excluded, are all again devolving competences upon an agency.</seg>
<seg id=1900> We Europeans are caught in a network unentrinnbar, our fates are intertwined.</seg>
<seg id=1901> Every aspect of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, as us.</seg>
<seg id=1902> As far as a European country, directly affects all indirectly.</seg>
<seg id=1903> We cannot afford to close the idea of two Europe -- the haves and the have-nots, the man and the pollutants -- never again.</seg>
<seg id=1904> All those who live on the European continent, of course, they must not be excluded from the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1905> The current major European peace and today's European prosperity depend on that.</seg>
<seg id=1906> Of course, some mutter that Ukraine is not Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1907> They come to Kiev and talk to the people, young and old, with factory workers, bauernfrauen, lawyers, doctors and teachers, for the last winter in the cold and snow and gathered in order to defend their freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1908> They are not linked to the General de Gaulle colleague fell ill in the French opposition?</seg>
<seg id=1909> They are not one with those who died in the fight for the Spanish Republic in the 1930's, which ended in Budapest in 1956 and fascism liberated in Spain and Portugal in the 1970's?</seg>
<seg id=1910> They are not the same as solidarnosc-bewegung spirit of Poland and the peaceful masses, who have in 1989, the Velvet Revolution in Prague?</seg>
<seg id=1911> This is the true European spirit, and no doubt can break it.</seg>
<seg id=1912> Those who believe that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership, I say: you in my country and look at the mothers, remain in the work of the late in the evening and their children to their firmenrechner used as a computer.</seg>
<seg id=1913> They should be in the village language in each and every town where young people prepare for Europe to learn French, German and English.</seg>
<seg id=1914> Those who have doubts about the European affiliation of Ukraine, should understand that Europe is not a question of hardware and motorways. It is the insatiable desire for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=1915> I believe that our future is promising, as Europe's past is proud, and that we must not be forgotten frontier deadlines our fate in a troubled region, but that we will shape peace and unity of Europe as a doer.</seg>
<seg id=1916> Self-determination is no longer synonymous with isolation, because the achievement of the national independence is only the return on the world stage with a new status.</seg>
<seg id=1917> New nations can build on their former occupiers productive relationship with a similar, such as France, Germany -- a relationship based on equality and mutual interests.</seg>
<seg id=1918> My government is trying to build a relationship with Russia, and by achieving this, we can contribute to the enlargement of the European area in which there is peace.</seg>
<seg id=1919> Of course, it is too early to do more than the high, and this is the prospect of membership.</seg>
<seg id=1920> We know that this is not part of this great buildings built overnight.</seg>
<seg id=1921> We know that the great achievements of the European Union are not to be found in documents and declarations, but in innovative steps to improve the lives of all Europeans and their security.</seg>
<seg id=1922> It will not be easy, to be done cheaply and quickly to build a Ukraine that is worthy of EU membership.</seg>
<seg id=1923> But, as the EU itself will be built up and completed.</seg>
<seg id=1924> We know that this is a great challenge, but the price worth the effort, and Europe should know that this is our objective.</seg>
<seg id=1925> The erneuerungsarbeit Ukraine is partly from a creative fight to put an end to a alptraumhaftes century ideologies -- fascism and communism, born in the heart of Europe -- tried to gain the upper hand.</seg>
<seg id=1926> Only a few months ago our children and parents in towns everywhere in Ukraine were armed forces knurrenden dogs and even death.</seg>
<seg id=1927> Only a few years ago, the young journalist Georgiy Gongadze who wanted to raise public awareness about the corruption of the old regime, has been abused by the thugs and face beheading of the regime.</seg>
<seg id=1928> But our orange revolution of the last winter shows that the Ukrainian people have won.</seg>
<seg id=1929> That is why I am despite today's doubts and difficulties in my unshakeable belief in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1930> I refuse to accept desperation as the last answer to the confused and cruel history of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id=1931> I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is tied to the tragic to the sternenlose night of communist heritage that we can never see the brilliant morgendämmerung of peace and of true European unity.</seg>
<seg id=1932> If the EU citizens to think about the place of Ukraine in Europe, they should look behind the facade, you see, you should consider it but also.</seg>
<seg id=1933> They should vorbeisehen over the devastated caused the communism, poverty and social disparities, with which our has-beens former leaders have tried to extend their mismanagement.</seg>
<seg id=1934> Instead, you should look at the face of our President Viktor Yushchenko, distorted the last year in the election campaign by a giftangriff and recall the words of the great French André Malraux, "the most beautiful faces are injured."</seg>
<seg id=1935> The Muslim civil war</seg>
<seg id=1936> The gap between Sunni and Shiite Muslims in the Middle East is deeper than the enmity between Israel and the Arabs?</seg>
<seg id=1937> In view of the reaction of some Arab governments to the decision of Hezbollah attacking Israel, it.</seg>
<seg id=1938> Even as Israeli bombs dropped to Beirut, and tyrus, Saudi Arabia, perhaps the most conservative arabisch-muslimische state of all the actions of the Shiite Hezbollah, which was condemned the conflict with Israel.</seg>
<seg id=1939> Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict a State that regards itself as a leader of the Arab / Muslim peoples, Israel has openly supported.</seg>
<seg id=1940> Moreover, Saudi Arabia's break with Hezbollah is not an isolated case.</seg>
<seg id=1941> Egypt and Jordan have condemned the Hezbollah and its leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, for their bravado.</seg>
<seg id=1942> What is behind this spectacular development?</seg>
<seg id=1943> We are witnessing a fundamental change in the relationship between arabischem nationalism and Islamic sectarianism?</seg>
<seg id=1944> Power of the Sunni, Shia Islam the Saudi government more and fear, as you are committed to the Arab unity and the Palestinian cause?</seg>
<seg id=1945> The Arab condemnations of Hezbollah suggests that the gap between the Muslim religions, which is the daily violence in Iraq, the Middle East and intensified.</seg>
<seg id=1946> President George W. Bush's desire to make the rigid societies in the Arab world, the modernizing forces against the traditional elements in the Arab and Islamic societies.</seg>
<seg id=1947> Instead, he seems to have unleashed the most atavistic forces in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1948> This could open the Pandora's box ushered in a new and more hässlichere era of general violence, perhaps you can only be described as "Muslim war '.</seg>
<seg id=1949> The gap between Sunni and Shiite since the beginning of Islam, but the geographical and ethnic isolation of the nichtarabischen Shiite Iran has come together with the rule sunnitisch-arabischer countries on their Shiite minorities this rivalry.</seg>
<seg id=1950> The tensions have in the wake of the "Islamization", which was created by the Iranian revolution, since the konfessionsgebundene identity of the Sunni Arabs, was in the context of a general, while hervortrat "Islamic" self-confidence.</seg>
<seg id=1951> All of this changed when Al Qaeda, a Sunni terrorist group that much of the wahabitischen ideology and the staff of the Saudis, America has adopted in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1952> A Sunni explicitly variant of militant Islam was on the increase.</seg>
<seg id=1953> The fact that the United States declared Sunni both the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Sunni Iraqi regime encouraged the war, this new, radical Sunni trend.</seg>
<seg id=1954> The newly independent Sunni Arabs are Israel and the West as a threat, and the other is the so-called "Shi'a Crescent" -- the landbogen that extends from Lebanon and Syria and Iraq to Iran and inhabited by the supposedly häretischen Shi'ites.</seg>
<seg id=1955> As the guardian of the most sacred sites of the Muslim faith in Mecca and Medina the rulers of Saudi Arabia is perhaps the most impassioned this threat.</seg>
<seg id=1956> In the eyes of the Shia, Sunnis, not only on the oil-rich regions in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the East, but also try -- by the actions of Hezbollah -- the role of the "schutzherrn" of the central dream of all Arabs in itself, the Palestinian question.</seg>
<seg id=1957> Because the Saudi Royal deriving its legitimacy of a form of Sunni Islam and its Shi-ite population loyalty to the US, the UK has appealed against Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id=1958> Ironically, it was for a long time, America, Saudi Arabia's protector, which provided the power of the Shia, it has fallen by Saddam Hussein and Shiite parties in Iraq to power.</seg>
<seg id=1959> The Bush administration seems to realize what it has done, while the Shiite barrel in the east of the Arab / Muslim world, the United States aufspannt try to strengthen the protection of the Sunni arc -- Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia -- in the West in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1960> Israel, once the implacable enemy of Arab seems to be embedded now in the middle of the defence structures.</seg>
<seg id=1961> But this is verteidigungsstellung because of pan-Arab feelings unstable.</seg>
<seg id=1962> At the moment, ordinary citizens from Saudi Al Jazeera and other Arab satelliten-fernsehsendern put to follow events in Gaza and Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id=1963> They see Arab authority) (not only the bloodshed and fighting against Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id=1964> In their eyes, Hezbollah is a model for heroic resistance.</seg>
<seg id=1965> This has prompted the Saudi state to deepen the divisions between Sunni and Shiite Muslims.</seg>
<seg id=1966> After the Kingdom had officially reprimanded Hezbollah, the Saudi state called on its official wahabitischen clerics fatwas to state that Hezbollah as heretics and condemn Shi'a apostates.</seg>
<seg id=1967> Such convictions can only Saudi Arabia and religious divisions within the region.</seg>
<seg id=1968> The Sunni regimes, if these differences will deepen, to believe that they need their own Hezbollah to fight in their regions?</seg>
<seg id=1969> If they are to achieve this end, they need to look for a long time, because many of those who have already been trained -- of Al Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id=1970> Europe must not forget Georgia</seg>
<seg id=1971> The times in which Europe could count on America is Europe ’ s backyard wars that peace and introduce democracy is over.</seg>
<seg id=1972> To see the enlargement of the European Union and, as well as in the recent Russian gas crisis, not only Ukraine belongs to this backyard, but also Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1973> As in Ukraine, democracy is now in Georgia and Europe cannot afford to ignore this development.</seg>
<seg id=1974> Georgia was the first post-Soviet country in which there was a "color revolutions" and where people demonstrated their choice for democracy and European values with dignity and maturity.</seg>
<seg id=1975> The waving flags since then, the European Union, which at all public buildings in Georgia, a natural ties to Europe, which dates back as far as the history of a country that has since the time of ancient Greece a permanent component of the old world.</seg>
<seg id=1976> Prometheus, medea, and the amazonen Noah's ark in neighbouring Armenia show that European myths took from here.</seg>
<seg id=1977> With its history, culture and traditions -- including the critical, independent and even rebellious spirit from the days of belonging to the former Soviet Union is Georgia -- would be the ideal candidate for a successful democratization.</seg>
<seg id=1978> So it is all the more serious that this democratisation fails.</seg>
<seg id=1979> It all began as well.</seg>
<seg id=1980> Political reforms, anti-korruptionsmaßnahmen privatization, the search for new links with the former regime clean leaders and the introduction of a pro-European foreign policy with no resistance.</seg>
<seg id=1981> However, the totalitarian attitude of some leaders is again today, under the pretext to represent the will of the majority, more and more power.</seg>
<seg id=1982> Similarly, in the ancient Greek Hydra the political elite of Georgia is emerging over and over again.</seg>
<seg id=1983> The very people and herrschaftspraktiken, which we want to get rid of the "rose revolution" in November 2003, are now back to seize power. They use their networks operate on the borders of Georgia and its fantastic wealth and their talents in political intrigue and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id=1984> This has little to do with a real democracy, not only by elections, but also by separation of powers.</seg>
<seg id=1985> The government is interfering in the affairs of Parliament, which, in turn, for its part, is trying to control the government in detail -- in my case, the attempt to determine the nomination of ambassadors and their House.</seg>
<seg id=1986> A schwerwiegenderes problem is the lack of judicial independence, and the rule of law and much-needed private investment.</seg>
<seg id=1987> The Georgian democracy exists in mind, but not the heart: the people's policy is still a dirty business, those who are left to the ground, which should have long been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id=1988> The hope of democracy is in people, the organisations of civil society and deeply rooted in the media.</seg>
<seg id=1989> It is now up to Europe to ensure that this hope not cease to apply.</seg>
<seg id=1990> The United States has done everything in its power to support the political stability in Georgia since independence.</seg>
<seg id=1991> During the term of Edvard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister, who lost his Presidency during the Rose Revolution was not always the same, of course, with democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1992> But the Americans generous invested in the survival of democratic ideas and the proponents.</seg>
<seg id=1993> Although the Rose Revolution not as Russian nationalists, the work of the financier George Soros Foundation was supported this has promoted the democratic foundations, encouraged and supported.</seg>
<seg id=1994> For the consolidation of its democracy but Georgia needs a different kind of support more Europe can offer.</seg>
<seg id=1995> The balance of power, the practice in justice and local democracy must be made on the basis of European models of the Georgian reality, rather than the Anglo-Saxon models American mould.</seg>
<seg id=1996> With a rejection of this challenge, Europe would its fundamental responsibility to betray a small, Mediterranean, flexible country with old traditions, where democracy has a much greater chance of success than in the vast and still the Soviet spirit arrested Ukraine, to say nothing of Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1997> The refusal to support Georgia's struggle for democracy is very likely delay the democratic process in Ukraine, Belarus, and even in Russia itself.</seg>
<seg id=1998> It is therefore more at stake.</seg>
<seg id=1999> Although Russia had abandoning its großmachtträumen, ladies and never had to accept the inevitability of democracy, at least at the frontiers.</seg>
<seg id=2000> But this reluctant acceptance of some degree of normality in relations with its neighbors has always been vulnerable to the sudden wiederausbruch of Russia's famous "irrational derschawa" -- an aggressive ethos that glorifies the state and its strength from the use of weaknesses of the other.</seg>
<seg id=2001> This is the key to understanding of the recent Russian gas crisis.</seg>
<seg id=2002> We can also be sure that any signs of a withdrawal of democracy in Georgia and other post-Soviet states will revive neoimperialistische Russia's ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=2003> It is the responsibility of Europe, to convince Russia that there is no hope of a return to the past.</seg>
<seg id=2004> Europe must accept this role, not only to ensure the independence of its future energy supply, but also to demonstrate that the European values of freedom, democracy and justice between peoples truly solid foundations.</seg>
<seg id=2005> In order to be successful, Europe must equip itself with the necessary tools to breathe: we need a large semi-public foundation for the promotion and support of political reforms, a university training managers in the future budding democracies and police forces, and the resulting host of judges and courts, those models, which we live.</seg>
<seg id=2006> But above all Europe needs conviction.</seg>
<seg id=2007> If this Europe cannot even today that it has a fundamental interest in the future of its neighbours, who will believe tomorrow in Europe?</seg>
