Racially divided Europe
In fact, the extreme right is its racism and that uses immigration issue in its political benefits.
Italy's lega nord, the Dutch vlaams bloc French Le penova National Front - all of this are examples of parties or movement vzešlých of common averze against immigrants and prosazujících simplistic view on how to address immigrants.
While individua like J??rg Haider or Jean-Marie Le Pen, and (never not enough), soon leave the question of race and racism of European policy only then will not disappear anytime.
For the growing racial roztříštěností in European countries, two factors: aging populations and otevírající the boundaries.
Right and left party concentrated around the political center schovávají before this problem capita in the sand doufajíce, despite all the immigration one itself disappears.
But it will not disappear to give the idea of American racial history.
Race relations stand in the United States have long decades in the center of political debate, and until the extent that racial divisions are as important as income, and often determined by political preferences and attitudes. Moreover,
The first step toward Communist takeover racial policy is understood počátkům and the consequences of racial intolerance, even if it means that, become clear home truths.
In the United States is about this postaraly massive economic sociologické, psychological and politologické surveys.
Comes from them, that people different race, are much less they trust their that white only unwilling to support the social costs, because they are seen as aid minorities, and that racially roztříštěná community have much less effective public administration, rampant corruption in them, protežování and crime, and is in them less productive public goods on one tax the dollar.
Of course, this does not mean that the solution is eliminated all heterogeneity and build racially homogeneous community, but that could start to build a solid public policy on the relations between the various rasami, we must first of all admit the existence of these problems.
Of course, nor Americans are in this regard united.
Some will have a positive discrimination that minorities admits preferences in hiring jobs at university, and in allocating public procurement.
This policy is not only be perceived as compensation for historical grievances, but also as a way to create a positive examples of human and curb continued, and perhaps bezděčné discrimination.
But it is, and many people who rail against positive discrimination and who argue that, for it to vznikala jobs for minorities and to the black family remained together, it requires only quality,, rasoslepá "policy, coupled with policies of the free market and the support of the family values.
Support for family values is crucial in any policy, for all the cause of poverty in the US is the huge amounts of households with one rodičem (that read: the free mother) within the black communities.
The solution may have, but here is mostly a that American policy to racial issue at least's stance.
Minority here, of course, a massive pokročily on the road to integration and economic success.
In the 1950's blacks not sit in front of autobusu; today, two blacks travel to the the top of the American foreign policy.
Extreme American politicians, of course, even now takticky use racial question as a political tool.
For example, patrick Buchanan, a former aide presidents nixona and Reagan, who in the US presidential election ran as an independent.
The recently succeed published a book entitled "dying the West" about how vymírající populations and invasion immigrants threaten America and Western civilization.
For every one such book, however, is ten other that America's racial question solving a serious analysis.
In Europe but political analysis and the debate about relations between the various rasami substantially is lagging.
In the best case on this issue speak greatly omezeně in terms of immigration quotas and border limits, and not in the sense of social problems and opportunities that racially smíšená Europe offers.
To stop the illegal immigrants, of course, is needed clear immigration policy.
The but it goes further: America's racial politics also přeci ends controls on the US-Mexican border!
Europe is rich and kvapem older. Europeans, protected generous social programs, refusing to do, "dirty work in agriculture or to be in kožařském industry.
The increase in immigrants is thus inevitable.
Europeans, but it never leave missed opportunity to America criticized for any of its failure in politics to minorities or for any sign of racism on the other side of the Atlantic.
When začteme into the European press, cannot be the nevšimnout a complex superiority to the United States in the issue of racial policy: they, Americans have with rasismem problems, we, Europeans, we are against him immune from, perhaps to poblázněné neonacisty and them similar.
But this to do in recent weeks came from Paris to Amsterdam, shows that rasový problem in Europe is much deeper and that just as in the US derived from the truth that race relations are the nature of complex and that trust and cooperation between human rasami is not always not self-evident, and easy.
Start, if the European political parties are all vážností and with invest in understanding of racial tensions in Europe and happen if the question of racial one of their main priority, vězme that individuals Le penova have will not be delayed with to this vacuum naplnili hate their message.
The battle with the exception of French
Europe is rightly focused attention on enlargement and the European Constitution, which currently vypracovávají EU member states.
For the fate of new and an enlarged Europe, however, will be equally important result of a few French rozmíšek with the European Commission.
France decided to that will be unilaterally ignore the Stability and Growth Pact, because its předpokládaný budget deficit highly beyond the 3% of GDP.
The French, like chlubí rational and střízlivým considerations, but when it comes to budgets, then descartese replaced confusion terms.
When the Irish government in 2000 reduce its budget surplus of 4% of GDP about half a mere%, France belonged to its leading critics.
The Stability Pact already porušily and other countries, but France is the first, who do so with pošklebky and open vzdorem.
But that would be no surprise.
France simply regulates rules of the EU undeserved habit of its own culture viewed as exceptional.
The French, for example, ustavičně vetují reforms of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.
But even children know that this policy is příjemným and completely nezaslouženým dárkem rich European (and particularly French farmers) at the expense of struggling farmers in developing countries and consumers in the EU.
France is also seek to return to the old politics resort non-profit private companies stojících on the verge of bankruptcy of money for taxpayers.
The EU Commissioner for Competition Mario Monti into such battles cannot lose: needs the support of those who believe in free market and equal conditions for all.
The story of this is simple.
The French government planning to save society alstom, which has developed a series of high technology products, including a French train tgv, but have recently declared bankruptcy.
The government claims that the plan on behalf of the alstomu never give up; he is not motivated by all well known dirigistickými motives: to maintain employment protection of investors, etc.
Moreover, because it is alstom technological companies, vytahuje the French government also card research and development and argues that investments in research and development stimulate growth.
Saving alstomu zestátněním is clearly wrong.
This society is composed of many different parts of the, some of which are profitable and other krachují: it would be so obvious firm divide.
Profitable part, such as tgv, merchant easy to find, while non-profit facilities should be closed.
Money French taxpayers would be more efficiently spent on temporary support dismissed workers than on subsidies that will keep alive unprofitable plant.
It is important to the European Commission neumožnila France ušít in the issue of competition policy on the special rules, as has clearly happening in the budget deficits.
The Commission must from state aid French private companies, as well as prevents subsidies in any other member country of the EU.
In this field by the Commission reached certain success, especially when forced Germany to zrušilo government guarantees on state owned banks.
France as a whole and firm alstom especially should not be exception and should follow the same standards.
If the Commission will act, the EU will become even more remind hřiště for French civil servants.
France's already took the lead role in the EU foreign policy, where Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin increasingly looks and acts as Secretary of State of Europe.
At the same time, France violated the rules of the key common economic policy and state aid private companies.
The European Commission remains loses its credibility and will eventually remind smaller pařížský obvod?
Defeat in the case of alstomu should for Europe profound implications - and not only on competition.
The war over oil
For decades America through democratic and Republican presidential administrations naplňuje in terms of oil politics several přímočarých goals: to maintain the world oil prices on what nejstabilnější level; what nejbezbolestněji reduce domestic consumption oil; to reduce the dependence on imports from abroad; diversify sources of oil importů.
While the so it may seem, none of these goals for the Bush administration change.
Many observers believe that Bush udal new direction, because it appears that the invasion of Iraq these goals completely protiřečí.
Substantial increase production in Iraq are likely to increase the US dependence on oil compared to other energy sources, because with respect to the new reserves probably oil prices fall.
This will mean increase in the US as a result of dependence on oil imports, especially from the Middle East.
Ironically, however, that the US should over the Iraqi oil sector much more power during pre-war program of the UN, oil-for-food "(within which not Saddam Hussein, but the UN určovala level sales of Iraqi oil abroad) than in the future will have a democratic Iraq.
If the Bush administration was it a permanent, secure, varied and cheap oil supplies, could simply lifting the embargo on Libya, Iran, Iraq, and Sudan and oil would only řinula.
America's interest in Iraqi oil, however, was not motivated by not economic, and energy policy.
The Bush Administration recognized that the Iraqi oil is primarily a critical geopolitical asset.
Who controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq.
Saddam's power means of that ovládal the world's largest oil supplies.
The role of the oil in his power sehrávala, very well appreciated.
When Saddam was forced to confront the invasion and defeat threaten zapálením Iraqi fields.
Much of a subsequent destroying and plunder oil equipment and pipelines in the country reflected widespread perception that dominate the oil means dominate Iraq.
At a time when the US plánovaly invasion, became a priority security oil fields.
The aim was to strengthen the oil supplies or reduce its prices for Americans, but to remove Saddam power and in posledku established and to consolidate the new Iraqi government.
The future of the Iraq directly depends on the fate of Iraq's oil production.
But the vrtochům oil industry, especially for such unstable conditions, it is difficult to predict how will be in the next few years, the Bush administration will be able to fulfill their goals in Iraq.
The logic is simple.
The US must oil revenues to use of America's tax burden plátců sejmuly funding of regime change in Iraq.
Any plans reconstruction rely in the long run on the ability to Iraq export large objemy oil.
If it fails Iraq oil zpeněžit, then President Bush cannot meet promises, which gave the Iraqi and the American people and the world community.
Invasion of Iraq's oil production capacity was three million barrels per day.
During the deadline, which is needed to the formation of the Iraqi government, it will be able to Iraq's increase in this level.
Every increase in Iraq's oil production will require preparation deposits to extract, so large investments legitimate parliamentary government and political stability.
Early realization these requirements to nor the Bush administration.
Political stability is the main for increase production capacity.
Historical experience from Iran, Kuwait, Russia, and even from the Iraq suggest that from rebuild political stability is needed about three years than capacity significantly) and the new, higher level of is here to stay.
Iraq needs a few years, to write a new constitution, created a legitimate democratic government sjednal division of oil revenues between individual regions, a new investment laws and made its economy přitažlivým for foreigners.
It also needs a time of negotiations with international oil companies and neighboring countries, on the technical analysis and studies proveditelnosti and for reconstruction, modernization and survey of its oil deposits.
As optimistic so seems even tříletý a framework that assumes that during the deadline end the occupation and Iraqis sestaví own democratic government and that will be achieved political stability.
The situation, of course, can develop completely different.
Tension can continue for years.
Moreover, should not surprise anyone would even this, even if under a democratic government production of Iraqi oil suddenly stopped.
History suggests that workers strikes and similar shocks that can extracting oil stopped, are greater threat in democratic than in undemocratic countries.
If Iraq fails to in the next few years its production capacity significantly raise becomes a this obstacle both foreign and energy policy, the US.
How will the US long-term reconstruction finance Iraq?
Who will pay efforts to preserve the fragile Iraq's democracy?
Will the US occupation for sustainable if unable to the Iraqi people food, health care, and other basic services?
It is a difficult questions that are essentially nezodpověditelné until in Iraq will be a stable, democratic regime capable of control and secure uninterrupted flow of oil exports.
Let murderers bdít of human rights
If it was so deeply depressing, the report might be šibeniční anekdotou Millennium: Libya was elected předsednickou countries of the Commission for human rights in the UN!
When caligula chose the Senate his horse had his horse at least on kopytech blood.
Of course, was utterly zákonný: the presidency of each year moving from one of the world region to another.
This year proposed a minister Africa and nominovala Libya.
Only voted against the US and Canada.
To their eternal hanbě European countries zdržely voting.
It is a telling commentary on file moral bankruptcy of the UN that this decision comes at the moment for organization and choulostivém.
President Bush called the UN to, has made clear that takes seriously their own binding decisions concerning Iraq: could not otherwise capture as neslavně as society nations that in the 1930s demonstrated a blundering, when should face aggressive political approaches Nazi Germany and Italy's fascist.
A right now Libya to head the body of the UN that responsible for human rights, barely help to strengthen the legitimacy and moral authority of the world's organization.
Recall: Libya is totalitarian tyranny. Its leader, Muammar kaddáfí, enriching their sometimes nevypočitatelné behavior extrémistickými political approaches and supports the world's dictators.
Stands in the forefront of one of the nejrepresivnějších regimes of the world, where at the polls nothing nepředstírá and dissent, it is constantly after krku.
Under his rule Libya helped terrorist organizations from around the world - from the IRA to different Palestinian extremist groups.
So far is under sanction because of the UN has played a role, ten years ago in pumovém the assassination of aircraft society panam over a Scottish Lockerbie.
In the past decade, the UN's status as a symbol of ideals peaceful world constantly zhoršovalo society.
The organization is demonstrated as completely unable to stop the war in the Balkans. But in at least one case - in Srebrenica, Dutch mírotvorné the UN force cost and přihlížely worst massacre in postwar Europe, when the Bosnian Serbs killed around six thousand bezbranných Muslim men.
The Dutch investigative commission later admit that their battalion the UN should on war crime complicity.
At a time when in Rwanda began to genocide, official UN responsible for the mírotvorné operations ordered evacuation of the UN troops from the country and ponechal fields completely open nejkrvavějšímu genocidnímu massacre since World War II.
This representative of the UN, Kofi Annan.
It is a severe and poor record in history, that the UN to - perhaps to no avail - undone by in the Iraq crisis appears as a voice of reason and international legitimacy.
But at a time when the UN inspections in Iraq remind army salvation vyslanou odpravit group alone, they get Libya to head of the Commission for human rights can classes in history as the eventual failure organization, whose lives began with so many expectations.
Organization usually do not die, and certainly is every reason for this, to ensure that the UN will kulhat further.
But it will only ghost what should and could be.
The United Nations no longer hypocrisy neodpáře.
Autoritáři before the Gates
Last čtvrtek me judges Indonesian central court in jakartě denounced to either in prison.
As the editor of the intelligence weekly rate was, according to the Court provinil nactiutrháním against business magnátovi name tomy winata that I indirectly signaled its possible share of the fire textile market for Southeast Asia in jakartě and that I proliferation lies podněcoval to riots.
It is my case and similar cases him in the end of the short-term experiment with democracy in Indonesia?
The "výtržnost," to that I supposedly podněcoval, have been in May 1998, when almost two centuries of hrdlořezů označujících for winatovy supporters přepadly kancelář weekly rate, threatening to vypálením buildings obtěžovaly workers and zranily one reportéra.
In an effort to help to peaceful resolution of the situation, I was to persuade to act on the central police station in jakartě, but to their terror, I found that the station check leaders that a mob.
Those me bili and kopali, while the police dívala elsewhere.
Fortunately, the US to help přispěchalo many journalists are zapnutými diktafony and kamerami.
Their broadcasting have led to the public outrage forced the parliament organize public hearings.
To him were předvoláni national and jakartský police chief and a mob leaders were on the basis of a strong pressure public accused of punitive action.
Winata itself but policejnímu investigations unikl, and not only on the basis of public statements that his followers acting without his the previous knowledge or consent.
Winata then showed their own criminal complaints on ahmada taufika that an article wrote teuku iskandara aliho that it editoval, and to me.
Celoroční proceedings then noted many suspect zvratů that virtually zvýhodňovaly winatu.
So mainly include žaloba sepsaná police and the state zástupcem as a tawdry way fraudulent documents that police with two of its own officers.
The Court, however, refused to our request to delay management until the objasní právoplatnost state sepsané claims.
The case of officers implicated in falšování appears leads to lost.
One of them was promoted to even chief of the newly constituted (and the United States funded) anti-terrorist troops in jakartě.
The second then was allegedly poslán at the police academia, where absolvuje advanced training.
The Sixth month projednávání claims was předsedající soudkyně in tříčlenném Senate suddenly povýšena on předsedkyni a court in the city vzdáleném hour jízdy from Jakarta.
One of my advokátů noted that for 35 years practice in the courts even never had to be předsedající judge fired from has an ongoing case.
Soudkyně, despite povýšení continue to předsedala court in another case projednávaném at the same budově.
It took place on released by judges, who in previous winatově občanskoprávní žalobě decided in against the pace.
Finally, the winata dopustil during svědecké testimony křivopřísežnictví when denied that would with him rate did conversation.
Before the Court was přehrán record of this telefonního conversation, the Court heard místopřísežnou svědeckou testimony reportéra, which led conversation, and two editors, who in, we are witnessing as evidence of the existence of a call was submitted to official record telephone society and technical witness have concluded that the voice on nahrávce really belongs tomymu winatovi.
Judges but rejected the request of the pace of to winata was arrested and tried for křivopřísežnictví, and told us that we have ohlásit on the police, which are made.
The judge then rejected and our request to delay the Court's decision to resolve the case winatova křivopřísežnictví.
Given so pochybenému management was my conviction and nepodmíněný punishment no surprise.
Still, however, neztrácím hope that ultimately not we win to begin to appeals heard courts higher rates of last resort.
Higher Indonesia's courts are cleaner and chairman of the Supreme Court is věrným supporter of democracy and freedom of the press. Case weekly rate might be památným victory of our democracy, just as it became famous decision US Supreme Court in the case, the New York Times vs. Sullivan.
By raising laťky for claims for nactiutrhání was the fact that America's journalists can hnát public officials to responsibility.
No country knows better than Indonesia that freedom of speech and freedom of the press are ověřenými ukazateli democratic development and that kriminalizace journalists is raný sign of authoritarianism.
In the 1950s was Indonesia liberal democracy, as long as in 1956 nezahájil President sukarno in support of the military campaign against the press.
Umlčení critical of the vote usnadnilo consolidate his unchecked power and in June 1959 declared sukarno controlled by the onset of "democracy".
Within a few years after the first sukarnově fall in 1966 were all the benefits of real democracy, including the press freedom restored (for the communists but not).
Regime of President suharta, however, in the early 1970's, opened another strong measures against the press, leading to the prohibition of various media and imprisonment of many journalists.
Once was brought under control of the press, was already quickly okleštěna and other political rights and Indonesia's democracy again failed.
After suhartově fall in 1998, Indonesia became a third largest democratic countries and the world's largest democracy Muslim communities in history.
Two parliamentary elections and two direct presidential elections, including the recent presidential in the second round - were free and fair peaceful, which has shown that Islam and democracy can be together.
Enemies democracy but never nespí.
Radical Islamist groups conduct unthinking pumové attacks, while groups with strong authoritarian inclinations infect into nejužších circles around prezidentky Megawati Sukarnoputri.
President Megawati, however, is diminished defeat in their quest for re-election.
Will the newly elected president susilo continue persecution journalists?
Will my conviction, as well as the processes and condemnation of other journalists, mark the beginning of the end hard-won third democracy in Indonesia?
The answer lies in the question of what can support for Indonesia's fighters for democracy to gain at home and abroad.
The loss of Indonesia - potential světélka hope for all combatants for democracy in the global Muslim community - would be a defeat.
The death penalty morálnost
The United States are often kritizovány for refusing to lift the death penalty.
Many people now claims that the abolition of death penalty is necessary for a civilized system criminal law.
A Nobel Prize Gary becker with this notion of disagree.
European governments have pressing hard oppose the death penalty -- the European Union him even explicitly prohibits -- and some Europeans consider law enforcement in the United States for barbarous.
Many European intellectuals argues that not only the death penalty, but generally any punishment fails to deter criminals.
But, while Europeans, on which the crime in the last half-century ranged far below American levels, long could in most crimes afford relatively "soft" approach, during the past twenty years of years, and they a sharp increase in crime.
American crime, by contrast, has declined, partly because the wider use of punishment.
Between them includes the death penalty.
I support execution people convicted of murder, because, and only for this reason, I believe that this předejde another murders.
If I believed that stavěl I against hrdelnímu punishment, because msta and other possible motives should serve as the basis of public policy.
Serious empirical research death penalty began in the US průkopnickou studies isaaca ehrlicha, published in 1975 in the American economic review.
Some subsequent studies revealed much weaker deterrence payoff effect, while others reached concluded that the effect is far more.
Available evidence, however, are very limited, so, no one should its findings based solely on the econometric evidence.
Public policy in the area of any punishment, of course, cannot wait until will have a perfect evidence.
Even when the availability of limited kvantitativních evidence, however, there are good reasons to believe that the death penalty has deterrence payoff effect.
Most people -- and vrazi especially -- has fear of death, especially when it is quickly and likely to after were committed murder.
As in the debate about the suicide declared philosopher David Hume, "no one never neodhodil life, as long as was behind this live.
Neb such is our natural hrůza of death??? "similarly schopenhauer believed that" when the horrors of life dospějí into phase in which will outweigh the horrors of death, one of his life end.
The disasters of death, however, set a considerable resistance??? "
Opponents of the death penalty often argue that the state has a moral right to take someone life, even if it were a nejodsouzeníhodnějšího murderer.
For anyone who believes that the death penalty deters, but it is completely wrong conclusion.
To understand why, suppose that for every murderer, which is executed (and that is vyměřen, for example, life sentence), the number of the murder of reduced by three, which is far lower than in the number of their odhadech odstrašujícího effect stresses Ehrlich and some other.
This means that for every nepopraveného murderer would died three innocent victims.
If so, the government neuplatňovala the death penalty indirectly, it would "sebrala" many lives.
Saving three innocent lives for every popraveného man seems very alluring trade, and even two zachráněné on lives on the execution of a convincing ratio costs and yields hrdelního punishment.
Admittedly, that with the decline number of zachráněných lives per execution of this argument in favor of the death penalty loses on pádnosti.
But even if every execution benefited only a single human life, still would be this "trade" desirable in the case that would be zachráněný life better than life odebraný, which would usually true.
Many people have a challenge to the comparison of quality and zachráněného zmařeného life.
But I see way to such comparisons avoid.
Consider "kariérního" criminals who oloupí and zavraždí victim that led seamless life and left for a few children and husband or manželku.
And suppose that popravou such criminals would be to save the lives of the victims.
According to me is obvious that save lives such victims must have greater weight than ending zločincova life.
Not all cases are, of course, such a but comparing qualities individuals must be part of any reasonable social policy.
This helps explain why should be the death penalty vyměřován only for murder, and not for less serious crimes.
If we should poměřovat odebírání human lives and, for example, reducing the object criminal activity, then is argument in favor of mírnějších thieves much stronger.
Although the heavy ublížení on health, including some hideous crimes rape can its importance some murders approximate and could possibly calls for the hardest punishment, I law enforcement in these cases nepodporuji.
A powerful argument for reducing the death penalty solely on the murder is the so-called "marginal deterrence."
If, for example, the assault trestalo popravou were perpetrators would encourage their victims to kill to avoid getting caught (which is an important reason why the tvrdost punishment should fits of crime).
One of the komplikací associated with hrdelním trestem can provide the fact that the guilty will defend sveřepěji getting caught, which could lead to other deaths.
Marginal deterrence, while plays an important role, but I believe that the resistance to getting caught murderers, some even at the cost of losing their life is in fact nepřímým evidence that the criminals have from the death penalty really fear.
Of course, and I fear risks that will be executed innocent people.
My support for the death penalty would have declined, if the percentage of Executions of innocent people really so high, as many claims.
But I believe that odvolací process in the US is enormous protection -- perhaps not so much against nespravedlivému conviction as against unfair popravě -- so cases kill innocent people there is very little, if not a.
This process, highly helped develop identification through DNA.
And so can be repeat that debate about the death penalty is basically a debate about his odstrašujícím effect (which can prolonged process appeals reduce).
To understand that some people standing to these evidence skepticky, even when I believe that, at this point wrong, and that against them on this issue talk and healthy common sense.
Take someone life is very disturbing, even if this was the life of a murderer, but sometimes it is necessary to take even very unpleasant steps to prevent even worse behavior, which frustrates the lives of innocent victims.
People versus Putin
In the search for a successor first democratically elected Russia's President Boris Yeltsin, I helped with the selection of Vladimir Putin.
Given that Russia now dominate structures at the edge of the KGB and mafia and the same structures manipulating the Court system, is projected to Yeltsin wanted dosadit his successor in order to avoid future criminal prosecution.
But we who are Putin chosen, we were pověřeni the search for someone who would ochránil Yeltsin and his family, but someone who would continue his reforms.
Yeltsin do not fear and neusiloval about their survival, but for survival democratic ideas, has put into Russia.
Yet this idea is now at risk because successor, for which we chose.
Nepopírám its responsibility for support Putin.
They are close friends, but collaborated in critical situations, and I never doubted its sincerity.
Putin is in accordance with its the beliefs.
The problem is that his beliefs -- including the view that Russia can prosper only if it control the only source of power -- are flawed.
The critical mistake leads to Russia's political crash.
Of course, no one nezastává high function without did mistakes, even mistakes fundamental, which is particularly true in bouřlivých times.
Yeltsin was no exception, its mistakes but recognized.
For example, when the silvestra 1999 odcházel retirement, asked about the need for that launched a war in Chechnya.
Putin, on the contrary, it seems neschopen understand and acknowledge its mistakes and insists on a policy of long after the its failure to be clear the entire world.
One of the Yeltsin mistakes was that at the forefront of his program of reform to a moral priorities.
Russia should be kát for stalinismus and system gulagů.
The people without exception should show remorse, as it since 1945 show the Germans.
This failure is important, because Putin's bezvýhradnou faith in the central power to result in the state capture the ingredients of security.
Indeed, the direct result of the national pokání for era gulagů should be the prohibition of the Communist Party and diskvalifikace workers KGB of political functions.
Although in postcommunist societies where harassing and collaboration were so widespread -- and borders between them often neostré -- are such political lustrace complicated find reasonable solution was possible, as in the Czech Republic.
Failure to leave the Russian security structures without damaging capable of political return, which they just succeeded.
A resurgence of political structures KGB during Putin's government and their efforts to umlčení dissent has again transformed Russia in a country sběhů.
It is impossible to silence the independent policies and independent media, nezadusíme if independent of the sources of money, which is why Putin's Kremlin focused their attacks on the so-called "oligarchs."
This is why was zorganizováno the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the court.
Security forces that dominate the Kremlin hope that by excising independent of the sources of money destroy in Russia independent political life.
Without independent myšlenkových bases is uchytávat atmosphere of fear.
Fear, however, is not only's humiliating; it also allows bad governance state.
Yeltsin intuitivně understood that fear and vertikálně governed, centralized decisions are the right choice for management of modern country, and therefore insisting reform relations between citizens and state.
Putin still do not understand that highly-centralized political system now cannot understand mistakes and fixing is, as well as the Soviet era.
Putin does not well educated man with absolute and deep with Russia is leading to the same decay that accompanied the break-up of the Soviet state.
People are beginning to realize this.
Understand that Putin's desire to build a powerful and effective modern state cannot be implemented, because the modern state is run from above, but well informovaným electorates that representative of the state to recognize and fixing its mistakes.
Putin appears to be the inability of his regime also concerned.
This is one reason why Russia began to behave as aggressively to its neighbors, Ukraine, Georgia, and why seeks to maintain military presence in places like Transdneister, odštěpenecký region Moldova.
The Kremlin thinks that děláním ramen in the immediate neighborhood Russian can Russians at home convinced of his omnipotence.
Given vykleštěnosti debates in Russia and the Kremlin's ability to manipulate elections, the only option, which are left to those who want to maintain democratic in Russia, the idea is regime change.
Insisting on iluzích nothing help.
Those who oppose, Putin must rozmyslet what they want, and declare that if regime cannot ensure observance of the constitution, they have the right to him to drive all necessary means.
On the issue of power today in Russia cannot decide only at the ballot box.
As in Ukraine, in Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan, for it will decide on the streets.
Daňte and utrácejte (prosím)
The excess taxation can otupit incentives and impede growth.
Too low taxation but can lead to the same.
The government's skrovnými tax revenues cannot ensure basic public goods.
Worse yet, the low tax revenues in poor countries often result of shortcomings system collecting taxes (rather than from low tax rates) that including support neproduktivní business.
The importance of well designed tax system demonstrates India.
In Bangalore, high tech companies built areály on the world level, full šlechtěných trávníků and high speed networks for dálkový transmission of data.
Beyond these areály but lies open stoky, nikým nesbírané scraps and roads in havarijním shape.
Although society of new technologies at any moment terabajty convey information to remote continents, local transport hovers nearly medieval speed.
Businesses in Bangalore because run by their own bus service, hire, private contractors drinking water and montují generátory to protect themselves against výpadkům supplies of electrical power.
The state of the mess cannot correct, because it is to broke.
India's public debt exceeds 70% of GDP, so more than half of tax revenue is for interest payments.
But debt nevznikl because excessive spending in the past.
India's government spending is about 15% of GDP, with the average in the OECD makes about 40% of GDP.
India's financial problems follow more from badly koncipovaného and spravovaného tax system.
Rates and the rules of the income taxes physical and corporate people are to be uměřeně international standards.
Nevertheless, India's government vybere income taxes of just about 3.7% of GDP, so about half compared to South Korea, and other Asian Tigers.
In India about a quarter of GDP for agriculture, but not wealthy farmers are not taxes.
Exportně aimed companies operating in more software and other areas are on their profits tax holidays, although their employees income taxes must pay.
Despite reasonable rates are widespread tax evasion.
To šizení occurs because the government to invest personnel or to tax systems odhalujících podvodníky that rarely threatens way behind bars, and if they are caught, it is often through bribery avoid problems.
In view of podrobnějším discover that trying to avoid "direct" tax revenues and profits mirror turmoil in a system of "indirect taxes on" uvalených production and consumption.
More than 60% of indirect taxes, which have the same share of total income tax, are in India taxes consumption.
The basic consumer tax be stated on 16% of the value of the company.
In addition, there is a host of relief, liberation and přirážek.
For example, on the category as food products, dinner, bavlněná příze and computer is imposed "snížená tax" rate of around $8%.
Some products, including polyesterová fibers, cars, kondicionéry and leak, are burdened by additional "special consumer tax" (sed) of 8%.
On the "goods special significance" is imposed "přidaná consumer tax" (aed, attention to the from sed).
Relief from their consumption taxes are numerous and complicated and related, including the companies with celkovými annual sales to 10 million rupií and firms sídlící in certain disadvantaged or violent areas.
Overall, the liberation of tied to 70 broad categories, rozčleněných into 259 lines, 52 conditions and 7 lists, each of which contains amounts of data.
Fiscal liberation to say about abuse.
Lower officials who have considerable discretion in the application of the conditions for a price can be persuaded to the fact vykládali příznivějším way.
Goods zdaněné high rate (for example, leštěná žula) sells as goods zdaněné rate low (for example, neleštěná žula).
Trying to avoid spotřebním taxes is nakažlivější than trying to avoid tax from profits and income.
When a firm consumer tax haunts and tax rate is in comparison with nezdaněnou profit margins in more high, its konkurenti must also cheat, not only because to preserve.
As the tax evasion spread, governments introduce "dodatkové" and "special" taxes, provoking another evasion.
The choice of a direct taxes are also.
Pay the bribe předaný výběrčímu tax for favorable classification, the difference between value leštěné and neleštěné žuly and accounting lower than real revenue creates a "black" funds, which cannot be uvádět to tax returns.
Insider plans to bypass indirect taxes not only weaken the state's ability to provide the basic public goods, but also discourage firms from imposing produktivnějších technology that require procedures, including operation in large.
Given that nepřímým taxes can be easily unikat provozováním many small organizations rather than one big, cannot be reached savings from velkovýroby.
It is noteworthy that in software competitive industry, which are exempt from indirect taxes all troops are Indian society efficient size.
India could emulate example of China, where rationalization indirect taxes in 1994 set the stage for a boom?
Or coalition government vitální democracy are capable of such reforms?
Last year, India's government led by Party BJP offered legislation nařizující from a reduction in the budget deficit.
After by the working group, which should have the task formulate necessary changes in the tax and spending policies.
This year in July, this group proposed tax increases (not škrtání spending), including through the removal of the majority of liberation from indirect taxes.
It seems that the new India's government under the leadership of the Congress is also nakloněna proposals.
If Congress and opposition parties dotáhnou thing to do the end of the great piece of labor to sustain economic growth and diffusion of for the view that democracies cannot do what is needed to stimulate development.
What is wrong to Turkey?
On December předstoupí before the Istanbul court one of the nejslavnějších Turkish writers orhan pamuk to faced charges of "insults national identity," which is supposedly dopustil by voted for open discussion about Turkish genocide amount of the Armenians million in the years 1915 and 1916.
Pamukovi now threatens tříleté prison.
Turkey's efforts to pokutovat and close down to prison those who are not keeping official line, me leads to believe that I react correctly, when I opposed starting accession negotiations that country with the European Union.
In December 1999 udělila the European Council Turkey status candidate countries of the EU, of which logically an that Turkey to some closer nespecifikovanému date joining a union.
The Council, in turn, asked the European Commission to in October 2004 decided to whether Turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria membership -- including democracy, the rule of law and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities.
It was a one of the recent decision Commission Romano Prodi, which I member.
From 30 members of the Commission them 29 konstatovalo that Turkey sufficiently fulfills criteria, and negotiations and can continue.
The only I with the nesouhlasil.
My decisions, shaped report of the Commission, which deprived Gunther Verheugen, the Commissioner for EU enlargement.
This report that are involved in 2003, in member countries of the EU's request for asylum 21 370 Turks and 2 127 by bureaucrats was taken.
Even the governments of the EU itself in other words, they that the Turkish government in 2003 perzekvovala more than two thousands of their own citizens.
Meanwhile, the Commission released by the regular news about Turkey, in which připouštělo that slightly islamisticky oriented cabinet Prime Minister Recep Tayyip erdogana continues in the reforms, even if slow pace.
Even this report, but also reference to serious pochybeních: violations of human rights, including torture continued, influence army was and remains too high, freedom of speech, nedodržovala widely, nemuslimské religious and cultural minorities, potýkaly with discrimination against violence and on women was not enough strongly bráněno.
From the start of the accession talks this year in October much has changed.
Moreover, the current criminal prosecutions orhana pamuka it only filled with other cases unacceptable behavior.
In March 2005 police violence rozehnala show to celebrate the international day women.
In may be zakázána the biggest odborovému Union teachers, because an education 14 million Turkish Kurds in their language.
Intolerance, it extends to the top of Turkey's government.
Foreign Minister Abdullah gül recently in Copenhagen decisively abolished press conference, when in audiences vyslídil Kurdish journalists, whose after the Danes refused to lead the country.
Such actions and attitudes my opposition from October 2004 enough justify.
But even if these deficiencies remove, Turkey would still should be accepted into the EU, because it is the European countries.
Christianity, feudalism, Renaissance Enlightenment, democracy and industrialization has made US Europeans what we are, but have not made Turks what they are.
So I believe that reforms that were adopted in Turkey's insistence on the European Commission would continued after his entry.
Rather, I suspect that will uvadat.
Turkey's admission would also will inevitably lead to the entry of Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova, and perhaps Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The first three of these countries are certainly evropštější than Turkey.
Even if ponechali three kavkazské Republic party, but zahrnuli successor states of the former Yugoslavia, this would mean the creation of an EU with roughly Thirty-five members.
What would it was a Union?
The EU is not simply clubs friends.
It is based on freedom of movement of goods, services, capital, and citizens.
The Commission as strážce Union contracts must these four freedoms protect, which means that sometimes must member countries persuading and in cases, the necessary force to change laws.
Protialkoholová policy in Sweden, the Volkswagen law in Germany and discrimination foreign investment funds in France, this are cases that the Commission unpopular.
Were but necessary.
At a time when I Commission leaving, I's on stohu fifteen hundred such přestupkových management.
Membership in the EU in short, entails the need to take strong measures that have a profound impact on the internal affairs the state.
This will not be possible if the members of the Union will become so disparate countries.
The EU would then victim of what the historian Paul Kennedy called "imperial přesah."
The Union would nepřijatelně rozředila.
Thus, the former French President Val??ry Giscard d 'Estaing feared that Turkish accession will lead to the collapse of the EU, and therefore former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: "Turkey's admission would be more than the EU can bear."
The strongest reason against Turkish accession, however, it is genuinely democratic: most of the population of the EU him simply wants.
Bolivia's crisis, Latin America's failure
Bolivia is by any definition a typical Latin American countries.
With the exception of Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and in terms of stability is on the even worse, because it is here since independence place more than two hundreds of upheavals.
In the region with a strong indigenous past, but roztroušenou and izolovanou present is Bolivia, together with guatemalou probably only a Latin American countries, where indigenous peoples form the majority of the population.
Its topografie and ethnic rozvrstvení gives rise to autonomistickým, and even odtrženeckým forces that threaten national unity hrozivěji than anywhere else.
And, of course, is Bolivia, together with paraguayí on the subcontinent also the only nation, which has sea.
It would be so greatly nemoudré imposing the current bolivijskou crisis in the rest of the Latin America.
Zevšeobecňovat is all too easy: elsewhere are institutions stronger poverty -- and especially extreme poverty -- to decline, and the battle for natural resources has been largely settled.
Even in places like Venezuela, which has a vast reserves and based traditionally nationalist government survived the status quo allowing foreign investment in energy sources almost eight years of governance President Hugo Ch??vez.
The existence of indigenous movement is not reality in many countries -- from chiapasu over "araucaniu" and amazonii until after ayacucho -- but nowhere in Latin America does not constitute a real threat to national integrity.
Bolivia's crisis is worrying example and even otřepaná "domino theory," which in Bolivia zastávali Lyndon Johnson and Che Guevara, there seems as platná or if only half a moderate.
Yet the current Bolivia's crisis points to the "democratic deficit" which suffers from today's Latin America.
In Bolivia, Ecuador, and in Haiti fell from this or that reason elected leaders.
In Cuba in Mexico and Nicaragua, democracy is either imperfect or no and in Venezuela, Colombia is, of this or that reason at risk.
None of these cases is not an equivalent with another; all include varying degree of risk of damage or reconciliation.
The question is what to do with this state of affairs that contrasts with povzbudivou prospect that there is only a few years ago převažovala.
In recent conference Organization of American States (oas) in fort lauderdale in Florida took a delegation of the United States from other a good idea, and then him its support for essentially potopila.
The story began a few years ago, when they were the foreign minister Argentina dante caputo and team UN Development Program pověřeni sepsáním news about the state of democracy in Latin America.
Conclude that the system of early warning democratic crises in the region would help to intervene before the situation vymkne control, as it is now in Bolivia.
Caputo and team UN then convince Chile's President ricarda lagose to this initiative gain, and with a few colleagues it began to enforce.
Lagos done so, but initiative is too far got.
The report on the state of democracy in Latin America posted in 2004, the about it frankly barely zmiňovala.
The US and the new Secretary-General oas, chilan Jose miguel insulza, this plan revived during the conference oas in Florida, but eventually him sank that rational fears of Latin American leaders that the idea is directed against Venezuela, to which the připojil also anachronický fear latinoameričanů by breaking sacred principle nevměšování.
Although the continent failed to agree on this idea, the concept of early warning systems deserves much attention.
The current situation in Bolivia the community western hemisphere many nenadělá, but this situation is dangerous for all.
Evo Morales, a leader of the opposition and pěstitelů coca, may be honest if somewhat dezorientovaný democratic leader, but really in his stoupencích nedřímají authoritarian desire?
Hugo Ch??vez may nefinancuje Morales and other Bolivian dissidents, but do not feel Venezuela and Cuba temptation vměšovat to issue a country where almost 40 years ago died Che Guevara when led guerilla war?
The business community of Santa cruz may neuskuteční its threat separation, but did the will of oil and gas reserves in the region to share with indigenous peoples horskými than with Brazil's průmyslníky from são Paul?
Than events dospějí in these extremes, it might be from things, if they began to engage in oas (rather than the US).
The region will this engagement continue to need -- in time, the vyžádání and on the appropriate democratic platform, which will be different from traditional intervention and the US from traditional indifference Latin America.
The decline of France?
The French are proslulí its tenderness, if not directly upjatostí - the status of France in the world.
The French state invests huge financial amount to promote the French language and culture, but still, the French are painfully aware that the status of their country in the world is such that have been used.
So no surprise that the news of the European Commission, according to which the level of the French economy in comparison with other European countries fell in ten years of the third place on the tenth incited during the last presidential election made and polemiku. Before long, and President Jacques Chirac has accused of his opponent Lionel Jospin, that has,, the decline of France. "
The OECD and eurostat - Europe's authority to for these data fits - thought that aspect of this debate end, when have shown that France, Germany, Italy, and the UK enjoy roughly the same average living standards of the population.
A more general disputes by but not eliminated.
Ustarané discussions about, France, the decline of the "has again vynořily in the context of letošními protests against pension reform, with narůstajícími disputes about fiscal policy toward the European Commission and with hašteřením, with the United States in the war in Iraq.
The top-selling book literature fact in France is now the controversy Nicolas bavereze called the la France qui tombe (declining France).
The paper is prošpikována citacemi de gaullea and napoleona.
Recent spectacular successes at France under autora in the 1970's, when was launched a plant rychlovlaku tgv and plane Airbus.
Baverez also denounces mitteranda and Chirac for their "common talent vyhrávat elections and change in France outsidera."
The success of book is itself a sign of particular problems.
But what are the kind of?
Baverezovy arguments about decline is not as powerful as the author believes.
For nejkřiklavější evidence of the French fall, for example, as a diminution of jobs in industry.
But deindustrialization is routine in all advanced countries.
France in this regard is even better than most of its competitors in rich countries and Unlike Germany, Britain or the US, France in the industrial sector to maintain the same proportion of the global market, what should in the early 1970 's.
Also, according to the standards výstižnějšího competitiveness, which are foreign investment, France doing very well.
According to recent reports published the Council for economic analysis rose direct investment in France in 2001 to 60 billion euros, which is almost twice as much as in Germany.
In the past three decades, improved also nákladová competitiveness France (about 20%), with higher productivity compensating for rapid growth wages.
At the heart of long-term economic problems France is not just the fear of losing their jobs in the industrial sector.
France remains strong industrial powers in the traditional areas, such as automotive and aviation industries, but lags in markets with inovacemi, where smaller businesses by new technologies.
On research and development in the area of high-tech, for example, France spends only $30 billion per year, compared to 51 billions in Germany, 98 billions in Japan and 265 billions in the US.
In short, baverezova analysis shows the wrong direction.
In the last two decades France through a series of vital reforms: the economic and financial liberalization, by eliminating price controls and exchange rate of credit restrictions, European liberalization, reducing inflation and trade deficits, the introduction of the Euro and vynucenou globalization domestic firms.
French problems with any of these reforms nesouvisejí.
The problem of France is the fact that fails to take on the new world, which has become part of itself.
The French state capitalism is dead, and France, with his dying only hard vyrovnává.
This is not the only country whose - Prime Minister Lionel Jospin - felt obliged to explain away with a day after on television declared that "state is not an all-powerful."
For the French schizophrenia there are many causes, but it is certain that the key reason is linked to political hrátkami in the past 20 years.
Until 1981 led in France neat dividing line between right and left.
Since then, but mitterandova and Chirac's administration otupovaly their ideological ostří that could have an nelehký process of adapting to Europe and to globalization.
One dose of "shock therapy" on the way of Margaret Thatcher could twenty years ago to bring about a new political consciousness.
Consensual driblování away from the reforms, however, the French to live in a world and thinking in another.
This is a key reason for political disaster, which came during the last presidential election campaign, when the leader far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen came to a second round of presidential elections, at the expense of the prime minister Lionel Jospin.
Also the rise of the extreme left that in the presidential election received 10% of the vote, suggests a political failure.
France needs rather than political economic revolution, if it is coming to terms with reality, whose form part of the realization that the decline of France "is a fear that the French are causing themselves.
The value of European values
Europe's leaders restore talks on the Constitution, which last December zkrachovaly because of disputes about the voting rights.
Such disputes, of course, are subject to compromises that they are likely to have been found.
Still, however, it is needed a clear understanding of what is the constitution to achieve.
European integration podepírají two basic principles: solidarity and subsidiarita.
Both the principles of lies at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, the economy, sociology and law.
For years were present in legal and institutional framework of the European Union, in the treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which is cituje in the preamble), and in the recent the draft constitution.
In short, are vepsány in history and ideals of the EU.
But what solidarity and subsidiarita really mean?
Věnujme first Solidarity, which is open at least two interpretacím: static solidarity is only in redistribution of income and wealth, while a broader concept of dynamic solidarity includes their creation.
In the postwar history of European integration was dynamic solidarity strong in the first period - in an era of the European Coal and Steel Community, and both in the strategy of economic development (renewal), and in the treaties, especially in the Treaty of Rome.
But this does not mean that later was dynamic solidarity and: its, for example, is an expression of European monetary union.
Thus, while some countries should of the euro immediate benefits, yet it is adopted, because they believe that this in the long run, will have a positive effect.
In other words, dynamic solidarity means upřednostnění policies that supports investment, innovation, economic growth and employment.
But, as shows GDP growth in the EU was in the past decade dynamic solidarity podkopána.
Particularly troubling is lagging in areas of research and development.
Implementing the so-called the Lisbon Strategy EU adopted in 2000, with the promise of creating a nejkonkurenceschopnější economies in the world, threatened by increasing emphasis on statickou solidarity, which is reflected in high costs of social security and high taxes needed to his financing.
The ascendancy of static solidarity is given by the population who, with slow growth led and leads to structural fiscal imbalances.
One of the greatest tasks for the future of the EU is addressing today's majority static solidarity aimed at the old people over the dynamic solidarity favor young people.
After all, the Union cannot afford to continue to allow for the current consumption převažovala over investment needed to ensure future prosperity.
Subsidiarita the concept of solidarity similar to that it has two interpretation: vertikální subsidiaritu and horizontální subsidiaritu.
Vertikální subsidiarita lies in the distribution of power at different levels of government and sovereignty: the EU, national states, regions, and samosprávné communities.
Most famous applications of this principle is federalism.
In European treaties have clear statement vertikální subsidiarity.
But this is sufficient to obsáhnutí vyvstávajícího institutional and constitutional arrangements Union?
Horizontální subsidiarita lies in responsibility and freedom of the people, as well as in the social and economic power.
Includes relations between the state, companies and market.
Society and the market, however, have a vested rights and sovereignty that they become nepropůjčuje.
So the problem lies in ensuring autonomy each of these spheres of.
Example horizontální subsidiarity is Europe's internal market, which produced a new kind of economic freedom and increased competition between firms that eliminoval protection, which they provide national governments.
Horizontální subsidiarita means that in society or in the economic sphere of state cannot disturb freedom and individual responsibility that must be respected in the highest possible fashion.
This also means that wherever freedom and individual responsibility nepostačují towards achieving goals necessary for human dignity must support to provide a "nadřazená power."
This support, however, should be implemented in ways that nourish natural potential individual society and market.
But this is possible only in the case where is the role of horizontální subsidiarity clearly formulována, which is not the case of European treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights nor the work of the European Convention.
In short, solidarity mean more redistribution than growth (which is the way in which today's generation expressing their solidarity with the next generations), while subsidiarita began to mean more redistribution of political power than timid vytyčování borders between the state, civil society and the market.
Today, both values defined in ways that favor state.
Concentration of market-oriented "growth is often associated with half cizorodými values America.
These values are deeply rooted but also in Europe, and they should be again vytaženy to light.
The EU should to restore its economic vitality drive for such a model of solidarity and subsidiarity, which would be vyváženější in favor of the market and society and that would reduce the social, economic impact of the state.
State institutions should provide the public goods (such as defense, justice, fiscal and monetary policy), society should provide the social goods (for example, culture, education, and help appropriate people) and market should provide the goods economic (which connected with profits, growth and employment).
In the 21st century Europe needs to reconsider the value of both these principles - solidarity and subsidiarity - if achieve historical goals integration: freedom and prosperity needed to overcome the differences and political rozkolů that in the 20th century brought about a tragedy.
Such is the spirit in which must be the European constitution written.
Politics of values
The debate about US elections has neustala.
As President George W. Bush managed to get to three million votes more than senátorovi John Kerry and návdavkem achieve a majority of representation Republicans in both houses of Congress?
In the answers is the agreement, but many explanations invoke the the same two issues.
One is a question of personality.
At the time of uncertainty and risk people have more confidence in the president, who know than in the candidate who are neodzkoušeně.
The second issue are values.
People voted for sadu values rather than for any specific policy.
Some (as it is claimed) have agreed in Kerry's policies, but still, gave voice Bush, because it is his General attitudes naplňovaly feeling calm.
If it is a way of the vote, are now the United States clearly deeply rozpolceny.
Arch modrých (democratic states) to the East, North and the West countries spans a red (Republican) area in the midst of and in the South.
Indeed, what more, these divisions, will create and on the local level.
Účelové division of electoral districts and to make them to favor a political party, it is no longer necessary.
People they tend to move to areas in which most people share their values, whatever the Republican, or democratic.
It is precisely what values?
For those that, as it is claimed -- are related to the "God, weapons and gay."
Its role in them plays religion, including a literalist biblické truth, if it is a story creation.
Possessed weapons is the ultimate test individualism and use of weapons in wars is it made the outrageous.
Homosexuality and other "modern" practices are odmítány as nevázané.
As the political scientist recently said Andrew hacker, "the Bush kandidatura was directed at profits majority vote by providing roughly 60 million people have a chance of one good sense."
This is all of us phenomenon, or similar trends exist elsewhere?
One answer is that the politics of values as America's phenomenon can now account for the majority, but in no case is universal.
Europe and other parts of the world are divided the same level.
On personality undoubtedly matters and under external political differences can hide also questions values that even nevystoupily to the fore.
Traditional political divisions based on the dispute about the fundamental values, however, are in the election still smaller role.
For example, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, other major official who wait elections, while plays personal card and talk about political strategies, but in fact, above all represent hodnotovou sadu middle class.
When talk about "modernization," about "přenesení things in the twenty-first century," doing it sugerovat strange, but tempting směsici change and stability.
The opposition Conservative and remains without effective answers.
Even questions such as tax cuts or tighter azylová rules play quite in value struny that managed to dotknout Republican side in the US.
A similar picture exists in Germany, where is the influence of external value policies even lower.
The German debate is still largely debate about political strategies.
When the opposition offered government talks about reform health or the of struggle with unemployment, then the hidden rivalry concerns rather than kompetentnosti values.
Under the usual battlefield political debate in Britain, Germany, and elsewhere in Europe, but their value conflict.
Parties are fighting for those that can get to "from the had a good sense of", but perhaps fully comprehend that it is only part of the question of politics.
Religion is likely to become a major factor in European policy; public opinion polls show that religious practices are one of the few large differences between the Americans and Europeans.
Also weapons take in the minds of Europeans different place; most Europeans regarded as an important their lack of.
It is also in Europe nezaměnitelný and a feature of pacifism.
So far podceňovanou role, however, there is also plays a question of political correctness (gay).
Most importantly, however, the fact that Europeans divides Europe itself, as in any European state "national question arises."
It is a matter of values inspirovanou fear.
People want to know where náležejí, and they turn against the US and toward Europe, or against Europe and towards their country.
Either way, are empire political strategy, and even politics and enter kalné sphere symbols and myth.
This is in any case, the risk that democratic countries face, because the politics of values represents a development.
Again, vnáší fundamental divisions in democratic societies, whose the biggest success was eliminating it fundamentalism of politics.
Enlightened public debate must be dispute about political strategy in the community of values.
Insist is therefore the main objective of the policy of freedom.
The age of interest nadchází
One vlaštovka spring does and one month of a normal growth number of jobs and rising prices in the United States does not mean that America's central bank continues to worries economic problems and deflation.
Come, however, a time when the world's interest rates will rise, because the central bankers are preparing to fight with rising inflation.
Whether this moment will come whenever - this autumn, in 2005, in 2006, or in 2007, will, America and the global economy face financial zranitelností that reflects the success of monetary stimulus slowdown in a downturn production and reining in unemployment in the past three years.
Short-term interest rates are amazingly low: just 2% in the euro area, the only 1% in the US and zero in Japan.
An expansionary monetary policy was successful, but only that it pushed interest rates on historical wages, and that investors convinced that the cost of borrowing remain at current levels even a long time.
The result of monetary stimulus was an increase in asset prices: if interest rates very low and expects if that very low remain, then everything bears a return, dividend or rentu a atraktivnějším - and thus in the currency expression cennějším.
This explains the differences between the current real estate prices in the US stocks in New York, London, and Frankfurt and long-term bonds around the world with what one would normally considered to be their fundamental value.
So what will happen when central banks begin to raise interest rates?
In 1994, rising Short-term rates also growth rates of long-term - and the decline in the price of long-term bonds, which was at least twice as large compared to what is at the time předpovídaly standard models.
Interest rates in marginal developing economies of the world, have grown much faster than rates in the developed the industrial core.
The first danger that we should worry for 2005, as well as in the future, when the rise of the world's interest rates likely to come to - is therefore another wave of financial crisis in the new economies.
In countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the balance of the 1990's, shows that the rising interest rates can expand and flow of capital is remarkably quickly turn regardless of how this favorably perceive economic policy a country's leaders of the IMF and the analysis of big banks.
Rising interest rates in the new economy is now reported as being abnormally low.
International cash flows - aside from the flow of financial resources to the US - even reached levels, when by talking about "irrational exuberance", but we still to can occur before započetím growth interest rates.
But this is the prospect of alarming, because if of the 1990's, is a lesson, then lies in the realization that, no one should exaggerate the stability of the international financial flows.
A second danger stems from high asset prices within the first industrial core.
In America's central bank apparently prevails view, who agree - that the revolution of information technology continues, the growth rate of potential performance in the US remains very high, and performance gap is thus a relatively large.
From this means that interest rates may will have to stay low after a long time.
Confidence in the central bank is, moreover, the high and bonuses for the last inflation risk in the 1970's, have been of interest rates vyždímány.
As a result, remain interest rates on the conditions of the 1980's and 1990's low even after the performance of the economy return to its potential.
All this, of course, is the good news for those who own assets as long-term bonds, stocks or real estate.
The long-term asset price was, indeed, the real reason for reducing interest rates: gain holders of bonds and, above all, after all, the real estate owners stimulates an their expenditures.
The bad news, however, is that, even though assumes that interest rates will be even some time, low nezůstanou such low indefinitely.
The bottom line is that the rise in interest rates will be to fall asset prices.
It is in such periods, particularly if asset prices falling quickly and sharply - will show how well our central bankers fulfills its main task: reducing financial rozkolísanosti and support for economic stability.
In such periods also find how much owners long-term bonds, real estate or stocks is holds not because they regard their current prices for attractive in proportion to the basic prices, but simply because their price in the past few years increased.
This is for economic stratégy the key question, because those who long-term assets purchased to their cost at the time, seemingly without ustání dramatically, is, immediately after the downward trend begins to turn.
Especially the US trade deficit is in the future a potential source of huge instability, if there is a significant decline in the long-term asset price.
Problems with which they are key strategists the world economy during the next few years face, will certainly different from the problems that confront in the aftermath of a bubble NASDAQ.
Risks associated with inflation are likely to be less dangerous than risks stemming from the collapse of performance and threats of deflation.
As we are, however, poučili in the 1990s, all of this does not mean that the coming challenges will manage easily.
Contradictory future America
I recently discovered something zajímavého: American economists of international finance and American economists inclined to domestic economy have very different -- indeed, contradictory -- views on likely consequences of America's current-account deficit.
Economists of international finance for likely see financial crisis, after which will follow painful, and perhaps more permanent recession in the United States.
Macroeconomists focus on domestic economy on the contrary, nepohlížejí on the looming the dollar's value as a crisis, but as an opportunity to faster growth.
Macroeconomists inclined to domestic economy see on the situation about this: at some point in the future of foreign central banks begin to be less prepared to continue to buy a vast amounts of dollar-denominated securities and reinforce as America's currency.
To end its massive programs purchase dollars, the value of the dollar will fall, and will fall sharply.
According to this view, but when the value of the dollar will reduce for foreigners become more attractive American export of goods and in the US will grow in employment, with the labor force will přesměrována to the newly oživeného export sector.
It is about the equivalent of what happened in the UK after abandoned the peg the exchange rate and kept pound devalued in relation to the Deutsche Mark, or of what took place in the US in the late 1980's, when the dollar depreciated to the pound, the Deutsche Mark, and, above all, the Japanese yen.
International finance economists see future much pochmurněji.
Are convinced that the end of the large programs central banks to buy $will not only to a dollar decline, but also to a sharp increase in the US long-term interest rates, which immediately will curb consumer spending and with little late přiškrtí outlet investment spending.
Of course, economists of international finance also understand that reducing the value of the dollar will benefit vývozům the US, but prodlevy demand are such that export growth will only a year or two after the fall in consumption and investment spending.
Eight to 10 million people will have to change jobs and move of services and construction in areas of its export of goods and goods konkurujícího imports, which means that rises structural unemployment.
Moreover, it may appear financial panic: large financial institutions with short-run pasivy and long-term assets difficult for the moment when it will have to deal with a large increase dollar long-term interest rates.
This inappropriate links can trigger financial tensions and bankroty as easily as during the Mexican and East Asia's crisis in the 1990's, and in Argentina's crisis in the current decade caused assets banks in local currency and pasiva in dollars.
When economists of international finance načrtnou this scenario, macroeconomists focus on domestic economy respond by that it is as an incompetent monetary policy.
Why should the Federal Reserve afford to long-term interest rates vylétly only because other central banks ended their programs purchase $?
Should the Fed act and replace them of their own purchases of long-term government bonds, the US, thereby long-term interest rates maintain at the level of allowing full employment?
On this economists of international finance respond, that is in the power to prove that the Fed.
If the Fed to choose between full employment and price stability, economists of international finance say that the chooses to price stability, for his institutional memory of the 1970s years, when inflation escaped control is still very lively.
Thus, given that the decline in the dollar's value raising import prices and works so as adverse shock for supply side of the economy, the Fed will have to raise interest rates, not reduce, and sell bonds, not buy.
On either pólech this debate is a highly vyhraněné views of serious economists, of which the extremely vážím.
I so wise to managed to say, who is right, but certainly not know who hope that is wrong.
Black pasažéři Europe
In the United States must individual countries that follow unsound fiscal policy, pay a price.
Compared to better spravovaným states their bonds sell at their discount windows.
Higher debt service, it must meet, serving -- to some extent -- as a form of kázeňského measures against the temptation to spend now and pay until příště.
Of course, market discipline is not perfect: the bond market too well "see" implicit future liabilities (as přislíbené payouts pensions).
But this forced fiscal discipline, together with internal budgetary procedures of individual nations, from the US has since the Great Depression of the creation of a large fiscal crisis in the level of the state.
Now look at Europe.
Before the advent of the euro in individual national states in southern Europe vyskytlo many fiscal crisis that elicited waves of high inflation.
After the introduction of the single currency, however, the possibility of solve fiscal crisis through inflation closed, because of monetary policy now hold patrol the European Central Bank (ECB).
But, while no longer national states cannot resolving their nevyvážených finance rely on inflation, the single currency allows them to extending expenditure dýchánků and to odsouvání political responsibility for a period of laissez forest bons temps roulés use debt capacity that properly's other members of the European Union.
To this possibility, ahead of an EU created the Stability and Growth Pact: government deficits should be less than 3% of GDP.
Last week government in Germany -- once fiskálně nejrozvážnější and most disciplined EU countries -- violate the pact rules on fiscal discipline has year in five working for themselves and did so without (many) omluv.
Finance Minister peer steinbrück suggested that the expected to the European Commission applies to Germany a sanctions: if made no steps, said, the credibility of the Stability Pact is at risk.
Germany, therefore, this time is blocking sanctions, as did before the two and a half years.
Steinbrück but has also made it clear that the expected to sanctions behind on předpokládaný fiscal deficit Germany's $3, 4% of GDP will largely symbolic, that will not to repay, for which would make government or economy paid a significant price.
The Stability and Growth Pact works -- at least for now, as has been intended.
And as it has with market disciplinou?
The German government is the willingness to create more debt and running deficits more limited, because market rozeznává and pokutuje national states that allowing their fiscal position slábla?
Put a word, not.
Interest rates in sovereign debt in euros twelve governments of the euro area are all very similar.
So it seems that markets are not care about this that individual countries have different potenciály produce exports and krýt and financial flows needed to repaying debt or different common and estimated circumstances of the debt to GDP.
Willem buiter from amsterodamské universities and Anne sibertová University of London believe that this was a willingness to take the ECB basically all debt euro-zone as zajištěný what undercut the willingness of markets operate like vymahač fiscal prudence.
If maržová part of the German debt použije as a guarantee for short-term loans or as the main point Treaty buy in order to obtain liquidity, its value is more likely to determine the conditions under which it as a guarantee of the ECB will than according to the underlying indicators.
The ECB's approach to all such debt as an equally solid resources reserve liquidity now triumphed over every analysis of difference in the long sovereign risk.
This is a dangerous for the long term.
To create a reasonable chance to long-term price stability is needed to market discipline and uvážlivé fiscal management.
Vynechte either market repay for the behavior of that can prostoupit lehkomyslnost or institutional leverage that propůjčují voice future generations, and you seriously risk -- may not today and tomorrow, but only once and for the rest of the life.
How is the time, the single currency, and the manner in which the euro was launched, generate increasingly wary.
Overall, policies over the eurozónou too deflation.
Does not to appropriate transferům that would have made a common currency snesitelnější for regions that prodělávají and are already in recession when the ECB zpřísňuje policy.
The institutional foundations for a stable long-term fiscal policies are rozleptávány.
And into the buiter and sibertová compelling argue that the ECB gives market to compensation hospodárných and punishing extravagant less than space should.
This does not mean sesuv land, and even some time will.
But if nothing has changed, underlies under the euro can be put into motion.
Milosevic and Hussein: the Court as a farce
Processes with war criminals were once serious enterprise.
Only the vzpomeňte on the images hermana göringa and rudolfa hesse how mrzutě sit on the dock at Nuremberg.
Some nacističtí brass were even after the relatively short, but fair processes oběšeni.
Today, the proceedings against nejničemnějším world leaders turn into a farce.
The Court with Saddam and his baasistickými posluhovači provides a constant sequence trapností.
Defendants zkoušejí one taškařici for the second and Hussein has flaunted all possible forms of contempt, beyond the vystrkování holého zadku to judge.
Hardly expect the outcome, which will be in the eyes of Iraqis and the world seen as legitimate.
The process of Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, after mark nudných testimony, and four years after the depletion of more than 200 million dollars to spending made in pohřeb.
In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government has almost a decade dohadují as before the Court get přežívající of the Khmer Rouge.
Masoví vrazi, who have come to power in the twentieth century condemned to the fact that are either killed in people's rebellion, or tried for their crimes -- unless nezemřeli in power.
Those who can be proud to it that the Communist leader Romania nikolae ceauşescu and his wife were zastřeleni without sebemenšího appearance of fair process?
Formal dangers real court appear always better than immediate justice, even if end result was also death.
Today, there are two viable ways to act against svrženému tyrant.
Its former leader could before the Court because he nation, as in the 1980s did Argentines with generals accountable for the disappearance of more than five thousands of people.
On the international level remains for the other processes unavailable norimberský model, while a dubious conditions, when the victorious powers sometimes introduce responsibility for crimes, for example, "crimes against humanity," which were in times of their were committed properly vymezené.
Were a time when we could see the benefits of both national and international court processes.
Domestic trials allow local community to blízkou participation vypořádalo with its hořem.
As the judges and porotci could countrymen obžalovaného manifest greater cit for assessing blame, because they were aware of hard the conditions under which sesazený dictator doing their decisions.
Argentina's trial generals was successful ritual in bolestivém transition from military junta to democracy, but experience ended plačtivým lack of free.
Even after conviction were generals so powerful that vynutili ending processes and then mercy from nastoupivšího president.
Argentina's policy is to legal processes consequences of 20 years ago still zapletena.
On the international level, the UN Security Council's decision established the international criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also přivítáno with great confidence.
The ICTY, led by antonia casseseho made several major decisions.
But then should judges there bad luck, that they splnil their greatest dream -- tries to his of arcilumpa Slobodan Milosevic.
It is not clear how it in local process with Milosevic naložili Serbs.
Many would záviselo on that political party, the Court dominate.
On the international level, there is no fear of přemíry policies, but from přemíry rights.
Milosevic's trial had to be more than just, had to be emblémem justice of the UN.
So Milosevic was allowed to himself advocated -- which was given délce and efficacy court a huge mistake.
Nor was not a limited number of witnesses that prosecutors předvolával to testimony about one and the same nightmarish history of the Serbian aggression and brutality.
Take many months before it stanoveno what went wrong and why process lasted scandalous four years.
My tušení is that the officials with good intentions too affecting South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, vychvalovaný model of corporate fakultách as desirable alternative to reprisal justice.
In South African-based negotiations was the most important question of the future obžalovaného, but past victims.
All the victims were led to vyprávěly their story and obžalovaný listened.
In the case of the slaughters vytrpěných in the twentieth century, the story stories could take decades.
Povzbuzovat victims to talk, and then giving obžalovanému right obstruct negotiations vychvalováním their merit in a position of the political leader is a recipe for endless zdržování.
One lesson that we from processes with Milosevic and Hussein odnesli is that it is not well build a man or woman before the Court because to skoncovali with their charismatickou přitažlivostí.
Defendants process překroutí -- especially if the possibility of defending the themselves -- and the courtroom use to obhajování of his career.
Tyrants should be when are clearly beaten.
The irony is that advantage of the Nuremberg court tribunals was their fill the most representative of the victorious powers.
They were göringovi hessovi, and their pomahačům a constant reminder that control have in the hands of the allies and that the Nazis were nezvratně beaten.
A clear goal process was always punishment of culprit, not powerful way, which will psány history.
Milosevic's tragedy and husajnova process is that the details of history has not yet neusadily and to the cost of history.
The resulting hesitation responsible people to create a procedures -- as international and national -- that nahrávaly fantaziím about zbavení guilt and return.
In the case of Hussein, this fantazie may yet zhmotnit.
Economic ambivalence Iraq
Anyone who has a Iraq to see the state divided on the community Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds.
As the fundamental dělítkem -- which probíhajícímu insurgency contributed to the same level as sectarian půtky and resistance to the US-led military occupation -- is but the deepening gap between rich and poor Iraqis.
After the liberation of Iraq to most people, especially those of the poor, in the hope of a charismatic leader who would is to defend the bitter reality everyday life.
These people were bred in fear, and should therefore idea about how would be on their society apply democracy or how could groups to protect human rights and civil society organizations help shape the future.
Iraq and soon faced a new social divisions.
On one side stood people who understand how work in democracy gain power and implement their ambitions.
Learned to speak the language of democracy, earned, money, achieve influence and to ensure that their rights and defended of an independent organization.
On the other hand, however, remains a huge population powerless Iraqis including vdov and rozvedených or abandoned women who have anyone who would postaral about them and their children.
For these people democracy and human rights mean nothing.
Are neinformovaní, poor and disease-ridden.
Became the victims of educational system, which is more than a decade ago collapsed, and are little qualified to zničeném in Iraq's economy find jobs.
For Saddam's rule was vynaloženo no effort to increase vitally levels of the poor.
I visited huge Iraqi slumy and found in a family living in homes that have barely homes are zamořeny omnipresent hmyzem and pode doors them prosakují neředěné splašky.
In the day, and in the night live in temnotě.
Although the need for nothing else than food, a decent home and allowed to gain work, waiting for these families to death and scares the tears of their hungry children.
When I met women that in these obydlích live covered me questions: democracy will give us food and homes?
Prevent democracy to men bili their manželky?
Can our children citizenship?
Will give us the right rozvést with husband, which we leave?
My answer to all these questions sound "Yes".
Yes, democracy, you will right bydlet in slušném house, the right to learn and work, providing vašim children of citizenship and lead you at the your men.
But must work hard and make all possible efforts to require their rights.
Women did: "Saddam US 35 years taught to be the unemployed, mlčenlivé and ustrašené.
What Now we can do? "
In these bezútěšných areas where a majority of Iraqis, people are becoming prey for bitter temptation.
Many of them live outside the political or government leaders.
Easily, letting the drive to violence, krádežím and sabotážím.
Poverty drives some of them to take money for violent acts ponoukáni vábničkou bogus hrdinství, which in Saddam's long rule could give průchod.
Poverty also rozjitřila trauma of Iraq's violent pasts wars and atrocities that make people less citlivými against the killings.
Although the conditions in today's Iraq attract many young men to violence, I believe that it is sufficient to provide a decent job and housing, is to save.
Particularly jobs will help young people based new lives through serious labor.
Jobs, we must create artificially only because to zamaskovali army unemployed.
We must give people the jobs that would allow them to contribute to rebuild the country.
Every individual to by its nature manifest a useful member of society.
Culture created by Saddam, however, Iraqis convinced that the only way to get authority, power and the knowledge, are political connections.
To overcome such sentiments will require time and prosperous economy, which means that the new Iraqi government must be limited power to allow private-sector growth and nourish general understanding of democracy and human rights.
Religious groups are prepared to contribute to this process.
We can also rehabilitovat technocrats, who served under Saddam, so that they have an opportunity to serve their country.
Last but not least, we must provide loans poor families to help them up obstojný life.
Above all, however, the government must from all forces trying to persuade poor Iraqis about the value of democracy and freedom and about how it is for implementing their desire for a better life important constitution.
In a country where many people regards violations of law in speech hrdinství, this will produce easily.
We are Iraqis, but also to that power should not be concentrating in a few hands and that the establishment of justice requires struggle with all forms of corruption.
If the Constitution will serve as a guarantee of freedom, democracy and security, then the poor Iraqis must learn to take this struggle for its.
Islámistická Identity
Anywhere now podíváte, Islam is used (and abused) as a political force.
Some Muslims him use as call to action; many people in the West (and elsewhere) him again see as something else "and demand his restrictions and refusal.
I as Turk, can directly vcítit to both parties of this debate.
The reason why the Islam in the West eyes look like a religion, another "is the fact that the West is now seen systematic deinstitucionalizace religion.
The West of modern life, of course, nevymizelo itself religion, but rather claims that can religious institutions to ask for the lives of the individual.
Religion in the modern world is much more than ever before personal and clerical prožitkem.
The process of deinstitucionalizace religious experience, but also place within Islam.
Politicization of Islam weakens the authority of Islamic religious class, the so-called ulema.
As in the case of the West, and Islamic religious experience becomes osobnějším.
One of the results is a matter of religious texts individual Muslims, including political radicals, intellectuals and women.
The second is then vulgarizace religious teachings knowledge, the abuse of the Koran and vytrhávání certain the part of the context in order to support for political ends.
Who now to what is in Islam legitimate, and what unlawful?
Who is making the authority of religious texts?
Who can go,, fatvu "or a meaningful,, Jihad"?
Activism and terrorism now provide - or rather vnucují - new source of legitimacy.
What about Islam means and does not mean, so they decide laikové without religious authorities schools and specialized training.
Islam is now vykládán mostly agents of political and cultural hnutími, not religious institutions.
This deinstitucionalizace allowed to Islam cease to be only local and national social pojivem and began to participate in the formation of imaginary the ties between all Muslims who everywhere feel utlačováni or expelled.
Islámismus now can uniting supporters, among them previously existed deep divisions: the spiritual sufie and vysvěcené advocates of šaríi, Shia, Sunnis, and Conservative Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran.
At the same time, with the entire Islam in motion, for his religious are rural areas and tend to cities, including cities in the West.
Many people consider the Movement for something adverse and highlight the fact that these Muslims are socially vykořeněni, leading to estrangement and in some cases, to terrorism.
The social mobility, however, it is also a condition of creating a modern worldview.
Muslims through migration, of course, are experiencing a sense of odloučení, if not directly separate from its social origin.
Their religious experience and picks up a new character, zbavený theological, social or state institutions.
Becomes a form of social fantazie within which the Muslims again a sense of belonging to Islam in the new and foreign environment.
A return to religious identity is podněcován odloučeností from modern life, but his blízkostí.
Most radicalism appears within the groups that the experiences with mobility and outsourcing into a new environment witnessed secular political thinking and městský life of the West.
In neznámém environment, neorientují, and their anchor thus becomes Islam.
If, however, this kotva work, they must Islam in the face of modernity free from its traditionally ponížených, pasivních and poslušných positions.
Nošením veils of or plnovousu, pushing the right to modlitebny in employment or in schools and požadováním special food, Muslims outwardly identify as Muslims.
Telling everyone around that are in their religious obyčejích zanícenější and úzkostlivější than those who its religiozitu limit on private lives.
For example, nemuslimové see in wearing veils of speech humiliation and podřazenosti Muslim women.
For Muslims, but from the former stigmatu became a positive confirmation of Islamic identity.
This transformation perfectly ilustrují young muslimky.
Girls, that the French and German schools nosí šátek have in many ways (notably in youth culture, the perception of fashion or language) closer to its spolužačkám than to its domáckým nevzdělaným mothers.
Nošením veil in European public sphere of these girls inadvertently changing symbol and role of Muslim women.
This tendency but runs deeper than the šátkům.
All Western Muslims now have a sense of belonging double cultural capital.
Themselves defined through their religiosity, but also adopted a universal, secular knowledge.
And because they are double cultural capital can a relatively free to přesunovat between the various activities and prostředími - home, lessons, mládežnickými alliances or urban centers for free time.
Be Muslim and be islámistou is not the same.
Currently, we are experiencing a shift away from Muslim identity to identity islámistické.
Religious I for individual Muslims přesunuje of private sphere into the public sphere.
The question for all remains whether this can be the search for identity satisfy šátky and adoption islámistických religious practice wide public, or whether positive confirmation of Islam requires fundamentálnější surrender of modernity.
A new era for Islamic science?
When natural science and mathematics enjoyed několikasetletému period of great inventions, čněla one area of the world above all others.
These mistři disciplín there were uctíváni, medicine zaznamenávala rapid development and the average citizen, zajímal how nature works.
No wonder that this region sklízela around the world respect.
In the second half of the world has poznané were so far, scientists punished, even killed.
The mathematics was based outside the law as a Godless and cizorodá discipline and later serve religious purposes.
Living standards was low.
The prosperous regions was Islamic Middle East, while ignorantská Europe's poor.
Both the religiously were orchestrated (historians in this context rozcházejí in view of the nature of the role of religion and science flourished), but only in one of them.
Today, the role of Islamic Middle East and West turned.
After World War II, undisputed on the tip of the field of science became the United States.
During this period used to come nejbystřejší students from their countries, because it is better attracted research universities and opportunities.
Until recently, the more than half postgraduálních students mathematics, natural science and engineering in the US people birth abroad.
Many of these talent after the completion of the study in the United States remain, of which těžil industry and public administration.
Islamic culture, meanwhile, joined the historical phase in which was položeno links between science and the influence of Western society, and thus science vyhýbala.
Even in countries where oil revenues could support a huge amount of research, Arab rulers similar investment nestimulovali, as a result of which their societies neprosperují as could.
The desire for greater political recognition recently encourages Islamic states to invest in technology, which is nejviditelněji reflected in Pakistan and Iran's nuclear ambitions.
Nuclear weapons while bear some political clout, but their scientific basis for it uninspiring and old.
It is a recognition of stemming from kultivace pronikavých ideas rather than from the products of past discovery.
Imagine how much influence would receive Pakistan's Institute, which would be put to head global research cancer.
And, would political rhetoric of a shift if ománští scientists discovered a key to the suppression of AIDS?
This is one nevyužitá opportunity.
But there is also another, and not just for Islamic society.
The US in the last time dopustily deep přehmatů.
At the level of the government, from the president of lower, science replaced--by "questions of faith."
Political činovníci changing reports Top scientists, if the facts come into conflict with official faith.
Also schools, povzbuzeny religiously ovlivněnou administration move center of its activities from science to "values."
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 are entry visa vydávána less and obtížněji the shánějí, which is weakening the flow of young talent to American universities.
Major scientific organization against this to no avail.
At the same time were tax laws upraveny so that investors bohatli in the short run, which is odradilo from long-term investments in research.
On the war in Iraq was vyčleněno half a trillion dollars, which is the amount that some amounts to support the basic research in the last thousand years.
Even if the US to avoid a fundamentalist temna, in any case, the risk of global domination in areas of research.
Japan pochopilo link between political influence and science in the 1980 's.
The Japanese industrialist and chairman of the administrative Council society Sony akio morita then, together with pravicovým politician šintarem išiharou gave many speeches, which in 1986 book entitled The publikovali in Japan, which can not to say.
Nastínili basic features of national strategy that recognized that global influence stems from a leading role in the field of science.
A key insight, was that military power can zastarat if "potravní chain of" military technology check the other states.
The book is narážkou on Japan's plan said "no" America's military influence when Japan will gain control of the key military technology.
Knowledge economy can be clearly build also using oil wealth.
For example, Texas was once as most Southern states economically poor and declining.
And while had already then oil revenues, the flow of dollars in the economy itself to increase prosperity as much as they may seem.
So the Texas decided to invest the money from oil production in educational foundations.
Today, the foundation of roughly equal to foundation of Harvard University, and includes 15 universities.
The result is amazing: production aircraft nearly disappeared from California, but in Texas experiencing boom.
Also research centers telecommunication companies and konsorcií has shifted to Texas, which is even a kanadském telecom giant Nortel.
And while industrial production in the US is in crisis, Texas is one of the production of the strongest economies in the world.
There is no reason why should the outcome of the same to achieve in the Middle East.
First, however, must the Islamic world redefine its proud heritage and behind the to him.
Iran's debate over Iraq
None of the countries of the Middle East it is postwar what happens in Iraq bedlivěji than Iran.
Geographical proximity, the perception of the history of the bloody confrontation with Iraq, Saddam Hussein, religious and emotional ties to Shiite Iraq and fears of the United States and his political approaches to the region is the ties that Iran to his Western neighbor vážou.
Given přetrvávajícímu tensions in relationship with America about Iran in particular the ongoing the presence of the US for humny countries, as well as America's dominant role in shaping the future postsaddámovském in Iraq.
For foreigners may be difficult to watch vnitroíránské debates. But there are those and are living, although from the perspective of greater international public are always evident.
In developing the discussion about postsaddámovském Iraq can be recognized three general approaches.
Iran's pragmatists argue that Iran cooperation with the US in postsaddámovském Iraq is inevitable, even if only because to be for the rights of Iraqi Shiite population.
For this reason should Iran to gain the assurance that the new leadership Iraq will against him hostile and that will seek the reciprocal friendly relations.
Another major considerations pragmatiků include preserving the territorial integrity Iraq and repatriaci tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.
Moderates of this type thinks that Iran's government to press for America because of the members of the organization modžáhedíne chalk sitting in Iraq and due to its full removal.
Iran's government should be to return to offer support bringing peace, stability and security in Iraq.
In short, pragmatists would an Iran - America's negotiations with the goal is focus on the agenda, which largely reflects the Iranian domestic concerns.
In summary, a conservative forces in Iran supports this approach.
The vision of another approach is činorodější role and a more pro-active cooperation Iran in reconstructing Iraq.
Advocates of this position argue that Iran is because of their well functioning network of personal and institutional ties to Iraq in advantageous position from which may facilitate the reconstruction.
According to their words, the US and the international community value of Iran's cooperation eventually ocení.
Gratitude of for Iranian cooperation should manifest by excising infrastructure modžáhedíne chalk in Iraq, perhaps in connection with Iran's commitment to act against activities an al-Qaeda and its members to banish from Iran.
Most importantly, to Iran from the US demanded the assurance that his cooperation is opětována US guarantee that Iran in the future will happen to America's military action.
Advocates of cooperation in calling for an open and clear agreement: change Iranian help with maintaining stability in the current transition period in Iraq and commitment to maintain relations in a spirit of cooperation with libovolnou permanent government, which in Iraq will for improving the regional and international position Iran.
This view is widely held between Iranian reformers, as in the government and outside the - and between internacionálněji naladěnou technocratic and business class.
Finally, for Iranian radicals is the possibility of relations based on cooperation with the US it fantazií.
Are convinced that America is only třese to undermine the security Iran and betray his national interests.
According to view the radicals will the US at least to dictate fundamental change in Iran's foreign policy.
If the worst, says the radicals, America will be actively promote change the Iranian regime.
Will actively act against to Iran has learned to use of nuclear fuel and received atomic energy, and may even try to weaken Iran's military capabilities at all.
These radicals perceive the American invasion of Iraq as a reflection of the desire of the US obklíčit Iran.
In response to this are convinced that Iran hard must defend their interests, create a strategic alliance with Russia and other regional powers and use of Iran's influence in Iraq to in Baghdad zamezilo of pro-American, protiíránské governments.
This approach support hardliners from all factions.
The overthrow of Saddam's regime was easy part of the Iraq crisis.
Now it is difficult to of: the introduction of peace and security, victory in the war against terrorism and simple belief Muslim people that America is not going to occupy Iraq, odčerpat its oil and reshape the Middle East to his image.
Meanwhile, the very probably will escalate the resistance against the US vyjádřený pumovými suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism.
Iran is pre-determined by to plnil role as a regional players because his political dynamic and Muslim identity widely rings with Muslim world.
What happens in Iraq will have profound effects on Iran and the United States cannot be than inside recommend to find their way to understand this fact.
American threats or talk of other war přilévají in Iran added to the fire resentment and frustration and to force radical forces.
If it is in the interest of the US to avoid the consequences of such, it must consider how to limit the influence of their own radicals, and to realize that American interests in Iraq will benefit most greater degree of cooperation with Iran.
The way out of Iraq
In Iraq was finally achieved phase in which all seemingly want the same thing: the coalition forces from the country.
Recent publishing interního document by the British defense about withdrawing troops this desire only dotvrzuje.
The only question is how it satisfy.
If the coalition forces setrvají in Iraq, violence, will probably eskalovat.
But if leave, will violence eskalovat also only faster.
So the real question is how to strike phase in which will have Iraq corps police and military, which will be possible to believe that in the country unchallenged law and order.
This is still need notný has long way.
Regardless of the courage many Iraqis who enter the army or to the police, no one should be surprised that to some do not fully clean motives.
In the Northern Iraq, vyřizují old scores and in ethnically diverse traditionally areas, such as irbíl, there is a virtual ethnic segregation.
In other areas, to forcibly provides Islamic law Sharia.
So how can Iraq to create a credible uniformované components that will enforce laws effectively, fair and regardless of ethnic loyalties religion and gender?
Traditional answer is: take recruit, trained and vštípit the "right" values.
In such a thing, however, is not enough time.
Must be found other ways.
Given the lack of deep-seated hodnotového system needs Iraq active civil society organizations, which will shouting police and military accountable.
These organizations can have many guises, but it is important to into their activities really zapojovaly citizens to local level and to them received support okresních, regional and national power structures, whenever expose the abuse of power.
If there control on local level and support and recognition of the value of the controls at the national level, then, most of uniformovaných forces will probably be appropriately -- and in the other is the case can be easily identified and punish.
Perhaps that appears overly optimistic, but in Afghanistan -- the country in many ways near Iraq -- there are groups that on this goal work.
A model example of how this can be done, represents a Partnership for Peace and Unity (cpau).
In Afghanistan as well as in Iraq is the highest priority of ordinary people restrictions on violence.
Cpau in the past three years operate across the country and based there peaceful committees at the county levels, which have in individual villages support satellite peacekeeping councils.
The initiative range in culture, where violence is so deeply entrenched that here children once taught aritmetiku so that the cards dead Soviet troops.
Committees as a result, trying to combine all the ingredients society -- including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women policemen, soldiers judges and entrepreneurs -- and find ways to deal with conflicts non-violent means.
Although monitoring hitherto nepředstavovalo formal part of the role of such committees (in the future, however, planning), the very fact that are in them represented in the army and police, judicial chorus is brings into contact with the rest of the company, provides zpětnou link and to build mutual trust.
Some results are noteworthy.
One of the workshopů visited from civility is not local military commander in two hours and eventually, the zdržel the week.
In conclusion is omlouval for their violent pasts and pledged to disarm its dvoutisícihlavé private army.
Now regularly navštěvuje úřadovny Committee.
In Iraq are beginning to projects as humanitarian styčné center in kirkúku play monitoring function by offering ethnically varied population opportunity to tell their difficulties and use of aid in their solutions.
Too often, but there is that, even when it is vydáno judicial decisions, as a result of intimidation is subsequently vymáháno.
Many good labor already in strengthening civil society exact American and British troops.
Neslyšíme about workshopech for the better the status of women nor a organize successfully small local elections across the country.
The mobilization of civil society, however, is extremely difficult task, especially when it is to it as in the case of Iraq needed we quickly and in a broad scale.
Military force is still necessary but as necessary are also incentives to disarm, including the prospect of economic opportunities, which are more productive than crime, and blackmail.
Fortunately, is building the functioning of civil society not only important, but also cheap.
Humanitarian styčné center operate in the kirkúku in annual cost just $75 5,000.
For ten million dollars would be the number of these centers zestonásobit -- and even if a lot of money left with.
The task is oddat such approach extend circle of activity and support to nadoraz statečné people who took commitment to lead the power to responsibility.
Otherwise, it is unlikely that the Iraqis receive security that after many years suffering so desperately need.
Democracy in nilu?
Surprising decision Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's proposed Constitutional change, which would allow direct and competitive presidential elections, could become a giant step toward democracy in Egypt, and in the Arab world.
For Westerners, for which is taken for granted pluralistic democracy may be hard to understand about how potentially huge shift is in the country uvyklé for more than fifty years on military rule.
Under the current system of Egyptian citizens can made only one in six years in a day's referendum and their say Yes or not the only person uvedené for presidential kandidátce.
This explains why someone like Mubarak regularly získával over 90% of the vote, though in low electoral participation.
The Syrian and Iraqi samovládcům with this system has even better, and no doubt because demand to vespodu every voting lístku was having said name and adresa hlasujícího.
Many observers have long argue that democratization in the Middle East is far return, as long as in the process of fully nezapojí Egypt.
Egypt could on a path of democratization issue, without first change its constitution -- must be shrink faraonské the powers of the President and establish limits on his tenure.
Indeed, President Mubarak is no longer 24 years.
Statements that wants to competitive presidential election is so important a first step.
Regime may believe that process can use in their favor, but what is not so easy control, when people feel their power.
Democratic the genie has been let out of the bottle.
In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this neklidném region, which focuses on the path of democracy.
Successfully already proceeds from either side of the Middle East Turkey and of the second Morocco.
This time, however, it seems that real initiative comes from a time close and positive results of the recent elections in Iraq, Palestine and smaller have also in Saudi Arabia.
The unprecedented demonstrations against Syria's occupation of Lebanon after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri Al appears to be no neopadají.
Egypt's opposition groups also in the last few weeks uspořádaly increasingly daring works when and other forms of civil disobedience.
The catalyst for their outrage at the end of January became the arrest and imprisonment churavého opposition leader ajmána núra.
Tough procedure governments revived domestic "Kifaya Movement" (enough), which calls for the end of Mubarak's regime.
Suddenly, it became clear that its opodstatněnost loses popular view that the Egyptians are passive and afraid to act.
On the nilu, against zažité tyranny being alliance local, regional and international forces.
The current wave of universal pressure, it seems, regime otřásla.
A month before the Mubarak's demand for a constitutional reform refused to as "just."
But whatever change his views stems from any succession events electoral initiative is to be welcomed.
It is a necessary -- if insufficient -- step towards reconstruction's stagnant political system in Egypt.
The Egyptians are now wary before symbolickými reforms?? la Tunisia, where longtime President zín Al ábidín Ben Ali created a caricature constitutional dodatku that seemingly otevíral doors rival presidential elections, but then implemented podvodný window, with a few selected control "adversaries."
In earlier tuniských presidential plebiscitech Ben Ali regularly získával 99% of the vote; now received 96%.
Let us hope that Mubarak think electoral reform more seriously.
It is necessary to its sincerity witnessed the order to okamžitému release ajmána núra and to taken steps to an end to 24 years of the state of emergency, which prevents effective action political campaigns.
Mubarak should also approved by a limit of two consecutive five-year presidencies of.
Equally important are measures budující confidence, including an open and equitable access to the media, now that the state.
I announced his intention to attend to the forthcoming presidential vote to launched a debate on these fundamental reforms.
With enjoyment I but returned to private life simple citizen, when I this autumn should safeguarded tend to be societies free and open elections.
If these steps properly introduce, become Mubarak's legacy.
Together with the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine could be the first paprsky Arab the dawn of freedom, has long zpožděného.
Historical elections in Egypt?
Of September, the Egyptians, to the polls to elect a new president. Select will of the ten people looking, among them close nor the President Mubarak Husni, that this function holds no longer 24 years.
Although there is little doubt that the result of the election is his re-election, many people this process intensively follows.
The election is preparing roughly 6 5,000 domestic electoral monitors and this week, into the country sjíždějí hundreds of foreign news reporters.
But while the entire process nepostrádá all formal features of the electoral race, some important elements autenticity here remarkably chybějí.
Despite promises not for all far from the same rules.
Mubarak still hold in the hands of disproportionate advantages: has known name, an effective monopoly on state controlled the electronic media and some 85% of the media tištěných.
Week ago vote was some opposition candidates odvysílán in Egypt's television even neither electoral spot.
All members of the presidential election commission appointed Mubarak and the new electoral rules exclude the participation of any independent people looking.
The Supreme Court in 2000 decided that the election results must be and ověřovat is 8 tons of Egyptian judges.
This was an important step towards a more just elections, because soudcovská EU during the last half-century grab executive power maintain a independence.
Mubarak's regime therefore had to use the various plot to soudcovskou Union neutralizoval.
One of them were enlargement definition of "judicial state of the" so to include thousands of loyalist state workers who have a legal education, but zero experience for a stolcem. This is true judges zahnáni into impasse, because vyjádří if protest bojkotem their dohlížitelských duty připadne this task, and this time the police which falls under the notorious for the interior.
And so should soudcovská Union in the past tend to submit -- with predictable results.
In the parliamentary election in 2000 received Mubarak's ruling party in parishes, where the elections dohlíželi real judges, approximately 38% of the vote, but in parishes under the supervision kvazisoudců this percentage of some enigma vyskočilo for 86%.
This year převratnou promises to change.
In the spring judges have held the National Assembly and usnesli that if they regime nepřizná full independence and exclusive control over the voting process will be on the upcoming presidential (or parliamentary electoral race oversee.)
Second, then left with konečnými demands: to allow monitoring voting process groups from the ranks of civil society, end interventions in the definition of actual judge for purposes of the election and agree to be in all the ballot box constantly přítomen legitimate judge, until it přepočítán, ověřen and nahlášen their content.
So far, it looks likely to patovou situation as Chairman of the presidential election commission in Egypt's television publicly stated that reject any monitoring of the electoral process citizens.
Another consider development in the run-up to the election, including the public debate whether voters have in the presidential election vote, or is bojkotovat.
Several opposition parties called for its members to elections nezúčastnili to protest svazujícím electoral rules that strongly favorizují Mubarak.
By contrast, Muslim bratrstvo, which is deemed strongest opposition groups in Egypt, pressing adherents to vhodili into box electoral votes and voted by our conscience, but to supported no "despotic, corrupt ruler."
This is an obvious, even be tacit rejection of Mubarak, a single ruler in the country in the last 24 years.
Despite repeated government výhradám preparing about 34 groups from the ranks of civil society thousands of young egypťanů to monitor local elections.
These groups argue that if the regime has in plan elections zmanipulovat, then domestic and foreign monitoring voting process should provide a problem.
Response regime is a statement that any monitoring is outside intervention in Egypt's sovereignty, and that of domestic observers urážejí integrity of judges.
This argument, however, was soon podkopán when soudcovská Union announced that one of the ranks of civil society supports.
Whatever has Mubarak's regime fear for the pressures from inside and outside to uspořádal free and fair elections, or is simply neschopen rid party cheating as a way of life, the current signs nevěstí before středečním vote no good.
The Egyptians so far, the first time zakoušejí exciting sense of resistance against tyranny and vychutnávají their newly nabytý space freedom.
Dollar complex of Europe
Currency become not only the centerpiece of business transactions, but also a diplomatic and political půtek.
When this happens, the trade transactions are complex and surrounds is greater uncertainty.
Politicization of money during the meziválečné depression is economically devastating.
But there are more současnější cases nevraživých currency wars.
In the 1960's, the centerpiece of political tahanic became the international monetary system.
Each side to other theory and otherwise, vysvětlovaly then affairs.
Europeans - especially the French - complained about what General Charles de Gaulle called "nehorázné privilegium" American dollar.
General and its exchange guru Jacques rueff argued that the US is the dollar's status as a major reserve currency brettonwoodského regime fixed exchange rates to help deficits hradili their foreign military adventure (this time in Vietnam).
France respond to the challenges of currency reform, which would do away with the strange the role of the dollar, and tried to revive deeply discredited the gold standard.
Europeans began long debate about the benefits of monetary union, whose achieving them should allow we in the face of the dollar.
From the US, but the international role of the dollar was traps.
Other countries could change their exchange rates and by keeping their greater export competitiveness.
The US government was helpless against podhodnocenému yen, which utvrzovalo belief that the outside world zneužíval dollar to attack on America's manufacturing base.
Nixon's administration concluded that the only way to help the American economy is practice monetary unilateralism - monetary expansion so dramatic to other countries forced to adjustments exchange rate.
These long zapomenuté battle with the suddenly seem to be again at hand.
The world has used the regime of fixed exchange rates, but the dollar remains the major reserve currency - it is a certain pohyblivý brettonwoodský system.
According to the Americans represents a reserve role of the dollar potential threat, while for neameričany this is another example of America's Neo-Imperial struggle for hegemony.
China in the decade, took the role of Japan 1960's, and holds its exchange rate at low level, to promote export growth.
Became so target stížností the US on nekalou competition and efforts to promote such adjustments exchange rate, which would Americans odradila from buying Chinese toys, spotřebičů and clothing.
Producers in the US concluded that podprsenky Chinese production represent a threat to the American way of life.
Europeans (particularly French), on the contrary, they complained about the failure of big America's deficits and fashionable again came de gaullův argument that the world is paid by America's war.
Some Europeans are proposing to Asian central banks, much of their reserves in the euro, it is a certain resonance generálova failed attempt to diminish America selling dollars into gold.
1960s ended, the collapse of the system, "and massive financial turbulence, accompanied by a sharp inflation growth commodity prices.
To the detriment of their all and America's role in world affairs was shaken.
A similar collapse will now likely to have different consequences.
Today's system plovoucích rates is increased and the cost of his arrangements are rozložené differently.
The majority of Americans a sharp fall of the dollar significantly suffer, as foreign buyers are forced to modify its prices for the American market.
Asia's economies grow forcefully and their central banks gradually increasing claims for the US.
In this policy probably persist, for the alternative would be a sharp decline in the competitiveness of their export sectors veledůležitém on the American market.
This gives us more time for resolving the trade deficit, which is long unsustainable.
Economically dynamic regions of the world - North America and Asia, so are a Pact, which is postará about the continuance of the central role of the American dollar.
Americans will continue to increase its debt, because this for them asijci want.
Abolition of the Pact would be against the interest of both concerned parties.
This is not about American unilateralism, because it is a cooperation with Asia.
But Europeans who are excluded from the Stability Pact, in the monetary and economic unilateralism see.
The growth of the euro against the dollar is also trnem in patě European exportujícím manufacturers.
But Europe cannot do many for its relief.
Indeed, that in the new currency conflicts, Europe will be the most losers.
The solution, which was vychvalována in the 1960s, reviving the gold standard or the creation of a common European currency - is no longer seems as too useful.
A single currency has proved measures that provide significant protection.
The old form of Europe's response - who would psychologists might call "dolarovým complex" - only to the urgency.
There is a call for the European Central Bank to spread its currency basis, as if imitace the dollar was the answer to all industrial, structural and demographic problems sužující Europe.
But a short reflection you should review that Europe's problems cannot be removed by manipulating the currency.
Protests against the new form of nehorázného exchange privileges of the US should be viewed nezkresleně: it is a way of compensation real European impotence.
Dollar complex so nevytratí, and even will deepen, because international notes value of the dollar will fall, without it visible negative effects on those who is tisknou and use.
Epidemic Policy
Americans, as well as citizens of other countries around the world, it used to that in the selection of some public officials plays an important role policy.
What is surprising is málokoho (though it is perhaps some zklamán), if it is in the federal judicial office or on high diplomatic post appointed candidate, which has passed a test of commitment to a principle that is relevant for the President's or premiérovu party.
But science differ, agree with all - and here the United States are beginning to vyčnívat warning as an example for the rest of the world.
The appointment of the scientific positions should be to rely on objective criteria, education, and success.
Of course, is a legitimate question her about the future minister of health and social services to his views about abortion.
But it is very clearly room for doubt, when they are tests political loyalty podrobováni candidates nominovaní in Scientific Advisory Committee.
Similarly, that membership in bodies that they conduct peer assessing peer review () scientific proposals - a process of fundamental importance for scientific advance - would undoubtedly should not be narrowed barriers, which neváží to technical qualifications.
Scientists in the US on such obstacles, narážejí increasingly.
Journal Science on the subject last autumn published several contributions.
One concerned complete exchange members Consultative Committee of the national Center for hygienu, elements of centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), without this who with the director of the center of konzultoval.
Similar cases are within cdc affected also Consultative Committee for methyl olovem and its prevention, Consultative Committee for national protection of human resources in research and Consultative Committee for genetic testing.
The current epidemic ideology, during which close advisory boards and then will sestavují with new members, and when the candidates are subjecting zkouškám loyalty, some observers for seems old known písnička.
Officials of the Ministry of health and social services it called "the standard practice."
In America, but it did not usual practice is - or at least nebývala.
Nejznepokojivější in any case, the news is that the Bush administration is exploring relationship candidates to its "values."
Most fearsome is how deep the ideological lustrace runs. Affects the region, which against the type of manipulation were immune from.
Perhaps nejvýmluvnějším case spreading political plague was obměna membership research section of National Institute of security and health protection at work, which in grants in the area of study úrazů in the workplace.
Advisory boards perhaps in the past to the occasional dosazování spřízněných soul were vulnerable.
Eventually, it is what they recommend policies that then politicians want to, or do not want to address.
But research section?
In October 2002 journal Science published an úvodník David michaelse groups and his colleagues.
Some of them were former outstanding state workers who působívali in several of Chernobyl-affected committees, and bring on this issue valuable perspective based on personal experiences.
Their contribution was itself revelations, but what followed, was even more attractive.
Provoke a flood of letters, in which the scientists svěřovali with similar experiences.
The proposed by the into koordinačního Committee for research svalové dystrofie National Institutes health told that was prověřována zaměstnancem White House.
First was dotazována on their views about different policies of the Bush administration, all of which is to to work committee, and then it was asked the question is whether an advocate of the President's stance on the subject of embryonic stem cells.
Another pisatel, distinguished professor of psychiatry and psychology, showed testimony about that him from the White House telefonovali about his nomination to national Council for illegal drug use.
Volající argued, that is povinen him to explore, "to identified, whether zastáváte some views that could be President difficult."
According to profesorových words followed issues, with official White House scores for some odpočítával.
One example: "So it is two to three; president is against exchange jehel [in the case of intravenous drug users] of the moral reasons, regardless of the consequences."
Conversation, zvrtl in even mrazivější scene.
Bureaucracies are candidate dotázal whether voted for Bush, and when they know that, not ptal is: "Why are President support?"
This is the nature of dictatorship, rather than democracy.
The purpose of Scientific Advisory Committee is on a balanced and well calculated Council in the process of shaping policies.
If in advance protěžuje a outcome, profits is a zero - and losses huge.
Decisions that research projects will support, this is why was never affairs politicians, but kolegiálního assessing.
After all, the law, which issues ošetřuje, a federal law on advisory boards, explicitly requires that committees were a balanced and to "were nepatřičně ovlivňovány jmenujícím organ."
US Secretary of health and social services tommy Thompson and personální separation of the White House should go example of the world.
This may prove easily: dodržováním law.
The murder of in Moscow
It is time to end iluzorní the notion that "dictatorship of law" Vladimir Putin, if only about píď declined lawlessness in postcommunist Russia.
The murder of anny Politkovskaya, one of the nejstatečnějších and the best novinářek Russia, women, which should have the courage reveal brutal murder páchané Russian troops in Chechnya, is the ultimate proof that President Putin with did nothing more than tuctovou dictatorship with the contempt law.
This recognition, for the world, especially for Europe in fitting time.
Germany's foreign ministry preparing policy Russia - German relations that zapouzdří disregard for Putin's illegitimacy, because it is said in the national interest nejsilnějšího member of the European Union.
Indifference, however, is changing in ústupnost, fueling if Putin to their illegal methods pushed even on the international scene to demonstrate its current efforts to economic dušení Georgia.
The murder of Politkovskaya incited přízračný déjà sense of d??j?? vu: in Putin's Russia, as well as in the gold days of the KGB, simply losing their people.
The murder of novinářky is the third politically zabarvenou vraždou over the last three weeks.
Třicátého September was in irkutsku zastřelen enver ziganšin, the main inženýr Russia's office BP.
And 14 11 was spáchán assassinated Andrei kozlova viceguvernéra, Russia's central bank, who fought against financial scandals.
The fact that investigation murders Politkovskaya, as well as in the case of the assassination of Russia's kozlova took the prosecutor Yuri čajka, does not inspire hope that the inclusion of so senior jobs in the real democracy vzbuzovalo.
Engagement top jobs Russia's government is on the contrary, almost guarantee that vrazi never be vypátráni.
The murder of Politkovskaya is an extremely grim sign, taking into account, that this was a woman strong kritičkou Russia's president.
In their articles for one of the few other independent of Moscow newspaper novaja gazeta, as well as in his book "Putin's Russia: life in declining democracy" and "messy war: Russia's reportérka in čečně" psala politkovská about vanishing freedom, which are continue to be the hallmark of Putin's presidency.
As evidenced by exile former media tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky, and the holding of oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, in Putin's enemies waiting three possible fates: vyhnanství, prison or grave.
Neobviňuji Putin's government, that the murder of Politkovskaya objednala.
As an angažovaná journalist after all, moreover, Putin also alienated many more people in the least of even the Chechen Prime Minister ramzana kadyrova, whose with a policy of the abduction motivated desire for výkupném.
But even if associates Vladimir Putin had the zastřelením Politkovskaya in výtahu its home in the center of Moscow nothing in common, his contempt for law in any case, a atmosphere in which was the murder of committed.
As murder arcibiskupa Thomas becketta in canterburské katedrále from many staletími was also the crime spáchán in clear belief that King potěší.
Given what politkovská ztělesňovala -- responsibility democratic press questioning the Kremlin and his policy -- should a government to ensure that it did nothing bad.
In Putin's Russia was in the past six years zavražděno already 12 leading journalists.
None of these crimes was not solved, which would be done, if it was his "dictatorship of law" something more than just PR strategy.
Six years since the advent of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin was recently strongly, odporujících signals.
On one side of the world sees a young and vzdělaného leader, which is to modernize Russia -- especially by přizpůsobí his pořádkové forces and the practice of international standards.
On the other hand, President quietly přihlíží as its former colleagues of Russian security services FSB (the former KGB) are not delivering later zavražděným people any security and unleashing a series of most notorious Soviet-era spy affairs against journalists, scientists and environmental activists.
Between these "neošpehy" include journalist gregorij pasko, weapons expert Igor suťjagin, diplomat Valentin mojsejev, physicist Valentin Danilov and other.
It seems that Putin's Kremlin clique squandered the supposed kultivující influence stemming from the partnership with the West -- for example, in the form of even the holding G8 summit in St. Petersburg.
Confrontation with Western values, and this time, just another potěmkinovu village; Russia is keeps fasádu observance of laws and democratic institutions, but for these lepenkovými kulisami is still tíž svévolní surovci.
The danger in the world is now underway exports of Putin's illegitimacy.
Around the "near abroad" Russia finds roots a form of kriminalizované diplomacy.
Just look at Putin's efforts zmanipulovat earlier presidential elections in Ukraine, and of the vznášená and again stahovaná criminal charges against the opposition vůdkyni juliji Tymoshenko.
Just look at the unruly odtrženecké regions in moldávii and in Georgia, that there are only through the support of the Kremlin.
And is sufficient to see how the Kremlin to with neighbors that threatens their energy supplies.
A policeman everyone knows that when criminal behavior remain ignored, criminals are still smělejší.
It is past time that the world began in Vladimir Putin to see this, who really is: the man who drives Russia back into the shadows.
The world as a result, now must reflect on the old latinským úslovím qui tacet consentere videtur -- silence means approval -- and to ask the question is whether wise quietly approve Putin's building illegal energy superpower.
Russia's gas pipeline to empire
Gerhard Schroeder, who was before necelým month of the German Chancellor, kývl on that will be the chairman of society that is building pipeline from Russia over the Baltic Sea in Germany, as well as to Western Europe.
In many countries today, Schr??der was accused of illegal conflict of interest.
The obvious moral failures are compounded by the fact that it is now in Russia vyhrožuje that odřízne Ukraine's gas supplies, if Ukraine nepoddá prices demands Kremlin state plynařského behemota Gazprom.
The strategic intention to Russia is obvious: odstřihnout Ukraine's gas supplies means also odstřihnout most European gas, because some of the greatest European pipeline lead to Ukraine.
By new pipeline obejde Ukraine, Poland and, of course, the Baltic countries, the promise of the Kremlin more power in an effort to the regional through.
President Vladimir Putin and his administration comprised of clones former KGB, it will have to ohlížet in Western Europe, when deciding how strongly squeeze postcommunist neighbors Russia.
Europe should Putin truly arm this new imperial weapons?
Indeed, what is worse, could Russia this weapon turn against the EU, which is dependent on energy?
The fact that a society that could bring Russia means to the manipulation of the EU economy, will former German Chancellor is testimony dangerous satisfied the indifference of Europe in the face of Putin's neoimperiálním ambitions.
Russia's media are intensely aware of the growing dependence on Russian energy Europe.
Indeed, libují in it: when integrujeme and strengthen our mutual trade with gas, wrote the authors of Russian editorialů, Europe will be silent about human rights.
Putin this stance on skrytěji in his determination to what calls "independent policies."
They believe that Russia is to be "independent" on the moral and human rights issues of Western democracies.
Perhaps that are some European leaders really believe that maintain comfortable prosperity union justifies that the human rights and in other issues that the Kremlin popuzují, přinutíme to silence.
Of course, compared may speak, albeit in a "trade" matters, such as expropriation Yukos, but once the Kremlin cenově responds to our values or to criticism of Russia's crimes -- for example, in the blood of zbroceném Chechnya -- Europeans seem willing to sklapnout rather than to confront the possibility of higher energy prices, or even blockade like that, from which now stands Ukraine.
Given how Putin promíchává its družinu to their will podrobil Duma, the EU should forget about its hopes for growing "poevropštění" Russia.
Russia that Putin is building, zmutovalo from postsovětských hope for freedom in oil and gas protective sanitaire for his new vzornou elite of former KGB agent.
Indeed, Matthias warnig, CEO konsorcia budujícího pipeline that will předsedat Schroeder is of Putin's friend.
The newspaper The Wall Street Journal this year's report that warnig, which is leading Russian branch of dresdner banks, was the armed forces East German secret police Stasi and that in the late 1980s met with Putin, when the current Russian President in East Germany nasazen as špion KGB agent.
The fact that Russians tolerate government former members of the KGB, for which is nemilosrdnost and nesnášenlivost vis-??-vis opposition standard, reflects their únavu turmoil of the past 20 years.
Now it seems that the Kremlin thinks that what is good for ordinary Russians, is also good for independent states: when Russia gain tools to intimidation, izolování and bar threats against, the prospect of energy blockade will with small and weak countries nakládáno without slitování.
As a former head of state a independent Lithuania, I was repeatedly forced to such threats to tolerate.
The EU with Russia signed the many agreements, including the Treaty "common space" for freedom and justice.
The Kremlin very well can such idealismus pretend.
Its control over Eastern Europe is not always vynucoval on the basis of "the Conventions on friendship," and Soviet invasion Hungary in 1956, and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 were "fraternal" misemi.
Just look as Putin this "common" space abuses: with the Chechens, goes barbarsky, the entrepreneur Mikhail Khodorkovsky is arrested, foreign NGO's pronásledovány and one of the vůdkyň last year the Orange Revolution juliji tymošenkovou, obžalovali Russian military prosecutors from vykonstruovaných crimes.
Think if Europeans common space for human rights and freedom seriously, must recognize that vypočítaví Kremlin dosazenci these values nesdílejí.
The same is true for nahlížení on Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.
Is it really represent that domovina "red terror" with bezpočtem nepotrestaných crimes of the Soviet era, potřísněná blood from Lithuania until after the Caucasus, provide a solid assistance in order to prevent Iran and North Korea in endangering the world?
As likely to be that Cold brains the Kremlin only each crisis use as an opportunity to strengthen their malignant power and influence.
The area of Europe, from which I come, was decades vydána on's evil.
So could only so sit quietly and watch as Europe blindly klopýtá to a new appeasement.
We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, we have learned to from his legacy that behind every diplomatic act Russia lie imperial ambitions.
West Europeans, who were the legacy of spared should our warnings attention.
Dependence on Russia -- though its face today is supposedly "charismatic" Gerhard Schroeder -- will only to the brink.
Iraq's elections and the bullets
When in 2003, the war in Iraq, should the Bush administration very ambitious plans, as in the case of Germany and Japan after 1945, the supposed long and peaceful occupation, during which ensure prosperity rising oil production, and will after parts of the budovány democratic structures.
The should be liberal, or directly post-modern constitution containing a guarantee of 25% of the parliamentary seats for women.
In today's Iraq is peace and prosperity.
The constitution, which will vote on October 15, while the zakotvuje pětadvacetiprocentní rule, but otherwise is far from liberal.
The key provisions (Article 2), according to which no law must not be at odds with "nespornými rules of Islam," violates basic principle Parliamentary sovereignty and will defend to legislation splňovala international standards.
For example, the sexual zletilosti for girls cannot be set on more than nine years, because he Mohamed should devítiletou manželku.
From this means that devítileté girls are zletilé even in terms of criminal law, and can be against them applied the death penalty -- say, for that violated to other religions.
In a wider scale can then Shia this provision used to nadřadili their ayatollahs over elected parliament, as in Iran, because only those are to determine the "rules of the" Islam.
Outsiders and few Iraqi liberals are worried mainly because of this Islamic provisions, but widespread the Sunni resistance to the Constitution is directed against other stories: against the exclusion of "saddámistické Ba 'ath Party" of political life, and government and against federalistickým provisions that admit autonomy 18 Iraqi provinciím and allow them to integrate into regional governments.
The rule of exclusion is for elite Sunnis -- including tisícovek businessmen, experts, and even artists -- personal affairs, because only a few exceptions, all members of the Ba 'ath Party.
In theory can be the constitutional prohibition interpret so that applies only in the future.
In practice, but now administrative rules by so that exclude the so-called "senior" Baathists of any form of government employment, which affects thousands of people.
Federalist provision would Sunnis are likely to accept should apply only to the Kurds.
They know that alternative is a return to centralismu, but of three provinces with kurdskou mostly -- dahúk, irbíl and sulajmaníja -- and the creation of an independent Kurdistan with its own financial service, the army (peš merga) and oil production in the vicinity of kirkúku, where are the second largest reserves in Iraq.
For the Sunnis but the same arrangements reject the federal, because it is considered Arab brothers, who in the past, to accept the Sunni and government will do so again -- if the government will have their own.
This would them, the new constitution allowed, because the province with Shiite majority in the south -- where it is more of the Iraqi oil deposits -- could create their own regional government.
So the disappointed Sunni leaders who are with a constitution nespokojeni, now in the usual style of the Middle East threatened violence.
Federalism, however, there is no reason why hlasatelé Sunni superiority and Islamists conduct murderous attacks.
Their opposition is fundamentally: not accept the principle of democratic governments of the majority.
Instead, trying to restore government Sunni minority.
According to the Islamists all Shia as odpadlíci as deserve death.
Also one Shiite leader muktada sadr is fiercely opposed to federalism.
His supporters are mostly illiterate, the poorest and violent Shia of Baghdad and other slumů, whose "mahdíovské militia" sváděly in 2004 struggle with American troops, though Americans protect Shi 'a Sunni bombers.
As a very young priest that his authority sprang from the late father -- Ayatollah and also populists -- is sadr in opposition to the Iraqi living ajatolláhům that abhorrent in his ignorance and násilnictví.
Sadr with them cannot possibly compete on religious authorities, and so against them's Arab / nationalist stance, with frequently reminded that the highest Shiite cleric Ayatollah sistání is Arab, but peršan.
In a similar spirit his followers reminded that hakímové, who is leading the top of the Council for Islamic revolution in Iraq (sciri), and their "badrovské" militia were placenými exulanty in Iran -- and many of them fought in a long and the bitter an Iran, the Iraq war on the part of Iran -- as long as is the Americans "nepřivedli back."
Sadr oppose federalism because Shi 'ite regional government would listened to his enemies Sistani and sciri, and, according to his words would fell into the Iranian influence.
To their position stressed sent sadr its men to attack against badrovským militias -- in Baghdad, where many mahdíovců, met an achievement, but narazil in nadžáfu, where it is nenáviděn because of the devastation of that there in the last year napáchal than his men zmasakrovali Americans.
To handle sadrovi as to banditovi was very bad; simple political aritmetika now shows that he will likely be the key figure that determine the outcome říjnového vote on the constitution.
To the constitution rejected and vynutili the new elections to the constitutional convention first, need its opponents dvoutřetinovou majority of at least three provinces.
The Sunnis appears to win only in two provinces, but imposes if sadr his followers in Baghdad slums to, together with local Sunni "no" votes, probably this vychýlí misku the scales on the party's opponents of the constitution and ensure that its refusal.
As a political bandita sadr, of course, is willing to be buy.
Last year, for it was vypsána reward for murder.
Now wants recognition as statesman, money, and at least indirect humiliation Sistani and sciri.
Could get a supply and it is possible that smlouvání already began.
Some Shia, in which the sadr stokes words and kulkami, but have tisícovkami ozbrojenců and believe that the only offering for him should be again the bullets.
The fall of the secret policajta
As has found the Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc gyurcsány when nahrávka with its recognition that the government lže, a street turmoil, openness governance in the new democracies of Eastern European nezavádí easily.
Also postcommunist Romania is like Hungary struggled to increase transparency and integrity in a society that once belonged to nejuzavřenějším in the world.
Continuing secretiveness, however, despite our fight allowed the explosion of corruption and abuse of official authority.
At the same time, and finally came to real move towards openness -- this progress recognize and the European Union, when Romania has the green light to join in 2007.
In addition to achieve what the EU now considered "functioning market economy", a key and political and legal changes on which I as Secretary of the possibility of justice should scrutinize: from greater transparency and better control financing political parties to the revolutionary changes in the judiciary.
Reform of the judiciary, help undercut corruption.
Charges has been raised against the former and current ministers government poslancům, judges, state representatives, advokátům, police and tariff důstojníkům and other public officials, as well as ředitelům private firms.
Moreover, they were adopted new standardized tiskopisy for confession ownership conditions and financial interests in all those who hold official function in government, parliament, the public and local employment and in the judiciary.
The new property confession are nejpodrobnější in Europe and -- which is even more important -- are also released.
The progress of Romania affirms and report by the early October, according to which is now approach citizens Eastern European countries to government information at the same level as in the established democracies.
The report watchdog and silence that forge initiative for justice Foundation (the open society it can be found on WWW. Justiceinitiative. Org), even suggests that, in particular, the old ways can democracy from new learn: some governmental bodies in Romania are to by citizens of information vnímavější than comparable bodies in France and Spain.
In particular, was in Romania positively vyřízeno 60% of conventional by bureaucrats, while in France was 31% in Spain and 24%.
Among other countries that have a good outcome include Peru and Mexico, which adopted its laws on freedom of information left in 2002, shortly after the Romania.
To gain access to information sensitive in emerging markets democracies, however, is not always easy, as I have convinced during her earlier in the role of obhájkyně of human rights to the Romanian helsinský Committee.
Often, we had to turn up to the Court to on the basis of Romanian law on freedom of information from 2001 vynutili disclosure of certain information.
For example, even though we win the controversy regarding access to záznamům eavesdropping enacted by Secretary prokurátorem, prosecutor Court ordered simply ignored.
They filed are so at him občanskoprávní against and judge him vyměřil pokutu for every day containment of information.
Yet were information -- containing data on the number of eavesdropping enacted by over the past 10 years, against whom and for how long -- reported only after the case of our gain media attention.
Their for the Romania began oprošťovat from the past, which has dominated the Securitate.
Today, and I itself I sit in government and realize that share information with the public is sometimes hard.
But when they are necessary painful reforms is no alternative.
Economic and political reforms that US today entitle to EU membership would not have had nevystavili political decisions public scrutiny and nesmířili with higher public participation in the decision-making process, which such openness inevitably accompanied by a.
Today, of openness has become part and parcel of the democratic government everywhere.
When in 1966 adopted its own law on freedom of information, the United States, join it to exclusive society comprising then only švédskem and Finland.
Now has such a law about 65 countries.
Those who for law on freedom of information fought in Romania, it now fully use.
Autorům studies initiative for justice, who in the framework of its demand for Romanian government information were willingly to even such data, whose disclosure would before a few years was inconceivable.
Romania, the Defense Ministry zveřejnilo, for example, the number of members of the armed forces who died in 2003, including the causes of their deaths (including a 13 suicides, two zastřelení and two deaths in combat in Afghanistan).
Bucharest's Court was, asked about the data on the number of judges pokáraných from the beginning of the year 2000, including reasons these forms of punitive measures.
The Court postoupil request top judicial Council, which response in full breadth: čtyřstránkovým seznamem all potrestaných judges, including those detailed reasons and annual punishment.
This information is the result of and at the same time, and the motor of continuing reforms.
For people in the government is not always enjoyable and because of sensitive documents from always arise tahanice.
In the former communist bloc, however, are gains from transparency undeniable.
At the same time, Romania's experience shows that official concealment remains a threat to the basic values democratic governance and that only a constant vigilance in the established and young democracies can prevent the spread of its.
Zachraňme trees life
None of US neprožije a day, without use product coming from the forest.
Paper to which píšeme, water, that we flowing from kohoutku, drug that US uzdraví, timber, from which stavíme homes and furniture, all of this has origins in the forest, and far more funds than most people realize.
Forests provide both a fresh air, which dýcháme and home for endangered species.
Provide us vacation opportunities that are in our složitém world increasingly important.
About 1.5 billion of poor people living in rural around the world depends on lesích about their basic needs, such as food and palivové timber.
Yet deforestation continues.
Year after year ztratíme 14 6 million acres forests -- it is a rozlohu four times more than Switzerland.
Its sinister influence spájí irresponsible forest;, stupňované bad government regulation and poor law enforcement, and markets, which odměňují illegal extracting timber and unisono planýrují valuable and nejohroženější forests of the world.
When will fall forests, usually follows a number of environmental, social and economic problems that US somehow affecting all.
A good example is Indonesia's island Sumatra.
Businesses producing celulózu paper and encourage bezuzdné and illegal forest destruction, where lies the richest diversity plants in the world.
It is likely that so vyhynou even neobjevené plants and živočišné endangered species, such as sumaterský nosorožec, slon and orangutan.
Until Sumatra lost their forests, the entire societies people find themselves without proper jobs for life and without any possibility of properly to make a living.
Perversion of global markets caused business with nelegálními, inexpensive získávanými products, leads to znevýhodňování those enterprises that behave like odpovědní citizens of the world.
Developing countries for illegal extract timber comes year about $15 billion dollars of income tax.
To this was not enough, unsustainable claims posed by the sumaterské forests even 'demand for dřevě on reconstruction of last year after the tsunami.
Similar threats are clear and in the Amazon and in konžské pánvi.
A recent report Millennium ecosystem assessment (mea) shows that in these and other major areas occurs because of poor; to decline forests, that will be ubývat, if the proper steps are taken.
The information published Brazilian government suggest that deforestation nenahraditelných amazonských forests, caused by factors such as conversion of forests in agricultural land, intervene in the past year 2, 6 million acres, thus odlesněná land amazonie grown at 17%.
Battle against deforestation, but even neprohráli.
Diverse organizations, environmentalisté and associations that state of the world's forests about associate its forces to deforestation reversing and zlepšili managing forests.
For example, the world fund conservation (wwf) and the World Bank helped Brazil's government to launch initiative within which a more than 17 million acres of new proprietary forest ploch, such as national parks.
The alliance wwf and World Bank also motivating their partners to establish Trust Fund, which these protected slopes will be run.
The summit leaders countries konžské Basin also resulted in the extraordinary cross-border cooperation in the protection of forests and responsible for managing them.
This has led to the initiative subsidized 53 millions of dollars by the State Department of the United States to support the protection of forests around konga.
From the first meeting leaders in 1999 was still in konžské pánvi based newly protected territory about rozloze 3.5 million acres.
Nevertheless, given the consequences of Asian tsunami from last December, pádnosti evidence presented mea and statistics zachycujícím deforestation in key pralesních regions must our efforts to continue.
The World Bank and wwf recently promised that common effort help cut the global deforestation about 10% by 2010 and that will cooperate with other institutions public and private sector to pursue a ambitious goals aimed to protect forests.
Wwf studies show that if the world's forests divided on a mixture of different types of and -- including protected responsibly administered territory, commercial forests and renewed zalesněné landscape -- could be as satisfy world demand for forest product and also in the foreseeable future protect environmental and social values.
Its role in implementing this vision must play leaders trade governments and organization of civil society.
The al-Saud are fanatics?
The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia led many not only to challenge the outlook for the ruling dynasty the al-Saud on survival, but also to the question of whether the Kingdom is deeply inefficient and destructive.
It seems, the Saudi society zplodila flow of violent fanaticism, which recruits inspiration from extreme religious orthodoxy.
The fact that 15 of devatenácti airline hijackers who September 11, 2001 attacked the United States, were Saudis to loose dávnému view of the Kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.
In some ways, this view is correct, but it cannot be enforced on broad Saudi public.
On the contrary, it would be a mistake to believe that the Saudi attitude towards religion is fully in fanatickém islámismu.
The years between 2001 and 2003, I was a member of the team that carried out a vast survey values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Iran.
Our results bring surprisingly jemně stínovaný picture Saudi positions.
Compared to respondentům from other countries of the Middle East are the al-Saud overall less religious and their attitudes toward democracy and parents dohodnutým sňatkům also point to moderate tendencies.
Of course, in all four countries is piety widespread - more than 90% of respondents together argue that believe in God, posmrtný life and heaven and citizens hell.
The al-Saud but seem to be less than their Muslim religious druzi.
For zbožné, was 62% of the Saudi, but 82% of Iranians, 85% jordánců and 98% egypťanů.
As zbožnější than the al-Saud seems and Americans, who are so call themselves from 81%.
To some extent can be explained by the differences in how the different nations explain what it means be zbožný.
For example, Americans can piety define other than those in the Middle East, with their definition will probably lnout to religious beliefs less than in the Islamic countries.
This may explain part of the differences between Muslim countries.
But the gap between domestic definition of zbožnosti between the Saudis on one side and Iranians, jordánci Egyptians, and on the other side is so large that calls into question the prevailing perspective on Saudi Arabia as a highly conservative and zbožnou society.
After all, actions talk clearly than words, compared to 27% reacts, 44% jordánců, 42% egypťanů and 45% of Americans, just 28% of the Saudi said that each week in services.
These findings, though contrasting to generally rozšířeným views on the Saudi culture, are less překvapivá than it seems.
Sociologists religion has long claimed that in a rigid religious environment or in an environment where religious institutions are closely provázány the state, universal piety public has declined.
There is to be convinced that when the authorities vymáhají strict observance of norms negotiations, people tend to the revolt and divert from officially schvalovaných religious institutions.
Then there is no surprise that Egyptians and jordánci who live in countries where state faith force enforced, are zbožnější than the Iranians and Saudis have must face local "mravnostní" police zaštítěnou state.
Even in terms of sňatkům express the al-Saud unexpectedly liberal ideas.
Subjects were in things smluvených marriages almost evenly divided, for half held that marriage should be to rely on approval parents, while 48% of those polled could as base manželského Union priority love.
Given the entrenched segregation of women and men and otcovské dominance this findings seems revelations strong desire for greater individual options elections in things, which has traditionally decisions families.
Finally, the al-Sauds have show a strong advocates of democracy, which also understood the idea of an enlarged, conservatism.
Democracy in the form of government was 58% of all of those polled Saudis, with 23% nesouhlasilo and 18% of its view nevyjádřilo.
Majority support for democracy in the country without the previous secular and national history seemingly contradicts logic.
In fact, support for democracy fits the number of other liberal positions, that we have found in Saudi Arabia.
Supporters of democracy are less religious, sekulárnější, tolerantnější toward other, more critical to the behavior of public sector and are more interested in cultural invasion of the West.
Moreover, data from survey also history shows that liberal ideas are on the popularity, if people ruling despotic finance-prince in conjunction with religious establishment.
In response to religious despotism Sultan abdülhamida at the end of the nineteenth century, a strong flow of liberalism in Ottoman Syria.
In the same period, in Iran has shown protiklerikální, secular movement for government according to the constitution, in response to the absolutist alliance between kádžárovskými šáhy and religious institutions.
In the knowledge similarities between these historical precedents and current conditions in Saudi Arabia, the possibility of reform should vylučovat.
The results of the survey now also suggests that the al-Saud could demand transparent policies and less intervenční religion.
The museum
At the end of the nineteenth century Europe viewed Asia mainly as a source of inspiration for their artists, or on the imperial ambitions.
Asijci again see Europe either as a model of modernity, such as in Japan during the period meidži, or a barometr decline, for example, in China.
One hundred years later, Japan's economic miracle made in the eyes of Europeans vzezření at least part of Asia's instead of a technical and industrial progress.
Today, in the early years of the twenty-first century, the perception of Europe in Asia and Asia in Europe dramatically changes, as Asia's economies through boom, while the European Union to sink into identity crisis and sebedůvěry.
Outstanding asijci, for example, a former Prime Minister Singaporean Lee kuan yew, now Europeans warn that if will continue to current direction, Europe has quickly become irrelevant in all but turismu upscale and real estate.
China's prominent obchodník that their time tied among Hong Kong and London, was more concrete.
A few weeks ago on private meeting top trade and political leaders in Paris said: "You Europeans začínáte become Third World, trávíte time in the wrong issues -- the constitution, the welfare state, pension crisis -- and systematically badly odpovídáte on issues that kladete."
Europeans views on Asia in general and on China above all, are complex and been erratic from a sober adapting to the new and respected competitor to purely ideological denial.
In May 1968 in France students -- or at least part of their -- who vyšli into the streets to vynalezli new world, dreamed of Maoist China, the country in the midst of brutal and meaningless Cultural Revolution.
Their absurd and výstřední poblouznění was as a consequence of ignorance maových crimes, and the result of znuděnosti youth in a society where was practically non-existent unemployment.
Their heirs today, by contrast, openly criticize Asian capitalist model.
The past, China was protikapitalistickou reflect a radiant star utopických revolucionářů; now turned into ultraliberální metlu in the eyes of a new generation of utopických reakcionářů -- obránců of the status quo in Europe.
Studentští demonstrators in the streets of Paris, recently do not want to look like the Chinese or Indians; zavrhují logic of globalization and refuse to abandon its hard vydobytých social jistot.
The European economic elites view on China and India very differently.
Now is fully aware that their somewhat nostalgic postkoloniální view of these countries as a major export markets and huge zásobníky cheap labor has endured.
China and India have become real competitors, who deserve respect, if not directly awed.
The quality of the costs and the deadline add automobilové in manufacturing, for example, are European standards.
Europe has uchovává advantage in the area of genuine science, for example, in the pharmaceutical industry, but the emerging society world standards, especially in India, are increasingly able to hire absolventy MIT and Harvard and at the same time maintaining lower labor costs, and thus global competitiveness.
Unfortunately, though, European leaders Asian challenge recognizing to use it as a litmus test of reality in inevitable process of globalization even as a calling into weapons in social and economic issues.
In fact, can be fairly say that Europe's politicians, with a few exceptions, such as Tony Blair, are too pomalí and have this view of the world to set in accordance with the pace of the revolutionary changes in Asia.
Jailed between the lack of long-term strategic vision and obsession with short-run interests, European politicians are so far from much of the nevydobyli respect its Asian counterparts, unlike European companies, which in the Asian eyes are much better.
Of course, asijci for a continent that largely failed to bury history and its zabouchnout the door for nationalist strašáky, often see as well as for the EU model reconciliation, peace and prosperity.
But if the European performance will continue to fall, this view?
Perhaps that would then asijci began to the European model regarded as a political version of benátek -- instead that it is worth visit with nostalgic for his former slávě and with obdivem to his muzejní nature.
The Khmer and modří
Exchange Colin Powell for condoleezzu riceovou position on foreign minister, the US shows that America's recent presidential elections have remain strong dozvuky.
To understand what we elections say about America, but it is important not only for Americans, but for the world.
This year's presidential election on shows that America's democracy may be healthy, but that some things might be better.
Compared to the elections in 2000, when President Bush earned most popular and barely won in by an electoral college, this time, Bush won a 3.5 million votes.
Although some Democrats are still zatrpklí, serious questioning of the legitimacy of Bush's victory appears rarely.
America remains just allocated on the Red states (Republican) and blue states (democratic).
If 100,000 votes in red state Ohio it otherwise, President would be John Kerry (though would těšil minority všelidové support).
An electoral college was in the US Constitution zaveden to protect small states in the federal system, but nowadays means that political campaign has largely focused on battle in some half-dozen states, where there is a public opinion just divided.
Even more important is that the victory of President without všelidové support is something nemístného.
Nazrál is time to serious discussion of change the constitution, which would an electoral college down.
Some observers also complain about štvavou negativistickou rhetoric and advertising, which campaign charakterizovaly.
But it must be judged in historical perspective.
In an era of fathers fathers were newspapers extremely party and George washingtona were terrified hrubost language policy.
After a large part of its early history -- a period of civil war and the postwar reconstruction not to mention -- was divided country so just as now and těsnost usually is reflected in lítých rétorikách campaign.
Yet, despite štvavé promotions on both sides, three celostátně vysílané televised debates serious way raised important issues and won the broad attention viewers.
Generally, that the incumbent president with growing economy has hopes for re-election.
In this sense, in Bush's re-election surprising, about how a majority of it.
Largely this caused nepopulárnost the Iraq war.
Kerry has tried to impose a central issue campaign war, low level of jobs, lack of health care, and the Bush tax cuts for the group with higher incomes, but some observers should feel that it never nevyústilo in a clear message.
Bush kontroval concerns about security in the face of terrorism and cultural populism on issues such as marriages gay and a right to abortion.
Eventually, security and cultural populism trumfovaly over economic populism.
Interpretation of the election affect ankety in východů of polling stations, in which were voters interviewed (after vhození voice in box), what matters are the most important for them.
Most respondents (22%) said that "moral values", by contrast, 20% wanted called the economy and 19% mentioned terrorism.
Social conservatives this vysvětlovali so that they Bush assure victory and that would their agenda to dominate another the President's electoral term.
Poll conducted pewovým střediskem a week later, suggested that category of "moral values" involves a wide range of issues, not just the right to abortion and wedding gay couple.
In fact, polls show that the 25% of the public support marriages gay couple and 35% prefer legal občanskoprávní ties gay a (so stance obhajovaným Kerry).
Nevertheless, in the case of 37% of those who are sňatkům against homosexuals, particularly in red center countries subject helped to mobilize the voters and make them go to the elections.
A deeper question is whether the US is hopelessly riven by.
The map of red and modrých states gave rise to the Internet anekdotám and kresleným vtipům that a blue coast, odtrhávají from Red center of the country.
Some call this the "coastopia" (coastal Utopia).
Dividing line but not so harsh.
Each camps in some countries won only with small náskokem, and if the map nevybarvíme at the national level, but okresů, much of the country looks pretty fialově.
A better than description of coast versus nitro state is greater city versus suburbs and countryside.
Opinion polls this confirms, for they show that a majority of Americans extrémům belong to the political spectrum, but that is natěsnána in his umírněném center.
The political elite, such as party activists and members of Congress, but they are more prone to excesses than the public.
This is initially look like a puzzle, precisely because they should have the incentive to posunovat to center, which is the rich to voters.
Many members of the Congress but represent obvody that are for their parties safe, so their re-election is at stake in the party primárkách that dominated by aktivistická and radical fringe parties.
This tendency to strengthen the rise of kabelových television, which attract viewers through hašteřivých "infozábavních" programs, and Internet bloggerů who enter urputných polemik without any redakčního filtru.
Reforms aimed at border changes Congressional districts that would have to them more competition, would help alleviate the problem, but few úřadujících kongresmanů will vote for changes that could strengthen the risk that will be beaten.
Těsnost outcome indicates that Bush won weaker than mandate is apparently convinced.
Given that face nesnadným issues in foreign, fiscal and social policies, react would be wise if neusmiřoval with its conservative membership bases, but he turned to political center. So far, however, remains unclear whether will prevail policy ideological or the pragmatic.
The oil zlozvyku zbavme
For the first priority agenda Germany for his presidency of the EU and the G8 startup in January, a Chancellor Angela Merkel solutions to climate change.
Here is a proposal, which is a broad enough to him, world leaders and consider accepted, and a clear enough to him other governments and businesses recognized: simply at the G-8 summit stanovte term, in which they cease to be in industrial countries schvalována vehicles spalující petroleum products.
Such decisions should strongly positive economic and geopolitical consequences.
The real cause of today's fears about energy is of world oil reserves, but rather that domestic oil production in its largest consumer -- Europe, the United States and China -- an is at a time when the rising Asian demand namáhá market.
Available resources will increasingly concentrated in the Middle East simply because supplies in other regions are out of the past.
The main exporters are willing to abide by its oil, investment policy demands market.
Saudi Arabia is trying to extracting oil conduct independently, while Iran potential investors deters bureaucratic impediments and corruption.
Iraq suffers from bad security situation and in what Russia now padají foreign investors klacky under its feet.
These four countries own half prokázaných world oil reserves and two-thirds of what would the potentially could export.
It is these circumstances, rather than the cost of production, lies at the core of high oil prices and rvačky about oil contracts in Central Asia and Africa.
Opinion that high oil prices are good, because serves environment, ignores basic facts of international politics.
First, in many poor African and Asian countries represent oil imports much larger share of national spending than in industrial countries, which means that is under threat economic growth and social development, while on the horizon, under the new crisis of indebtedness.
Rents of oil production in export major countries from reforms.
Because of their financial strength in great kondici regimes, for example, in Venezuela and Iran feels less and less pegged international rules.
Opozdilci between spotřebitelskými states such as China, imitate old habits industrial West, with long histories ignoring the entitlement to human rights to ensure the lucrative deals with authoritarian, oil obdařenými regimes.
Iniciovat change in a global scale can only the world's political and economic difficult weight, leading industrial countries that remain far from the largest consumer uhlovodíků.
Change must begin in transport sector, which responsible for more than half of the current oil consumption -- and the share of the likely in the future will rise.
The G-8 countries would thus should agree that since the year 2025 will povolovat no new cars fueled by oil products.
This decision would be directed against individual mobility, but against wasting rare source, which is naléhavěji need to production syntetických materials.
Political leaders should zvýhodňovat any particular technology.
Rather, should give automobilovému industry incentives for the development of alternative technologies that rely on pohon from biomasy, etylén, hydrogen, indeed, during a transition period and the natural gas.
Countries that will razit way forward politically, as collateral benefit ensure its domestic industrial area of the first place in the energy technologies, so it bad future markets.
The expected major cut CO2 emissions would eventually could trigger a breakthrough, which is needed in international climate policies.
The change would not demonstrated, and in economic development: if the vyléčili from its "dependency" on oil, it would it more to poorer, less developed and newly industrialized countries and would also be a stlačovalo uvolňovalo energy prices and geopolitical rivalries.
Geopoliticky benefits would be similarly obvious, as would greatly reduce the ability of the main vývozců oil with industrial countries.
This could increase bargaining power of the international community in the Middle East and strengthen social forces in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Russia, which genuinely want to promote from within the political and economic reform.
As a technologically advanced countries and the major producers cars is Germany in advantageous position to such Initiative launched a.
Merkel, which has Ph.D. of physics and his political career began as Secretary of the environment -- in 1995 předsedala first conference the UN Framework Convention on climate change -- is perhaps to address this issue a more credible than any of its colleagues in the EU and the G8.
It is time for brave vůdcovský act.
Myth of trade and aid
Trade and aid became international change hesly.
It seems that increase aid (including debt relief) and ensure better approach products from poor countries to the markets of rich countries are to the bottom of the world's agenda.
Now is the debate about what to do, but how much the make and how fast.
In this climate are lost clear-cut lessons from the past five decades of economic development.
On the čelném place between them list of the fact that development is largely in the hands of the poor countries.
Countries that in the recent past led well did so with their own efforts.
Aid and access to markets in the rarely played a key role.
Consider developing country that has a free and preferential access to the market of his biggest neighbor, which is as it also puts the world economy.
Suppose further, that the country can send millions of their citizens for work over the is příjemcem vast of domestic investment and is fully embodied in the international manufacturing chain.
The banking system, supports deklarovaná willingness to rich neighbor operate as lender of last resort.
Globalization has neither can be better, is - liž true?
And now to consider the country.
The from access to the world's largest market trade embargo, from the West, it not foreign aid or any other forms of support, is excluded from international organizations, such as the WTO, and must not to borrow from the IMF and World Bank.
And that these external liability was little uvaluje this economy also own high barriers to international trade (in the form of state dirigismu, import tariffs and množstevních restraints).
As has been readers may vytušil, it is a real country: Mexico and Vietnam.
Mexico has more than 3 500 kilometers long border with the United States, which it provides only privilegovaný access to the market of goods and work, but also claim to sources of America's Treasury (as it became clear during the peso crisis in 1995).
Vietnam to maintain the America until 1994 trade embargo, diplomatic relations with the countries established only in 1995 and clause of the highest advantages neudělila vietnamskému imports even after many years.
Moreover, Vietnam still stands out of the WTO.
And now compare economic performance of the two countries.
Since the signing of the Treaty NAFTA in December 1992 Mexico's economy has grown at an average annual rate of only 1%.
This is not only far below Asian economic superhvězd, moreover, but it is only a fraction of its own Mexican growth during the previous decade debt crisis of 1982 (3, 6% per year between years 1960 and 1981).
Vietnam's economy on the contrary, before the start of the economic reforms in 1998, and navázáním diplomatic engagement with the US in 1995 has grown at an annual rate of 5, 6% and even since then continues in the rapid growth in the $4.5%.
The country has experienced a dramatic decline in poverty, while in Mexico, real wages.
Both countries have a sharp increase in international trade and foreign investment, but still offer vastly different picture in ukazateli, in which matters most: in raising living standards, particularly the poor people.
These examples show that when it comes to economic the fate of the country's domestic exceeds the efforts of everything else.
Not all opportunities that Mexico offering the market of the United States, failed to balance the consequences of political errors at home, especially the inability to reverse the real exchange-rate appreciation peso and expand productivity growth made in the region close export activities to the rest of the economy.
Most of all the depends on whether a country accepts the right prorůstovou strategy.
Vietnam without any Mexican advantages a strategy that has focused on the diversity of the economy and the expansion of production capacity, domestic suppliers.
The wider post-War experience support conclusion that most importantly domestic politics.
South Korea, the early 1960's neodlepila from DNA when foreign aid was peak, but at a time when was on the wane.
Taiwan neobdržel foreign aid and has not preferential access to markets.
China and India, the two today's economic superhvězdy prosper, largely because of his jedinečnému reform efforts.
It is tempting to ascribe to rare African achievements -- botswanu and mauricius -- foreign demand for their exports (diamantech or oděvech), but this explanation works only to some extent.
It is obvious that both countries would be without access to foreign markets considerably poorer.
As in other cases of successful development is but from other neodlišují external benefits, who enjoy, but the ability to these benefits?? Capitalize on.
The story is svízelná situation in which bogged down other rich countries on the incidence of natural resources.
In Sierra Leone, the word "diamant" hardly implies peace and prosperity.
Nor little export processing zones, which is spreading around the world, the results had seen in mauriciu.
None of this nezbavuje rich countries help responsibility.
Can make the world less pohostinným for corrupt dictators -- for example, wider exchange of financial information and neuznáváním international treaties that these dictators sign.
As well as increase the number of workers from poor countries, which will be allowed to work in rich countries, and provide a broader framework for růstově oriented strategy of the WTO rules and podmíněnosti from the US should on the development of higher long-term effect.
It is far from clear that the expansion of access to markets and increase aid is nejplodnější way of drahocenného political capital in the North.
Development should not be focus on trade or to help, but to improve the political environment in poor countries.
Who is dependent now?
If now alive late Argentina's great economist as president, Ra??l prebisch, they would certainly have divil, if the world nepřevrátil upside down.
His extremely influential theory "dependency" claimed that if poor countries too rely on exports of commodities, never will achieve industrial depth, which is needed to maintain svižného growth.
Instead, they get stuck in the cycle of falling global commodities prices and an tenčících income holdings.
Prebischova upřednostňovaná policy response protectionism, has proved katastrofická for many Latin American and African countries that have put on his advice.
But it is the fact that many years seemed prebisch correctly pojmenovává long-term trends commodity prices.
Sustained efficiency gains in agriculture and extract resource stlačovaly commodity prices, especially in the 1980's and 1990 's.
With only a few exceptions, the countries that have focused on exports of commodities, managed mizerně, while natural resources neoplývající Asian countries pádily forward.
But now, when the global economy employs Asian obři, India and China, oil prices, gold grain and virtually all other commodities rise sharply.
Even though it is always will show cycles -- oil prices, for example, is likely to fall than start again rise -- the long-term trend in many commodities certainly will remain for some time growing.
One thing, that trade negotiators and other policymakers admit, even though prebisch this would postřehl immediately, is that this dramatic turn of events entails huge consequences for global balance of power.
No other aspect of economic globalization may not be in the coming decades for world leaders represent greater challenge.
Issues are many.
Today's rich countries are ready to mutual dependence era, when will after commodities prahnout as strongly as developing countries for imports and industrial technology?
Are ready to inevitable transfer of power and influence to commodity producers who will be significantly being rich?
As the two of the world's sole superpower, China and the United States, deal with the fact that a major regions vyvážející commodities, from Africa across the Middle East to Central Asia are poseté badly utvořenými national states?
Some samozvaní jasnovidci relate to issue as a problem konečnosti natural resources, with the world are necessary commodities an alarming rate are drawing.
Many supporters now has theory "hubbertova highs" in the production of oil, which has for that we have the upper limits production capacity, vrty vysychají and by now it will be just from kopce.
But, as podotýká leading historian history oil Dan yergin, proroci of announced that the world is running out of oil, not least four times.
Each time the threat of zaplašilo radical better technology.
At the end of the first decade of the 19th century oil production include collecting matter by mul.
Today, no one is surprised vrty in depth 3,000 meters below sea bottom.
To a comparable advances plošně occurred in extract rud even in agriculture.
No, the world commodities in the near nedojdou.
Instead, however, is the inclusion of 2.5 billion people (only China and India) into the global economy ústí shift in demand, which is likely to cause far more pressure on increasing commodity prices than what can vykompenzovat technological advances.
Natural resource prices will thus be directed upward at least in the next 50 to 75 years, and perhaps until the people in the next hundred will benefit on marsu.
Rozkolísá world politics change balance of global economic power, which will result?
The first world war, of course, in part to incite fears that Germany's other colonial powers, reserved too large share of world oil reserves and commodities.
In World War II, Japan similarly strachovalo about the stability of its foreign oil supplies and other natural resources.
To come to a similar tensions between China, whose natural resources are limited (problem is that even the water), and the West?
This seems unlikely, as in the meantime, fortunately, particularly given střízlivému and pragmatickému access to the Chinese leadership's problems with natural resources.
The Chinese are rozhlížejí after regions, such as Africa, and hope that it will find a permanent trading partners.
Nesdílejí political evangelism Americans who do not want to with commodity exporters only trading, but it is also aspire to turn to their faith.
But there are also tací American leaders who with respect to the energy supplies talk about turning the US in soběstačnou country.
But this is virtually joke: nestřídmost perhaps, but never self-reliance.
Much of the Arab world understandably, is the invasion of Iraq in úhelný cornerstone of real strategy of the US in the region ensure stable energy supply.
If they are right, can only hope that America is in záloze plan B.
In the meantime, will continue to rise commodity prices, with oil exporters currently represent the biggest supporters to zejícímu US trade deficit.
Perhaps that the real strategies of the US is dlužit countries vyvážejícím oil much money that will feel dependent on effectively responding America!
This is a turn that would never prebisch nepředpokládal.
Iran's so hard line
The next president, who, he chose Iran stoupenec hard line and Mayor Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, probably will aggravate as relations with the West, and international isolation of the country.
For domestic view, but probably Islamist regime will succeed better than, he would have done with more moderate result.
It is clear that the Ahmadinejad has real base podporovatelů.
But these circumstances, that ran as populist, spoke of help the poor condemned government inefficiency and vystupoval almost as the opposition candidate, are all irrelevant: was vyvolencem regime, and he received assistance and against rival candidates hard line.
Regime shape used their opportunities.
A little pragmatičtějšího hášimího rafsandžáního that nesouhlasil with some existing policies, turned into a representative of the "establishment" and their own person in rebela.
Thus, the government to take advantage of feeling directed against the establishment to strengthen the personal power.
The fact that last President Mohammad chátamí was přívržencem reform movement -- though přívržencem neprůbojným, which eventually nothing achieves -- underscores just how carefully ruler of the political situation turned.
Ahmadinejad is representative of the younger activists protišáhovské revolution of a century.
Indeed, in their holdings of US rukojmí in Iran, though how far on it podílel, remains the conflict.
Nejznepokojivější is that it is close to two main groups that are part of the most extreme Iran: the Islamic revolutionary guard and organization basidž.
The first is parallel prorežimní army; the second is organizations to intimidate and all opponents, who seek a more open society.
Fears that Iran conquered even more radical leadership, but alleviate two factors.
First, Ahmadinejad will focus more on internal affairs, because it will seek to improve the living standards of the poorest Iranians -- though it is not clear to what extent succeed.
Second, the ideological and foreign policy will continue to essentially the same group that is in power since the revolution.
President has less power than it seems, zastíněn above all, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah alím chameneím.
Nevertheless, ahmadínedžádovo electoral victory inexorably demonstrates challenge by Iran represents for Western policy and the stability of the Middle East.
In the first and foremost gives a sign of the most extreme elementům in Iran and terrorist clients countries -- the Lebanese Hezbollah, Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad and smaller different groups vystupujícím against Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other Arab countries -- that have the green light to the attacks.
All may decide that Iran is will promote, whether provedou anything.
Outwardly was Iran often relatively cautious, but in skrytu is leading the world's sponzorem terror.
Individual Iran's leaders sometimes could act for themselves and objednat and control certain operations; now will in such actions feel volněji.
Moreover, openly Ahmedinejad argues Iranian spěšný program to obtain nuclear weapons.
Most of Iran's politicians -- at least those that the government to publicly act -- program supports, but they prefer tiššímu and obezřetnějšímu approach.
For example, rafsandžání's building a better economic relations with the West over progress on nuclear front.
If President Ahmadinejad nuclear Iran, for it is likely that weapons used dobrodružněji.
This does not mean that it should odpálit, but rather that it is used for the purpose of diplomatic blackmail and zesilování threats until a crisis levels.
Given that Iran's leaders day what day deklarují their desire to wipe Israel off the map and fight with the US (Ahmadinejad on the road to the voting urně pošlapal picture of American), the risk of confrontation increased.
Finally, in the Ahmadinejad is likely to be daring in subversion stability in Iraq and that his victory will encourage both radical Iranian leaders so extremists within the Iraq.
Iran has now sends to Iraq amount of agents and supports out, which aim is to turn the country in klon.
Iraqis, including the Shiite Muslims -- have the same odnož profess Islam as the Iranians -- such meddling widely reject.
Militantnější Iran's stance may reinforce the of friction with Iraq and to the other anti-American violence.
In short, Iran's electoral outcome is dangerous, while both strongly destabilizing will eventually be will depend on ahmadínedžádově negotiations and on the scale of powers that him to grant Khamenei.
To deal with such openly extremist Iran -- radical and according to the standards of hard regime line oříškem -- will not only for the US, but also for Europe.
Europe's nations seek to pretend that ahmadínedžádova militant rhetoric and his provokace complaining about and that Iran's nuclear ambitions can find a diplomatic solution?
With Rafsanjani would be easy to maintain either real domluvu or simulaci cooperation.
With ahmadínedžádem will be needed but vrchovaté rates appeasement to přetrval at a minimum diplomatic development.
Some Iranian reformers and exulanti represent ahmadínedžádovo election in jasnějších barvách and argue that in the case of his administration is unlikely to be true face regime and to eliminate the West all the false promise to compromise.
But the choice may also provide the success of the regime in kooptování discontent with čtvrtstoletím radical Islamist governments.
Whatever the consequences of any, for the West ahmadínedžádovo victory means that everything concerns Iran, will be even more žhavější.
Take the rich and poor giving
It seems that President Bush is ready to turn in coming years, America's budget in ruin.
When Bush took office, the prospect of budget surpluses zaplňovaly all horizons.
Given the combination of irresponsible tax cuts that imposed the Republicans now fiscal horizon dominates zpomalující economy, praskající bubble stock markets and massive increase their military spending.
And will be worse, because the Bush administration and the Republicans dominated by Congress are gearing up to tuhle fiscal mess even more profound.
Skody causing, probably will weaken the United States and increase instability of the world economy.
America's Republican Party traditionally supported balanced budgets.
This has changed with the Reagan Administration, when the conservative Republicans to prefer tax cuts at the cost of large fiscal deficits.
President Reagan told the American people that they can also dopřávat tax cuts, growth army and the continuation of their favorite programs public spending.
Not surprisingly, the result was a series of huge budget deficits that urovnávaly for years.
Both George Bush senior and Bill Clinton had to raise taxes, to the mess of Reagan era remedy.
Tax hikes probably contributed to the victory of Bill Clinton to Bush seniorem 1992.
Yet, Clinton decisively decided to complete the process of the fiscal stability, in part because to pojistil long-term finance pension program of social security.
When in 2000 Clinton leave office, budgetary situation was best for several decades.
Then came President George Bush junior and napodobil Reagan: the large tax cuts, major spending increases on arms and continuation of the or even enlargement popular programs public spending.
The outcome was predictable.
In January 2001 was the cumulative result of the budget naplánován for a period of 2002 to 2011 with přebytkovou částkou 5, 6 trillion dollars.
In the middle of 2002, the planned surpluses disappeared.
Taking into account the change economic conditions and the threat of the war in Iraq, one would expect that the Bush administration and the dominated by Congress will in obhajování new tax cuts careful. This, but was mýlka.
Their highest priority is to enact another tax cuts that benefit most rich.
At the same time, government calls for major increase their military spending.
Given the forthcoming presidential election naplánovaným in November 2004, we can be certain that even outside the army to no a cut government spending will not.
So, it seems that large budget deficits are in the US zabydlují.
Change if the level of domestic spending in proportion to national income, the cumulative result of the budget reach for the next decade combined deficit 1.5 trillion dollars.
This number but may be still optimistic, probably because misses appropriately into account the cost of possible war in Iraq, another round of tax cuts or the danger of higher interest rates in the coming years.
As it is possible that are Republicans to these problems indifferent?
Some have greater interest in the tax cuts for the rich than anything to another.
Others believe that the deficit, forcing the large reduction of domestic public spending and this will diminish state, and this is the desire to their hearts.
The problem of this view is that most taxpayers has programs domestic spending in popular and will not be willing to support cuts in expenditure.
The question that zaráží more, this is why Americans give voice in the election takovýmto political approaches, if they should be clear that the problems are obvious.
Possible answer is that many voters impending budgetary problems comprehend.
Better answer is that the majority of Americans, such a policy nevolila.
Turnout was 2002 only around 40% and Republicans won only about half of the vote - so voices around 20% of eligible voters.
Of course, that prospects may not be the dark.
The war in Iraq can be avoided.
The proposed tax cuts, it is possible to lessen or from them upustit.
But I předvídám in the years large budget deficits and growing sense of malaise in both the US and abroad, which will come from America's macroeconomic situation.
Foreign investors may decide to limit the financing of America's budget deficit and current for fair conditions.
The dollar will weaken and may begin to a greater extent show fear of inflation.
This will cause that American policymakers lose confidence and flexibility, which is to be in dealing with economic shocks.
The poor, as in the US and abroad, could utrpět most, when President Bush and the US Congress will say the American people and the world that a large budget deficits is not enough money to fight poverty, disease, and the problems of education.
If ordinary Americans neuvědomí this fiscal danger, rich may vyváznou with another mnohamilionovým gift to, while the United States and the world bear after years of their painful consequences.
The lesson of fiscal lehkomyslnosti America
George W. Bush has done economic policy us more harm than any other President in America's history and surpassed and its faculty Ronald Reagan.
In just three years in office destroyed the fragile political consensus, which took the creation of a decade and whose to create a can claimed other ten years.
But Bush jeopardize long-term economic health and social stability America.
Because long-term budget questions that the US so bad in, they are not specific, they can of fiscal přehmatů America take important lesson also other countries.
The main problem fiscal policy is that, politicians can easily temporarily boost the popularity of the tax cuts and increases in public spending and create a massive public debt servicing and his odkládají in the future.
This stratagem can be enforced a few years, but budget deficits and growing public debt, sooner or later, forcing the painful reversal of politics.
Cynical policies, yet can buy reelection, and than will come crisis can no longer be retired.
One would have thought that after the hundreds of such ukázek fiscal irresponsibility around the world over the past decade will no longer voters to such a plot allergic.
Bush him, however, has flaunted again and yet buying the popularity nadělováním of tax cuts at the current growth military spending, and even spending on education and health care.
The result is the budget deficit corresponding more than 5% of GDP.
Worse, the long-term budget prospects of the United States were disturbing already before Bush embarked on its lehkomyslnou policy.
In the US are aging, so will come the rapid increase in spending on publicly financovanou health and pension systems.
Careful calculations show that future revenues in fiscal policy prosazované Bush will likely be about $desetibiliony lower than spending on public pensions, health care, and other fiscal výlohy that public expected.
In the future so in a moment emerges the rapid increase collecting taxes, ostrých cuts in public expenditure, or both, if it is to be napraveno Bush's actions.
So why his public policy supports?
Because the public the long-term consequences of little understands or about them little concerned, although eventually incite affect a majority of Americans.
The richest taxpayers are, of course, satisfied, because much of the tax cuts will shift is them.
It is astonishing that the richest 5% of American taxpayers was given to almost half of the tax cuts, and these taxpayers clearly expect that the majority of future expenditure cuts and tax increases will bear on their bedrech spare 95% of the population - so middle class and lower.
Bush, they managed to convince many voters from poor and middle classes that they should be that without them, however, said that if policy his administration will prevail over the longer term, will have to for their small tax cut pay more rozsáhlejším reducing government services in the future.
If Americans political memory understood that would have to this fiscal,, toboganu "in the past twenty years have one svezli.
Also, Ronald Reagan came to office with promises of tax cuts and a large increase in military spending.
In the mid 1980s the result was a huge budget deficit.
The tax cuts received reaganovi vast popularity and dopomohly him to re-election in 1984.
The return of the budget surplus to back then took more than a decade since Reagan's second term only after term George Bush older and Bill Clinton.
Of course, this means the approval of new tax cuts that equipped George Bush's re-election older and led to a polarization policy in the 1990 's.
History will almost certainly be repeated.
Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush Administration believes that today's budget deficits eventually forcing the fierce reduction in government social spending.
Hope that they can kill programs as "social security and Medicare.
The American public, however, these programs strongly supports.
Right-wing strategy tax cuts for the purpose of pozdějšího from forcing cuts in social programs so nevyjde and eventually will have to be to increase tax rates.
Other officials of the Bush Administration argue that the tax cuts are important for vyvedení the United States of recession.
This argument is also wrong.
America's economy might of recession vybřednout even without tax cuts, and perhaps even zdravěji.
In any case, it is a big mistake based long-term fiscal policy in the short business cycle.
For other countries that follow from two vitally important lessons.
The first is the realization that the looming US budget deficits sooner or later, reducing the power of the United States in the world.
Americans supported the war in Iraq only because they have to pay for it in the form of tax increases.
If they will have to choose between foreign dobrodružstvími and higher taxes, with much less likely will support the costly military operations abroad.
When the public will face fiscal mess that has left behind Bush, the US is deeply internally rozštěpí.
The second lesson is that countries should in planning budgets take into account the growing fiscal costs inspired by the population.
Taxpayers or parliaments have rarely on long-term big budget conditions.
From the governments would thus should insist that, together with the annual budget proposals provided also long-term budget projections, thus reducing the tendency to short-term political manipulation with budget.
The US can other countries to serve as a kind of early warning.
The White House should provide for the rest of the same warning, what wizards on television adresují viewers: "nezkoušejte this at home."
Securities markets and policy
Many economic and financial analysts complain that securities markets emerging countries are often considerably manipulovány its governments, and that it is a political markets more than economic.
Unspoken understanding seems to be that securities markets in advanced countries on the contrary, guided by pure some strength of the economic nature, so that predicting their performance is the same as predicting growth trees.
This description securities markets emerging countries is wrong, only zaujatý, because the same description applies also to securities markets in advanced countries.
The best analysts know that predicting performance of the stock market any country's basically means predict, as well, according to view the government has in the current political atmosphere investors in equities well.
Consider the stock market of the United States, by far the largest in the world.
General perspective is one that government between society nevměšuje and that the fruits of investment in the American stock market reflect fundamental forces strong capitalist economy.
This is one reason why the US is a magnet for portfoliové investors from around the world.
Returns, thanks to whom they are US securities markets so attractive, reflects but fragile political balance.
With the passage of time and changes political pressures are proměňovaly above all, tax rates affecting securities.
For example, during World War II reduce political support for great wealth and government sharply increased taxes capital gains, dividends and high income at all.
When World War II provoked mounting revival of the Great Depression of the 1930's President Roosevelt and Congress turning přidali tax excess benefits to the assurance that shareholders are benefiting too much.
By contrast, 1980, when, while neválčilo, but market securities was weak, American voters decided to Ronald Reagan about which many think that it is for President too pravicový.
He asked about cuts in taxes on capital gains, dividends and income - and he was served.
Political meddling in the stock market is not only taxes capital gains, dividends and income.
Taxes property, consumer tax, import tariffs and taxes turning - that are financing, either directly or indirectly, trade society - can have násobný impact on the profits of enterprises, and so on the market securities.
It is random that whenever securities markets have done, governments see that these taxes neničily clean profits enterprises.
Policy markets in stocks not ends in taxes.
Instead, the profits of enterprises, and in the consequences, and so on the market securities, has the effects of almost all of the government actions.
After the collapse of the stock market of 1929 the American government earlier majority antitrust activities, thereby firms to get the monopoly positions that reinforced by their value.
This policy zpozdila recovery from high unemployment, but even this unable to přibrzdit political forces sešikované under the banner of support of the stock market.
Similarly, one of the most important thing about which přičinil President Reagan, was destroying the substantial parts of the rest of the power of the US trade unions, which compete for their share of corporate profits pie.
Reaganovo victory over the air strike dispečerů in 1981 was fault events for both the US trade unions movement, and for market securities that 1982 began its dramatic bull market.
The American government supported market securities particularly aggressively from the moment kulminace stem stock price bubble in 2000, most notably repeated cutting interest rates.
Of course, this publicly obhajovalo in relation to encouraging the economy, not the support of the stock market.
But a telling indication of the importance of the US stock market is that it is falling prices stem stocks were deemed one of the most important factors tížících economy.
The response of the authorities are really neomezila on monetary stimulus.
The books of national income and product of the US shows that effective taxation profit enterprises (percentage of profits really odvedených government through taxes) in the first quarter of 2000, when kulminoval securities market economy and generally - climbed to $33 0.7%, while in the third quarter of 2003, when the market in a downturn, fell to 20, 2%.
Much of the decline reflects the direct tax breaks odhlasované Congress and a sense of widespread among businesses that, under the current economic and political situation can be to bypass tax průbojnější.
After the collapse of the stock market was also sharply snížena maximum tax on dividends payments of stocks, and this from 35% to 15%, which have a major advantage long-term investors and strengthen násobný effect reinvestic dividends after taxation.
Even in this case, the tax cuts obhajovány with respect to stimulate the economy, which but one can say, of course, a libovolném measures targeting the support of the stock market.
Whether it is a odůvodnění credible, but depends on the balance of political forces.
We can say that in the US is no longer 200 years by the same variable, including the resistance to high taxes and weak labor movements - and thus can be expected that will be enforced, in future and that ensure high returns on the stock market and massive inflows of foreign investment.
Those who believe that investments in the US stock market to preserve trend strong growth for decades, can be quite right.
One would but should be clear in what actually predicts.
In principle predicts not only the economy, but also policy, and even cultural values that shape the economic policy and economic performance.
Global Home
Homes are nejlokálnější of investment, rooted in a place as tree, and therefore thrive or wasting away in response to the local economic conditions.
On TV screens, we mihotá around the world, but the market with our housing, which is almost exclusively tvořen local amatéry, remains ukotvený directly in the US on zápraží.
This would, however, may soon change.
During the moon the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in cooperation with my companies macromarkets and further fiserv and Standard & Poor ', with a options and futures contracts on home prices in the ten cities of the United States.
The Treaty will underpin indexy home prices of the S & P / case - Shiller that evolved from the academic job that we almost 20 years ago průkopnicky did I and my colleague Karl case.
For many years propagujeme futures contracts for housing, but no exchange until now want to these indexů to create a termínového market use.
The futures markets aimed at prices apartment houses will allow investors around the world indirectly to invest in home in the US, when through these markets to acquire stakes in them.
Investor in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo be able to invest in home obývaných their owners in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
The fundamental principle of financial theory -- "diversification of" or "distribution of risks" -- suggests that a stake in the new contracts will be great.
People and businesses in New York, for example, are too strongly exposed to their local real estate risk, and this is why these risks should reduce selling futures contracts on prices newyorských home.
People in Tokyo take part of their risks purchasing futures on home prices in New York, if correctly tuned price.
People in New York will further live at home, but investment risk, rozloží around the world.
For a true termínového market with a family homes is no nepokusil since 1991, when their efforts to rozběhnout such market in Britain failed in London Stock Exchange with futures and options liffe (now after the merger into euronext. Liffe).
Their attempt to never create greater trade turnaround.
Stock market organizing večírek, and nobody nepřišel.
The British markets sázkami on the margins in prices apartment houses or maloprodejní online markets also never významněji failed.
Will this time otherwise?
Of course, start new market is always uncertain thing: people want to come to večírek only if there is a lot of people; if there is no one, no one wants to come.
Similarly, that in markets where is many investors, cannot be taken enough deals that would have postaraly about returns that would attract investors.
Just as it often pay for great večírky may be a bit while enigma how important new markets are in motion, but we do know that now and then this happens.
The first signs show a growing interest in trade futures on home prices, mainly because, as strongly significance diversifying risks underscore the debate about "property price bubble."
After the announcement by the CME one of its competitors, the Chicago board options exchange, said that planning to create a futures and opčních contracts for the regions of the US, which are based on mediánu home prices zveřejňovaném National Association property offices.
But also a strong public concern about investments in housing and ensure risks with the United, must be resolved another major cause, if the futures markets work: must be odkrýt prices and investors must understand what these prices mean.
To be quite likely that many of these futures markets will soon predicting substantial price declines in some major cities the US during the next year.
Will the situation, already traders call a "backwardation": termínová price is now on the market lower than the current price house.
This may need to be the first day now, when it with realitními futures trading, but it is not likely to occur within a few months.
In some of these markets can backwardation need if fulfill its function.
Everyone knows that in recent years, many of these cities (as well as other part of the world) is a real estate boom.
International investors are likely to invest in these cities, if the expectations of falling prices in the futures markets nezohlední how people Tokyo to their own hořké experience well understood.
But if the rate of backwardation sufficient, even investors, who think that the US market with housing is bound to decline, will power from futures on home prices to expect a decent profit, because get reduced prices are already on the termínovém market.
But this will require that people in New York aimed at ensuring their investments in real estate to adapt that will sell futures contracts, zapracovaným prices decline in.
They will have to be used to the idea that the market for weakening expected and that they can protect just before the scope of the possible future falling prices, which is over this expectations.
To korekcím our thinking probably will only really be future market prices.
Far future direction of real estate prices only a matter of various views.
When markets will create international consensus about the future of home prices in cities around the world, we will be able to better to manage the risks that this city faces, and the stabilize their economies -- and our own lives.
That reports hýbou markets?
Stock markets in most of the world have roughly from 10 may sharp growing drops; the main part of the collapse of occurred during the period dvoutýdenního roughly in 23, may, but prices continue to fall in the average.
Mean problems in the world's stock markets the problem for the world economy?
Consider the strongest declines.
From indexů large countries that the biggest collapse in India, where from 10 may into 22 may fall stock prices of 16, 9%.
A disaster on the other side of the world was almost as large and upper and lower highs from levels in India different a day or by two: in Argentina stock prices fall about 16, 1%, Brazil's about 14 0.7% and in Mexico 13.8%.
European markets also suffered a large losses.
In Sweden from on May 9 to 22 may stock prices fall about 15, 2%; during nearly totožného period, prices of 9 0.7% in Germany, about 9, 4% in France and in the UK and about 9, 3% in Italy.
Likewise, stock prices in Asia during the almost shodného period plummeting from the highest in the lowest values by 11, 5% in Korea, about 9, 3% in Hong Kong and 8% in Japan.
Many commentators tries to associate with these events events in the United States.
But the American stock prices fall between 9 May and 24. May only about $2%.
For global decline in seems nor China, because their stock prices are in fact, during this period increased.
The usual explanations economists revolve around monetary policy.
As a result of the deflationary scared 2003 central banks around the world have cut interest rates, inciting speculative boom as on the market with stocks and real estate market.
Now, however, according to this view, are beginning to hlodat rising interest rates, which does another drops asset prices.
This argument certainly contains a point.
America's Federal Reserve really 10 may increased rates and his Chairman Ben Bernanke then suggested that in the future may be to other rate.
They were 17 may were published data on deterioration of inflation, the US signalizující that there is another monetary tighten.
Economists like to see the world as a logical and zvladatelný, which implies that understand what is happening.
This approach its but often exaggerate the role of central banks.
Indeed, America's rate hike was only one in a number of -- that no longer šestnáctým.
From the moment in may declines in stock markets began, no other important central bank rates increased, and until 7 - 8 June when so made several banks (the European Central Bank, and banks in India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey).
Another factor is the price of oil, which from 22. In March 2 may by 24% and recorded in time absolute rekordy.
Certainly it was an important event that should be credibly affect stock markets around the world.
Increases in the oil prices were sinner virtually all economic recession since World War II.
Yet rises oil prices coincide correspond to intervalu, when in half may indexy stock markets plummeting most.
If the claim that higher oil prices caused the stock market downturns, would have to be assume několikatýdenní prodlevu a time.
Stock markets, however, are too logical and to overdue response to shocks oil prices could occur.
As for all other prices in financial markets is true that the's attention.
When oil prices rise sharply, people watch news about oil prices and about these prices, talk, triggering greater sensibilities of all of these reports.
To oil prices are linked crisis in the Middle East, and that in may in reporting dominated.
Increases in the oil prices in thinking investors probably still umocnily ominous indications and strong words some political personalities.
Israel's deputy prime Shimon Peres 8 May in response to hostile statements Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that "the president of Iran should remember that Iran may also be wiped off the map."
In the early květnového stock collapse, Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia, the world's largest state Muslim-majority, and 13th may newspapers psaly that he on two leading universities in the country received from students ovací vestoje.
This report may be regarded as evidence of that they have Ahmadinejad politically rewarding his game with fire in the nuclear question, which would be reinforced by the impression that would napjatá situation in the Middle East could result in even higher oil prices.
These reports may seem far more remote stock market than monetary policy.
But the response to them, together with the recent zvýšeními oil prices, can largely explain change market psychology.
Approaches to risk, with the passage of time is changing, and events as ahmadínedžádovy and peresovy remarks can such changes precipitate.
So, although these issues odehrávají in ways that can be difficult to kvantifikovat, analysts would probably in order to understand the course of the world's stock markets should ahmadínedžádovým words attention as well as carefully words bernankeovým.
Economists may be enthusiastic about that are to focus on public opinion on how affects price changes, on the world coverage and to the speculative dynamism.
After all, of such an approach is that economic events are less predictable (and economists less vševědoucí) than to imagine.
Such a focus but gives intuitivně sense.
What really ties ideas investors?
Ahmadinejad is charismatická person; Bernanke not.
Ahmedinejad, is to riskantního enterprise; Bernanke not.
And what is perhaps the most important, Ahmadinejad has destabilizing influence; Bernanke not.
Indeed, whatever the primary cause of global downturns stock prices of half may, for any unstable market psychology are significant.
Can be hard to believe that only related to the views on the monetary policy and not to the bigger and deeper issues, including to energetickému and political tension on which it is performance of the world economy.
Why připlácet for férovost?
Marks the S & Spencer, a chain of supermarkets and other clothing, 400 shops across Britain, recently announced that the entire their sortiment coffee and tea, fairly 38 species, is to fairtrade, marketingovému symbol "ethical output."
In their 200 cafes caf?? revive no longer a chain sells only čaj and coffee, brand fairtrade.
Are also hýbat its sales košilí and other goods from fairtrade cotton.
's announcement came during the campaign "fairtrade fortnight" dvoutýdenní promoting products férového trade, whose part of the was besední trail farmers from developing countries, who British vylíčili how fairtrade helps their community.
The shift to ethical consumption is a significant increase in the United States, as consumers are increasingly reverting to an organic, lokálně vyráběným potravinám and to vejcím from slepic that are held in klecích.
In Britain was průzkumem zjištěno that half of those who was submitted to a symbol of fairtrade, this brand recognized and knew that calls products, which provide decent conditions for farmers Third World.
A similar poll in the US, but there is a related data and discussions with my students suggest that number would be much lower.
Traders to certifikaci fairtrade must pay manufacturers of that pokryje costs sustainable production and ensure wage to live.
For example, the price of coffee is minimal 1, 26 $for pound, no matter how far can fall market price.
If the market price vystoupá over this sum, the price of fairtrade rise, in order to stick of five cents on the pound up.
From small farmers, in turn requires that the organizovali into družstev or other groups that enable democratic participation.
Plantáže and manufacturing businesses can casting fairtrade use, if their workers pay a decent salaries, lives up hygienické, security, and environmental standards, allow yet unions or other forms of organizing exactly, provide good housing, if workers live at home, and use the child or forcible labor.
Not everyone fairtrade endorses.
Brink lindsey, director protržního research centers for trade policies in katonově Institute is convinced that káva fairtrade is "well míněná blind ulička."
To some extent rightly claim that the real cause of the fall of the prices of coffee was ziskuchtivost multinational corporations, but the big increases in the production of coffee in Brazil, and in Vietnam, together with new technikami that enable coffee grow using less labor, and thus less costly.
According to lindseyova view, if we want to farmers coffee aid should is to persuade to switch from coffee to výnosnějším plodinám -- and here, for the obstacles to remove, rightly describes trade barriers and subsidies rich countries -- or to turned to products with higher value, for example, speciálním types of coffee, which brings higher prices.
But what makes the special lindseyově argument is that the campaign for fairtrade coffee can be regarded as it is a meeting of what he recommends -- persuasion farmers to have manufactured special kind of coffee, which provide them with higher prices.
The pro-market economists nothing nenamítají when corporations to promotion of their products bezostyšně use snobskou appeal.
If they want to people pay 48 per pound coffee from jamajských modrých mountains, because it is here to want to James Bond, economists nenamítají that this pokřivuje market.
So why be critical when consumers decides to pay 12 per pound coffee, which they know that was vypěstována without toxic chemicals, under stinnými trees, that helped survive ptactvu, and farmers who are now can afford to feed their children and send them in schools?
Economists can answer that if you want to help someone with výživou education and their children, you can for ten dollars buy coffee without loga fairtrade that chutná completely as well, and ušetřené $2 to Development Agency, which provides food and education for poor children.
While this is possible procedure, but fairtrade has its benefits.
Pěstitelé know that must provide product, who have preferred to consumers, both for his taste, and for the way the building.
If their product markets may well be display on that vyrobili something about what is around the world's interest.
In view of farmers is better get compensation for low-priority goods fairtrade than dobročinný příděl that would receive an even without labor and regardless of the quality of what they produce.
Připlatit behind brand fairtrade is no more "protitržní" than pay more for brand Gucci and this reflects a better ethical priorities.
Fair trade is state subsidies.
His success depends on political lobbingu, but on the market demand.
Fortunately, the market demand in Europe is soaring.
One hopes that similar levels soon achieved in the developed world, and wherever people can decide their freely zvažovaných spending.
Pigs telata and America's Democracy
In a flood of titulků about the fact that control of the United States Congress gained in last November's election Democrats remain largely ignored one great electoral outcome.
It may on one side was weaknesses of America's political system, but also resumed my belief in soucitnost Ordinary Americans.
If citizens arizony nashromáždí sufficient number of podpisů can about a draft law to let the vote in direct popular vote.
One of this year referenda the issue of law, which would zakazoval uvazování or zavírání pregnant prasnic or telat farm-raised meat on such a way that animals resists freely otočit, lehnout, and not the natáhnout končetiny.
People who that a modern industrial agriculture many do not know, they can ask why is no such legislation needed.
Agricultural methods that even 50 years ago, generally followed and in some countries are common still, yet dopřávají all animals enough space on otočení and stretching their končetin.
In the US, but now roughly 90% of chovných prasnic -- mothers pigs farm-raised and zabíjených on porcine meat, some bacon and šunku -- spend a majority of life uzamčeno in klecích about rozměrech about .6 times 2.2 meters.
They can in them otočit, lehnout, with nataženýma my feet or do more than one step forward or dozadu.
Another prasnice are chovány on a brief provazech that they also from otáčení.
Also telata are entire life shut down in individual kójích that they are neumožňují otočit, lehnout, or natáhnout končetiny.
The purpose of these methods is saving jobs -- facilitate the manipulation of the animals and allow operating chovných stations čítajících thousands of or desetitisíce animals in lower staff and lower nárocích on their expertise.
In addition to animals mrhat energy in motion or mutual potyčkách.
After the protests organizations to protect animals, the European Commission a few years ago objednala in their scientific veterinární Commission report on these methods.
The Commission found that animals are due to the inability to move freely and total lack of any náplně during the day.
The same conclusion is, of course, had to strike and common sense.
The EU after report set data for whose mark will stěsnané conditions for these animals banned.
Date set by the for telata, 1 January 2007, is already almost here.
Individual kóje for prasnice that are already in the UK and Sweden's illegal, will by 2013 banned in the EU.
Gradually are zaváděny also steps to improve conditions nosnic that are usually mačkají in holých wire klecích, where they are not enough room to roztáhly wings.
In the US are similar measures at the national level in sight.
When I my European friends in the past asked why the United States in the living conditions animals as strongly lag behind for Europe, I had to that no answer.
After another, I had to acknowledge and insistence possible explanations that Americans upon animals depends less than Europeans.
And then in 2002 to benefactor animals in Florida to všelidovému voting proposal, who would banned farming prasnic in kójích.
To the surprise of many for this proposal voted 55% of the voting.
Also in listopadovém referendum in arizoně voted despite well-paying opposition by agrobyznysu 62% of voters to ban small cages for prasnice and telata.
Florida or arizona are not progressive states -- both set in 2004 priority George W. Bush before John Kerry.
The results so strongly suggests that if given the chance to vote on the farming of prasnic and telat in so tiny cramped conditions all Americans, most would they vyslovila against.
It seems that Americans depending on the welfare of animals as Europeans.
If so, explain the gap between Europe and the US on the conditions for agricultural animals, we should focus on the political system.
In Europe voters concern about the welfare of animals effectively affecting the national parliaments, but also members of the European Parliament, the result that were national laws and the EU directive that respond to this concern.
By contrast, in the US should such a concern for members of the Congress no obvious effect.
Conditions farming farm animals neupravuje no federal legislation -- and very little legislation state.
According to me that is due to by agrobyznys can nastrkat tens of millions of dollars into the pockets of Congressional Congress seeking re-election.
Movement for animal rights, despite broad public support has not succeeded in political arena lobbismu and subsidies to electoral campaign.
In America's electoral politics have money greater than the price of the views of the electorate.
Party discipline is weak and Congressmen must much money needed to select re-election themselves -- and it is also in the case of the members of the House of Representatives happening every two years.
In Europe, with a strong party discipline and electoral campaign nefinancují individual candidates, but parties are money smaller role.
In the US, a country that has display its democratic traditions are pigs and telata hardly the who to lose.
What is happening in the new the Afghan army?
Afghanistan's murder of air transport rozzuřeným mob (perhaps podníceným members of the Afghan interim administration) shows that the Afghan society continues to be deeply ambivalent.
The first reform of the Afghan army this ambivalence even increase.
Secretary of Defense temporary Hamid Karzai's government has appointed new top army officers.
Secretary General, Mohammad Fahim, tádžik from northern panjsirského okresu, won three months ago command of the forces of the Northern Alliance that dobyly Kabul for help us bombers.
This appointment but Karzai's efforts to unite the country's overall zpochybnilo.
Afghanistan is multinational state in which nejpočetnějsí pastuni form two-fifths of the total population.
Hazárové and Tajiks constitute another two-fifths.
From 30 eight officers that Fahim povýsil into hodnosti Secretary General is Thirty seven tádžiků and the other one is Uzbek.
If in the army drafted any from 15 to sedmnácti million pastunů, will under command sestávajícím almost exclusively of tádžiků.
Pastunstina are not from tádžičtiny lisí as well as to be spanělstina since the English and millions of pastunů have přinejlepsím only basic knowledge tádžičtiny.
Geografický profile of the army's new leadership is as close as his ethnic composition.
Thirty five from 30 eight senior officers comes from the smaller the North from Kabul, from province parwan (in which is bagramské letistě) and from nedalekého panjsirského Valley, which was for a long time the root of the Northern Alliance.
In other words, of the new military elite countries was vynecháno twenty seven of the twenty nine Afghan provinces.
Such closely directed group might prevent dojmu closed caucuses, if it is composed of representatives at least 12 political parties of the country.
But this is not its case.
Eighteen from 30 eight generals are members of the Party jamiat - indeed, Islami, Islamic factions that after a long time led Mullah Burhanuddin and former professor theology rabbání.
This party ruled by a short in Kabul in the midst of the 1990s and caused bloodshed and chaos, whose in the wake of the most Afghans welcomed the emergence of the Taliban.
Virtually in the same as the number of members of the Party jamiat are in a military command represented the Communists.
Sestnáct from 30 eight generals, after a long time řadilo to side, whose activity in the late 1970s, led to the Soviet invasion in 1979, 89 that cost the life of two and a half million Afghans.
Most Afghans now on the Communists nahlíží with the same of preference as have, for example, česi or Poles to hitlerovým national Socialists.
It is true that Afghans, as well as others mívali for joining the Communist Party nejrůznějsí reasons, and in no case cannot be said that each of them was hard grounded ideologem.
But between fahimovými generals is six former party professionals who side served even after ending the invasion of the Red Army.
All of these six men, and three other the Communists, who served as the Afghan army officers, actively worked in the decade the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
We can see how would probably by, for example, the French, if a quarter of the French důstojnického chorus after World War II part of the person cooperative occupation in their countries with wehrmachtem.
After Afghanistan, new fast they promote ústně.
If so, it did, afghánstí nationalists (which virtually all Afghans are) soon political awareness of the circle of around general fahima expose.
But also the astonishing evidence of unilateralism and bias military high command might could be partially vyvrácen if new generals přináseli into national armed forces real and commitment to enhance the professionalism of vlasteneckým values.
Unfortunately, only ten from 30 eight povýsených velitelů has experience as professional military officers.
Jedenáctý serve as a pilot.
By contrast, twenty four of total (professional experience of the remaining four generals are known) comes from the civilian life in which to work in different profesích, for example, as officials of the Communist Party, one of them, has a career Mullah.
What do these data for daily practice mean?
Mean that commanders international peacekeeping force in Afghanistan, as well as US military and diplomatic officials will meet with Afghanistan's Deputy Secretary of Defense Abdul rásídem dostumem, a notorious brutal and corrupt commander, communist that keeps contacts with the old friends of the Red Army continues to serving in Moscow.
This means that commander Afghanistan's armed forces, as well as a strategic commander and commander military intelligence services are also the Communists, people, their orientation is uncertain, the person who most Afghans distrust.
Is this really group that war has divided Afghanistan bring together again?
Will these dubious generals gain confidence three čtvrtin Afghanistan's population, which was to vrchnímu armádnímu command zamezen approach?
Or is it more outcome bezuzdného approach to government, which (sometimes in the future) to other bloody ethnic response of those whose legitimate interests were now cynically poslapány?
The United Nations evropstí and American political leaders should consider these questions before with bezohledným recognition of power small and unpopular mensinou smíří.
The celebration iracionálna
Three cheers for the new Nobel Prize winners in economics, danielu kahnemanovi at Princeton University and vernonu smithovi of the university George masona in virginii.
As for nobelových prices are, this award are not only the recognition of the original work kahnemana and Smith, but also myšlenkových schools, between whose main representative of both scientists are.
The psychologist Kahneman showed that individuals are systematically behave less racionálně than to think orthodox economists.
His research not only demonstrates that people often act otherwise than to predict the standard economic theory, but also that do so regularly, and systematically in ways that one can understand and interpret through alternative hypotheses, which compete with assumptions, with which operate orthodox economists.
Most of the market participants, but also ordinary monitors - not come as nothing převratného.
Makléři on Wall Street, who sell the shares, for which they knew that for nothing is, this iracionalitu that Kahneman and Smith discover routinely exploited and zneužívali.
Mania that culminated in "bublinovou" economy was in large part is based on the use of investorské psychology.
This iracionalita is nothing new or for economists.
John Maynard Keynes, after all, no longer about securities markets, he wrote that are based on racionálních individuals snažících about the discovery of basic principles of markets, but that is more about competition beauty, in which the one who can best guess what says porota.
This year's Nobel Prize is like last year (which I was one of the three laureátů) celebration criticism simplistic market economy.
Loňští laureáti putting emphasis on the fact that different market participants have different (and imperfect) information and that these asymmetries of information is a profound impact on the functioning of the economy.
Loňští nositelé Nobel laureate have suggested that markets are effective widely and that they have an important role sehrávat governments.
Invisible hand the founder of political economics Adam Smith - the idea that free markets are led to efficiency as an invisible hands - is invisible at least partly because, there is nothing.
For those who every day work in markets (and earn haldy money by using and obcházejí information asymmetry of) is not that no innovation.
For more than twenty years, economists are for the so-called "patterns racionálních expectations," which they assume that all market participants have the same (if not perfect,) information and act perfectly racionálně that markets are perfectly effective that there is no unemployment (except in cases where it brings chtivé unions or government minimum wage) or credit přídělové systems.
That such models they prevailed, especially at American universities, despite the evidence of their zkreslenosti, suggests a triumph of ideology of science.
Many of these university graduates but now have Unfortunately, in charge policies and the economy in many countries of the world and build programs based on the ideas that are over time began to tell market fundamentalism.
To the right expressed: models rational expectations are major contribution to economic science; energy with which their supporters undertook economic thinking, contributing to expose weaknesses of initial hypotheses.
Good science is aware of its limits, but proroci racionálních expectations skromností usually nepřekypovali.
Vernon Smith is leading figures development experimental economics, so the idea that in laboratorním environment can be otestovat numerous economic tezí.
One reason is economics and náročnou discipline and why among economists there are so many issues is that economists cannot pursue governed experiments.
Nature while directly abound for natural experiments, but in most cases, so many things changing so quickly, that is often difficult to determine what incited what.
In principle, the point is that, in the laboratory can be conduct controlled by attempts to draw and reliable conclusions.
Critics experimental economics warned that the subjects comes into experimental situations ways of thinking that are who have been conditioned by setting outside the experiment, and that attempts to clean and are thus conclusions important as in the natural sciences.
Economic experiments, however, to participate in the nature of important processes and events and, for example, helped improve rules dražeb.
It is important that iracionalita market participants, which was subject to kahnemanova research, was in the laboratory contexts repeatedly shown.
To zábavnějším results, to which reached experimental economy, belongs to the findings of altruismu and self-interest.
It seems (at least in experimentálním environment) that Trial subjects are so sobecké how economists expected - with the exception of a single groups, and that the economists.
This is because of economics as scientific discipline more attracted individuals who are from nature sobečtější, or because it is being economics and makes them sobečtější individuals?
The truth lies will almost certainly somewhere in the middle.
The question of the relative weight of these two hypotheses will likely to other experimental research.
The award of the Nobel Prize two scientists is testimony, that it is important to study the people and the economy such, what are the, and not such as we is to have.
Let's hope that when better understanding the human behavior, we will be able to come up with such policies to be better work and economy.
The Bush nečestná energy policy
On one of the surreálnějších meeting this year's World Economic Forum in davosu vysvětlovali experts on oil industry that melting polárního ice sheets -- to which occurs faster than expected -- is not only problem, but also an opportunity for: can lead to open its massive oil deposits.
As these experts to concede that the United States a agreement to marine international law -- Convention stanovující, who has access to oil under mořským day and the right to other mineral raw materials from the sea -- represents the risk of international conflict.
At the same time, the same point to the experts, lining: oil industry may not in the never-ending search for other supplies prosit Congress for the right zplundrovat aljašku.
President George W. Bush has záhadnou ability to overlook things in the broader picture.
With over the years, is still clearly demonstrated that with its energy policy is many in trouble.
It is so strong rukopis oil industry that even Bush leaders of the previous one of the draft bill declared that "nezapomněl on no lobbistu."
Bush has been touted merits free market, but also too willingly it gives huge charity energetickému sector, although countries dealing with a sharp rise in the deficits.
In the energy market is failing, but government intervention should go precisely the opposite direction than what proposes the Bush administration.
Given the fact that Americans are not full price for air pollution -- in the form of its enormous proportion of the creation of greenhouse gases -- that is the result of their rozmařilé energy use, is the price of energy podhodnocena, further keeps excessive consumption.
What is needed to government stimulating conservation, and interventions in the price system -- through taxes on energy -- represent an effective means to achieve this.
Instead, Bush supported conservation, a policy of "first vysát America," thereby deepens future America's dependence on foreign oil.
Never mind him that drives demand high oil prices upward, which is gift from heaven for many people in the Middle East, who were among friends America.
Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it appears that the Bush finally awakened to the reality of the growing US dependency; with sharp rising oil prices are difficult to could nevšimnout consequences.
Klopýtavé steps his administration, however, in this case almost surely situation in the immediate future only will aggravate.
In the region conservation still Bush refuses to do anything and its continuing prayers to US zachránily technology subsidized very little money.
So what is to think of the Bush recently vyhlášeném commitment to cut the 25 years dependence of the United States in the Middle East oil by 75%?
For investors message is clear: neinvestujte more to the development of reserves in the Middle East, which are far from nejlevnějším source of oil in the world.
Without new investment in the development of the Middle East reserves and given bezuzdnému energy consumption growth in the US, China, and elsewhere, however, the demand předběhne supply.
And as if this was not enough, the Bush pohrůžka sanctions against Iran carries the risk of suspension of supplies from one of the world's largest producers.
At a time when the world oil production close to the maximum capacity and prices are already more than the twin compared to the level of before the war in Iraq, this věstí further hikes prices and further hikes profits oil industry -- one clear winner in the Middle East politics.
Of course, Bush cannot be upřít that the existence of a problem finally recognized.
A close look at his proposals, however, as always reveals further eskamotérský trick his administration.
Moreover, refusal to recognize the importance of the global warming, encouraging conservation and devote enough resources on research to something really means changed, Bush's grandiózní promise reduction of dependence on Middle East oil less than it seems.
From the Middle East, comes only 20% of oil used in the US, and so his goals can be achieved only a small outsourcing demand elsewhere.
Humans also napadá that the Bush administration must realize mechanisms of global trade with oil.
Even if the America was on the Middle East oil stoprocentně independent, the supply of the Middle East oil could have devastating effects on the world prices -- and thus on the American economy.
As in the Bush administration often, for there is no official strategy lichotivé explanation.
Does Bush only politics and try to pandering to antiarabskému and antiíránskému sentiment in America?
Or is it only another example of incompetence and tumult?
According to what we in the past five years saw contains the right answer is likely to be more than a small amount of nečestnosti and sheer folly.
China's Road Map
China is poised to accept their 11th pětiletku and to prepare the stage for a continuation of the probably the most remarkable economic transformation in history and also improve welfare almost three-quarters of the world's population.
The world has such a persistent growth; even has never been a so large reduction of poverty.
Part of a recipe for long-term success China is almost a unique combination of pragmatism and vision.
While much of the rest of the developing world, that is regulated by the Washington consensus was driven to donkichotskému efforts to higher GDP, China once again made it clear that it is a sustainable and fairer increased real living standards.
China recognizes that it entered the phase of economic growth, who bears environment bloated -- and unsustainable -- claims.
Barring to change course, it will eventually to the detriment of living standards.
This is why the new pětiletka places much emphasis on the environment.
Even many backward part of China grow pace that would probouzelo awed, if not the fact that other part of the country, even prudčeji.
Although the process of reduces poverty, inequality is on the rise, given the growing differences between urban and rural areas and between pobřežními regions and the mainland.
This year's report on the development of the world issued the World Bank explains why the US should not only zneklidňovat poverty, but also inequality and 11th pětiletý plan China's problem in předstihu.
The government for several years talk about harmoničtější society and just pětiletka describes ambitious programs to achieve this goal.
China also knows that what less developed countries tied from developed countries, is not only the gap in resources, but also a gap in knowledge.
Rozvrhla so bold plans not only on zúžení this gap, but also to create a base for separate innovation.
China's role in the world and in the world economy is changing, and this plan also reflects.
Its next growth will have more to rely on domestic demand than about exports, which will require an increase in consumption.
Indeed, China has nezvyklý problem: too much saving.
People set aside in part because of the shortcomings of government social insurance programs. Strengthen social jistot (pensions) and public health and education will reduce the social inequality, will among citizens of the sense of prosperity and also support the current consumption.
If these measures successful -- and China has almost always overcome and their own high expectations -- could have acquired enormous pressure on the global economic system, whose balance already disrupt the massive US fiscal and trade imbalances.
If China save less -- and if, as officials announced implement diverse policy investing reserves -- who will be financed US trade deficit in $2 billion dollars a day?
This is subject to sometimes at other times, but must not be a distant at other times.
With such clear vision of the future will challenge of its implementation.
China is a big countries and without large decentralization could succeed as it has not succeeded in.
But decentralization has its own problems.
Greenhouse gases, for example, are global problem.
While America says that cannot afford to in this things done anything, senior Chinese officials campaign zodpovědněji.
During the moon from embracing pětiletky were adopted new cars, environmental taxes on gasoline and products of timber: China to their own and global environmental problems to take advantage of market mechanisms.
Pressures on representative of the local governments, in order to ensure economic growth and jobs, but will immense.
They will find themselves bring the temptation to argue that when produce in ways that protects the planet, can neither America, how would it could afford us?
To his vision of přetavila in actions, the Chinese government will need strong political programs, as, for example, are already established environmental taxes.
As China closer market economy, there were some ailments, that beset advanced countries: interest groups that for a subtle veils of market ideology was vypočítavé arguments.
Some argue for the economy opřenou on the theory "stékání of wealth": the poor are nestarejte, growth will eventually benefit all.
Others will oppose competition policy and strict laws relative to the administration firms: whether we its miracles předvede Darwinian survival of the strongest.
Will předloženy growth arguments to kontrovat a strong social and environmental policies: higher taxes on gasoline kill our infant auto industry.
Such a supposedly prorůstové policy would not only failed to secure growth, but would threaten the vision of China's future.
There is the only way they avoid: open debate economic policy, which is intended to detect deceptive conclusions and open up space for creative solution many fundamental issues that China today faces.
George W. Bush has proved the danger of secrecy and reducing decision-making on narrow circle of patolízalů.
Most people outside of China not entirely doceňuje the extent to which its leaders, in contrast to Bush, embarked on large deliberation and broad consultation (and even with foreigners) in order to address the extraordinary problems that lies before them.
Market economies are samoregulační.
It is simply cannot be left to autopilotovi, especially if we want to their benefits widely shared.
Management of the market economy, however, is no easy task.
This is an art maintain the balance, and it must be continuously respond to economic change.
China's 11th pětiletka represents a road map such responses.
The world that follows with úžasem and hope for the lives of 1.3 billion people remain transformují.
Democratic lessons from tocquevilla
It seems to be a place that because of the Iraq War world 200 years after the birth alexise de tocquevilla debatuje about the nature of democracy.
Tocqueville rightly proslul by refused to reakční and nostalgia for our fate as a victory for democracy, but also warned of a dangers that democracy means for freedom.
We should his fears still share?
Tocqueville, democracy is not only for the political system, but especially for intellectual regime that generally shape the habits of society, making it gives sociologický and psychological dimension.
Democratic regimes, he argued Tocqueville, determine our ideas, desires, and passions.
As there were renesanční man and in the twentieth century Homo sovieticus, "one democratic" is a form of human beings.
According to tocquevilla would systemic effects of democracy could lead to a loss of citizens zdůvodněného thinking.
Could only to pretend that events and values posuzují independently; in fact, would only kopírovali gross and zjednodušené views masses.
What Tocqueville calls držením "social" power over sentiment is really in democratic regimes probably the most powerful -- his position predicts increase in the current demagogie and media manipulation.
Tocqueville was convinced that this tendency has no an effective long-term limits.
The decline of the critical thinking that, it seems, democracy is to prevent even local democracy or small companies, or government checks and balances or civil rights.
Schools have the ability to be little more than enclave protected before leptavou force social influences affecting the functioning of the mind.
Similarly, while the Tocqueville believed that efforts to virtue?? la antických nations or I to religious faith can sometimes soul povznést, both have strong into conflict with the democratic ideal, if it is in public life officially předepsáno.
In this sense among tocquevillovi schools of thought heir include neomarxističtí theorists frankfurtské schools and Hannah arendtová, who are equally feared decline in the sense of modern societies.
The French philosopher marcel gauchet even his recent book called democracy itself against itself.
Democratic way of life, they claim writers, tend to annihilate authentic thinking and curb "high" culture, so that poddává tuctovosti, in which a result of citizens susceptible to the enemies of democracy.
But, while are histories of bloody regimes opěvovaných zastrašenými and podvedenými masses, greater risk for democratic countries is that their citizens pull back into apathy and short-term thinking focusing on gratification of momentálních needs.
The past is -- despite rituálům trying to remind moments in history -- zahlazována návykem on what is now and what is new.
This okouzlení propadá and supposedly well educated ruling class.
The fundamental problem democratic sentiment is the lack of historical consciousness.
Indeed, the democracy, as Tocqueville argued, mean that the only -- realistic, but unsustainable -- way in which we can go is rezignovaný pessimism?
Think so.
There are ways to fight against what might be called the "democratic hloupostí" today.
The first defense is to promote educational system, which really being critical thinking, especially through (in today's time) zanedbávaných objects: literature, history and philosophy.
If an informed and critical civil base, already democracy requires, our schools are must stop pandering to the fashionable waves and start bystřit analytické ability to students.
The greatest obstacle such education are mass media, with their sklonem grow plytkost and fun.
Many people now spent much of life before television than in school lavicích.
Passivity, have grown mass media, is the opposite naprostým active involvement by democratic citizens need.
But it is hard to imagine that the mass media (except high-quality newspaper) from its own will become an instrument of education that improve critical faculties citizens.
Concern over the mass media is not just a elitářským opovržením popular culture.
The question is in the popularity of itself -- the end of all Mozart was in its time popular and shakespearovy of the game líbily -- the rich and poor, but in the reluctance of mass culture question and provokovat.
The result of this failure is widespread apathy and passivity its audience.
A globalized media culture, unable to how to inspire the art of critical thinking and waking up povznesené city, has long been on the rise.
It is a culture that its neglect threatened by democratic freedom, because it cannot create the sense of obligation -- to society, to history, to the community.
It is too late to do something with culture, which umrtvuje soul?
Tocqueville pohrdal elites of our time for their self-satisfaction in the face of vykořeňující weapons of mass democracy.
Short-sightedness, our leaders also serve as a force for a his zneklidňujícího prophecy?
For all of Europe
Long serving members of the European Union now, it seems, the future of the Union, but we in Ukraine on the European Union hledíme with hope and obdivem.
To join the development of the EU is the main meta our foreign policy, because Ukraine discovered that státnost is the ultimate goal, but the beginning.
European unity is indeed indivisible: if one nation ostracized, are all free.
We are inevitable networks, Europeans obepnuti oděni in a common roucha fate.
About how they all aspects of our shared culture, if not the last century vyplněné shared suffering.
Anything will shift one Europeans directly, many countries, other indirectly.
It never cannot afford to live with narrow the idea of two evrop, half of the wealthy and half of the poor, those inside and outside the.
No one who live on the European continent, cannot -- indeed -- must be regarded as foreigners in the Union.
It is on the depends today's spectacular Pax starting and today's pan-European prosperity.
Of course, some people bručí that Ukraine is Europe.
Whatever so přijedou into Kiev and promluví with people, young and old, with továrními workers, the farmers, with the lawyers, doctors and teachers, who in the winter without ustání stood for weeks in zero and Snow and vydrželi to defend their freedom.
Are perhaps svázáni with those who stood alongside General de Gaulle in French odboji?
Do not agree with those who in the 1930's, have died in battles for Spanish Republic, who in 1956 liberated budapešť and in the 1970s skoncovali with fascism in Spain and Portugal?
Nedodává them the vibrancy of the same spirit as Polish solidarity and peaceful masses that meant Prague's Velvet Revolution in 1989?
This is the real European spirit and no doubts him nerozdrtí.
Those who say that Ukraine is for EU membership too zaostalá, odpovídám: přijeďte also in my country, whether see mothers that remain in the work of the long into the night, to their children to use the computer that have in employment.
Přijeďte into language schools in every village and in any city where young people prepare for Europe and learns French, German and English.
Those who question European dispozice Ukraine should understand that Europe is a matter of technical equipment and superdálnic; it is neuhasitelnou desire for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.
I believe that our future is as nadějná, as it is past Europe vznešená, and that our fate is not be zapomenutou threshold neklidného region, but sets and budovatelem European peace and European unity.
Self-determination has not isolation, because achieve national independence currently does not mean more than a return to the world stage with new Charter.
The new countries can with its former by the occupiers create productive relations, as well as to build France and Germany -- it is a relationship based on equality and bilateral interests.
This is the relationship, about what my government seeks to with Russia, and his successful creating is what we can contribute to the enlargement of the zone of European peace.
Of course, that it is too early to do more than giving clear its great respect, with which we regard the prospect of membership in the EU.
We know that our share of the greatest building exists overnight.
We know that a great deal of the results of European unification nespočívají in documents and deklaracích, but in novátorském doing so scheduled to zlepšovalo lives and provides security of all Europeans.
Build Ukraine value of EU membership will not be easy, cheap or rapid.
But it will be created and succeeds, as the Union.
We realize that it is a huge task, but the resulting reward for the námahu stands and Europe should know that this is our goal.
Part of efforts to revive Ukraine is creative battle for an end to the děsivého century, in which the, for dominance rval fascism and communism, ideology zrozené at the heart of Europe.
A few months ago our children and their parents in cities across Ukraine faced Armed soldiers vrčícím dogs, and even death.
Only a few years ago was nájemnými murderers former regime struck and sťat young žurnalista heorhij Gongadze, who tried to the public reporting corruption regime.
Our Orange Revolution of this year's winter shows that Ukraine's people won.
So, despite today's doubt and difficulties in Europe uchovávám permanent confidence.
Refuse to accept the despair as the ultimate response to confusion about and dread Ukraine's history.
Refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically tied to the bezhvězdnou půlnocí Communist legacy that can never see dawn peace and true European unity.
When the EU citizens zamýšlejí over place Ukraine in Europe, they should, and you see in the face of who see, and also look deeper for this face.
Should see deeper than on vypleněnou pustinu inherited after communism and on poverty and social divisions, through which to overthrow former leaders to extend their devastating governance.
Instead, should we in the face of our president Viktor Yushchenko, Haiti's degraded during the last election campaign jedem, and recall the words of the French skvělého andrého malrauxe, for which "nejkrásnější faces are those that were poraněny."
Muslim Civil War
It is now a split between Sunni and Shi 'in the Middle East deeper than hostility between Israel and the Arabs?
Given the response of some Arab governments to Hezbollah's decision to attack Israel would this one might think.
Although Israeli bombs dopadaly on cities Beirut and tyre, Saudi Arabia, perhaps nejkonzervativnější Arab Muslim nation openly sentenced procedure Shi 'a Hezbollah, which supposedly launched a conflict with Israel.
Never in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict happened that the state, which is regarded as leader of Arab Muslim nations, so openly boosted Israel.
Saúdskoarabská split with Hezbollah, is one-time affair.
Also Egypt and Jordan directly doomed Hezbollah and its leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah for avanturismus.
What lies behind this stunning development?
We are witnessing fundamentálního shift in relations between the Arab nationalism and Islamic sektářstvím?
Saudi Arabia znepokojenější government is Sunni and Shiite zděšenější Islam in more than in what is oddána Arab unity, and the Palestinian cause?
Condemning Hezbollah Arabs suggests that sectarian split Muslims that there is no longer on a daily violence in Iraq, in the Middle East and deepening magnifies the.
The desire to US President George W. Bush broken zamrzlé society of the Arab world was míněna so that the modernizing forces stand against the traditional prvkům in the Arab and Islamic society.
Instead, but it seems that Bush pustil from the chain atavistic forces in the region.
Opening up the pandořiny skříňky may began with a new and more ošklivější era zevšeobecňujícího violence that may not be described as "other than Muslim civil war."
The conflict between the Shia, Sunnis, there is no longer from the dawn of Islam, but geographical isolation and ethnic nearabského Shi 'a Iran, together with the rule of the Sunni Arabs over the Shiite minorities in other countries mostly maintain this rivalry at reasonable bounds.
This tensions further declined in the flow of "Islamization" the Iranian revolution, because sectarian identity Sunni Arabs was immediately after it zatlačena further into the background and instead, vynořila a general "Islamic" asertivita.
All of this has changed in September 2001, when al-Qaeda, Sunni terrorist force that strongly is drawn from Saudi Wahhabi ideology, podnikla attacks on the United States.
On the march of the suddenly gave specificky Sunni militantního form of Islam.
When the United States triggered a war as the Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan, and the Sunni Iraqi regime has given that the new radical Sunni odnoži even greater kuráž.
Sunni Arabs in the region, who found new self-confidence restored, see Israel and the West as a mere one threat, while the second represents a so-called "Shiite půlměsíc" -- srpkovitý deal landmass spreading from Lebanon across Syria and Iraq to Iran and obývaný supposedly kacířskými Shi 'a.
Saudi rulers as opatrovníci nejsvětějších places Muslim faith in Mecca and medině feel this threat perhaps nejostřeji.
Viděno sunnitskýma eyes Shia not only control on oil rich areas of Iran, Iraq, and East Saudi Arabia, but are trying to -- through actions Hezbollah -- uzurpovat the role of "protector of" central dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cases raise.
Saudi Arabia's Kingdom has turned its back to Hezbollah because the Saudi royal family sprang its legitimacy from strict forms of Islam Sunni and Shiite doubts loajalitě their populations.
Ironically, it is the United States as a longtime protector of Saudi Arabia, which to strengthen the Shia that toppled Saddam Hussein and brought Shiite parties in Iraq to power.
It seems that the Bush administration knows what is made; while Shiite arch to the East Arab Muslim world is the rise, the US tries to enhance their protection of the Sunni oblouku -- Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia in the Western part of the region.
Israel, this druhdy nesmiřitelný enemy Arab things as would now into this defense structures zapadl.
Such defenzivní status, however, must be given panarabskému sentiment inevitably unstable.
Today are ordinary Saudis přilepeni to television obrazovkám with broadcasts station Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite network and watch events in Gaza and the southern Lebanon.
See how is prolévána Arab (not Shi 'ite) blood and armed resistance to only Hezbollah.
In their eyes, so he Hezbollah hrdinným example of resistance.
In the Saudi state, as a result, deepening schism between Sunni and Shi 'a.
After official condemnation of Hezbollah called for Saudi Arabia's Kingdom its official Wahhabi clerics to they issued a fatwu condemning Hezbollah as members of the Shi 'ite devianty and kacíře.
Such a conviction, however, can only vyostřit sectarian the schisms within Saudi Arabia and across the region.
Dospějí Sunni regimes with deepening the antagonism to believe that need their own Hezbollah, which would fought in their corner ringu?
If such conclusion do, then the need for a long time, because many such fighters has been vycvičeno -- Al Qaeda.
Georgia at the heart of Europe
The era, when Europe can rely on America with the leadership of the wars in assuring peace and creating democracy on its own zápraží, is behind us.
Given the enlargement of the European Union this zápraží, as has shown a recent crisis around of Russian gas, now includes not only Ukraine, but also Georgia.
Georgia, like Ukraine, is a test of democracy, who are Europe cannot afford to ignore.
Georgia was the first postsovětskou countries that implements its "barevnou Revolution" and the demonstrated by its, with dignity and vyspělostí that its people, he chose democracy and European values.
Flags of the European Union, which have since then třepotají on all Georgian public buildings, showing natural sympathy, as old as the history of the country that was for the ancient Greeks part and parcel of the then familiar world.
Prométheus, médeia amazonky, and in neighboring Armenia noemova ark -- the beginnings of a Europe of our myths, it is here.
For its history, culture, and traditions -- including critical, an independent, and vzdorovitého spirit within the former Soviet Union -- would seemed Georgia is an ideal candidate for democratization.
So it is the worrying that there democratization troskotá.
It seemed to start rather not look promising.
With resistance to encountered political reforms, privatization, anti-corruption measures to find new leaders neposkvrněné concessions to minulému regime or pursuit of Europe's foreign policy.
Between leaders who with claiming that represent the will of the majority, appropriate the most more and more power, but again appeared totalitarian approaches.
Georgia's political elite, like starořecké hydře, constantly dies, once again born.
These same people and methods of governance, whose potření "Rose Revolution" of November 2003 to, he arrived in ohnisku power through their personal connections that go beyond the Georgian borders, and its obrovitého wealth and jemně vycizelovaného umu political conspiracies and manipulation.
It does not much in common with the nature of democracy, which is based not only on the voting urnách, but also on the division of power.
The government intervening in matters of parliament, which in turn to intervene in decision-making government -- in my case, for example, to nomination velvyslanců and their daily working duties.
Finally, the most serious is that the judiciary is not an independent, which undermines the rule of law, and thus discourages desperately needed private investment.
Georgia's democracy no longer dominate head, but not body: people continue to policy zavrhují as immoral instead, so fields přenechávají those who have long should go into retirement.
But doufání in democracy remains highly entrenched in Georgia's people, civil society organizations, even in the media.
It is time to to Europe care about the hope that this nevyhasne.
The US has already in Georgia since independence has done for the support of political stability, what could only.
Of course, during governance eduarda Shevardnadze, former foreign minister of the Soviet Union, which we as its president expelled, stability is not always ztotožňovala with democracy.
But the Americans generous invest in the survival of democratic ideas and leaders.
Although foundations supported by finančníkem George sorosem růžovou revolution nevykonstruovala, as they Russian nationalists, not the conditions that democracy requires pečovala, stimulating is and helped them.
If, however, help consolidate Georgian democracy, the country needs now support different nature, whose to provide is better vybavena Europe.
Models balance of power, the functioning of the judiciary and local democracy must be inspire a European models that are Georgian realities closer than Anglo Saxon models American-style.
The rejection of the challenges by Europe would mean a betrayal of the all its elementárních duty in place -- a small, středozemském, flexibilním, with the old Historical traditions -- where democracy has much greater chance of success than in Ukraine, that is how the enormous and still sovětsky smýšlející of Central Asia not to mention.
Indeed, neposkytnutí support Georgian democracy that struggle with nepřízní, would most likely odročilo democratic progress in Ukraine, Belarus, and in Russia itself.
This raises the stakes clearly.
Russia, while the never nevzdalo its Imperial Dreams and tools dominance, but začínalo smiřovat with the inevitability of democracy, at least for their the margins.
Váhavé hiring some normality in relations with its neighbors, however, was always vulnerable to náhlému explosion proslulé irrational Russian "děržavy" -- aggressive ethos that glorifies the state and imposes its power vrháním of weakness.
Here is the key to the understanding of the recent Russian gas crisis.
Equally clear is that every sign depart from democracy in Georgia and other postsovětských states will only keep propel neo-imperial ambitions Russia.
It is a European responsibility persuade Russia that a return to the past is hopelessly impossible.
Europe must play its part, not only because to future to ensure the independence of energy supply, but also to have shown that the European values freedom, democracy, and justice between nations have real power.
To succeed, Europe must recall tools needed: a big poloveřejnou foundations for promoting Europe and to support the political reforms, univerzitou, where vyškolí future leaders its democracy by an army and police and judges of the Court officials who breathe life into models that we want to follow.
Above all Europe needs a belief.
If today's Europe cannot convince itself that has a vital interest in the future of their neighbors, who will come to believe in Europe?
