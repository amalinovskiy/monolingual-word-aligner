<SEG id="1"> Our rights is the only way of this Millennium. </SEG> 
<SEG id="2"> Let us, here in order to be able to welcome in good conditions the countries that are knocking at our door. </SEG> 
<SEG id="3"> In the field of public services, the basis of social, cultural and charitable must be resumed in Article 87, so that these important institutions can benefit from a lasting protection. </SEG> 
<SEG id="4"> Some are of the opinion that they can create a market in Europe without agreeing on common values and fundamental principles. </SEG> 
<SEG id="5"> I want to salute, in my turn, strong and substantial intervention of President Prodi. </SEG> 
<SEG id="6"> You know that it is a matter of a choice that was made in Amsterdam, to make a clear distinction between the two functions the high representative, in contrast to the Commission, does not express itself in complete independence, but it has the task of coordinating the political and security that are common to the Member States and we must leave room in the Intergovernmental. </SEG> 
<SEG id="7"> It has that the toll in Nice the path for the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="8"> They can in fact wish to more and better, but I think that it is a good start. </SEG> 
<SEG id="9"> I hope that the European Council of Nice will appropriate this project and the start of a project and not as that, after having obviously the reforms that are needed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="10"> However, I have also made it clear that in the current situation, we were able to achieve objectives by means of very important issues, such as, for example, a more effective action in the Balkans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="11"> It is only by linking Russia in the West and in the European Union that we will be able to have an influence on its policy and maintain contact and dialogue with it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="12"> Motion for a resolution (00 / 00) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on constitutional Affairs, on the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="13"> At the moment, it follows this and freedom of the press and the freedom of the press and the State of law that exist to torture in that country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="14"> To try to meet the expectations of this, which is called Giuseppe Italia, lives and wish to sail, I voted in favour of the Piecyk report on the development of sea ports, navigation and on the intermodal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="15"> The result of the vote of this Assembly, to achieve the objective of the directive, yet accepted and approved by all the speakers and the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="16"> Mr President, I voted in favour of the Skinner report, as I have said in the course of the debate, before the vote, because I believe that the capital is important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="17"> My Party colleague Armonie Bordes yesterday in terms that only a minority of the commitment of Community funds and contributions to the case of the risk of business. </SEG> 
<SEG id="18"> In consequence, the Charter will serve more to respect the current practices, including, national States that a success. </SEG> 
<SEG id="19"> Mr President, we have Finally a Charter of citizens' rights which a whole Article, Article 25, the people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="20"> This text can painless as a first step, since it takes for the bulk of existing rights, but if it was incorporated in the Treaty with binding force, as the European Parliament, it would, in time, to the standardization of national rights in Europe; it will give strength to the Court of justice; it would promote a centralisation around the European institutions; it would limit the margin of autonomous. </SEG> 
<SEG id="21"> So it is necessary to avoid overloading the Charter with and to leave the care of those in the right. </SEG> 
<SEG id="22"> I will go to vote for another, in part in the demonstrations in Biarritz, 13 and 14 October, and now, on 7 December 2000. </SEG> 
<SEG id="23"> Progress towards membership of the 12 candidate countries </SEG> 
<SEG id="24"> I think that a certain number of Member States have not yet grasped the existence of this link in this day and have not understood that the Intergovernmental Conference might we ask of huge difficulties in order to impose the speech in the debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="25"> We will not be able to impose, in the end, all of which I have just spoken up here that if the political world and the applicant countries and the European Union - and, in this regard as well, I agree with you, Commissioner - Finally to know that the enlargement of the European Union uses to this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="26"> It is the expression. </SEG> 
<SEG id="27"> Allow me to present the second orientation according to which the Presidency wishes to bring in the course of this year in the process of enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="28"> I therefore ask you, it is to work in this direction with the idea that we have to examine, in the perspective of 2003, which are the countries which are ready to join us at this time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="29"> I thank the rapporteur for the Committee on foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his clear and comprehensive report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="30"> The object is in any case the 'if': it is a question of the 'how' and 'when'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="31"> But they have also made for the prospect of membership of the European Union to consider the people and that it gives them a solid political and economic anchoring. </SEG> 
<SEG id="32"> A certain number of countries have so well advanced with regard to the second criterion - on the internal market - that they approach to great steps. </SEG> 
<SEG id="33"> We therefore look for more with the national governments, the European Parliament and the other institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="34"> Every year, and we shall be again - on 8 November, all the candidate countries are looking forward to the case that the Commission itself on their progress. </SEG> 
<SEG id="35"> We have with due to the principle of the country, according to which each candidate country is assessed on the basis of its own merits. </SEG> 
<SEG id="36"> This debate is an opportunity for my Group to confirm that the States of Central and Eastern Europe - but also of Cyprus and Malta - is the best guarantee of future for all of us in Europe, to the East as to the West. </SEG> 
<SEG id="37"> The most urgent task, which is, however, has not yet a lively interest on the part of the public. </SEG> 
<SEG id="38"> The people about the speech that, since the fall of the Berlin wall, still needs to intervene in five years only. </SEG> 
<SEG id="39"> The next opportunity all natural, this will be the way of 2009, but we want to make efforts to a maximum of countries can join in 2004. </SEG> 
<SEG id="40"> In addition, six other questions, we take account of the possible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="41"> In reality, it is the model of the building in which we are, I want to say the interests of all the sectors of activity which are, or some and others, which once again. </SEG> 
<SEG id="42"> The expression of this feeling of general in Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the 1980s we engage all until today. </SEG> 
<SEG id="43"> But, that things are clear: there can be no reduction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="44"> There is a strong that is also a good idea: to know that we do not only against the opinions and that the best way, indeed, do the expression of opinions and by their participation, since the elections are the expression of the democracy and the citizens in political system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="45"> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express the conditions relating to making possible the dealers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="46"> You should not forget that these people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="47"> However, I have already that all the countries approached relatively quickly to this point. </SEG> 
<SEG id="48"> This means that one has already suffer the liberalization of trade in the area of agricultural products without their the collapse of their agriculture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="49"> Tensions are produced, but on the whole, the peace and to commercial exchanges between the citizens of relations, which are still affected by the monetary Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="50"> This must be the results that count. </SEG> 
<SEG id="51"> The only amendment which has been at the moment is already covered by this report, but I am delighted that the Group of the Greens want to underline the necessity of an equal treatment of all the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="52"> It does not involve only a law in the area of public service but also open remuneration for the young officials. </SEG> 
<SEG id="53"> That applies just as much to the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="54"> The unification of the euro is seen during the second half of 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="55"> Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am rapporteur, is the biggest and most important but, as we know, the most problematic countries who are preparing to join the Union to tell the truth, it does so problems that they intend to raise its voice asking themselves: the first Group, one of the countries which will join the first. </SEG> 
<SEG id="56"> We have too many promises have not been in Poland, to the countries of Eastern Europe, the former Communist countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="57"> Remains a point which, when it is a question of the Czech Republic, and that is the problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="58"> Slovakia is not to remain in the second Group and it is logical that it wants to join the Union at the same time that the Czech Republic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="59"> I would Finally allow me a final point regarding the policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="60"> Thirdly, and with regard to agriculture, the level of remains one of the European Union, it is necessary to open the structures of the State, to the modernisation of farms and structures, as well as to the improvement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="61"> The Union is to join the European Union and NATO. </SEG> 
<SEG id="62"> The issue - a problem which affects the Romanian since 1990, they note last signs of progress under the current government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="63"> I hope that the new Parliament that in terms of the new government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="64"> But we also underline that the solution, just and lasting must fully respect once the relevant resolutions of the security Council of the United Nations, which is nothing other than the international law in force, and the principles of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="65"> Malta has in addition to industry and functional. </SEG> 
<SEG id="66"> Mr President, Mr Commissioner, dear colleagues, on behalf of the Committee on economic and monetary Affairs, we want to make our contribution to this debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="67"> Yet it is necessary to apply the Community law is in fact not only a collection of laws: it must also be a law in the applicant States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="68"> This poses to the citizens of the candidate countries, but also, at the same time, their future and that of their children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="69"> I agree with the previous speaker has: it is necessary to give attention to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="70"> In this respect, the Commission must be for! </SEG> 
<SEG id="71"> The applicant States to be put on the process of growth, even if it has to be done to the detriment of the policy of protection of nature defined. </SEG> 
<SEG id="72"> On the one hand, on the other, we maintained bad habits, most of the questions raised. </SEG> 
<SEG id="73"> (ES) Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and United European continent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="74"> The European Parliament and its Committee on regional policy, equally competent in the matter of transport and networks, are aware that it is necessary to coordinate the different sectoral Community policies in favour of a global policy planning. </SEG> 
<SEG id="75"> I stress yet again on the fact that the transport infrastructure is of the utmost importance for the success of the enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="76"> Mr President, I associate myself with you, when you that the forthcoming enlargement is the main task of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="77"> The traditional social former of Central and Eastern Europe have been hard. </SEG> 
<SEG id="78"> The PPE Group do not wish to unload the applicant countries of the rhythm of the process: we cannot just any date. </SEG> 
<SEG id="79"> The second point is the dates. </SEG> 
<SEG id="80"> There is another reason. </SEG> 
<SEG id="81"> Thirdly: the approval of the enlargement and its positive prospects for the different countries and for the EU as a whole and - the example of Denmark is for us to the point - matters of the social and economic policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="82"> It is the us that the popular when she herself in a way which does not suit them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="83"> Ladies and gentlemen, it is now time to pause and the debate will resume at 9 p.m. </SEG> 
<SEG id="84"> We have, even if it takes longer term, a currency for the whole continent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="85"> These cause internal battles in each of the countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="86"> We call them to fight for a different Europe, that of all the people, of all these inhuman, where the people will be to their fate, between the relations of peace, freedom,, mutually beneficial. </SEG> 
<SEG id="87"> I am publicly the praise of their work and, in particular, the work performed by challenge, which is situated in Birmingham, so that the work of other organisations Irish supported by a certain number of people whose economy o'donnel, the Irish artist, who has promised 1 million pounds than it has in Ireland and other parts of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="88"> The Summit must especially to establish clearly whether and how the EU can, from its side, to be ready in time for this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="89"> The only if they still when they will have, or whether they will become a country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="90"> I am convinced that with the good will and with the help of the European Union, will be found a solution which will allow the two communities to live in harmony and to prosper, as they have done for. </SEG> 
<SEG id="91"> We are also concerned about the problem of for the issue of the integration of these minorities, including their linguistic, is also important in these countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="92"> The condition for membership of the Union is to meet the criteria of Copenhagen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="93"> The benefits of enlargement have been and it is one of the topics on which the Lithuania can we learn something. </SEG> 
<SEG id="94"> Imagine that they are all like this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="95"> Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I also wish to congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs, but I wish especially to Slovakia, and more especially in the policy towards minorities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="96"> I ask you, therefore, at the next Summit to fix a date to which you plan to the negotiations with the candidate countries, the more progress on the road to EU membership, without naming names. </SEG> 
<SEG id="97"> The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its efforts to join the Union and, of course, ensure that the planning of this aid is even more. </SEG> 
<SEG id="98"> The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of society, the government and the Parliament in this respect plays an important role and - as we know - positive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="99"> We are in the process of completing the division of Europe into two blocks and not to create a new division. </SEG> 
<SEG id="100"> All of these elements contained in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, on behalf of our Group. </SEG> 
<SEG id="101"> In this sense, I believe that the Cyprus question is, by excellence, one on which will be the ability of Europe to see his policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="102"> I live in the Baltic sea, a sea which poses a problem for us all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="103"> The political vision remains. </SEG> 
<SEG id="104"> Thus, it was to hear that Mr Hänsch, who, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that the Commission an evaluation of the enlargement, so that in cases where would not take place. </SEG> 
<SEG id="105"> However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, according to which the fixing of transition is essential in the interests of both parties in addition, so that a region and - as Mrs Schierhuber on a farm in the problem, I consider that the creation of areas can be masters of trisÃ without the big problems and bring positive results on both sides. </SEG> 
<SEG id="106"> As a Democrat, I would like to emphasise three points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="107"> That includes the files of the first pillar gives a hand to the applicant countries and in the city and the scientists the right to participate in exchange programmes, but on the other hand, does not yet obliges the EU to extend its system of aid to agriculture in these countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="108"> Secondly, it is necessary to say "no" to the concept to accept at the same time an important Group of countries, because this would be in contradiction with the principle of the admission of each country according to its merits. </SEG> 
<SEG id="109"> Thirdly, we must all do, of the European Union, to prepare the European Union process in the direction of the speech by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi. </SEG> 
<SEG id="110"> In this respect, I should like to refer to the report that exists between Parliament and the Council in highlighting the fact that there has been enormous delays with regard to the questions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="111"> It is disturbing to see that such incidents occur in a country which is going to enter into the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="112"> I therefore ask that the question is to the Committee on legal Affairs so that it can prepare all of this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="113"> Mr President, we are going to discuss today, and perhaps to vote on three reports which this subject, which are two of my responsibility. </SEG> 
<SEG id="114"> All the players in the food production should in fact. </SEG> 
<SEG id="115"> The resolution will cost money to all those involved in the production chain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="116"> We must therefore follow Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and to adopt the principle of the animal feed and the consumers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="117"> The 1999 directive has well and it can be a success for the taxes could be in a sensible way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="118"> However, in purely and simply the time is not a solution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="119"> Very quickly, we must insist on the amendment concerning the dioxin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="120"> On this point we are in agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="121"> So, in that we, the European consumers, we are going to continue to buy on the leaders of the meat and milk and these products from an animal feed which has no link with the minimum and maximum limits set by the European Union and by a system of production of food for animals that matters on the international markets, any principle, and, before introducing their products on the territory of the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="122"> We must be able to have, for the second reading, the opinion of the Commission on the way to proceed to the assessment of risk. </SEG> 
<SEG id="123"> On the other hand, it would, for example, to adopt amendments Nos 39 and 40, because it would remove the possibility, for the Member States, to intervene promptly against the dangers that they come to disclose. </SEG> 
<SEG id="124"> The protection of consumers starts from the declaration of feedingstuffs for animals, and, Finally, the officials. </SEG> 
<SEG id="125"> Mr President, dear colleagues, the report by our colleague Mrs Paulsen relating to products in the feeding of animals is an important topic and, as all the important, it is highly controversial. </SEG> 
<SEG id="126"> Mr President, the discussion on the subject of this excellent report by Mrs Paulsen has, on certain points, on the plan, and now that this debate is closed, I think that we must start from the principle that the requirements in the area of animal nutrition are certainly companies, but we shall then see to it that the initiatives by the emotional. </SEG> 
<SEG id="127"> Individually and jointly, these three proposals aim to fill the gaps that have been put in by the dioxin crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="128"> Amendment no 33 abolishes the possibility of not towards the country of origin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="129"> Nor can I accept amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44 which aim to restore the possibility for, under certain conditions, intend to the manufacture of feedingstuffs for animals that are affected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="130"> These should be enough, taking into account the commitment that we have taken to establish, within the framework of the new proposal relating to food, a rapid alert system covering the whole of the products and foodstuffs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="131"> Commissioner Byrne, this directive on the marketing of food for animals, lies, in substance, a problem that we have for a long time, namely the question of the open declaration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="132"> And for that reason alone, I have learned something. </SEG> 
<SEG id="133"> Because if we put; this measure, and if we started the procedure, that would certainly be a gain and I am convinced that, in the face of the Council, we are strong and United. </SEG> 
<SEG id="134"> Mr President, dear colleagues, it may be that, in the future, can also enter into the composition of feedingstuffs for animals - in any case, it is not to exclude. </SEG> 
<SEG id="135"> The BSE scandal is the worst of the worst. </SEG> 
<SEG id="136"> The good sense - our rapporteur said - it is of course of having an open, which gives the list. </SEG> 
<SEG id="137"> I think that, as well as the case of the Members of the Committee on agriculture and rural development are no doubt in of food and feed for animals, in view of a solution to the practical and practice which should be applied and understood by the farmers and consumers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="138"> This is the positive points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="139"> It is, in my opinion, a right to the information that it fails to meet. </SEG> 
<SEG id="140"> Madam President, I ask you, on behalf of my colleagues of the Commission and on my own behalf, to send a message from Parliament to the families of the victims and the local authorities of both of city of Galicia, where they are in the majority of victims. </SEG> 
<SEG id="141"> (Parliament adopted the resolution) </SEG> 
<SEG id="142"> Are there any colleagues who oppose this oral amendment? </SEG> 
<SEG id="143"> It is good that the rapporteur has explained things. </SEG> 
<SEG id="144"> The majority of its technical proposals, for example on food safety, for example on the food, the nuclear power stations of the first generation, the protection of the environment, the fight against social dumping, the code of conduct for companies from the West when they work in the East, etc., and that it is also absolutely priority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="145"> At the same time, overcome, notably on the plan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="146"> The thirteen countries changes not only part of the Balkans, of the European Union, but it also structure since, at the time of the total population will increase (+ 28%), but also the number of "against". </SEG> 
<SEG id="147"> In this respect, it is necessary to take account of the fact that in the candidate countries, an area of agricultural and food success of importance for the success of the process of transformation and restructuring, in view of its weight in economic and social security. </SEG> 
<SEG id="148"> In this regard, I would like to see the results, which 6 on 7 are always among the poorest 10 of the EU, the structural funds, not only on the criterion of GDP, but also on indicators, and especially social. </SEG> 
<SEG id="149"> Because we, in the interest of the French, we cannot, in all conscience, approve his speech in the country and the people of the East, scarcely of the Communist dictatorship and which can again in any technocratic and totalitarian they want to go. </SEG> 
<SEG id="150"> We should be all the more to a short but intense in this regard the reports relating to the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="151"> The current system, quotas and quotas, must be replaced by the trade and adaptation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="152"> The importance and the problems that provokes are not compatible with the double language in which the concerns within the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="153"> For me, speaking of enlargement does not mean membership or not of some countries in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="154"> Our neighbour during the year to meet the criteria for membership. </SEG> 
<SEG id="155"> Latvia has its place in this House, not only because, overall, its progress gives him the right to this "said of us" essential to take such a, but above all, and above all, because it is at home in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="156"> I believe that, amongst the countries that have their, Poland is the State which deserves our support, our commitment, since, without the very important initiatives of Poland, the fall of Communism would not have taken place, and we are not here today to speak about this problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="157"> It is not too can be apparent to the Polish population which remains broadly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="158"> I urge that to seize this motion, this invitation, this request of dialogue, to give further and to make sure that, together with this Assembly, these relics of a nationalist might be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="159"> (it) I am very pleased about the Wiersma report on the request of Slovakia to the European Union and I share most of the conclusions of the rapporteur. </SEG> 
<SEG id="160"> On this occasion, I have the great pleasure of addressing a good people and the Bulgarian Republic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="161"> I do not see any reason for that Romania is not accepted in the European Union, if it continues to advance at the time that the Union will have to make its institutional structure and its policies to face up to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="162"> What is the resolution concerning the settlers, and God knows whether the problem, as one of the restitution of both sides, what the report says is too hard for a reserve. </SEG> 
<SEG id="163"> Unfortunately, some of the comments of the draft report on the request for membership of Cyprus to the European Union, established by the Committee on foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy, are not a great help in this respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="164"> This task will not be easy, given the lack of good will on the part of the Turkish Cypriot and Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="165"> Stenzel report (A5-0243 / 2000) </SEG> 
<SEG id="166"> Unfortunately, I was the victim of a food, even if it was, in the European Parliament, alas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="167"> For all of these reasons, I voted in favour of the prohibition of the time which is proposed by the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="168"> We must, in this resolution, with the countries of the democracy that the pressure on the military in order to restore democracy in the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="169"> We have shown in our approach and our way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="170"> This is not the time to show. </SEG> 
<SEG id="171"> I would like to mention a couple of important points of the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="172"> The equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="173"> This is why we need a legislation against discrimination. </SEG> 
<SEG id="174"> We are thus now with a large number of technical amendments aiming to ensure a degree of protection against discrimination based on race, on the one hand and the discrimination based on age, disability, age and sexual orientation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="175"> It was necessary to make an effort, of moderation and good legal practice and his report - in my opinion - all these qualities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="176"> In addition, they are of the opinion that the case of discrimination are not enough to justify a directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="177"> The programme of action in the examination does not enough resources to replace the work of the fifth framework programme, which, I hope, will be guaranteed in the other programmes - and we must therefore see their. </SEG> 
<SEG id="178"> Everyone agrees to say that it is necessary to fight against discrimination, but the differing opinions when it comes to know how, to what extent and with what means. </SEG> 
<SEG id="179"> I have had the opportunity, in Committee, I object to the fact that the experts can be to say something to say. </SEG> 
<SEG id="180"> We are also satisfied with the provision of the directive that equality of treatment for persons also means that the companies are perform found on the place of work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="181"> It is only in this way that we fight effectively against discrimination in all areas of life in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="182"> After all, as we teach the big, racism and discrimination fight, and not by the restrictions and the progressive, opinion, expression and association. </SEG> 
<SEG id="183"> Thus, we have a proposal that the rank of marriage. </SEG> 
<SEG id="184"> We thus the positions of the European Union on the positions by its nationals in keeping with the discrimination and equal treatment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="185"> I also come back on the question of the religious. </SEG> 
<SEG id="186"> My attention has been on the potential of the report with Article 1, which once again may seem a little obscure, if this is that it makes the distinction between the sexual orientation and behaviour. </SEG> 
<SEG id="187"> What the citizens themselves. </SEG> 
<SEG id="188"> In one gives a on a basis of the skin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="189"> These guidelines of the directive, by the fact that, recently, has been adopted the directive 2000, demonstrate the political will of the European Union to guarantee an open, from and, especially, the racism which has deep roots in history. </SEG> 
<SEG id="190"> Those who come to say here that Europe must not adopt directive and the values that we all want a mistake. </SEG> 
<SEG id="191"> Do not touch harshly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="192"> Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the media must also play an important role in this task. </SEG> 
<SEG id="193"> Experience has shown that the promotion of measures to fight against discrimination is essential, but it is not enough. </SEG> 
<SEG id="194"> We must avoid the confusion, which will be to reduce Europe to a politically correct, certainly, but first. </SEG> 
<SEG id="195"> I find that this Parliament has too often, the European Commission, that the Commission had intended to propose. </SEG> 
<SEG id="196"> I should like to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and turn, for their remarkable texts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="197"> I also accept the amendments that you have to emphasise the importance of the prevention of, and fight against these. </SEG> 
<SEG id="198"> The second aims to clarify the text of the proposal of the Commission and the third is in a number of important amendments whose purpose is to try to put this proposal into line with the directive relating to discrimination based on race adopted last June. </SEG> 
<SEG id="199"> In particular, the amendments 9, 10 and 20 are proposing to remove the reference to the discrimination based on race and ethnic origin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="200"> I cannot accept that you made, in amendments Nos 21 and 45, the physical and moral so that the groups no peace, because this proposal in the matter of employment applies only to individuals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="201"> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. </SEG> 
<SEG id="202"> You cannot expect support from the public to the operations of maintaining peace if your troops are threatened by weapons that we have provided. </SEG> 
<SEG id="203"> So, in my country, it would be a licence to have a responsibility, but not for me as established in the back of my garden. </SEG> 
<SEG id="204"> Another important point: the export ban, promote and market and knowledge to the practice of torture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="205"> Having said that, I would of course like to congratulate the rapporteur, my colleague, Mr Titley, for his excellent report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="206"> We must extend our considerations, on the one hand, the issues of pressure, but also the means other than those intended for military use, disarmament, to the conversion, strengthening of the action and the police and, on the other hand, the applicant countries that Mr Wiersma has just mentioned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="207"> The role of the European financial system makes it still more difficult one in arms trade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="208"> The report aims to identify such improvements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="209"> The European Union considers nowadays to lead the project of its expiry date, which will take place in November of this year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="210"> A and indicators have been and will be presented to the next Council 'research'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="211"> I thank you, Mr Commissioner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="212"> With regard to the problems of the SMEs, we have, of course, after that, in the framework programme, the SMEs have their part, as envisaged in the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="213"> This, at least, is what emerges from the discussion of the budget in this and it is necessary to point out that those who put forward the points of view of the European Union are numerous is true? </SEG> 
<SEG id="214"> In this regard, I share your feeling. </SEG> 
<SEG id="215"> The first is the participation of the EU in the national programmes, that it has in his statement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="216"> They cannot therefore speak of space research, if we are not, we only 5% of this research. </SEG> 
<SEG id="217"> Thank you, Mr Busquin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="218"> On the one hand, in the wake of the effort to commit the appropriations at the end of 1999, the requests in authority at the beginning of this year for the financing of new projects. </SEG> 
<SEG id="219"> But I repeat that things were well made by Portugal, for example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="220"> Question 2 (H-0730 / 00): </SEG> 
<SEG id="221"> Finally, because the excise duties on mineral oils level not a failure of Community competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="222"> Secondly, as Mr MacCormick knows, while the Member States do an industrial sector by means of fiscal measures, it is in breach of the regulations on the State, in this case the fiscal State subsidies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="223"> The nuclear energy, for example, is a clear example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="224"> Subject: budget line budgetary heading the appropriations of the European Union in favour of minority languages which exist since 1983, have ceased to be increased up to 1995, and in the course of which they were the 4 million euros). </SEG> 
<SEG id="225"> Mr President, our colleagues from Parliament means that important means are affected, in the structural funds - and this is new -, cultural activities, because that with my colleague, Michel Barnier, we have put the importance of the fact that the structural funds invest not only in the roads or but also in humans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="226"> The Commission will therefore not new financial commitments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="227"> With regard to the concrete proposals of financing, it is not possible to take position here, because we must respect the normal procedure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="228"> I spoke about several. </SEG> 
<SEG id="229"> It is therefore something to be done in the matter, because it is a matter of millions of small and medium-sized businesses in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="230"> His Committee for the requirements in the field of responsibility, for example to the, as well as the treatment of the personal consumption? </SEG> 
<SEG id="231"> If they were to apply this meat that one oneself, it would be for the hunters of a bureaucratic disaster. </SEG> 
<SEG id="232"> I intend, at the conclusion of this report, the proposals to improve the transport of animals and to tackle the problem of time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="233"> We have already discussed this issue at my meeting with the Group of the Greens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="234"> Our question was clear: what are the measures taken by the Commission? </SEG> 
<SEG id="235"> The products also makes the producers to inform consumers of the risks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="236"> The case of Maryam ayubi is worrying. </SEG> 
<SEG id="237"> Question 14 (H-0745 / 00): </SEG> 
<SEG id="238"> The attitude of the EU of this meeting Vientiane, and even the question of its or the level at which the EU should be represented, of the evolution of the situation in Burma. </SEG> 
<SEG id="239"> A final point. </SEG> 
<SEG id="240"> The constitute an important step in the participation in the management of their own. </SEG> 
<SEG id="241"> I can even tell you that the sequence of these was more democratic, more than some of our countries to which I am, either as a participant, either as observer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="242"> But we considered that it was a goal and in any case the culmination of the process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="243"> It calls for a more effective control of the arms trade and for greater transparency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="244"> I see now that the number of contracts carrying on armaments and their components does not increase every year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="245"> We cannot take on the basis of information, of. </SEG> 
<SEG id="246"> The arrangement that has in supporting together within the DG should be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="247"> If these institutions must have the possibility to appoint an internal auditor, it is enough to impose minimum requirements in the matter of financial. </SEG> 
<SEG id="248"> The Commissioner is aware, this proposal does not unanimity within this Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="249"> We therefore have nothing to object to an internal audit service, to which we give the Green light through the report of our colleague, Mr van Hulten. </SEG> 
<SEG id="250"> Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I would like to start by expressing my congratulations to the rapporteur. </SEG> 
<SEG id="251"> We are of the opinion that the modernisation of the administration is necessary and urgent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="252"> A check is essential to avoid the mistakes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="253"> The money must be a better and more efficient in the future, of course, they must be better able to ensure that the funds are indeed aims to which they have been affected by the competent in the matter of the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="254"> Regarding the amendments, I would like to make the following comment: the Commission agrees with this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="255"> I therefore thank you for your suggestions and your deliberations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="256"> I would like to sum up the proposals of this report which seem to me to be the most important and most, the creation of a Group of experts, which was raised by the Member States, which must contribute to define minimal protection of minors in the media; Secondly, the creation of a code of it by all the sector; Thirdly, the possibility of encouraging and to make available the devices of filtering both by the television that via the Internet. </SEG> 
<SEG id="257"> Unfortunately, I cannot endorse the requirements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="258"> This raises in most of the Member States and must not, however, what is not allowed for the search for consensus regarding certain values by way of dialogue with all the parties concerned at European level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="259"> It is Nevertheless true that, in my view, it falls to them to see to it that their children do not look at what kind of programmes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="260"> Parents need that they bring them assistance in this field, which must include: for the protection of minors in the field of application which are in the area of the European Union as a whole, the setting up and put at an accessible price of legal provisions relating to the protection of minors and the commitment of the media, that is to say of the broadcasting and the manufacturers of programmes, be they public or private. </SEG> 
<SEG id="261"> Then when I hear, during the debate in Committee, some people say that there is no evidence of the influence that can have the violence in all its forms,, on children, I am surprised and I an. </SEG> 
<SEG id="262"> With regard to the introduction of a code, it is, in particular, notably on the technical level, that in certain Member States have already introduced codes for the television, which must allow them to cut the current. </SEG> 
<SEG id="263"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="264"> In particular, my report - the international valid in the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="265"> This would be for us to agree this space of freedom, which is a fundamental right of every citizen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="266"> Some payments due in 1996, Mr President, have still not been made. </SEG> 
<SEG id="267"> Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want first of all to thank Mr Evans and Mantovani for their work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="268"> I commend this report to the Assembly so that the amendments by Mr Evans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="269"> Our human resources, our sole future in a world where there is more valuable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="270"> It is not with the Green papers, black or White, that one of the problems, but with actions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="271"> But the European Parliament, and it is in its role, the European Parliament has a pressure so that the researchers are nonetheless included in the text. </SEG> 
<SEG id="272"> Today, you visit us at a crucial moment for the future of European construction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="273"> But we know that the process is and that this threatens its vitality. </SEG> 
<SEG id="274"> The debate, in which each country with its own, its traditions, its culture, is the instrument which allows them, to define them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="275"> Long live the European Union!! </SEG> 
<SEG id="276"> It is necessary to see to it that the use of jobs, all that in the same as in the more traditional areas: less skilled jobs, part-time sometimes not chosen, contracts and access to jobs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="277"> The Council will discuss a proposal of indicators to measure the progress in the matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="278"> Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar of the approach of the approach adopted by the gender mainstreaming and guidelines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="279"> I think more violence suffered by them, a priority of my government action, and I know that you also mobilizes all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="280"> We know that the measures of reconciliation of working life and family life, in particular women, although it is still needed on the current situation of the family and the role that women plays, which is no longer the traditional so that society has strongly, just as the family structure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="281"> Some people, including that of this Parliament, sometimes seem convinced that the opposite is true, but it is a mistake. </SEG> 
<SEG id="282"> I would like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that to the House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="283"> I find this embarrassing position and ambiguous, and it deserves, it seems to me, for the plans that you are proposing to us, because it is not of course that we led the practice across all of this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="284"> In this area, it is not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="285"> The image of women, the one that they discover in the course of our report, directives, framework which with these women suggest that their to the euro. </SEG> 
<SEG id="286"> I find particularly significant that the report is the introduction of a balance between men and women in all areas of society, on the labour market, for example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="287"> It is precisely for this reason that the report has a major concealing the marriage and the family. </SEG> 
<SEG id="288"> This is something which the Committee on women's rights and equal opportunities should also bear in mind! </SEG> 
<SEG id="289"> We have heard that the first and then the inequality of opportunity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="290"> The salaries of women continue, on average 28%, compared to those of men, which contributes to the fact that women represent the majority of the poor population and which makes it difficult their participation in social and political life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="291"> It is a quite remarkable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="292"> We are in a women everywhere in Europe, in France too, where 15% of them live when even with less francs per month. </SEG> 
<SEG id="293"> All the countries did not follow this example, I hope that the example of France will be followed by other countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="294"> The history of women is obviously very long. </SEG> 
<SEG id="295"> It really is necessary to help the countries to put itself at the level of the acquis communautaire. </SEG> 
<SEG id="296"> But, on this point, I would like your support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="297"> This is not the case, even if it is a matter of a text in at the time, the Committee on legal Affairs and the internal market has chosen, after a long debate, not to present amendments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="298"> The Committee on legal Affairs, after a long debate, considered that it was not reasonable that I lasts six years and that three years, the delay, was a delay of more than proper so that it is possible to conclude, with the means and, if it has been or in a statement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="299"> It is a matter of amendment no 15 relating to fraud. </SEG> 
<SEG id="300"> The objective, namely to achieve a communication but quality, so that a sufficient base regulation by improving the process of recovery and in adapting the provisions in the matter of the customs, one of the many demands of the single market, and this objective is achieved here since the number of countries, are able to participate quickly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="301"> She would like to thank Parliament and especially the Commission, by Mrs Palacio for the efforts and the consent - by Parliament and the Commission - in the framework of this file. </SEG> 
<SEG id="302"> Welcome </SEG> 
<SEG id="303"> I wish that this does not alter the direction of the vote which will be expressed, but it is really the whole of the French version. </SEG> 
<SEG id="304"> Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="305"> It is accepted that the knowledge of languages is a reference to the mobility. </SEG> 
<SEG id="306"> We also consider that the Member States should be able to decide themselves, to a large extent, of indirect taxes that they wish to remove. </SEG> 
<SEG id="307"> I have a little that we have no chance of obtaining a majority in relation to formulate a prescription for the conservation of documents. </SEG> 
<SEG id="308"> . the time of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we were delighted with the inclusion of Article 13 relating to discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or beliefs philosophical divisions, disability, age and sexual orientation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="309"> My final point concerns the budget of this project, that is to say, and that is of course inadequate in view of the actions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="310"> It also explicitly the motives of the amendment that the directive provides to intervene in the area of regulations relating to age in the Member States, which are, however, completely for reasons of psychology and have no impact on the professional life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="311"> I also hope that we could go to everything that has been written in the new Article 12). </SEG> 
<SEG id="312"> With regard to the age of the personal convictions, of the principle of protection in this area. </SEG> 
<SEG id="313"> The estimate, on the whole, I welcome the proposal for a directive on the introduction of frameworks concerning the non-discrimination in the professional life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="314"> This is, however, that the occupation of an internal auditing service and not of the importance and, Consequently, of the usefulness of such a service. </SEG> 
<SEG id="315"> The EU has already suffer from reaching the objectives in order to achieve the objectives of the appropriations (fight against the search for solutions to crises and conflicts outside the territory of the EU), but it has no common policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="316"> (NL) without weapons, the world would be a much more. </SEG> 
<SEG id="317"> The resolution does not want the sale of arms to promote a policy, but only in order to ensure more the profits of industrial groups. </SEG> 
<SEG id="318"> The communication of the Commission acknowledges the problem but does not offer any concrete measures, because it is in the logic of the market and of competition, and the proposals that it can do that at the bottom of a cruel - in particular for children, one of the UN and of the multinationals, which, in their responsibility to the impacts of their programmes and their products and their employment and the whole responsibility to them, by inviting even to use of new products for their children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="319"> The example of the rapporteur, I believe that the measures aimed at protecting young people against the more violent and harmful should not be limited to the traditional, but to apply to the whole of the media. </SEG> 
<SEG id="320"> With an average of three hours a day, it is the most important human sleep and, for adults, the work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="321"> Moreover, women are often post 'flexible'; the temporary contracts or the low wages are typical of areas dealing with predominantly women. </SEG> 
<SEG id="322"> To be the first victims of the public, of adjustment in the area of health - for the right of access to care and treatment, without the right to programmes of prevention and information. </SEG> 
<SEG id="323"> B5-0792 / 2000, by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Group of the European United left / Nordic Green left, on the situation of crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="324"> Mr President, I would have wished that a debate on Latin America is not solely in terms of one or the other problem, but rather in the framework of a well prepared and in the committees. </SEG> 
<SEG id="325"> We must make sure that it has the objective that it is with countries that are at the level of the challenge and which are able to grant the view of the people, namely a renewal policy and a substantial. </SEG> 
<SEG id="326"> The joint debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="327"> However, we know that Afghanistan is not further, that Afghanistan is the biggest producer, and so we know and we can imagine the role that these mafias policies, not only political elsewhere, play in the expansion of the drugs trade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="328"> It asks the Commission to make the point of humanitarian aid programmes in the direction of the Afghan people, so that no one is on the territory. </SEG> 
<SEG id="329"> The suffering in this conflict are terrible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="330"> A budget line, programmes and of many years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="331"> Allow me to reply to Mrs Paciotti, in saying that I am, of course, ask the Commission today to know what has happened and what should happen means. </SEG> 
<SEG id="332"> (B5-0794 / 2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Linkohr, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, from a Spanish in the negotiations with the; </SEG> 
<SEG id="333"> We would all do not have to discuss the Colombia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="334"> The Commission has already proposed to coordinate the measures for such a package, and the Commission envisages in the next few days of means to this end. </SEG> 
<SEG id="335"> Therefore, once again, two weights, two measures, and I believe that it is necessary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="336"> This attitude on the part of the Albanian opposition to reject a resolution for an Albanian problem is in my opinion quite incomprehensible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="337"> I think that the an extraordinary performance in managing them the questions of order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="338"> This is why I also think that this reconciliation can hold. however, the government, which has very courageously found a solution to the question and to many other problems, need visible signs of success so that a strong support to the peace in the whole of the region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="339"> The PHARE funds put to provision for the year 2000 in the framework of national programme can also be used to support at the time of the next year 2001-2002. </SEG> 
<SEG id="340"> I would like to point out that we all today, Greek, we have reacted in the face of this situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="341"> And all of this, which concerns Greece, which deals with the first rank in the European Union for the area of the merchant navy, is in fact the shipping in all its aspects in the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="342"> In the course of the years, many other people have led to, not only to the continuation of ferry shipwrecks, but, well too, within our Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="343"> On the contrary, the innocent victims are used to promote the objectives and shipowners. </SEG> 
<SEG id="344"> We must realise that it is also a question of the credibility of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="345"> To conclude, I would like to stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the question of the legislation in the field of security and intended for the transport of passengers must be given the highest priority in the European Union and that what matters, it is to ensure that these provisions are applied in the whole of the Community of a strict and uniform. </SEG> 
<SEG id="346"> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to be a bit late for reasons that you know well, in order to make a brief statement on the two subjects which are in the order of the day: the situation in Belgrade and in the Republic of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="347"> Commissioner Verheugen is going to express, as did Mr Solana, on the two themes which we unite, that is to say, the Middle East and in Yugoslavia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="348"> We must be ready to take this promise, that the will of the people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="349"> Madam President, Mr high representative, Commissioner, it is with reservations that I take part in this debate, because I do not wish that our Parliament with only as a judge allowed on this or that, at the moment, the hopes of so much here, a month ago, we are faced with the consequences of the events of this new outburst of violence in the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="350"> Madam President, my intervention today is based not only on various analyses of the situation, but also on that I have personally last week, since I was in passing and in the Gaza Strip when the disturbances. </SEG> 
<SEG id="351"> Even if one is opposed to any violence, it is not possible to put on the violence and the Palestinian violence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="352"> I would ask Parliament, at this critical moment, to make a declaration of support for the people and who have, today, in the streets of Belgrade, so the support that we have, we, indeed, it was not so long ago, to those who also fought for their freedom in other cities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="353"> The Europeans, Madam President, would without doubt seize the bullet which was launched here by the President of the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="354"> The Statute is a point in the negotiations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="355"> For years, thanks to his brutal propaganda and the pressure on which it has on the media, it succeeded in making the inhabitants of his country, but alas also a large number of people in the West, in their a false picture of the reality. </SEG> 
<SEG id="356"> While this drama activity at its end, this Parliament has the duty, as a symbol of a free and United Europe, to support the force to the Yugoslavian Parliament and to help Mr fill his mandate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="357"> It is precisely this process as the cornerstone that makes us fear the worst - and the words that I have some hours. </SEG> 
<SEG id="358"> I wonder if the Commissioner, for the steps which they show that we consider and as the representative of the Serbian people and as the partner with which the European Union will have to deal with. </SEG> 
<SEG id="359"> The European Parliament wants to express its solidarity in this historic moment where the dictatorship is doing and democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="360"> The next item is the report (A5-0237 / 2000) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending decision 2000 / 24 / EC in order to spread the guarantee granted by the Community to the European investment Bank to make in favour of projects in Croatia (COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000 / 0122 (CNS)). </SEG> 
<SEG id="361"> We must welcome the new political way that was opened in this country after the presidential elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="362"> Between the European Union and Croatia, there exists a Group of working which aims to put at the disposal of the or its Member States and its technical assistance in the agreements of the mutual reports. </SEG> 
<SEG id="363"> Let us not forget that Croatia is represented the failure of a programme of State whose only someone profit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="364"> The contribution which we discuss, in the form of a loan of EUR 250 million of the EIB for the can then be a milestone, but must be a help stimulating. </SEG> 
<SEG id="365"> It is therefore quite right to speak of in this report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="366"> When, it has a, Croatia and the independent became independent for the first time, they were countries satellites. </SEG> 
<SEG id="367"> We can of course of the question of guarantees and that of Croatia, or of the debate yesterday evening, or which have taken place in Belgrade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="368"> At a time when it appears that Milosevic has fled and that the Serbian people, we hope that the normal relations and the partnership between Serbia and our Union will soon. </SEG> 
<SEG id="369"> I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, which had been interrupted the Friday 6 October 2000. </SEG> 
<SEG id="370"> (the Assembly rose and observed one minute's silence) </SEG> 
<SEG id="371"> My question is the following: who speaks on behalf of the European Parliament concerning the Statute? </SEG> 
<SEG id="372"> I ask you, Madam President, to do everything in your power to accelerate the process under way in Committee concerning a document by more than thirty social collective and NGOs in order to protest against this situation of flagrant violation of the Community rules on the radiation protection. </SEG> 
<SEG id="373"> The examination in has shown that it is clearly a murder after probable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="374"> Madam President, dear colleagues, we have the opportunity to make a big step towards your dream - which is not, Moreover, mine. </SEG> 
<SEG id="375"> It is a matter of the basic regulation, on the basis of all the other regulations on the plants. </SEG> 
<SEG id="376"> It is obviously the, one after the other. </SEG> 
<SEG id="377"> (the sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at) </SEG> 
<SEG id="378"> The next item is the report (A5-0291 / 2000) by Mrs van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on employment and social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council [COM (2000 / 2000 - 2000 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 (COS)], the European Parliament, the economic and social Committee and the Committee of the regions on the new social agenda. </SEG> 
<SEG id="379"> The fact of highlighting the importance of this method of open coordination does not mean that this should replace the social, because we need to focus, in Europe too, social rights, we must have the courage to define a social and a social legislation which is necessary within the framework of a home market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="380"> In our opinion, we also support the dialogue and cooperation with civil society, and primarily with the amendment of the countries which use their integration in the family, for it is there in time to ensure a uniform that will follow the steps and the rest of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="381"> The areas of action in the communication of the Commission have also made the subject of a general agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="382"> I would remind you, at this stage of my intervention, held a meeting in Biarritz on this subject on 4 and 5 December, which I chair. </SEG> 
<SEG id="383"> Regarding the fight against exclusion, we have achieved a great progress in defining, on 17 October, at the employment and social policy Council, and the fight against poverty and social exclusion of national plans of action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="384"> I have heard some people having read the report to say that they are in agreement with the diagnosis but not with the Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="385"> Technological development and the new organization also a flexible collaboration, putting more emphasis on the objectives and the achievement of results and granting less importance to rigid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="386"> It is this that it is necessary to seek, in our opinion, the accused those who did not wait for the best of all possible worlds of a market without hindrance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="387"> This has certainly contributed to reducing the social unrest in our countries and to promote programmes of investments and investments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="388"> On the contrary, seems more questionable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="389"> If we talk of a Charter of rights and if we see the Constitution of a European Constitution, we cannot say that it is necessary, and we have to say that it is necessary to make all the necessary steps in this direction, even if it calls for a more. </SEG> 
<SEG id="390"> I would like to point out, in a critical, the lack of initiatives on the new requirements of the protection of work, to the consultation of workers and the reports of work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="391"> Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Minister, Mrs Péry, for this, the social agenda. </SEG> 
<SEG id="392"> These points, we know, are fought by the Conservatives in Europe we are, with our Group, particularly attached. </SEG> 
<SEG id="393"> The third issue is the content. </SEG> 
<SEG id="394"> The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m. </SEG> 
<SEG id="395"> It would be necessary to complement the action of the Commission by a revision of the individual in the costs of health care, social security and pension system, the right of the organisation of work, and perhaps also by a reduction of working time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="396"> Thus, the women feel the Europe of 25, and the 'Europe and within which will shape the relationship with this programme. </SEG> 
<SEG id="397"> We are therefore waiting for an annual report from the President of the Commission in the framework of an annual European Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="398"> I am delighted that they envisage a better of children in order to facilitate the balance between professional life and family life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="399"> My Group will be taken into account in the final vote. </SEG> 
<SEG id="400"> (the President cut the speaker to the speaker) </SEG> 
<SEG id="401"> I find the new approach of the Commission very positive, and the proposal for the programme, 2001-2005. </SEG> 
<SEG id="402"> I believe that the large number of amendments which are the Community spirit which exists between the Commission and the Committee on women's rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="403"> Firstly, because I have received, in the course of the past year, many demands on the part of enterprises, which represent a little, by comparison with the directive that they have to take, particularly in cases where they have to appeal against the decision of the Commission before the Court of first instance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="404"> I would also like to ask Commissioner Monti to any date they will be able to consider the publication of a public register, effective and, on the State of the negotiations so that the picture, as expected, results. </SEG> 
<SEG id="405"> I would also like to point out to the Commissioner that it is important that, in the next report, a more important section is in the area of financial services. </SEG> 
<SEG id="406"> What I have just said is not only for the area of energy, but for other areas in general. </SEG> 
<SEG id="407"> Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I too should like to thank the rapporteurs for the good work in the two reports, which put a judgment on your work and that of the management of the competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="408"> I stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything and that, in this context, it is not or cannot be competitive without borders. </SEG> 
<SEG id="409"> Mr President, today, nobody calls into question, and I am not going to do, the fact that the State does the conditions of competition and constitute an element which is detrimental to encourage businesses to be more competitive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="410"> So to deny the fact that the State during the 1994-1998, while the Commission itself of this reduction, was already curious, to say the least. </SEG> 
<SEG id="411"> Today, we can, of course, Mr President, to the past, although in my opinion the report of the Commission on competition policy, and must learn the lessons for the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="412"> In the time I have available, I would like to make, Mr President, the three points: the modernisation of Community competition law, achieved in 1999 in the application of the rules of competition and the State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="413"> The Commission has continued to intervene with in particular in relation to the cartels and the abuse of a dominant position, just as in the field of power. </SEG> 
<SEG id="414"> Mr Rapkay, it was extremely important, for the Commission, to have the support of the European Parliament for the pursuit of its competition policy, and I do not have the impression that this support can control. </SEG> 
<SEG id="415"> This can be at the request of a Member State or in the terms of Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, provision which remains in force during the third phase of the Union and for the States which are the subject of a debate, currently in Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden. </SEG> 
<SEG id="416"> The appeal in the capitals should remain the only possible option in the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="417"> I therefore express the wish that this report the approval of this Assembly in its present version, and that the internal market is the area of vines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="418"> Today, its review is considering the phytosanitary and scientific and technical progress, in particular in the multiplication of in vitro. </SEG> 
<SEG id="419"> I also believe that, through this precautionary principle, to the possibility of, for example, the intensive use of treatments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="420"> To conclude, my dear colleagues, to respect the principle of precaution, in his mind as in his letter, if articles and amendments that I have just named market, it would be necessary, as the wine growers, that we follow the opinion of Mrs Isler, then the Committee on the environment, and vote on their abolition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="421"> Mr President, if you will allow me, Mr Commissioner, can you give your opinion on the amendment of the Committee on the environment, public health and consumer policy? it is amendment no 1. </SEG> 
<SEG id="422"> The only point on which they might discuss, it is that of whether I had or not take that the French government has the mandate of Mr Le Pen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="423"> I remind you that the vote will take place at 12 noon soon. </SEG> 
<SEG id="424"> In the area of justice and internal Affairs, I am optimistic on a solution to the civil judicial cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="425"> The Group will play its full role until 19 November, the date of the next meeting at ministerial level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="426"> We need this climate, as Mr Moscovici has said, and I have also felt, at the level of Heads of State and of government, a collective and historic at a historic moment in the construction of European culture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="427"> It will simply, ladies and gentlemen, to see from now, in these matters, we do not find the spirit or the climate of separately. </SEG> 
<SEG id="428"> The smaller countries of the European Union are not! </SEG> 
<SEG id="429"> I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify this point. </SEG> 
<SEG id="430"> On the one hand, the President is a historic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="431"> Madam President, Mr President of the Council, Mr Commissioner, if progress has been made on the and the extension of majority voting in the Council of Ministers, and on the composition of the Commission, the Council and the President-in-Office of the Council, you have underlined. </SEG> 
<SEG id="432"> It seems to me that one goes in the opposite direction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="433"> Those who refuse and enjoy the same freedom of movement as the passengers out of a car. </SEG> 
<SEG id="434"> I am not, and that you, to interfere in the internal Affairs of the German, but I believe that this position is coherent and go elsewhere in the direction of what the Commission wants, if I am not mistaken. </SEG> 
<SEG id="435"> We have started to have exchanges on this issue, it emerges that all the Member States wish to the maintenance of this ceiling after enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="436"> I believe that this will not be the case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="437"> The first: one has sometimes had the impression that in Biarritz, there was an obsession with the debate between small and large States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="438"> From this point of view, I believe that it is not enough to say that the Community must be safeguarded. </SEG> 
<SEG id="439"> Even when the applicant countries will have to the Union, each Member State must be able to a "or" senior ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="440"> The wording of the text of Article 93 is all the more tragic that once the first wave of enlargement, we will be even more in the move towards the Council of Ministers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="441"> It is in fact to convince the citizens of these countries of the merits of any new Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="442"> That would seem to recognize the importance of such a crisis that is maintained during generations could make up without the prelude, the conciliation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="443"> I am worried that the EU with a view to a decision processes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="444"> However, the failure in cost, to those who wish to make to intervene on a large scale before. </SEG> 
<SEG id="445"> On the one hand, the head of government of the time because of the violence that in the region and to focus its efforts on the creation of a government of concentration with the leader of the opposition, Mr Sharon. </SEG> 
<SEG id="446"> It is with an immense satisfaction of course that we have learned the victory by the people of Yugoslavia and the election of its President Mr Kostuníca. </SEG> 
<SEG id="447"> I recommend to Mr Barón Crespo to ask his colleagues Italians him to explain why they are in government in Italy with a Party which declares itself from and is preparing to confront the elections with a Communist, per the Comunista. </SEG> 
<SEG id="448"> Progress is essential on this plan in the procedure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="449"> The Commission is better to provide in the future by the possibility that it has to vote at the very simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="450"> The European Union has no need of visionaries who look up in 2030, but people who can the problems that will bring the expansion in the years to come, and which can find solutions to these problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="451"> It is therefore a work which is not open up and who does not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="452"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="453"> Because of this basic, at best they do more, because they understand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="454"> Democracy is better in Europe, but the, it, is ill. </SEG> 
<SEG id="455"> Today, on 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, the European Parliament says one thing and simple strongly said: the Constitution, yes, you can, yes, we want it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="456"> This is why the idea that is in itself a sufficient. </SEG> 
<SEG id="457"> I will go to the essential in concentrating on the salient points of the report of the President Gil-Robles, which I will simply say that I think it is very good. </SEG> 
<SEG id="458"> Firstly, that of a simplification of the Treaties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="459"> I will not go further, because we are not in any case - I am not - to discuss the report of the Institute of Florence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="460"> Information - I am going to be technical, - which have been linked to the Presidency, it appears that a clear majority of the language versions, contrary to the Italian version, refer, for the application of the policy of cohesion, at least not in general. </SEG> 
<SEG id="461"> Mr Duhamel, you will no doubt agree with me for saying that if it does not, there will be no place, not least, for a reflection on the future of the European Union, in any case in the current framework. </SEG> 
<SEG id="462"> It is also vital that is clearly defined in this Constitution, the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union the dynamics of the European Union should be included to cover the fields in which it is necessary to act together, as for example in the field of foreign policy and security. </SEG> 
<SEG id="463"> They could also prove necessary to overcome blockages. </SEG> 
<SEG id="464"> We need more in the division of competence and the affirmation of the principle of subsidiarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="465"> Everyone knows that there are different views on this subject in the different Member States and within the various social groups. </SEG> 
<SEG id="466"> Unfortunately the final objective of a European Constitution would be exactly the opposite and of course we cannot agree. </SEG> 
<SEG id="467"> In the House, in effect, there will be the people sitting at the table, budgetary, fiscal and then the other people who will be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="468"> It is obvious that the second version is not good and that, Firstly, because the regions are all covered by the structural funds and that, Secondly, if this was true, there would have been no reason to adopt the declaration no 30 </SEG> 
<SEG id="469"> Mr President, I will focus my poor or sixty seconds on the report Olivier Duhamel, who is a good report, because it clearly say clearly things, and refrain from our rapporteur us all the time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="470"> In my opinion, the unity of Europe cannot be that policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="471"> It seems to us that the new Constitution should enter into force for the next European elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="472"> Consequently, the word "less" applies both to the island regions and other regions and, if they follow the proposal of Mr Barnier, it is here to amend the text of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention. </SEG> 
<SEG id="473"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="474"> Since the colleague has said that she would vote against, the amendment is therefore rejected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="475"> Mr President, the amendment that here we all right at the chaos. </SEG> 
<SEG id="476"> - (it) I welcome the adoption of the Trakatellis report by this Assembly because it provides for the setting of standards of quality and blood and blood. </SEG> 
<SEG id="477"> If the European parliamentary is autonomous, should we take one of Mr Le Pen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="478"> I am particularly disappointed the vote of the European Parliament on the report concerning the multiplication of contribute. </SEG> 
<SEG id="479"> Some consider that the alcohol, tobacco and drugs, is a product likely to cause many according to those who use them and on the other the contrary above all as a source of employment and important enrichment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="480"> The rapporteur reserve in the Group, but the proposals in the White Paper of the Commission relating to this subject, but it is Nevertheless fears concerning the possible implications of the reform, whose main aim and rules of the application of the competition rules. </SEG> 
<SEG id="481"> In the debate yesterday evening, so I can greet Jonathan Evans for his work, I have to say to my profound with too, if extremist, on his report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="482"> Aid Ireland has its turn in the region of the objective of all jobs' in the three years to come. </SEG> 
<SEG id="483"> Faced with that cause the consequences of this policy, the interventions, and other economic and fiscal incentives of the State come first in part of the situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="484"> (the sitting was suspended at, is resumed at 3 p.m.) </SEG> 
<SEG id="485"> And we are therefore, in October 2000, on the eve of taking a decision with regard to the assessment of the budget 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="486"> That does not, however, prevent the Council from the agricultural spending a total of million euros. </SEG> 
<SEG id="487"> Moreover, we also of course that it is not enough to simply, quite simply, to create 400 jobs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="488"> I can only urge the Council to follow us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="489"> This is why the management of this Assembly is for the European Union and not the opposite. </SEG> 
<SEG id="490"> At the moment, it is the Court of Auditors which causes us less serious. </SEG> 
<SEG id="491"> Finally, we must treat the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="492"> On the contrary, we are of the opinion that this should be taken into consideration in the candidate countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="493"> In addition, we have proposed that the European Parliament continues to be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="494"> When they organize a cooperation on matters of social, cultural or environmental - the Commissioner that I am right - we meet with the Commissioner for Budgets, the finance Ministers and the Members of the Committee on Budgets to order together so that no mistake is not committed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="495"> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your warm welcome. </SEG> 
<SEG id="496"> The Council has proposed as the first reading the appropriations that seem to him for 2001, without taking account of the concerns of order in which serve the objective of good allocation of appropriations that the Community institutions must follow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="497"> Before you yourself on the draft budget for 2001, I would like to insist on a certain number of objectives which the Council and Parliament have in common and which can be translated into an agreement between the two branches of the budgetary authority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="498"> We are in a similar position in the field of structural policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="499"> Mr Colom I Naval, the cooperation of this as a good: in the future, Parliament will have better information in the field of legal bases that have an impact in terms of expenses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="500"> I would like to remind you that the planning of the year for the Balkans that EUR 1.85 billion euros for the whole of the period running up to 2006. </SEG> 
<SEG id="501"> I ask you once again to examine this proposal without that the Commission supports and to keep to the spirit of this possibility. </SEG> 
<SEG id="502"> This equipment was of course preparation time for the 2001 budget and for the disposal of 1999. </SEG> 
<SEG id="503"> Even if I appreciate the work of this body as a Member of the Committee on Budgets, even if I think all the work of the rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgets, I do not want to fail, as rapporteur for the Committee on economic and monetary Affairs, to point out once again that this is not a new time and importance of which is not, in spite of the modesty of amounts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="504"> By these measures, we want to make the formula I again fully operational, to restore the confidence in the judicial within the EU and to consolidate the Community law that is the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="505"> In proposing the abolition of this initiative without seeing the lesser extent, the Commission stated clearly definition of the political will to Lisbon and by this Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="506"> This decision was, to say the least, and she has given the impression to many of us that the whole of this programme, very important, was simply become a rubber that the Committee on Budgets and the European Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="507"> The third point concerns the common agricultural policy as it is defined in the draft budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="508"> If the employment is the policy of the Union, the Community, as a sector, cannot remain on the sidelines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="509"> I am particularly pleased that the funding of the Socrates, youth and culture 2000, which the European was at the end of the year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="510"> As regards the aid to the Mediterranean countries, for example, the door on the Budgets of several years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="511"> Mr President, during the debates, I took the floor on behalf of the Committee on culture, youth, education, the media and sport, for which we have heard Mrs Iivari. </SEG> 
<SEG id="512"> Nevertheless, I would like to say to the idea that we must not lose sight of the fact that the European Union does not believe that 1% of the GDP of the Member States and that the bulk of this money is managed in the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="513"> I come now to the strategy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="514"> This brings me to the strategy of my Group, because on the basis of our belief is the wish to give in to its money. </SEG> 
<SEG id="515"> On the contrary, we must do everything we can to ensure that this is an example of transparency, efficiency, and good democratic control of the European institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="516"> We need to reflect the way of resolving this problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="517"> We want to support the process of democratization and we want to reach a balance between the traditional areas of policy that we must deal with. </SEG> 
<SEG id="518"> The most difficult in the new budget actions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="519"> It goes without saying that a management is needed, it has our support, and we should not deceive ourselves on this point. </SEG> 
<SEG id="520"> It is a special initiative, especially in first reading, and this is an initiative, because it can, in the current context, to collect a majority of votes in favour. </SEG> 
<SEG id="521"> This directive, the importance of the allocation for the Kosovo is not without putting some problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="522"> The budgetary policy must inspire confidence in European policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="523"> We must therefore support all the measures aimed at strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises. </SEG> 
<SEG id="524"> The level of implementation of the budget; </SEG> 
<SEG id="525"> In keeping this line in the approach to the Budgets of this year and the years to come, the European Parliament occupies fully its place in the budgetary procedure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="526"> In fact, with the transfer of 175 million euros, we have made an estimate of 25 million more than what was intended. </SEG> 
<SEG id="527"> With regard to the MEDA programme, the Council declared that the commitments taken poses no problem as the eight years of payment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="528"> I believe that Mr Duff was present this morning, when we looked at the European Council in Biarritz. </SEG> 
<SEG id="529"> My reply will be very simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="530"> Ramiro Zapata was the last 25 of the press and the media the hundred campaigners murdered by the human rights of the Committee. </SEG> 
<SEG id="531"> The attitude of the Council delights me a little more today than in July because, as often during situations of crisis, the European Union seems to be the last to show itself on the international stage and to make its voice heard. </SEG> 
<SEG id="532"> The question, Mr President, and I will end here, is whether it is not a means of pressure stronger than the one proposed by the President in his information and if the aid that we are going to give will be completely different from that of the United States, that is to say, not towards the fumigation of cultures, but towards their substitution, and also for the social aspects rather than military. </SEG> 
<SEG id="533"> The questions that several and myself with the situation in Colombia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="534"> Their objects being, I call for the same 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13. </SEG> 
<SEG id="535"> Subject: on the contrary the claim of a tax on continues to gain ground these last months, with the multiplication of economic and financial for a tax on financial transactions and to help the citizens) in France and in Europe, and the amendments to the French national Assembly and in the committees. </SEG> 
<SEG id="536"> I would also that the answer to the question of its influence on the currencies, and in particular the effect of a tax of 0.1 per thousand on who expect of the order of 20 to 50%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="537"> It is also calling for in paragraph 26, the setting up of an international organisation of arbitration, to wipe out the debt of the countries of the South. </SEG> 
<SEG id="538"> It is Moreover what happened to the euro as a year, that is, or the wish. </SEG> 
<SEG id="539"> I would like to add to what has been said, at the time, in relation to the countries of the South, that certain standards, made by example: for example, a Tobin type of 50 to 250 billion dollars, which could be a Tobin tax, while, at the same time, the people, amounts to a sum of USD 40 billion per year, the amount that could be enough to give the living conditions and the hundreds of millions of people who are all in the countries of the third world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="540"> These last months, cases have been discovered, in particular, in different places of France. </SEG> 
<SEG id="541"> I therefore ask the question, as a representative of the French Presidency is here, to know whether the slaughter of these cows will be paid on the Community budget or if you on the national budget and if you think that it would be a good thing that they pay on the Community budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="542"> I ask for your indulgence and ask you to hear the answer? </SEG> 
<SEG id="543"> So the action of the two governments concerned is restricted by this international law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="544"> I do not understand how the Commission can say what it needs, and the Council in July. </SEG> 
<SEG id="545"> By acting in the name of subsidiarity, the European Union lacks, to one of its duties, as it happens, these weeks, both in the North of Italy and Spain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="546"> As mindful of this, how can the disbursement of GBP 5 billion by the British taxpayers - it is our current annual contribution - if it does not a broad approval of the public? </SEG> 
<SEG id="547"> A flexible attitude of the Council, to arrive at an agreement at second reading in order to complete the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="548"> If someone has need to be convinced, that it simply. </SEG> 
<SEG id="549"> This strategy has already been introduced by Joan Colom I Naval, President in charge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="550"> The present in the budget of this Parliament - and the Commissioner Schreyer has - are many: the adaptation of the agricultural policy, of new structural programmes, a better implementation of the structural policies, the monitoring of the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit in view of the creation of a European Union stronger and more competitive and of the fight against social exclusion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="551"> The war by NATO too and her too great suffering. </SEG> 
<SEG id="552"> Despite what has been agreed, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to reach this objective in the borders without undermining the agricultural budget to a sustainable rural area in the current Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="553"> And I say this very clearly: it is necessary to give its chance to Kostunica and I hope that it will take time to a clear in the course of the coming weeks or months; but in the meantime, I hope, however, that, in terms of policy and in terms of the budget, the political conditions are the introduction of these two new budget lines, namely the and reconstruction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="554"> The elections which took place in Yugoslavia have two things: the people have had enough of the dictator Milosevic and they have put their trust in the teacher is. </SEG> 
<SEG id="555"> I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners will also shortly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="556"> In short, we fall in ",", in the environmental and the cuts, in both the social and environmental expenses in the cooperation, without of course as far as the Balkans are sufficient. </SEG> 
<SEG id="557"> In the context of which we dealt with, it is a question of big problems such as unemployment, for example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="558"> It is, of course, a very important point, it is the fact that we have the section four, with its approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to solve the problem, in particular because the Council does not wish to participate enough. </SEG> 
<SEG id="559"> The priorities are an important element of all work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="560"> It is not on the eve of the expiry of the Treaty but it would be worrying if the legal framework allowed to maintain such practices. </SEG> 
<SEG id="561"> This brings me to a third comment on the task that is now before us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="562"> The mistrust regarding the political leaders of the EU continues to grow, as I have seen in it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="563"> I pay tribute to that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="564"> The provision in the discussion of all the institutions concerned has allowed an exemplary collaboration, we shall - I regret - to reach an agreement at first reading. </SEG> 
<SEG id="565"> We who are in favour of stocks in a country, we shall have an argument for the EU, namely a more effective protection of persons, which is important for the citizens of the modern. </SEG> 
<SEG id="566"> I noted that my own country is ready to proceed to an amendment of the law on the personal data, which, in the current State, deprives the representatives of any influence on the decisions of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="567"> Many other points also pose problems and the judgment of the practice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="568"> The Commission would first like to recall the commitment that we have all taken towards the citizens to ensure the protection of personal data by the institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="569"> By this statement, the Commission will accept that the field of application of the regulation is limited to the first pillar exclusively. </SEG> 
<SEG id="570"> In order to honour the agreement it has concluded with the Council and the rapporteur to allow the approval at first reading, the Commission rejects any other amendment which would not be part of the report approved by the Committee on freedoms and rights of citizens, but amendment no 69, which corrects the amendment 43. </SEG> 
<SEG id="571"> Thus, it is imperative that the inter-service Group are very quickly, of the Commission, so that all the proposals to act can be, during their examination by the force on the basis of Article 299, paragraph 2, a detailed impact. </SEG> 
<SEG id="572"> The Committee on legal Affairs and the internal market, it is important to stress that one cannot compare that what is comparable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="573"> Given the importance of the scenario for the region, I can only by this observation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="574"> Since the creation of an interservices Group for the areas under the Presidency of Mr Delors, a long and fruitful path has gone up here and I would like to address the most sincere gratitude to the one that this Group. </SEG> 
<SEG id="575"> In fact, if the Treaty of Rome, it was referred to in the French overseas departments, it was necessary to wait, and the programmes of options and to the departments, the POSEI programmes, so that the European Union Finally that the permanence and combination of structural handicaps justified a treatment in relation to other areas of the Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="576"> I do not doubt that the proposals that the Commission will formulate bear the hallmark of these qualities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="577"> This question is all the more relevant that we are closer to an enlargement of the Union to the East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="578"> This right is nothing else, that is, that the principle of equality, which also requires treating different what is different. </SEG> 
<SEG id="579"> It is a document that we, and I, as rich in ideas, proposals, which goes to the heart of problems and that none of the subjects of the Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="580"> Your report, Mrs Sudre, puts the emphasis, just as, on the need to act. </SEG> 
<SEG id="581"> As to the revival of the diversification of the economy, we have advanced in several key areas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="582"> It is important that a large number of projects is in part, but, to this action on the ground, we must reflect the way to the needs of each of these regions, this information. </SEG> 
<SEG id="583"> Approval of the Minutes of the previous session </SEG> 
<SEG id="584"> I shall, of course, part of your intervention to the President. </SEG> 
<SEG id="585"> I am concerned about the risk of a general of a large number of machinery and then in Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="586"> This food and the proposals which we are, aiming to ensure the security of food, of the support of this Parliament, Mr Commissioner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="587"> The main task of this will be a task of consultation process, because the debate on food must be "clean" also. </SEG> 
<SEG id="588"> Mr President, I would like once again to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and for his opening the opinions of the other committees. </SEG> 
<SEG id="589"> When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to put into practice the principle of precaution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="590"> On the issue of always know to what extent we must allow him to look on nutrition, to give advice and by those who are primarily of the management of risk, we have also said that, when it comes to security, these questions should at least be in the mission of the consultation of the food chain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="591"> A Central element of this last point is to make sure that the rich heritage which is the can continue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="592"> The elements that will enable this to see the light of day called or laws or legislation, but, water quality, accountability, transparency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="593"> A good scientific knowledge is indeed essential to better assess the risks linked to the action of the animal, from the farm to the fork. </SEG> 
<SEG id="594"> Mr President, the fad for the introduction of a European Agency for food, as our rapporteur to call it, is obviously considerable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="595"> So that the agenda of the who remain properly financed and supported, it does not seem to be necessary to create a body of more, especially not an Agency which limits itself to the 15 Member States of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="596"> Food is an essential condition for the consumer; in fact, to be able to eat healthily and it is to us here. </SEG> 
<SEG id="597"> If we do not work, we shall be many things in the area of food. </SEG> 
<SEG id="598"> We must therefore amend the Treaty on the European Union in such a way as to what the Commission has the possibility of applying sanctions in the field of food, exactly as it can make today in the field of competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="599"> I support all the more participants, that they are political, administrative or other, who work within the framework of the 'food for all'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="600"> I do not agree with these words, because we can discover that a man is more than a body. </SEG> 
<SEG id="601"> It should be the real coordination of the network of national agencies which, in turn, will speed up and a network of centres of excellence of food at regional level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="602"> Also, I am of the opinion that your amendment no 11 and amendment no 17 are perfectly compatible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="603"> The reform of the European Union of the Union must be made at the level of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="604"> His report does not propose changes that it puts the emphasis on a number of elements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="605"> We have clearly stated in the report, and I am very pleased without reservation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="606"> However, the creation of a European Agency on the food is very positive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="607"> It is to hope that, in the interest of consumers, they will be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="608"> It is obvious, I think, to define in which it will be necessary to notify the Commission of any case provoking a response. </SEG> 
<SEG id="609"> The EU must have the highest standards of food security for its citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="610"> The Commission proposes the creation of a European food. </SEG> 
<SEG id="611"> I fear that Europe once again at risk of acquiring a huge administrative apparatus, unable to act. </SEG> 
<SEG id="612"> In fact, the output is inversely proportional to the levels of bureaucracy and at the level of expenses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="613"> The works double and in a number of institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="614"> It is necessary, however, to avoid that, in the shadow of the debate on the Green Paper, increases in public opinion the fear of a bureaucratic Europe which impacts on the quality of the products and fraud which endanger the health of consumers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="615"> As you know, the Commission attaches the utmost importance to its strategy in the matter of food. </SEG> 
<SEG id="616"> The Commission plans to adopt a proposal for a regulation establishing the principles and objectives which form the 'food and constitute the framework of future measures of protection of health and nutrition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="617"> Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="618"> To come to my report, I believe the proposal of the Commission and should add that the committees on foreign Affairs and the lot, in particular on certain points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="619"> As Mrs Bonino has clearly said, they have made a step forward by the proposal for a regulation from the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="620"> The proposal for a regulation from the Commission seems to us very vague. </SEG> 
<SEG id="621"> It is necessary to organise properly the allocation of operations and financing of research for the jobs and and for the instruments that can be used simply on the spot in order to come to the aid of the developing countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="622"> In the course of these eight years, the European Union has more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget in the fight against anti-personnel mines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="623"> But we cannot people whose government makes of violence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="624"> Firstly, I have already spoken, I think that it would be a mistake, on the basis of a good feeling, of course, but all the same, to make the adhesion to the Ottawa Convention is an absolute condition of granting a Community assistance for the fight against anti-personnel mines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="625"> I cannot accept amendment no 19. </SEG> 
<SEG id="626"> Secondly, the international Community is suffering from a lack of coordination of its efforts at world level and more particularly in the affected countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="627"> Mr President, the Socialist Group shares that just expressed at the moment Mr van Orden about the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="628"> Remember the! </SEG> 
<SEG id="629"> I thank you for the quality of your report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="630"> Mr President, the calls for the children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="631"> The population maintains a forces that, whatever they may be, that is by years of war. </SEG> 
<SEG id="632"> Mr President, I am very pleased that there is Finally a European legislation, in the form of a regulation, on the anti-personnel mines and that we have a good report from Mrs Bonino on this subject. </SEG> 
<SEG id="633"> - (de) Mr President, Mr Commissioner, my dear colleagues, we are discussing today a sad question. </SEG> 
<SEG id="634"> This is not a chance if the children are, in the first place, in crisis, in other words in the areas which could take initiatives of a different nature to overcome these crises. </SEG> 
<SEG id="635"> In two, in Bosnia, in 1999, a panel of the presence of mines in a field, which is not on the premises of a small one. </SEG> 
<SEG id="636"> It is tragic that it is the civilian population which is suffering from the inability of its leaders. </SEG> 
<SEG id="637"> On the eve of the ministerial Conference, which will take place on 15 and 16 November in Marseilles, I am convinced that your work with our delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries, by Mr Obiols, will enable us to make progress in our project of dialogue and peace. </SEG> 
<SEG id="638"> All the children are involved in. </SEG> 
<SEG id="639"> - (de) Mr President, given that I agree with almost everything that my colleagues have said, it seems to me, of the I therefore abandon to use my speaking time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="640"> Your conception of the open cooperation it is to fall in the institutional by officials of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="641"> We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, which means that the decisions are taken at the closest possible level to the people concerned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="642"> Since, however, an amendment from the PPE Group come to find a very important, I have approved the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="643"> Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the resolution on the results of the informal European Council separately, for two reasons: Firstly because I voted separately, nominal, paragraphs 2 and 5, which has allowed us to express my opposition to frank in relation to these two paragraphs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="644"> In other words, around the table of the common European home, some of the card and other menu minimum. </SEG> 
<SEG id="645"> Of course, one can always do better, and the control must not weaken but by us, the listing of these rights and their inclusion in the Treaty itself does not constitute the second priority of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="646"> There has been debate about, and the amendments that have been tabled to this matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="647"> During 1999 at the European Parliament, the participation has reached that 40%, if one of the countries in which the vote is obligatory, and those in which this was national politics. </SEG> 
<SEG id="648"> In order to achieve the objective of a European Constitution - what we wish -, it is necessary to avoid imposing and rigid, which inevitably to the failure of the objective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="649"> A Constitution should align, by the high, the best approach to the world of work, women, and the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="650"> Without denying the laudable intention of producers, clarify and deepen the European Union, as well as simplifying texts for the closer to the citizens, I did not vote for this resolution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="651"> The allocation of powers and responsibilities </SEG> 
<SEG id="652"> I consider as to the fact that the Charter of fundamental rights of the EU a membership of the Union to the Council of Europe Convention on human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="653"> But the report by Mr Gil-Robles comes to my assistance, because it proposes that for some subjects, sectors and criteria, certain Member States of the European Union will come to an agreement on a joint action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="654"> To allow that a number of important decisions on a number of important areas are taken in the Council of Ministers is contrary to the basic norms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="655"> Today, it is trying to prevent the relaxation of, and it will eventually lose part, too. </SEG> 
<SEG id="656"> The present report tends to stand in this sense of our Parliament (resolution of 13 April 2000). </SEG> 
<SEG id="657"> (SV) our opinion about the fact that they are flexible is broadly positive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="658"> (it) the British labour Members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very welcome to the contribution that they have continuous work of the IGC on the cooperation, without all the details of this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="659"> These must feel part of the European Union which, I hope, will make a paradise for tourists and their inhabitants. </SEG> 
<SEG id="660"> In the Middle ages, these regions and their people do not belong to Europe and, even today, they are not considered as. </SEG> 
<SEG id="661"> In fact, the features of these areas, which follow in general and of the continent, but also of their chronic in relation to a number of products, or even a single production, demand measures in these institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="662"> Mr President, I apologise if I still the and the move to my last explanation of vote and would particularly like to express my solidarity with the translators our explanations of vote, as far as I am concerned the Italian ornella. </SEG> 
<SEG id="663"> It in fact clear that the Agency has aimed to obtain the powers of national, or of paralysing, to put at the service of the objectives of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="664"> It is not the Commission and the Parliament of this Agency 's ", which is totally contrary to the philosophy which is the powers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="665"> It is not quite what we propose the Bowis report, where one has the feeling that the food is primarily as a new pretext for feeding the well-known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission to the detriment of national bodies and the security of citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="666"> Also, I think, by definition, condemn these acts on behalf of our Parliament, which has always respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all the communities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="667"> Madam President, I understand the criticism of the rapporteur. however, by voting for the amendments of the Committee on agriculture and rural development, one vote not only of appropriations but also for or against a policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="668"> I ask you to support the amendment of the line, acquisition of property, "or", according to the proposals for amendments that will be adopted, so that we do not exceed our own exceed 20% of all administrative expenses. </SEG>

<SEG id="675"> However, the European Parliament has managed to make to adopt a number of important priorities - an effort in the fight against unemployment and poverty, on a series of important issues linked to the environment and to the equality etc., we have voted against the blows by the right to life and of women. </SEG> 
<SEG id="676"> - (SV) we maintain our opinion about the movements, namely that mission to play within the framework of their mission to have them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="677"> I assume - and I hope that the Commission will seek solutions to this effect -, that we are going to have to cover the period between 2002 and 2005 by means of a transitional rules. </SEG> 
<SEG id="678"> - (de) in its in order to regulate and of society, but especially in the purpose of regulation, the national parliaments, the Commission has put a proposal for a regulation and obligatory application, instead of a proposal for a directive, which must be treated in the Parliament and the Council to enter into force on 31 December of this year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="679"> We therefore support the efforts made by the Commission in order to reform this sector and we oppose any new measures aiming to promote. </SEG>

<SEG id="691"> For years, we claim of a harmonisation of the efforts made in this direction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="692"> I believe that this report on a critical importance for citizens and citizens, of small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro zone and to increase the acceptance of the Union on economic and monetary Affairs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="693"> The free movement of capital in the single currency can best obstacles or jobs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="694"> However, the European Parliament and the Commission are really attach a lot of importance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="695"> I support the dual policy that wants to follow the rapporteur to encourage the too to act. </SEG> 
<SEG id="696"> We cannot force the banks to exercise a not profitable, but as politicians, what we can do, it is to support the amendment on behalf of the PPE-DE Group by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs claiming that measures be taken again before the end of the year and that these standards are, when they begin to using the euro notes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="697"> It is in this direction that goes the proposal that I have introduced with Mrs Peijs: bringing the banks around a table, not to impose constraints, but because we can reinforce the political pressure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="698"> It goes without saying that if the problems of cross-border payments, as colleagues that, today, the credibility of these new these and of these new notes will be directly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="699"> We are of the opinion that this accumulation of statistics on the national payments of the Union are a relic of the past which is no longer justified in a space, and that it constitutes an obstacle to the proper functioning of the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="700"> To hear the speeches of some of my colleagues in the Committee, those that this House for longer than me, I have had the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, which this Parliament will submit to the fourth time, belonged to this category. </SEG> 
<SEG id="701"> Dear colleagues, I thank you for the support that you bring to my report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="702"> If we, at European level, it will be necessary to strengthen the possibility offered. </SEG> 
<SEG id="703"> The main source of job creation, both in terms of quality of that amount, the SMEs play a crucial role for the social and regional planning. </SEG> 
<SEG id="704"> The care that she has brought to the proposals and the cooperation she has had the lead with many parties were an asset to better define and optimising the setting up of this programme. </SEG> 
<SEG id="705"> Thirdly, we must look for the added value. </SEG> 
<SEG id="706"> It follows that the small and medium-sized enterprises can so that if unemployment is weak and if the public Budgets are free of debts and enough to see such investments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="707"> Businesses need. </SEG> 
<SEG id="708"> Above all, when a business or a society with fewer than 250 a project, it must be possible for a means not only with a guarantee to 120%, but also on the basis of a good idea. </SEG> 
<SEG id="709"> The national States, even the regional or local use colossal finance, intended to drain the taxpayers' money, that is to say the sums on the majority of the population, including the most, for the large companies and the basis for their property and their shareholders. </SEG> 
<SEG id="710"> The small and medium-sized enterprises consists of thousands of attempts to countries which supply the big companies in effective and ideas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="711"> What I expect from the Commissioner, particularly among the set of measures that we have proposed here, it is that it facilitates and helps and to information, so that the leaders of SMEs are capable of using the information with energy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="712"> All these occupy a special place in the multiannual programme. </SEG> 
<SEG id="713"> Finally I welcome the idea of us to give an annual assessment of the implementation of the programme. </SEG> 
<SEG id="714"> The recent incidents against the Greek imperative more the need to promote measures, of strengthening the institutions and the respect of human rights in Albania. </SEG> 
<SEG id="715"> An impressive number of Albanian leave their countries due to the insecurity which, social, social and family structures. </SEG>

<SEG id="719"> Mrs Karamanou, to the point of view that the convergence of your report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="720"> This is a very important that is by historical, social, political and economic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="721"> We will never know the exact number of victims. </SEG> 
<SEG id="722"> The economic activities of links between the people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="723"> What I find or unacceptable in this report, and I say this with frankness, it is that one of the causes, that is to say that the procedure of a procedure for granting visas, and therefore the possibility of migration, with the issue of illegal immigration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="724"> The Amsterdam Treaty which are the consequence of the Treaty of Amsterdam had an impact on the management of the issues of asylum and immigration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="725"> Thirdly and Finally, the action plan and its implementation must be at regional level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="726"> Of course, this requirement we invite us to show restraint in the matter of regulations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="727"> It is now or never to insist on the force of Community action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="728"> I also plead for that are introduced proposals are in the case of amendment of the order of the amendments in the directives or regulations were. </SEG> 
<SEG id="729"> The principle of subsidiarity, it is well understood, we engage in two directions: take the decisions at the lowest possible level, but to recognize that the level of the lowest possible can be a very high level, when the interests are at stake and if they are not protected everywhere. </SEG> 
<SEG id="730"> This report is a very concise and and I hope that my colleagues will take this into account. </SEG> 
<SEG id="731"> The report of the Committee on legal Affairs and the internal market has not provoke the enthusiasm of its Members. </SEG> 
<SEG id="732"> It is to this that I am in the report on the SLIM project, because the Community, and Mr Medina has proved with the reading of the articles of the Treaty, is hardly, even for the experts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="733"> Consequently, certain aspects of the report that little bit, because I would have preferred a report and 'with regard to the internal market, and, above all, because the report does not go in this direction on this point. </SEG> 
<SEG id="734"> What is important for the institutions of the Union, it is that we firmly to the texts, particularly bearing in mind the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="735"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="736"> The persistence of this situation could exert an influence on the citizens with regard to the euro. </SEG> 
<SEG id="737"> Mr President, the Committee on citizens' freedoms and rights, justice and internal Affairs has prepared with great care the Karamanou report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="738"> Having said that, as President of the Commission, I would like to take advantage of our oral question and this debate to address the two parties - since our motion for a resolution is addressed to both parties, and I would like to make some considerations calmly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="739"> The people of the Union that we claim. </SEG> 
<SEG id="740"> Although the water is under bridges, the agreement is Nevertheless his term and has not been renewed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="741"> I can understand the reasons, but not those of the director general. </SEG> 
<SEG id="742"> We could say that, eleven less the, we continue to pay the agreement and the 'l'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="743"> Mr President, we have held a similar debate here a year and the fact that it has been a year to start the negotiations shows how difficult it is to find the resources for the fleets of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="744"> During the second agreement, things clear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="745"> But it is also clear that there is nothing, not even the resources! </SEG> 
<SEG id="746"> It is for that that I want to make it clear that if the PPE-DE Group of others, it is not only for having supported, and the agreements, but also for having their extension of significant. </SEG> 
<SEG id="747"> Thirdly, since the agreement is discontinued, the exploitation of the place of the Sahara by Community fleets and which are, neither the Commission nor to one of the Member States continues: one talks of the Netherlands. </SEG> 
<SEG id="748"> I understand, because that represents a source of income and important for this poor - in relation to European standards. </SEG> 
<SEG id="749"> The other point that I would like to emphasise is that the temporary and shipowners in compensation of this company at the end of the month, and this is an untenable situation for them, they all work rather than receiving aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="750"> A year ago, as part of the Andalusian, I and I propose initiatives in the corridors, in the offices, in the Commission and at the time of the hearings with the Commissioner in order that is taken into consideration the very concept of the fleet fishes that Morocco. </SEG> 
<SEG id="751"> Spain has developed a remarkably positive the difficult that always existed between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco. </SEG> 
<SEG id="752"> In both Spanish and Andalusian, I claim the right of thousands of families and Spanish and to maintain, and to what this Parliament also, their jobs, which are put in danger for almost a year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="753"> We shall now proceed to the vote. </SEG> 
<SEG id="754"> A history of twelve years, made by the authorities by the authorities, delaying tactics, hopes, also of rights for the people concerned, of the defence of its rights to the respect of citizens, who wanted nothing other than their good right. </SEG> 
<SEG id="755"> As you know, the matter is very complex and more than seven hundred people working in more than Italian. </SEG> 
<SEG id="756"> If the Italian judicial order is and, as has been the case for the staff, we do not believe that the Commission can intervene at every European citizen an all the professions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="757"> The injustice lies in the fact that two people and the task and working to receive a salary and are subject to different conditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="758"> In my opinion, there is nothing worse than having to inform the people to be made in their favour could be that a series of words and have no worries on their existence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="759"> I say to you, I say to the Commission that I hope a reaction to the fact that, in that, to be made by the Court, that it is contrary to Article 48 (2) of the Treaty that a Member State if the work of a year with the possibility of renewal, if it exists in principle no limit of this kind to the contrary to other business. </SEG> 
<SEG id="760"> I think, however, that these matters go straight to the heart of the fundamental principles of the European right, particularly the freedom of movement, and no exception can in relation to these principles. </SEG> 
<SEG id="761"> As the current debate, we still have a lot of barriers, many obstacles on the path of this internal market, and not only in the present case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="762"> We shall now proceed to the vote. </SEG> 
<SEG id="763"> (the President cut the speaker to the speaker) </SEG> 
<SEG id="764"> On behalf of our Parliament, I, Mr Thomas and so that the Chancellor, Mr Wolfgang Schüssel, the messages and solidarity in the proof that such a tragedy calls in regard to the victims, their families and the whole of the Austrian people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="765"> Are there any comments? </SEG> 
<SEG id="766"> I support the proposal of Mr Ceyhun, and I would be very grateful if the Council if it could we do know if he intends to put forward a new proposal on this matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="767"> Madam President, dear colleagues, our Group considers this incident of such importance that we believe that it would not be treated as it is within the framework of the urgency debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="768"> I have the feeling that you join the motivation, Mr Barón Crespo, if I have understood you correctly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="769"> Madam President, some time ago, we have discussed within our Assembly of the issue of sanctions against Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="770"> It is imperative that we have a debate on this subject before the coming into force of the amendments proposed by the British authorities; the Commission must also make it clear that it is right in this respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="771"> (A5-0314 / 2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on citizens' freedoms and rights, justice and internal Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the adoption of a Convention relating to the improvement of judicial cooperation in the matter, notably in the area of the fight against organized crime, the laundering of the product and the question of material / 2000 - C5-0394 / 2000 - 2000 / 0815 (CNS)). </SEG> 
<SEG id="772"> The debate must be followed by concrete actions to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="773"> The creation of an area of freedom, security and justice cannot remain in the hands of a Agency under the control of the national governments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="774"> On the other hand, Article 8 of the draft Convention basis alone, the grounds for refusal of cooperation that could invoke the requested State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="775"> First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Marinho for his work and to say how the fight against crimes deserves not only our support, but also our vigilance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="776"> Spot, continue to condemn the laundering of dirty money and weapons and weapons and drugs: yes, of course! </SEG> 
<SEG id="777"> Our task is to, identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="778"> These are to be found in the amendments and, judging by the debate in Committee, I am confident that they will be approved by the European Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="779"> It seems to me that this set of initiatives in a manner which risk reducing the protection offered by Article 6 of the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="780"> But the reality is not so simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="781"> To conclude, Mr President, the PPE Group supports the compromise amendment which we have reached with Mrs Roure about of lawyers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="782"> The second measure, the second instrument, is harmonisation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="783"> Other speakers have already this initiative. </SEG> 
<SEG id="784"> Such was the objective of the meeting of the justice and internal Affairs Council "and" to "of 17 October last. </SEG> 
<SEG id="785"> The best way of strengthening the democratic parliamentary control and judicial control over Europol, all the Europol Convention in the legal framework of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="786"> The creation of a provisional judicial cooperation is a step in the right direction, which the European Parliament for a long time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="787"> That is the direction of guarantees, namely improving this aspect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="788"> The European Parliament is the supranational authority of the establishment of this report, and my speech you therefore propose support by supporting our rapporteur. </SEG> 
<SEG id="789"> It is only when the institutional and that the area of justice, that the citizens and the European Parliament to pronounce on the measures that the Council is proposing to us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="790"> Eurojust is therefore a logic of this work, which aims to give the citizens a high level of security, in an area of justice, security and freedom, in the fight against forms of serious crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="791"> Mr President, Mr Commissioner, dear colleagues, it is necessary to congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on the excellent report that she presents us, in the line of one of the decisions taken at the Tampere Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="792"> But as, with Eurojust, one talks of the coordination of national public prosecutors and judges to fight against all forms of crime - and I subscribe to the approach of the rapporteur - one concept: they do not speak only of cooperation for the crimes and transnational, they also speak of cooperation for the criminal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="793"> We will have the opportunity to engage in this interim, from 1 January 2001, but the Commission is willing to support the debate on what should be the Eurojust. </SEG> 
<SEG id="794"> To hand, and on the other, there has been taken that have - it seems to me - which have not yet been inflexible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="795"> The problems which are at the level of taxes have not too; other areas much more worrying. </SEG> 
<SEG id="796"> It is unacceptable that we do not have clear objectives and that we will not be able to measure the results; that does not happen in any other institution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="797"> A second point, Mr Commissioner: with regard to the matter of inadmissible, unacceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="798"> I want to underline that it has a positive in a certain number of problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="799"> It is obvious that this work in consortium not a spouse. </SEG> 
<SEG id="800"> Therefore, we have really to the recovery of 3.4 million, and one can say that we have more than 90%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="801"> Are there any comments? </SEG> 
<SEG id="802"> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of nine months of work and a long-term project, and thus the draft Charter of fundamental rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="803"> Even if it is now to say "yes" to this Charter, I hope that this Parliament will not leave no doubt, in the course of the next few weeks, on the fact that it requires the Council that this Charter is legally binding and that this matter must ensure the access of citizens to the Court of justice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="804"> This position, as you know, the one taken by the Heads of State and government at the European Council in Biarritz, which were approved unanimously and without reservation, and I can therefore only urge you, on behalf of the Council, to follow this position, perhaps in you by pointing out some reasons. </SEG> 
<SEG id="805"> But it is mainly by the strength of its content that the Charter, as I am, will cut. </SEG> 
<SEG id="806"> Its side, the European Union has been able to complain of what it considers to be the right, as the absence of the right to a minimum income by example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="807"> The fact remains that several, and in particular of Members of the European Parliament, have proposed that a reference to the Charter of fundamental rights is in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which makes reference to the European Convention on human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="808"> Our Group has approved the Charter, with the exception of the British. </SEG> 
<SEG id="809"> As the European popular Party, we are unanimously favourable to the inclusion of as quickly as possible of the Charter of fundamental rights in the Treaty, so that she have force of law to the citizens of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="810"> They have shown that they could work on questions of a new and which, in one of the Intergovernmental Conference, because it gives to these jobs an open and democratic, enabling citizens to fully exercise their right of inspection and participate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="811"> The right to health, social, housing or minimum income are non-existent or only to the agenda of the solidarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="812"> Fourthly, and this is particularly significant to me, the Charter is based on the principle of the civil and political rights, on the one hand, and social rights, on the other hand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="813"> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Commissioner, dear colleagues, I believe that this Charter is quite simply the States of the Union and of our Member States to multiply the texts empty, the declarations of intent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="814"> The representative of the Commission in the Convention of the Turin document a lawful. </SEG> 
<SEG id="815"> At the time, the hour of the Europe of rights is Finally the concept in the European Union is a comparatively new concept. </SEG> 
<SEG id="816"> The Charter is in fact as a value. </SEG> 
<SEG id="817"> I note also with a great that a representative of the Group to which I belong in the Finnish Parliament, Mr Gunnar Gunnar, has a very important role at the time of the Constitution of this Charter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="818"> As I said yesterday evening - I repeat today, there are too many shortcomings in the field, everywhere in the Union, and, sometimes, by our desire to the judicial and police cooperation, we ensure that the importance of innocent people do not become victims of passive, the war against crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="819"> Madam President, the draft resolution of the European Parliament on the Charter of fundamental rights is based on the side of the work of the House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="820"> The Italian Constitution provides, for example, the limit of good; the Convention provides for the limit of the rights of people, of public order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="821"> Mr President, today, at the time of the vote that will take place at noon, we will put an end to a process that began in 1984, when the European Parliament has approved the draft of the Treaty on European Union, where appeared the request for a statement of rights, a process that we have pursued in 1989 with the resolution of Mr de Gucht. </SEG> 
<SEG id="822"> The Charter will produce effects it will produce, that it wants or not in the Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="823"> It is to be welcomed and not to be afraid of, as seems to think. </SEG> 
<SEG id="824"> It seems to me that all the fights for the social classes that takes were one and we have learnt nothing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="825"> The Charter fills a gap in the right to this, it reinforces the protection of people against the attacks of which they could be the subject of the part of the police, who are fighting fraud and to those overseeing the competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="826"> I do not understand those who oppose the Charter under the pretext that it does not contain everything that they would like to see included. </SEG> 
<SEG id="827"> Mr President, I shall continue in the same meaning that Mr Gahrton. </SEG> 
<SEG id="828"> I would like to make a second comment about the rights of third country nationals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="829"> Just as the Court of human rights, the Council of Europe also has a solid experience in this regard such forms of control and we can take as a basis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="830"> In view of the text of the Charter that we are going to approve - to a large majority, I hope - today, it is obvious that we shall reach a protection of fundamental rights more important and more up to date, that would have allowed the European Convention of human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="831"> This is why it is necessary to achieve further steps forward. </SEG> 
<SEG id="832"> This point is very important if we want to win the support of the population in the respect of the Charter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="833"> After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of fundamental rights will be testing for this report and, as far as my personal means, intellectuals and will be that will allow me, I will make a right by right, country by country for the respect of the Charter in the fifteen countries of the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="834"> Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would first of all like to join the comments of Mr Moscovici, and salute the essential contribution that the Members of the European Parliament have brought the debate, to the Convention, in particular the role that Mr Méndez de Vigo has the Presidium of the Convention for the Charter of fundamental rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="835"> I shall take that some of the main points of this debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="836"> The Convention has chosen for the basic rights of the instruments of the Council of Europe, and the constitutions of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="837"> The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports: </SEG> 
<SEG id="838"> In the current State of things, it is also our Parliament to tell the Turkish people that there are now three conditions to her. </SEG> 
<SEG id="839"> In addition, it would not have been possible to secure conditions only by a decision of the European Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="840"> This is why I have taken note of the suggestions put forward by Mr Morillon on the conditions for membership of Turkey and they deserve the greatest interest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="841"> I am happy to be able to say that, in the meantime, the Turkish government has accepted this approach as the basis of future cooperation, which we hope to succeed in our aims, that is to say of help, by our policy, the forces in Turkey, to give a new boost to the process of reform and, in view of the membership of the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="842"> For me, the essential element is that Helsinki in Turkey, in the Turkish public opinion, a debate on the conditions of membership of Turkey to the EU and that this debate supports and promotes the forces of the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="843"> This text is submitted to you. </SEG> 
<SEG id="844"> What they intend to do now, it is to give a reference in the framework of a future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="845"> I do not know how the vote but I would urge Turkey to deal with this issue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="846"> The European Parliament will play its role in the promotion of relations with the political parties, the NGOs and the press, as well as in the development of its complex and sometimes tense relationship with the national Assembly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="847"> Mr Morillon, your report is, in my view, has made. </SEG> 
<SEG id="848"> On the occasion of your visit to Turkey in March last year, just as today, you have at least to the problem of the Kurdish population. </SEG> 
<SEG id="849"> It was at the time a great and a large enough to consider that the Europeans are going to bring the Turks, I quote: "to a radical change of their habits and their". </SEG> 
<SEG id="850"> Mr President, dear colleagues, the report which is, in serious concerns. </SEG> 
<SEG id="851"> Recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on constitutional Affairs, on the approval of the draft Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union (the / 1 / 00 / 1 / 2000 - 2000 / 2000 (AVC)) </SEG> 
<SEG id="852"> Be that as it may, we shall, the next time we discuss computer power, we realize that it is a broader and therefore more to respect the human person. </SEG> 
<SEG id="853"> Duff / Voggenhuber (A5-0325 / 2000) </SEG> 
<SEG id="854"> Only quote: </SEG> 
<SEG id="855"> The rights contained in the Charter are registered in the national constitutions and by national parliaments closer to the people and their cultures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="856"> For example, Article 19-1, which mentions that: "the collective expulsions are prohibited," do not that this ban can be suspended in the event of war or serious disturbances in the public order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="857"> We give a brief explanation of these three objections in the agenda. </SEG> 
<SEG id="858"> The right to a government of arbitrarily its Constitution is the definition of a dictatorship. </SEG> 
<SEG id="859"> But, I repeat, we have every reason to be proud of the conditions in which we have taken this important step for Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="860"> A democracy that of rights, but no duties, becoming a habit, many. </SEG> 
<SEG id="861"> It is our priority for the assertion of fundamental rights is in political choices. </SEG> 
<SEG id="862"> As the method of the Convention is and to establish a basic text, seeking a broad compromise, nothing justifies the they deprive the European Parliament, representing the people, of the possibility of amending, to enrich the text. </SEG> 
<SEG id="863"> This Charter must be improved and our Parliament should propose a strategy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="864"> Then, it should not be adopted and on the occasion of the meeting of the European Council in Nice: this Summit rather should undertake a debate on this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="865"> Fortunately, the prevailing tendency of national governments seems corner of good sense, that is to say that, from a purely political and not binding. </SEG> 
<SEG id="866"> In both "," by the Cologne Summit, it was proclaimed 'Convention', a statement that it 1793 and the promise of the French implemented by another Convention. </SEG> 
<SEG id="867"> In contrast, the method which has been used, the ambiguity that were raised and the ambiguity surrounding the nature of this text a rather on the new that are to be in the process of European integration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="868"> Fortunately, the European Parliament has again in this area as a result of the application, pending the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but it is the means to make use of it in the wrong direction, in slowing down the good. </SEG> 
<SEG id="869"> As to the way to proceed, the differing views. </SEG> 
<SEG id="870"> In fact, it was so there and, after that it is somewhat limited, this right to present a return in force. </SEG> 
<SEG id="871"> The last thing we want is that the single market to allow the perpetrators of concealed by a door. </SEG> 
<SEG id="872"> We also support the future creation of a Convention of facilitating the fight against organized crime and money laundering, as well as the different measures available to these ends. </SEG> 
<SEG id="873"> In fact, they create a provisional one of judges or policemen who exercise in our fifteen Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="874"> Mr President, as a Member of the EU-Turkey joint parliamentary Committee, I am in charge, of the question of the prospect of membership of Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="875"> Turkey's position on the Cypriot question is also unacceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="876"> We agree with the criticism of the rapporteur, who feel that it lacks, at the present time, an effective evaluation of the results of the activity of the EIB, and that it is also from the point of view of the right of public scrutiny and democratic control of the activity of the Bank. </SEG> 
<SEG id="877"> Turkey, in spite of all its difference, reality in the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="878"> The membership of Turkey to the European Union has become a matter of more than ever in the order of the day. </SEG> 
<SEG id="879"> Mr Morillon declares that Turkey should endeavour not to see the European Union as an exclusive club ', which would exclude, she, Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="880"> Turkey, when it will learn to live with its past, as Germany has learned to live with the appropriate, and it also, we have chosen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="881"> The authorities in Ankara will have understood that the status quo is unacceptable for Europe and for the rest of the world, for the structural funds to be achieved: the matter and a fair, lasting and comply with international law will tomorrow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="882"> To tell the truth, therefore, why all this remain missing from the report of the Commission? </SEG> 
<SEG id="883"> It is in this framework that we shall pursue our action to promote the rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="884"> If you are going to deal with the issue in connection with the negotiations in the EU - I would ask you to pay attention to my comments: to treat the issue in connection with the EU, the project which we have today. it is as simple as that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="885"> It is also the reason for our insistence that a report is the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, so that in Marseilles, rightly, we are in a position to stop the orientations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="886"> However, we have managed to maintain the dialogue and on sometimes sensitive subjects: terrorism, terrorism, migration, the rights of man, for example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="887"> It is that the Council, in particular since 1995, to endow the more important means, to the extent of the challenges of the partnership. </SEG> 
<SEG id="888"> It is in fact - and I would also like to say this as someone who comes from Central Europe - an extremely important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="889"> Mr President, as you know, there is a saying in English that said that when a star not at a Summit, it looks like Hamlet without first. </SEG> 
<SEG id="890"> We want to see, the policies and on the problems relating to the single market and to reach an agreement in order to introduce the cumulative origin, agreements trade for all the partners involved in this way and adopting the Protocol in the matter of rules of origin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="891"> We note with great satisfaction that the Commission has the intention to give a new boost to the Barcelona process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="892"> I have these aspects because it is there that it should seek the rhythm of the revival of the process and that it is necessary to add to all this the enrichment of the political agenda of the Barcelona process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="893"> Then, it is necessary that our priority is to guarantee the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we must all possible efforts on behalf of this cooperation and so that funds be effectively implemented, in accordance with the - Let us say - of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="894"> This is important and concrete questions that I would like to ask, and I thank Mr Brok have allowed this debate just before that the Presidency and the Commission to be able to discuss these matters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="895"> The world is moving in the direction of a purely. in such a context, it is necessary to organize itself in large blocks acting as actors in the great overview of global competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="896"> It is that the countries have only a quarter of the appropriations program expired in 1999 and which the allocation of EUR 4.7 billion euros. </SEG> 
<SEG id="897"> In this sense, the proposal for a new boost to the part of the Commission is positive and we are completely in agreement with the two priorities that Mr Patten has in its interventions and in front of this Assembly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="898"> This is a warning to the European Union to play a much more active in the region, historically and culturally, has contributed to the wealth and to the size of our continent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="899"> But much more serious still, at the moment in this we sometimes very divergent points of view, still more of Palestinians are. </SEG> 
<SEG id="900"> Assistance to the reconstruction </SEG> 
<SEG id="901"> If we do not, however, find the means, in December, to implement this regulation, that is to say that the debate we are having today is an empty shell. </SEG> 
<SEG id="902"> This is often too bureaucratic and passes through the procedures are too complicated, but we should and do not want to turn a blind eye, and I hope that the Member States do not, on the role that these last in this respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="903"> The media in this region have often been representatives of the tragedy that it has undergone; they must be able to be free to work in accordance with the rules in force in our democracies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="904"> But I am also happy because I believe that the European Parliament has, to a continuous pressure, to bring a happy outcome to a situation which was not particularly at hand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="905"> I repeat: it is actually to avoid money are superfluous. </SEG> 
<SEG id="906"> However, we must not focus solely on Kosovo. </SEG> 
<SEG id="907"> I regret that a series of programmes have been placed in the reserve, the performance reserve of behaviour. </SEG> 
<SEG id="908"> In it, he has recognised the quality of potential candidates for membership in the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="909"> I recall the main cards programme: the strengthening of the sense of democracy and the State of law, the economic development and reconstruction, the cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="910"> The European Union was right to react positively to the accession is in power. </SEG> 
<SEG id="911"> A first review has taken place on 6 November. </SEG> 
<SEG id="912"> As the European Parliament, in its resolution of 16 March 2000, that they initiatives does the Council intend to take to play a more active role in order to ensure the full and entire application of the UN peace plan? </SEG> 
<SEG id="913"> How can this revival without regulation of this conflict? </SEG> 
<SEG id="914"> I can simply say that France and Germany -, I speak not as President of the Council - have these questions in the course of a Summit, and, last week, and it was to constitute a working Group in order to remedy the problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="915"> At the same time, the European Union continues to give assistance to these two important countries, by means of its programmes, notably TACIS. </SEG> 
<SEG id="916"> The honourable Member's question on to the Presidency the opportunity to dispel certain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="917"> And I would add: it is about in particular, in these two texts, of strengthening the framework for fighting against the systems of smugglers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="918"> In the report that the Council of Ministers I adopted on 21 September as programme of reform, in part, several projects: did in the civil code of the measures of the real equality of men and women in the areas: better to fight against the family; better condemn these acts of violence, by the creation of guaranteeing the services and the possibility of a crime of honour. </SEG> 
<SEG id="919"> Therefore, the Presidency does not bring on this point. </SEG> 
<SEG id="920"> Next week, there will be a meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference, to my invitation, in France, that is to say with the applicant countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="921"> Do you think that the model of the "-" - namely the majority - will be in the future as a means of taking in ignoring the European institutions and to a new institution, or a new Group, to be able to bypass the rule of unanimity in the Council? </SEG> 
<SEG id="922"> The Council has not seized this letter but the Presidency has, of course, reply to Mr Cem. the terms of this Parliament were in all the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="923"> What it Mr President-in-Office see the position of Mr Cem - Mr Moscovici has not responded to it - which claims that it is not possible to take account of the Cypriot question, if one wants to promote the partnership between Turkey and the European Union? </SEG> 
<SEG id="924"> It is necessary to know that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than a single agreement and, as he knows, if we had not managed to such an agreement, and all that that entails, it would have to hide a dangerous of relations between the European Union and Morocco. </SEG> 
<SEG id="925"> And it is for this reason that I would like to show my scepticism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="926"> With regard to the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that this principle should enable the reinforcement of the cooperation of the Member States, but also to the protection of the rights of the people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="927"> Questions must be taken by other committees. </SEG> 
<SEG id="928"> In addition, the Commission, in the communication that it has adopted on 4 October 2000 on the supply of the European Union, indicates that it intends, at the European Council, a plan and diversification of energy sources which should contribute to strengthening the effectiveness, particularly in and transport. </SEG> 
<SEG id="929"> In this spirit, we have launched, during the vote on the resolution on the embargo, in the framework of the third Commission of the general Assembly of the United Nations on 9 November last, an appeal to the Cuban authorities so that they cooperate fully with the international organisations which the rights of man. </SEG> 
<SEG id="930"> It is therefore up to the NATO to take the measures that it will be necessary to that of such products cannot be repeated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="931"> (the sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.) </SEG> 
<SEG id="932"> When one speaks of money, those who give money really have the privilege to define clearly the political objectives, and it is this that the Commissioner has always done. </SEG> 
<SEG id="933"> This would, in principle, can open a new perspective for the whole of the policy that we are pursuing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="934"> If we consider the region as a region of political antagonism in power, we shall off course. </SEG> 
<SEG id="935"> Parliament must be consulted and are; this is the second request, which we should all support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="936"> The Heads of government have also confirmed the determination of the Union to support this process by means of a technical assistance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="937"> It is Parliament that has supported the Commission's proposal to create the European Agency for reconstruction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="938"> As you know, the Assembly, we do not believe that it is necessary to see a reference to this subject in the regulation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="939"> The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. </SEG> 
<SEG id="940"> The meeting agreed to spread and update the framework of cooperation, which constitutes the work programme for the next ten years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="941"> I think that this reminds us, in Europe, the important role that we play in Asia and this, not only in the area of the economy and trade, that it is necessary to point out that one of the reasons the Asia is due to the fact that we have held our promise to keep our open giants in the course of two years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="942"> I believe that it was a good policy, but we still have a few problems to be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="943"> We know that the Commission considers democracy with the greatest, and we support it in this attitude. </SEG> 
<SEG id="944"> It is necessary to improve the mechanisms at the level of the transposition of Community law in order to increase the legal and to overcome the current slowness. </SEG> 
<SEG id="945"> It should therefore encourage the creation of new organisations, while there is a Community, as this is the case in the Western Pacific and the South. </SEG> 
<SEG id="946"> This will be vital for the Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="947"> I believe that the future of the fishing in international waters of these organisations and the whole of the efforts of the Commission, Mr Commissioner, few things for the position of the United Nations, both in the Convention and in that of the United States, which has been mentioned here, our presence in these organisations in favour of the responsible must be active. </SEG> 
<SEG id="948"> This is why I think that the Commission can play a role of first on the spot and encouraging it to cooperate with it and to propose a resolution in which we can all join. </SEG> 
<SEG id="949"> Moreover, the Commission must take a most urgent tasks in the area which must be carried out in the framework of the RFOs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="950"> Mr President, I meet the same problem that Mr Nicholson, but in a form still more ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="951"> Mr President, Commissioner, my dear colleagues, the President of the Committee on agriculture and rural development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="952"> Sometimes, we succeed we wonder if the crisis of the market is, to a certain extent, the result of the action of the control of business, which is to ensure the democratic control of the sector in terms of their interests. </SEG> 
<SEG id="953"> The help of the EU proposed by Mr Garot in his report is, in my view, contrary to the good sense in these years of agenda 2000, to Central and Eastern Europe and the reform of the agricultural policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="954"> I think that it is quite remarkable that the rapporteur has shown here what can be done with a bit of management when one speaks a defined project, which is clearly stated in the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="955"> On the one hand, the biggest producers or those that are concerned with the companies downstream this device, the problems which they have to Bank cash. </SEG> 
<SEG id="956"> Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say first of all that, on the background, and in consideration of the Austrian agriculture, I welcome the proposal of the Commission for a Fund regulation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="957"> I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="958"> I have understood that they want a common organisation of the market in the area of the intensive and of the agricultural policy, where it is linked to the territory, where it is a matter of production in the territory. </SEG> 
<SEG id="959"> It is already a COM in beef and pork, and we must not make the mistake of calling into question then that, basically, it works well. </SEG> 
<SEG id="960"> According to the Commission, it is fair to submit a discipline that the farmers who participate, because these receive some changes to a certain guarantee of income, whereas those countries which do not do this guarantee. </SEG> 
<SEG id="961"> (the sitting is closed 11.10 p.m.) </SEG> 
<SEG id="962"> The resources from the tax on the value of 36% and 15%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="963"> Another element of the reform is also a recognised by the Court, and it is a matter of the increased importance to agree to the evaluation of the results and also in the framework of a distribution of resources which priorities and objectives clearly define and measurable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="964"> It is a good thing, and I would like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, so that the Members of the Court of Auditors and the services of the Court of Auditors, to support the reform of the Commission with this report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="965"> In this respect, it is also of circumstances that I wish to inform you that, for the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we have proposed to amend the Treaty to be able to create a European public Prosecutor to pursue fraud affecting the financial interests of the Community. I really hope that this proposal will not simply at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice or under the carpet, but that they will deal with the matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="966"> The reality in the annual report is rather. </SEG> 
<SEG id="967"> The number of errors is too to be able to give such a guarantee. </SEG> 
<SEG id="968"> The amount of EUR 240 million is too low. </SEG> 
<SEG id="969"> I would also that the report of the Court of Auditors was that it had some clear recommendations - for example, one or two recommendations by chapter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="970"> A Convention on the protection of the financial interests of the EU was adopted in 1995. </SEG> 
<SEG id="971"> The Commission and the Member States should in this direction and to exploit its conclusions in order to strengthen the effectiveness of their management of EU finances. </SEG> 
<SEG id="972"> I know that this report and the work that Parliament is on the point of Parliament within the framework of the procedure will contribute to greater vigilance with regard to the Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="973"> At this point, I would like to make, Madam President, and expect that a Member of the Council to come here. </SEG> 
<SEG id="974"> As in other years, the Court is not identify with the breaches. </SEG> 
<SEG id="975"> Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union approach and the report of the Court of Auditors shows clearly that there is still some work to achieve, even in the candidate countries for membership. </SEG> 
<SEG id="976"> Mr President, my dear colleagues, we have concluded an agreement with the Court of Auditors, which was to be able to get to the advance information on the report of the Court and to keep the silence in this regard. </SEG> 
<SEG id="977"> I would also like to "to" the Council and ask him why the situation does not progress regarding Article 24 of the financial regulation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="978"> Perhaps a few good sense to solve the problem and to give George Bush the place it deserves in history - the dustbin! </SEG> 
<SEG id="979"> We do not have to look for scapegoats, not more in our institutions and in our States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="980"> First of all, concerning the procedure of the annual report to the Parliament and to the Committee on budgetary control, I am delighted to hear that the estimates that the situation is this year is more than the previous years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="981"> In any case, we have the possibility of all this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="982"> When the audit of the justified, we mention all this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="983"> Ladies and gentlemen, as you have found, the last part of the intervention of the President of the Court of Auditors has been the victim of an unfortunate, which is between his speech and this Assembly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="984"> Some amendments, such as amendments Nos 1 and 18, related to issues which basically the United Kingdom and it must be said that all the groups in the United Kingdom, that they are Socialists, Greens, Mexico or with a large and they have been approved by the Committee on the environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="985"> Mr President, in March of this year, we have voted against the directive on the funicular railways for the transport of passengers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="986"> We feel that, in this case, the obligations which the causes of the law on the products should not burden the trade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="987"> We have heard the justification of these and the resumption of industrial arguments in Committee. </SEG> 
<SEG id="988"> From the moment that the seller is in a position to inform, every time the nature of the nature of the goods and as for information, that should be enough. </SEG> 
<SEG id="989"> Finally, I have one small thing to ask the European Commission concerning Article 4 relating to standards and to the question of whether these standards must be published. </SEG> 
<SEG id="990"> I am pleased that the exceptions are made for charity shops and non-profit organisations, as well as for second-hand goods sold on or within the framework of sales of individuals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="991"> The reliability of the products and represent a gain for the European label in a difficult and crucial moment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="992"> So we call on the Commission to present a proposal in the near future on the security services, they do not see why we should and would regulate here and now the aspects relating to the services, rather than waiting for the proposal of the Commission, because they can see that the demarcation of the different arise and that will increase over time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="993"> Just a few words about the main aspects of this proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="994"> We offer to present the possibility of opening the system to third countries, in particular the applicant countries: simplification of the procedures relating to the emergency measures at Community level to be able to provide a rapid action on the Council of a Committee. </SEG> 
<SEG id="995"> This new requirement does not imply any additional important requirement in the case of this kind of shops. </SEG> 
<SEG id="996"> To replace the word "in 'by the word", "as proposed in amendment no 11, more confusion than, given that the directive does not offer any definition of the word" ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="997"> Although the Commission is in favour of a swift implementation of the network, must be between Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="998"> Such can still use of evidence but cannot be considered to be considered. </SEG> 
<SEG id="999"> Having explained why the Commission cannot accept amendments 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36 and, in part, amendment no 7, the second part of amendment no 9 and the first part of amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission is able to accept amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31, 35 and, in part, amendment no 7, the first part of amendment no 9 and the second part of amendments Nos 27 and 34, given that these amendments constitute an improvement and clarification of the proposal of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1000"> Of course, Mr Barón Crespo, an Italian may be part of the Socialist Group. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1001"> In my view, there is no contradiction between amendment no 12 and amendment no 37. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1002"> With regard to the agenda, I leave the care, and I say that I am against, in any case, on each of the three amendments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1003"> The countries outside the EU, it is true, to the problems of economic development. there is a constant tension between the regions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1004"> With regard to the respect for the dignity of immigrants, in the spirit of a European policy in the matter of immigration, Besides the legal instruments aimed to guarantee them a treatment, it would be necessary to create the instruments of support for all those young people who, having a cycle, or, in the European countries, to return to their country of origin to start an occupation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1005"> I would like to put in a factor, which I consider is most important to tackle this problem, and I want to say in the area of work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1006"> In late, the Commission has presented a programme concerning issues of equality between men and women (2001-2005), which many of the programmes, in particular the fourth programme of action, which at the end of this year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1007"> Despite these reservations, I have voted for this report, primarily because it has been taking account of several of the amendments of my parliamentary Group, and then, because this report claims on the situation of women on the national work as well as on the workers in the systems of social security, two problems for which we have need of the relevant statistics, by gender. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1008"> My Party to serious and about the rules of the sale of consumer products by means of the Community, just as it sets about the concept of mutual recognition of standards. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1009"> This misunderstanding is currently, and not to give the guarantee not to be excluded from the field of application of the area of application of the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1010"> Finally, amendment no 15 to leave in the hands of the Commission for the linguistic diversity of the Agency, which we consider very worrying. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1011"> The simplification of the process of decision-making, the creation of centres (and not only in Pristina, what the Yugoslavia) and the management of the dual structure between the Council and the Commission can consider positive actions to fight against the important bureaucratic of the European Agency for reconstruction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1012"> We will vote against the proposal of the Commission as well as against the report from Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1013"> An adaptation of the Community in this area can therefore be regarded as justified. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1014"> Moreover, the funds by the Member States will make it possible to grant State aid more or less. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1015"> Despite its shortcomings, the Morillon report obviously goes further than the Commission's proposal relating to the partnership between the European Union and Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1016"> We have voted against. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1017"> Like the rapporteur, we must admit that Turkey has on certain plans and that of the national minority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1018"> In 1987, our Assembly is on the way to the recognition, and the adoption of this amendment shows the Parliament on this debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1019"> The Union must make further proposals and policies of the membership of Turkey as an indispensable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1020"> Such are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1021"> For several years, as a Member of the delegation for relations with Canada, I was able to observe the functioning of one of these organizations, the organization of the north-west Atlantic), to which the States of this region, which Canada, so that all those who use this and differences, including France, Spain and other countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1022"> It will be that when its own fleet, flying a European flag, will respect its policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1023"> The important is therefore not satisfy the will of the Commission in weakening the position of Europe, which would be completely contrary to a proper application of the principle of subsidiarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1024"> Finally, after a year, we reached an outcome that it is worth the trouble. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1025"> Thus, this proposal, which aims to replace three directives relating to the incineration of waste, has the objective of improving the quality of the air, water, soil, the health of people, by reducing the emissions of polluting substances and, in particular, of dioxins and furanes trucks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1026"> But I think that it is also necessary to emphasise - and it is a novelty - it is not only the transmission of these substances in the air; it also concerns the mission in the water and the soil. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1027"> The proposal is in the course of the year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1028"> The introduction of stricter limits in the matter of nitrogen oxides for new installations such as the same to cement is at the same time a and an incentive for the reduction of emissions, even if the standards do not the best available techniques. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1029"> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, forgive me - in particular Mr Blokland - for a few Minutes late. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1030"> In conclusion, this directive is a major contribution to the effects on the environment and the risks that they represent to human health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1031"> The European Parliament has pride, in the name of the refusal of the citizens and of the fight against the ambiguity, and in respect of everyone, to give a strong impetus to the setting up of a device which do exist the essential principle of solidarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1032"> They note however large differences from one country to another; we lack of statistical data and values that would allow for a reliable State of the situation, in which countries the systems are more competitive, and how, which the Committee on economic and monetary Affairs that is precisely the reason why my opinion, which was at the request of the Committee on economic and monetary Affairs, emphasises that it is necessary, before a few rules to value of that it is, in the matter of insurance, which the Commission to publish a Green Paper in all these dispersÃ ', which have been treated, so that the relevant information. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1033"> Until now, they were the subject of a taboo. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1034"> The risk that citizens in less good health and that of persons can have full access to an assurance in view of the risk to which they feel is unacceptable for the development of our society. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1035"> The other point of view, illustrated by the comments by the rapporteur and a number of colleagues, is to promote the regulations and codes of conduct for dialogue, between a good supply of guaranteeing the provision of a good practices and to counter the risk of discriminatory practices and a series of risks and customers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1036"> It seems to me that this is not at all the money that determines the turn of transit in a queue waiting. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1037"> The new proposal of the Committee on employment and social Affairs, which consists in raising a stock in the form of a Green Paper, then, whether we need a directive or a recommendation, we fair. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1038"> A debate is currently under way in the Netherlands concerning structural changes in the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1039"> On this basis, it is up to the Commission to take an initiative and concrete points will use of guidelines for the health systems of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1040"> It is the problem of a 'one size fits all' solution to the problem of insurance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1041"> It is for that that I think that we need to focus on the content of the report by Mr Rocard - that we -, which asks the Commission for the provision of a service, the Constitution of a Green Paper, which will enable us to know the current State of insurance in the Member States and also of the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1042"> The two systems are based on an understanding of the State, the business and the private sector. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1043"> The European Union has a certain rules in the area of pensions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1044"> Mr President, I want to thank and congratulate Mr Rocard for his report and to congratulate Mr Marinho for the opinion of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1045"> This could be the basis of a communication from the Commission to the Council and to Parliament containing initiatives or measures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1046"> As for the amendments of the Committee on Budgets, I can say with satisfaction that they have all been accepted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1047"> We have our support to the characteristics of the programme, as the multidimensional approach, measures in the field of health, education, housing, and with other policies, so that the participation of non-governmental organisations, but also of people who are of social exclusion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1048"> This means that we must take advantage of the rising to return to a situation of balance or surplus. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1049"> I would remind you in this respect that the Council and the Commission that the evaluation of programmes of ageing precisely from this aspect of long term of public finances relating to the ageing of the population. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1050"> One of the characteristics of the programme of the Netherlands is attention - as I have said before - to the impact of the ageing of the population on the public in the coming years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1051"> Consequently, in the case of Germany, the budget for the year 2000 for a surplus of 1.5% of the gross domestic product. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1052"> If we add to this the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, we have an impact in terms of inflation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1053"> On the other hand, they aim to make compatible a public system of sharing with capitalization and, of course, they are also compatible with support for the creation of funds likely to bring fiscal advantages in the long term and to help to deal with the problem of ageing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1054"> It is thus the third principle that guides us: the precautionary principle. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1055"> It must be pointed out that a number of proposals are currently under discussion, which will help to strengthen the effectiveness and the relevance of the Community and, therefore, I hope, the confidence of consumers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1056"> However, this relatively low incidence not justify any here. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1057"> Frankly, I was disappointed that the Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, not to mention the role played by the latter, in his speech yesterday. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1058"> It is obviously necessary to determine the reasons for the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1059"> The food and veterinary office of the Commission accords the highest priority to the Member States in connection with the measures of protection against BSE. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1060"> With regard to the security of animal meal, Let me remind you that there is a wide range of aiming to ensure that that does not present any risk of transmission of BSE. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1061"> Oh yes, too difficult to believe that it can be, it has taken four years to get a measure that I regard as fundamental to the protection of public health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1062"> Mr President of the Council, I urge the Council to make known its position on the last regulation is. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1063"> In the current situation, the only way to stop the cycle of transmission of BSE is of a total ban on the use of animal meal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1064"> In this respect, I would like to point out that the Group to which I belong to an amendment which I hope will be adopted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1065"> The policies have to change it in order that the true representatives of this crisis are and that allow a first step towards the end of this dramatic crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1066"> It would therefore be again. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1067"> The labelling of beef and veal, which has been decided, which is a minimum and which is in force for two and a half months, does not make it possible to trace the origin of the animals properly and we have banned well late at risk. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1068"> It is that public opinion is entirely on the characteristics of the test of which I speak. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1069"> To the President, Mr President of the Council, you have done nothing, or almost, as your fellow have done nothing about Chernobyl, nothing about the AIDS epidemic in blood, with the same reason: do not panic public opinion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1070"> The subject of France will cause a massive increase in demand, but the offer is not unlimited and extraordinarily heavy pressure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1071"> Consumers have lost confidence, and to combat this phenomenon, it is necessary to the BSE tests on cattle and sheep. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1072"> It seems to me more important to go in the direction of the proposal of the Commission, that is to say, to see to it that the more security. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1073"> For the rest, I am completely in agreement - for once - with what my colleagues, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and, have said. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1074"> Will, Members of the Council and of the Commission, you have a broad basis to take a strong policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1075"> It is necessary to regulate the problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1076"> Madam President, Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I am pleased to hear here, within this, that it is necessary at all costs to change the CAP. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1077"> We had, here, with Jimmy Goldsmith, in its time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1078"> Food must be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1079"> I find exemplary that France will be to take this step. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1080"> But we do not! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1081"> I am therefore surprised to note that bodies are still or in these conditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1082"> The just has to be issued in the United Kingdom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1083"> I proposed to the Commission to apply the precautionary principle in relation to the French. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1084"> It is necessary to know today, since we are still in the uncertainty, which are the scientific, what are the measures to take. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1085"> Moreover, I have, of course, all these proposals, I am not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1086"> If the citizens to tell me that the legislation has not been properly or fully applied, we shall then consider the matter, but not for scientific motives. it will do because the legislation will not be respected in the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1087"> The best way of us not to hear, it is not we call. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1088"> The Commission considers that the first agreements currently under negotiation, with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco plays an important role in the Treaties and the coordination of these policies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1089"> What proposals the Commission make in the matter on the basis of Article 31 of the Union? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1090"> (the President cut off the speaker) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1091"> During this period, the objective of reducing the public deficit in order to obtain a monetary policy more, rates of less and greater growth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1092"> I always say that the euro will not be introduced on 1 January 2002, but that it is in our pocket; we have with Let us have, but we have in our pocket. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1093"> The fixed in the directive 92 / 72 in the capital, but it should be noted that no action has been taken in the Middle of the summer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1094"> Subject: State in the audiovisual sector during a meeting of the cultural industries, a representative of the management of the European Commission that the obligations of investment constituted State the fact that these investments were made mandatory by the legislator. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1095"> It must be respected and protected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1096"> However, this does not, of course, for this new growth is and can be accompanied, as we have seen in the United States for ten years, of persistent exclusion, of poverty, of urban. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1097"> The governments of the Member States have to accept this definition, which is a little too simple and much too vague. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1098"> And in the difficult climate that some results, more and more people are not more, are and excluded. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1099"> Mr President, we often hear in this House, such a refrain, the excitement of the European social model, the social market economy, which opposes with pride - as many believe - in the wild, the United States of America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1100"> (problem) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1101"> It is a figure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1102"> Moreover, these are all the policies which need to be involved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1103"> I support the better known to the causes of poverty, I support the actions against exclusion as a result of mergers, industrial change, desertification, and, with the help of innovative and coasts, involving the social partners, local and national administrations, so that the joint action of citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1104"> We have a debate on the role of the use in the fight against social exclusion as well as on the role of social and structural reforms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1105"> It is a matter of a formal attributable to the fact that, in the Treaty, it is only made reference to social exclusion and poverty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1106"> I think that these proposals are a pragmatic to your request. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1107"> However, an approval of the global does not mean an approval of the proposal in the detail. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1108"> If we define a clear and binding for the Member States, the different systems to meet these requirements should have a longer period of put to the test. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1109"> The so far do not constitute the to solve this problem, but there is no doubt that they will be able to contribute in good part, to diversify the sources of energy and to reduce our dependency on oil, which, Moreover, do we not at all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1110"> I will come back here on three of our requirements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1111"> To define objectives can therefore only reinforce the confidence of the citizen in the policy of the energy to implement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1112"> I believe that a strong policy in so far is a symbol for the Europe of tomorrow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1113"> Finally, the countries have to show through these agreements that they contribute to the objectives of Kyoto. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1114"> It seems to me it of excluding any category of which can contribute to the total production of energy from waste - that this is for smaller-scale projects or within the framework of a global calculation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1115"> The formation of the bulk of mass by and in the production of wood is comparable to that of other biomasses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1116"> Finally, I can inform Mr Chichester that off my region, there is already a project is well advanced and that this has to come and I invite you to come to realize. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1117"> The debate on the renunciation of in the nuclear energy, in Sweden and Germany, for example, has shown that, without replacing conceivable respectful of the environment and competitive, the discussion turns out. it is. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1118"> This is why the Member States must impose binding targets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1119"> I am therefore optimistic about the future potential of the appropriate incentives that are put in place. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1120"> I believe that it is a tremendous courage to attribute to the renewable energy the place it deserves. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1121"> It is undoubtedly a very strong rise in the price of confronts us more brutally our towards the sources of energy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1122"> Consequently, we cannot accept amendment no 28. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1123"> However, in the Commission, bearing in mind that the terms used not prejudge its right of initiative and that they must be compatible with the single market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1124"> On 26 participants, the Commission for national reconciliation in mind that a single woman, whereas the countries account 25 000 widows. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1125"> Studies show that the presence of women in the ranks of the peacekeeping forces of the United Nations, even though in number, relations with the local populations and the general of these. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1126"> The report report deals with this subject in detail and contains many that we demand, as the Group of the European people 's Party and European Democrats in order to draw up an official document. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1127"> From a political point of view, I see in amendment 19 or of rather than a compromise in terms of content, which should in any case be unworthy of the issue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1128"> They have been kept. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1129"> Then a Portuguese example, where the doors of the doors are open to women that after the "April 1974. 'our Ambassador in Indonesia, the Western, has shown in West Timor that the role of women and to the problems and the suffering of a people, which has been only a long fight of 25 years for the people, can be received by all of the world and especially by the European Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1130"> Very few Member States have made to date. one tells me that there are two or three. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1131"> This is why it will also be necessary, in future, take account of this dimension of the policies of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1132"> Unfortunately, the report does not this notion, no more than it is to distinctions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1133"> Please convey our protest at the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1134"> They have different, which are indispensable to the manner in which the policy is based, in particular when it comes to manage crises. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1135"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1136"> I come now to the second point: if they intend to regulate the sector, it is of course a certain number of points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1137"> In the course of the last weeks, I have discovered a both on the part of the international banks that a certain number of organizations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1138"> The problem of waste are therefore in favour of the payment of a salary for women at home? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1139"> All those who work currently out a job in social conditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1140"> Moreover, this project has also allowed two to three families together to create a job of aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1141"> We were United in this first part-session in October, when we have learned, at the time of our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia, the courageous action of the Serbian people and, as you will remember, dear colleagues, we have asked the international sanctions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1142"> This fact, Europe has already shown its civilisation in the history of the world and a European policy towards the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1143"> There can be no doubt about the fact that the question of the status of Kosovo is a question. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1144"> In addition, we would like to have a chance to prove to the Europe that we are in a position to alone the cause of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia, while recognizing the principles. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1145"> I must say that I had - in hearing you - by a position Oh how difficult, at the same time by your. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1146"> This will be done in the next, Mr Watson. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1147"> Access to documents and information relating to the institutions enables citizens to put the bodies of the European Union in front of their responsibilities and stimulates greater effectiveness. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1148"> A third important amendment, in my view, is the one relating to the annual report which should in particular for documents to remain secret, or at least that remain secret. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1149"> Things are not clear on this point, and it is not impossible that can also remain in force more restrictive measures, and that is particularly on this point that we have tabled amendments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1150"> The Commission, for its part, is opposed to the idea that the documents relating to issues of foreign policy and security should be automatically and global, an exception to this rule, the right of inspection. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1151"> If we want the citizens of their rights, these places of information so well that take in some way by the hand of the citizens in the research of information and that their use of guides to the complex labyrinth of institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1152"> These are essential if we want to avoid that a transparency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1153"> It should be delighted that the Parliament together a broad majority in favour of greater transparency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1154"> Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1155"> Mr President, openness and transparency within the European Union does not in a positive light. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1156"> If that is the case, it would then be a bad calculation, what are the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizen that are at stake here. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1157"> The notion of documents on several of our present and we shall see to it that is as broad as possible to the greatest possible number of documents and for the various types of documents. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1158"> Mr President, we cannot know the position of the Commission in the matter of public access to documents in reading the Commission has that has been postponed, on 11 October, the officials of the Commission in order to explain the way in which they had to deal with the requests in this regard access to documents. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1159"> This point must be removed or at least by the obligation of taking account of the interests at stake. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1160"> The old models of international collaboration with all their old habits and diplomatic game where all happens in closed doors are more set in the type of cooperation that is instead of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1161"> We must not make between this and the role of Parliament, or with the interinstitutional agreements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1162"> I consider that a step forward has been made towards the possibility for the citizens to exercise their right to information and knowledge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1163"> It is, however, not only that I thank: Mrs Maij-Weggen, of the PPE-DE Group, and that by means of the Hughes procedure is the author of the report, also thanks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1164"> Transparency must become the mainstay of all the activity of the European Union, but the right of access to documents is not enough in itself to making a reality. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1165"> The European Parliament asks that the policy of security and the future integration into the structures of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1166"> During his speech before Parliament, on 3 October last, President Prodi referred to in the institutional triangle and that, in a system based on controls and, the operation of each institution contributed to the common interest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1167"> I must acknowledge that the great challenge of this regulation is to give a definition of documents. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1168"> I want to emphasise that the Commission might, when the time comes, almost all of the amendments, such as amendments Nos 9, 18 and 21 in part, and amendments Nos 23, 25, 28, 35, 38,,, 41.1, 42, 44, 47, 49 and 52. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1169"> So although I would vote in favour of the proposals made by the Commission, and for that it is indeed that the access of the list of amendments that the Commission can support and that the amendments that she does not want to support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1170"> Banks </SEG> 
<SEG id="1171"> Finally, and this is a more controversial subject, the Commission to make use of the procedure for the implementation of this legislation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1172"> These amendments replace different proposals, which will probably be rejected at the time of the vote and which will be replaced by new amendments from this agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1173"> Mr President, in the light of the excellent vote of support that has received this report, and given the response of the Commission this morning, it appears as evident - all the parties on which we have voted - on the basis of Article 69 (2), we should back to later the vote on the motion for a resolution, in order to enable us to start with the Commission and the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1174"> Mr President, I am sorry to have said that the PPE-DE Group had also that the vote tonight, but it is you, Mr coordinator, who came to tell me that you preferred that the matter be deferred until the second session of November, rather than to vote this evening. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1175"> The reason why I would suggest that the vote is - as Mr Goebbels has said - that it is a very important matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1176"> I do not know how the roll-call vote, but it is without doubt of hundreds of thousands of frank, or Belgian francs, of our budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1177"> I know that in France, the principle of the whole and that it does not seem to be the best way to combat this phenomenon. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1178"> From the beginning of the feeding of animals, not only that of cattle and sheep, but also that of pigs, fish; </SEG> 
<SEG id="1179"> That is not acceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1180"> It is those that consumers will be affected and that the regulation will hear the message that we wish to pass. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1181"> It is necessary to go further, as a matter of urgency, it is necessary to change the common agricultural policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1182"> The ban on the use of animal meal to feed is only the first step in this process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1183"> We deeply regret, however, that the amendments proposed by our Group were not adopted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1184"> I believe that it would be that the working hours of those who work in companies, is reduced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1185"> I will end by stressing once again on the fact that the opinion of the exploitation of the dangerous must not lead us to make the best of the production of such waste. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1186"> In fact, if the Commission, for example, less development, there would be less poor. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1187"> The report envisages an envelope of EUR 100 million over five years to reduce poverty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1188"> I support without reservation the proposal to implement a Luxembourg process in the area of social exclusion, including guidelines and national action plans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1189"> In fact, the report calls for the establishment of qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1190"> In submitting its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission the appeal launched by the Council "in June 2000" a "initiative of cooperation in this area. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1191"> Mr President, I abstained from voting for one reason: in my opinion, this report has not done, from the point of view that I and wished. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1192"> I wish that such a system is extended to all the cities of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1193"> Some of Parliament's proposals are not and cannot accept my membership of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1194"> We must also arrive in the future to make better known to the best practices. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1195"> The high wages mindful of the environment should be offered the possibility, on a, to contribute to a cleaner energy, while for the other, all remains as before. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1196"> The next item is the joint debate on the motions for resolutions: </SEG> 
<SEG id="1197"> These three reasons are the following: Firstly, because it moves in the direction of the process of strengthening democracy and in that of the strengthening of the requirement of respect for human rights, especially with regard to the populations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1198"> Mr President, in this debate, we wish to express, as well we who have, for the solidarity and support of this Parliament of Central, at a time when we are fighting to be supported in the framework of relations of the European Union with the countries of Latin America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1199"> I do not call that could express our friend and dear friend, the President of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, Mr Seguro, with regard to the issue of human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1200"> Finally, in its dialogue with the authorities of Central, the Commission stresses the importance that should be granted to the process of integration, of the consolidation and development of the region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1201"> To hold on to power it has not over the continuing debate on "the", causing a: hatred of the other, or, and yet they are numerous to live and work on the ground for many years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1202"> The introduction of a true that there are not able to do without the institution of a Commission on the crimes committed and the official commitment to uphold human rights and civil peace. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1203"> Some believe that the importance of the debate is relative when it comes to Africa, that these are complex, that he must leave from time to time, but I, I think that there is no compromise with the possible and the question which arises today for the ivory coast is the same as the one that we have, for example, where one knows today that there are people and that there is no system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1204"> I will end by the following: do not put in place, Mr President, because there are people who are suffering, who do not have access to knowledge, which does not have the knowledge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1205"> It would not be illogical that the European Union requires of new elections in which all the candidates this time could participate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1206"> In many parts of Africa, we are to ethnic and religious. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1207"> These must allow, in the national political parties which, at the time of the first, be only partially, the shortcomings of this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1208"> On the situation in Burma. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1209"> The authorities a great offensive against the peoples of the United Nations, and, as the rapporteur of the United Nations, there is no sign of dialogue between the sdpc and the NLD. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1210"> This is the reason why, we reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1211"> I hope that by giving an urgent and priority to this topic, the European Parliament sends a clear message to the Burmese people, meaning that its position is not there, that are aware of the fact that in Burma, things are, and that we are determined to try to change the course of events. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1212"> This has for a long time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1213"> In Asia, the danger exists that economic and political reforms are, that a society and a world without the political sector and strengthening of the State of law, although I am of the opinion that, in the end, the absence of the right of women to trade, subsidies and investments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1214"> Mr President, I join the previous speakers on a number of essential points, because many of the things that happen today are unacceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1215"> However, the publication of human rights watch, that Mr Swoboda, maintains that has recently made some efforts to improve its position from the point of view of human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1216"> These documents confidential documents we obtain a curious look on the wings of the policy followed by the authorities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1217"> The Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation can be achieved only by means of a dialogue between the military, the opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1218"> The Vietnamese pressures from the country so that it adopts a self-censorship. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1219"> The next item is the joint debate on the following: </SEG> 
<SEG id="1220"> We also ask the EU aid and assistance, not only in the south-west of England, but also to all the others. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1221"> I ask you all to support our resolution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1222"> It is imperative that the Union will be special interventions when disasters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1223"> The Commission has taken two initiatives in this direction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1224"> Mr President, an error of purely linguistic in one of the amendments in the common resolution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1225"> A postponement of the vote would be a continuation of the mission entrusted to the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1226"> (Parliament adopted the resolution) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1227"> The report is based on the observation according to which a proportion of more and more protection in Europe is covered by insurance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1228"> I am a bit of him now to compel the Commission to a motion for a resolution and ask him in a time to establish a Green Paper on the current State of voluntary insurance and health insurance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1229"> To the ageing of the population is very sensitive, it is essential that we improve the system of health care in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1230"> We can of course. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1231"> Mr President, there are arguments in favour of the procedure for the implementation of the re-examination of the funds. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1232"> With regard to the sense of urgency that Mrs Villiers has the feeling of the Commission in calling for a procedure for the adoption of these measures, we have to note that the rapporteur acknowledges that this new regulation will have taken on the practices which, unfortunately, alas, are the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1233"> We must also see to it that the decisions taken by an increase in own funds requirements, a second inconvenience for the banks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1234"> This being said, I believe, and I would like to stress, that are also satisfied with the approach to these regulations on the capital, which reinforce the themes at risk. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1235"> These are some ideas on the way in which we could reach a process, and effective in the framework of the current Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1236"> In fact, the time has come to admit that the institution of "" enough and that she has sufficiently proof of his to have its own budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1237"> The PPE-DE Group supports the opinion of the Committee on constitutional Affairs, to maintain that must be, and that the cost will be the better, particularly in the field of powers, by Article 3 of the 1994. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1238"> A mechanism that is, of course, subject to the rules, but to the citizens, it is good to know that one or one which fulfils this office can have access to documents which them, so that citizens, does not have access to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1239"> The report therefore to subject the recommendation by the Commission to enable the competitions by it to consult their copies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1240"> We believe that the institutions of the Community should take their recruitment procedures of staff, even in fact that all of the recruitment procedures, with a maximum of transparency, in order to avoid any suspicion, injustice or administrative. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1241"> I refer here to an amendment concerning the requirement of the evidence of the sequence of an oral, for example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1242"> Mr Bösch has already here the amendments to the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1243"> I have two questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last two questions, and I have received its part and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1244"> This is the beginning of a process of openness and transparency in the way of government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1245"> Firstly, the corrections organized by the Commission are always. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1246"> It is, of course, of July 2000. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1247"> Votes </SEG> 
<SEG id="1248"> (the Assembly rejects the proposal to postpone the vote) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1249"> (de) during the evaluation of the own funds directive concerning the credit institutions to that are in conflict. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1250"> It is thus that is based on the idea of a school of policy for the Member States of the European Union and the applicant countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1251"> This is the position defended by the rapporteur and by the popular Party. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1252"> The social situation in most of the Member States of the European Union is currently between the need for closer cooperation between the different police service is indeed important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1253"> The majority of speakers who have until now seem to think that it is essential that the school has a permanent seat. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1254"> The capacity of temporary, but not accustomed to, the small gift that the Council is to make to this Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1255"> The rapporteur would like to see more of the crime, welfare, innovative and surveillance and also wants to change in order to include respect for the law and order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1256"> It to the ideals that they and it was the kind of the State to which they. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1257"> I would be in favour of a standards in certain Member States of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1258"> Since the first, on this issue, which took place at the European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission is in relation to the Member States to promote an action intended to what we could consider as a culture, on the standard them in the matter of respect for the rights and freedoms of the citizens, and effectiveness in the fight against crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1259"> It is rather for the development of a force in an Intergovernmental perspective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1260"> For the above reasons, the Communist Party of Greece will vote against the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1261"> (SV) I have voted against the report on the interim school of police. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1262"> It is clear that many of our courts are very slow and cumbersome and that it is very difficult to act quickly in the face of these problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1263"> Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, from the fact that it remains in Brussels II "which excludes the children whose parents are in divorce proceedings, so that the children outside marriage. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1264"> My mother has experienced such a divorce and there is 85 years and it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1265"> I want to say to the House that, in the programme of action on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions in civil law - which we hope that it will be adopted before the end of this year, the Commission proposes that the first and the main priority is the extension of the scope of the regulation and, therefore, of this regulation concerning the right of access, or without any mariÃ and the children of the mariÃ either. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1266"> We shall now proceed to the vote </SEG> 
<SEG id="1267"> At present, it is - it has to be said - is to other areas as one of the audiovisual industry or the promotion and of the marketing of products. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1268"> What we need, it is an intelligent and flexible interpretation by the international Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1269"> That is to say, a European Constitution, if we look at things from this point of view. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1270"> The Commission expects to receive an answer to his request for information regarding the measures foreseen by the British government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1271"> The proposal has been adopted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a statement made before the review of the budget, six months before the full budget from the spring of 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1272"> Again, I thought that what was said by Mr Simpson has really served to reassure us in this regard the probable intentions of the British government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1273"> The traffic jams we do not only lose a lot of time, but they are a problem for the whole of the environment, and I therefore think that if the British government - the funds necessary for the resolution of these problems, it is in everyone, and in particular of all the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1274"> We are more or less the only producers from the European Union and yet we are faced with the price of petrol and diesel to all the countries of Europe - GBP the diesel in the United Kingdom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1275"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1276"> The European Parliament must inform them that it is in their sides, and I offer you, once again, to observe one minute's silence which express our solidarity and our proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1277"> Madam President, it is for the support wholeheartedly, since I am one of those who have asked the inclusion of this point. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1278"> We have achieved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1279"> The Union will deepen its relations with all the groups and, as soon as possible, and also the new administration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1280"> Taking into account the brilliant report of Mr Prescott on the manner in which it had itself, how is it that not only Mrs Voynet but also, I believe, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, the majority of the other Ministers of the environment have rejected it? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1281"> What they can fear, it is that is not lost, that the change and that is to begin in may. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1282"> This time, which are the main stumbling block. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1283"> If this continues, a part of the territory of the countries of the European Union will transform at sea or in the desert. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1284"> The standard of living is there and the products. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1285"> I congratulate the Commissioner for the efforts she has provided at the moment and it wishes to have more of a chance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1286"> Without doubt, it was better to have no agreement at all than to have an agreement that is wrong and, in this case, the proposal was a proposal to you, totally unacceptable for Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1287"> The climatic changes have jobs in the developing countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1288"> I repeat this idea in its formulation of carbon sinks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1289"> Only this will allow the European Union to turn the speeches and the action of this "B" in Bonn. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1290"> We shall do our own assessment of what has happened and to the contacts with the different parties and, of course, with the 'umbrella' Group. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1291"> Of course, the result of the next importance or the pursuit of the importance the ratification of an agreement in the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1292"> Before the Council, we will again next Sunday, Pierre Moscovici and myself, a conclave, which I 'Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, so that a session of the IGC, on Monday at the meeting of the general Affairs Council on ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1293"> The minimum number of participating Member States should, whereas the clause of appeal to the Council, which is currently a right of veto, would be a right of 'European vocation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1294"> They may regret, but I am obliged to do this report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1295"> The European Council will also discuss the State of progress of the negotiations on membership, and therefore of the '. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1296"> The European Council in Lisbon was approved guidelines aiming to promote an innovative and competitive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1297"> The protection of the consumer is a growing concern, for reasons which I do not need to develop. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1298"> We must be ready for this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1299"> That is, in the final analysis, to which we will have to judge the Nice Summit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1300"> (Applause) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1301"> The first is that the applicant countries must adopt and implement the acquis communautaire, and that is the task that they share with us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1302"> We are deeply attached to the Charter of fundamental rights and we simply do not want the Charter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1303"> Of course, the text could be better, and they will be able to improve and after Nice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1304"> I am simply unacceptable that a number of governments have purely and simply to table the question of the insertion of a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1305"> You do not want in the Treaty, which shows that this text must be put aside. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1306"> We speak with a single voice within the WTO. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1307"> Given the financial prospects of success of the Intergovernmental Conference, I believe that it would not be appropriate to add to the agenda of this complex and controversial. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1308"> I make an urgent appeal to the Presidency to do everything in its power to fill this role. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1309"> The Commission, in the field of trade policy, a proposal which must be examined carefully. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1310"> Although the Treaty of some progress on the terms of the extension of the expression, it has also introduced this expression of the for the social rights of persons and cultural policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1311"> The simple fact that this question is clearly shows, in the absence of a policy of strengthening the links of mutual trust between the countries which make up the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1312"> It is precisely in this situation that the Intergovernmental Conference drags on for months, because nobody wants to abandon his. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1313"> The experience of this year we did say that bring - after Nice, by looking towards the future of Europe - the process of constitutionalisation of the Union must not be to the obsolÃ reflects the confidential between governments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1314"> If the majority do not become the rule, the process will increase, as has so rightly pointed out, Mr Prodi. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1315"> If this aspect is very important, we have heard in the course of the debate today. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1316"> It is this that we have made, and has been adopted, we are Group with wisdom by Carlos, Amsterdam, we are now on the eve of the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice and the situation has in practice, Mr President: we are back to the institutional problems, without finding solution which allows us to complete an ambitious, I want to talk about the enlargement to 27. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1317"> Do not add to the debate that is going to cause, of course, if the Council proves, the greater our Parliament would cause among the people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1318"> By the past, we have shown that it is possible to achieve this goal and, both from a Member State which has a plan of transition towards the membership of the EU, I hope very much that we arrive at a peaceful Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1319"> But it must be clear that, if you have the right of veto, all the others have too. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1320"> But it will be necessary to undertake a view regarding the criteria for a certain number of new Member States will join us before or during this that will run until 2009. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1321"> The President of the Council has the issue and it has said that the way towards a consensus in the field. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1322"> Mr President, first of all, to put the necessary reforms and on the prospect of enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1323"> If we had that some overtones of this, if we insisted on the things that are going wrong on our continent and a little more on the things that go well, we are a little more happy that at the moment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1324"> We must not only extend to the vote in the Council of Ministers in the Council of Ministers in the transport of goods, we must include the services, investment, intellectual property and the competition that there are new and adapt the Article 1 of the Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1325"> In fact, the granting of such a right to Parliament on free movement, arbitrary of the policy of the subject of this extremist sensitive question. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1326"> Therefore it is also, as one of you, by referring to the optimism and to the way in which the Americans talk of themselves, it must also be capable of promoting what works and what you. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1327"> I would like to say also that I do not believe that there is a problem between large and small countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1328"> We have a lot, but we have to this old problem, and I do not believe that the directive can be adopted by the movement of a single country, because we, once again, national, political, democratic, strong in the countries of the fifteen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1329"> Finally, Mr President, you have a situation stretched and a certain pessimism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1330"> In a way, could take the measures aimed at strengthening the security of this as such cannot happen again? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1331"> I believe that we must take measures that we still have never taken until now, so that this Parliament as, and not to be afraid of threats. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1332"> Here, and respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1333"> I would like to thank you for your contribution, Mr Tajani. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1334"> The best tribute to murder and to his memory would respect his message - in Catalan. we all give him its chance in the Basque country? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1335"> Of course, on the other hand, everyone can express his opinion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1336"> B5-0550 / 2000 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy, to the Council, on the political situation and the humanitarian aid in Afghanistan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1337"> When I speak of organisation, I also believe in the European Union which, in my opinion, if responsibility and which, in my opinion, should be able to take the responsibility. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1338"> In the second place, you will see in the resolution of the net Parliament do to rest the policy and on two pillars: civil crisis management and, in the case of the failure of the management of the military, the two pillars being. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1339"> Mr President, given the delay which has been taken and my obligations, after all, I am going to try to shorten a little the speech I had prepared. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1340"> These relations will in particular form of meetings between the Council of the North Atlantic and the copsi, and of meetings between the European Union and the fifteen countries candidates and / or. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1341"> Take, for example, what is in the Balkans, where one can say that everyone has a full role. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1342"> We have also in this period of considering the United States under the title of the policy of security and defence, which is a condition sine qua non for that she is in harmony, as this is the case at present. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1343"> The second annual report of the European Union on the rights of the Committee was presented to the European Parliament a year on human rights in Paris on 13 December. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1344"> This policy, say, did not seek to compete with the Atlantic Alliance, which remains today the foundation of the collective defence of its Members, or to set up a European army. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1345"> On the other hand, if I have mentioned the figure of 100, 000 soldiers, that does not mean that we aim to exceed the target set in Helsinki, but that we have a reservation in qualifications and in which could ensure that the men of the objective of the Council would be reached, what are the conditions of their employment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1346"> Allow me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 'in a few words the deep political sense, approved by a large part of our public opinions, this task by which Europe acquires a tool of political influence that him. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1347"> The problem which we are now is to ensure that, when we speak of consolidating democracy in Europe, we believe in the whole of the European continent, because that is the aim of enlargement and the process of enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1348"> It is necessary in all three elements: the Community policies, the Member States and the action of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1349"> In spite of our democratic procedures, we have no need of a force of 60 000 men to meet our objectives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1350"> It is therefore urgent to put in place a solution of humanitarian aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1351"> I do not agree with the cynics who argue that Europe is seen so, of course, it is true that, in many cases, the rapid action will not be directly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1352"> The EU must not acquire a manpower. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1353"> To conclude, I express the anxiety that the Members of my Group and myself faced with the constant worsening of the situation in Afghanistan, and I would urge the Commission and the Council to do everything possible, to intensify efforts to reach a peaceful and come to the aid of the civilian population, in particular at this time, to the approach of winter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1354"> To put it simply: where, when and under what conditions the intervention force have to take action in the future? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1355"> It will allow us to understand the appalling toll of these two months Intifada: 270 deaths, most of the Palestinians, and injured, often in life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1356"> His relentless efforts to set up an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, they can no longer gloomy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1357"> In the second place, contrary to what the previous speaker, I do not know if it is possible or desirable that the Union makes more than it has done in the face of the conflict and to the escalation of violence, especially now that, in this period of transition which cross the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1358"> Mr President, I shall concentrate in my speech on the report by Mrs Lalumière, report that I find well and clearly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1359"> But there is no political concept and it is still not really of foreign policy and common security. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1360"> The only problem of the EU is that so far, it has not managed to collect the public opinion for this type of actions despite the fact that they are considerably more sustainable and more effective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1361"> Mr President, it still remains, of course, the budget and the question of how to divide. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1362"> I say this in spite of the bulk of guarantees that have moved on the subject in the course of the last few days. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1363"> For the time being, gravely and it will, at the end of the day, that the Member States will look on their programmes of expenditure in the matter of which enormously from one country to another. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1364"> Even those who are themselves on the that can a decision as one aiming to create what is called the European Union must consider the important political aspect of this decision and its influence on the cohesion of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1365"> The presence of a Minister for the first time in this Assembly is a historic such that we have the evening so that our representatives are not too. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1366"> For all of these conflicts, a management of crises is better than a military management. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1367"> Russia want, in the long term, a? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1368"> Therefore, Europe does not constitute a new Alliance, as I have heard, I believe, by an incomprehensible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1369"> I have received a motion for a resolution, pursuant to rule 42 (5) of the regulation, to wind up this debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1370"> Given the scale of the task, four commissions and a procedure has been put in place, with four reports. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1371"> The package of measures proposed in the White Paper must help to modernise and to make all the efficient functioning of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1372"> It would be a good thing, therefore, that the reform is the opportunity to limit their intervention in the areas which do not entail expenses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1373"> The difference of assessment that by not only of a political nature, but reflect the cultural differences between the fifteen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1374"> The new internal audit service, under your direct, Mr Kinnock, of the reform, and the analysis of the systems and systems of internal control which exist within the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1375"> Working Group has been a pleasure, and I think that the fact that we are all four has deepened and enriched the process of treatment of a reform of the Commission, a reform which is essential for the future of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1376"> They can expect to be transferred to other institutions, governments or to work in the sector. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1377"> Also, our Commission reject its attachment to a Commission strong, independent, efficient, transparent and politically responsible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1378"> As the Committee on Budgets, we consider that the budget by puts me in view of the lack of expenses and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1379"> This will, in a way, the good will of this Parliament with regard to the implementation of this reform with the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1380"> Mr President, allow me first of all to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1381"> It is a shame when they believe that the European Union presents itself as the champion of the modernisation of the life! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1382"> Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteurs to support the work of the Commission, they have not yet a global and consistent from the Committee of independent experts, which aims to a policy of management and not only of better management of the institution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1383"> This change of attitude must be translated into a transparency of the administration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1384"> For me, it is no structure whose importance is greater it is fifteen Nations just twenty or more, a continent, part of the globe, who live in the Union and, by it, in the Commission and its structures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1385"> The change is never easy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1386"> This will, however, the Socialist Group feels that the current functioning of the management of public administration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1387"> The result is known and devotion and the competence of the majority of Members of the Commission and its administration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1388"> Several thousands of calls for an assessment for more than a year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1389"> The debate, as we have seen, does not so much on the principles, the objectives and the timeliness of the reform on the procedures, the consequences of the calendar, the serious or not of its implementation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1390"> I would like to begin by communicating to the Assembly - as Mr van Hulten in at the moment - that the meeting of the age of this morning has adopted the proposal of interinstitutional agreement to an advisory Committee on standards in public life, such as the action 1 of the action plan of the White Paper. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1391"> I think that Mr van Hulten has once again on this point during the debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1392"> The main objective of this objective is to simplify the procedures, to increase the transparency and to strengthen the rules, which will result in a reduction in the number of exceptions and of the procedure and, therefore, greater effectiveness at the level of the budget procedure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1393"> It is in fact for the Commission that the texts, a payment of 20% for the cost X and 30% for the costs there and then, it is grouping and evidence for the small amounts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1394"> The next item is the report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on development and cooperation, on relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the reform of the Commission on these relations [2000 / 2051 (INI)]. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1395"> These aspects touch the experts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1396"> Of course, it is not sufficient, but it should put us all in the enclave of caricatures on the weakness of our aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1397"> We will return to this matter, because it is in itself a framework. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1398"> Mr President, I am today Mozambique, where the European Union has provided humanitarian aid of greater following the floods. however, reconstruction projects which were already are, once again, in the expectation of a signature in Brussels. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1399"> Faced with these, the necessity of a greater involvement and greater effectiveness in the fight against poverty and is essential. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1400"> We have to present a framework for the documents and the national indicative programmes of cooperation in all the countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1401"> What is more, the creation of did not put an end to the difference that existed between eight voluminous administrative resources. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1402"> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, if I wanted to be with you today for this debate on the first package of maritime, it is because you are going to take three important texts, which constitute a first essential step on a subject that was unfortunately put to the agenda of the current. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1403"> It could enable, Moreover, from the point of view of the Presidency of the Council, to discuss with the Member States to obtain an agreement from the Council in terms of your proposals and to adopt the text in first reading, if necessary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1404"> This quick and efficient, by the two Erika packages of measures and the six proposals, has launched a dynamic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1405"> The lesson that must keep this Assembly in its debate of this morning is that we are forced to conclude that the maritime laws are, all over the world, in a State of mess, and that we should get down to the task to put in order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1406"> We must send a clear signal to not replying to the standards of security and that we do more in the waters or in the ports. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1407"> For the small, we adopt a position of compromise between the ceiling of 5 000 tonnes that had the IMO and one of 600 tonnes that has the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1408"> These will be put at the disposal of the authorities, the Member States and to, so that the public concerned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1409"> The nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in an area can have on a more tense, requires the creation of a Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1410"> The protection of the environment are also involved in the cooperation at local level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1411"> To amend the directive in the direction of greater rigour in its application, a harmonisation of concern, particularly as regards the subject to examination, and the area of application of different types of examination, is of course positive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1412"> I should like to point out that the urgency that you call at present does not place to be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1413"> With regard to the membership of that, it is my opinion that the Council and Parliament deepen, apart from this that will suffer today. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1414"> A black, a black list, all the things which we are actively, but I nonetheless want to highlight a few points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1415"> Faced with this situation catastrophic and anarchic maritime transport, Europe has the challenge and, eleven months after the Erika disaster, the European Union will announce that never procedure will have been so quickly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1416"> One measure was the logic is' a high level of maritime security. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1417"> What are, after all, the technical measures which will be taken, one of the major sources of 'so that they will not, in the zone and the trafficking of children in the enlargement of the North sea ports. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1418"> This would be to the credit of President in office of the Council to put things in order, also in its own country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1419"> Madam President, since the sinking of the Erika, a package of measures has seen the light of day, under political pressure, in order to improve the security of ships at sea. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1420"> Vessels, without which there is the slightest, Mr Gayssot. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1421"> Thirdly, I think that it is becoming clear, in this kind of dossiers, that there is no connection between our supply of on the one hand, and the fact that we always use of fossil fuels on the other hand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1422"> Let us therefore Finally the political courage of our ambitions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1423"> This is to say that, in this field more than in any other, our responsibility is greater and we must, it seems to me, to make any institutional self-esteem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1424"> From the point of view of Finland, for example, it is important that Russia is part of these agreements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1425"> I think at the time of the requirements concerning the standards of construction, and also the ports, and also, therefore, the tightening of regulations applicable to the classification of ships. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1426"> Madam President, we are talking about today of the maritime security on the basis of three reports which I warmly congratulate the rapporteurs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1427"> As for these three new proposals on the maritime, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs, who have, in short, to what extent our Parliament is to adopt new measures to strengthen the security at sea, the controls, the standards of building and that there is more that similar accidents occur again. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1428"> Madam President, our continent has recently by a series of large-scale maritime disasters, particularly productive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1429"> More than 80% of accidents are linked to human errors, but there are reasons to the human error, which are social order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1430"> One or a parliamentarian has used the term "to". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1431"> The directive on control by the port State is designed for the respect of international requirements and not to introduce new regulations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1432"> Amendment no 18, which links the democratic control by the State of the seamen, even if the application of the provisions concerning the working hours of wages is completely covered by the directive 99 / 95. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1433"> I am pleased to see that the rapporteur has introduced a reference, in amendment no 9, the system of democratic control, and I make our agreement with the main idea of this motion, but emphasises that the wording should be to clarify matters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1434"> Amendment no 4 and the part of amendment no 18 on the point K are not acceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1435"> I can assure you that if an owner do have a ship under these flags, it would all there two times in view of our proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1436"> The Commissioner has spoken for 18 Minutes, and for all this time, she dozens and dozens of goods, and it has the position of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1437"> Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning a set of actions relating to the network of collection, production and broadcasting of statistics on the goods and (EDICOM) (COM (00) 0458 - C5-0401 / 2000 - 2000 / 0201 (COD)) (Committee on economic and monetary Affairs) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1438"> In withdrawing our resolution, I am, however, convinced that our Parliament would have made its voice heard in dedicating, in view of the Nice Council, a resolution and traditional so important and so difficult to the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than to deal in the framework of a single resolution including also all the other points of the agenda of the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1439"> (more than twelve, is not the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the resolution) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1440"> Report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on development and cooperation, on relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI)) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1441"> I have voted against as a sign of protest against the fact that the European Union does not manage to intervene as it should make it in this matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1442"> Although the proposal to amend the existing directive on the control of ships, the Watts report does not respond to real needs, they represent some progress in the right direction, for these reasons, the Communist Party of Greece, have voted in favour of the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1443"> They can so that the proposal of the Commission has not taken the idea of the creation of a European body of surveillance, on the coast "in the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1444"> The security of ships, the protection of life at sea and the environment is that one has to the which enjoy the shipowners, that they take strict measures for the control of the safety and that they impose sanctions on maritime companies which violate the rules of security, that one of the conditions of seafarers, that they be given a training and that they guarantee effective to board which needs increased ships. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1445"> Alas, the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, does the opposite. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1446"> The sinking of the Erika accident in December 1999 was at the origin of the will of the issue of the political agenda and in the Community and it is under pressure from the European Parliament that the Commission has proposed the texts that we have today, almost a year after this sinister shipwreck. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1447"> The existing mechanisms have been badly, and this is not at all too clearly in the case of the Braer disaster, following which the industry of the Shetland has too little very comparison of damages incurred. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1448"> I have already said, Madam President, that in the past I have had the opportunity to sail. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1449"> The rapporteur's proposals for the harmonisation in the European Union cannot be that positive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1450"> It is a matter of an important since it concerns the classification of ships. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1451"> This would be rather a great success, because the Europe of which we need, on the eve of enlargement, is not a supranational Europe, rigid, remote, but a flexible and close to the people, then based on respect for national democracies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1452"> The fight for power that will deliver more and more openly number of Member States blurs the prospect of compromises. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1453"> The Nice Summit will principal task to guarantee the effectiveness of the institutions of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1454"> In a week of the Summit, I personally hope! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1455"> I am not in favour of a link between the and codecision and, here too, I believe that any aiming to extend the powers should be examined on a case-by-case basis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1456"> In amending Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the 'Europe in the vote in the Council of Ministers, currently in force in the Council for the trade in products, in other areas as public services, intellectual property, the health or education. </SEG>

<SEG id="1458"> I have also voted against a text which asks for the incorporation of the Charter of fundamental rights in the future Treaty which will be adopted at Nice. </SEG>

<SEG id="1461"> There are many elements which the British Conservative Group can give its support in this report, in particular the emphasis on the enlargement of the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1462"> The public in the European Parliament have decided to support the report on the establishment of a common European security policy in the matter of security and defence. </SEG>

<SEG id="1465"> The means which bring no solution, because it does not remove the cause of the conflict and does not change public opinion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1466"> It is the fact that the military operations financed by a line from the budget of the Community and that the Member States would have to contribute to it, even if they do not participate (paragraphs 49 and 50) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1467"> The EU should, on the contrary, benefit to modify the priorities in the framework of the Petersberg tasks and it should concentrate its efforts on the situation of civil and restrictions. </SEG>

<SEG id="1484"> In the Committee on foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy - that Mr Brok - it smokes sitting. </SEG>

<SEG id="1492"> It is in Parliament and in the Council to approve this proposal for a directive and to examine, among other things, its legal basis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1493"> I do not think that we can take a way too restricted, that is to say that, apart from the content - and the others that have put in to Mr Maaten and others - there is the danger that, if this Parliament and the Council accepts the proposed by the leader of the popular Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and all the Community institutions meet the leader at European level, of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1494"> The weak point of the proposal is that it places the emphasis on the promotion of free competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1495"> I say by way of conclusion that, since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has the power of coordination in the matter of environmental and consumer protection, and that it will work, in cooperation with the Council and the Commission on these matters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1496"> In fact, it has absolutely nothing to do with the tobacco, but by the Court of justice of the European communities, a ban on the advertising of alcohol or to the chocolate, since it is known that the sugar can also be dangerous to health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1497"> I really do not manage to understand that a majority can wish a relaxation in the matter of governments in relation to the wishes expressed by the governments of the Member States - the governments which also represent many industrial circles. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1498"> It is a fact that 80% of smokers want that, but the tobacco industry as it does that policies in place to assist these smokers to stop. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1499"> If we are to dictate to other countries the public that they should apply in all our proposals for the internal market, we will be in danger of the excellent work done by Mr Maaten. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1500"> We are favourable to the implementation of a method of testing, recognised by all the countries of the EU, which must be implemented by a laboratory of trials in a country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1501"> The effects of the consumption of tobacco on health are fully recognised, and the share share the feeling that it is now time to adopt and drastic for this product. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1502"> Consequently, the Community would be in harmony with the future international agreements, which we in the danger of commercial and reinforce the protection of consumers, while ensuring a high level of public health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1503"> It would be preferable to wait until the matter within the framework of the first report of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1504"> Regarding the laboratory tests, dealing with the approval of the amendment is superfluous, given that another item guarantees the movement of goods which are in accordance with the provisions of the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1505"> Madam President, this report is all this that there is more simple: at the moment, the guidelines on aid to have only one of five years, after which they have to return in front of the Parliament to be renewed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1506"> The Committee on industry, external trade, research and energy. Madam President, my dear colleagues, the proposal for a directive concerning the provisions relating to the time, that we are debating today, is a good proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1507"> I think that we should not spread too long on this subject, so that the Member States and the population has been the rules on the time and that this has been recognised as part of our annual rate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1508"> In my view, it is good that the questions of application and application of the directive on the should remain the competence of the Member States, as the proposal envisages. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1509"> It would be more reasonable to put an end to the time at the end of September, six months after its purpose. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1510"> It can Nevertheless agree with the idea of making proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report by 2007 in Article 5. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1511"> It was that no identity of the amendments cannot be accepted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1512"> If we approve it, we shall have a regulation which guarantees and does not leave the protection of patients in the Commission, but this is why I am in favour of this compromise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1513"> These groups must be maintained in the field of application of the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1514"> I am also glad that we have managed to put guard. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1515"> I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his work, and to thank it for the efforts it has made in order to reconcile our points of view. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1516"> These concern the fight against cancer, AIDS, the prevention of drug addiction and the promotion of health, which would mean the the jobs that have been put in place. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1517"> It is very parts of power to the moves to smooth the way, to develop the best possible, closer to us greatly and, in cases where a second reading would be, to make sure that we are virtually at the point of split. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1518"> In addition, we must not lose sight of the fact that both the President and the promotion of that the police will always be more important and that it will be during the days of the most important and give them greater importance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1519"> Madam President, following the Trakatellis report concerning the extension of some of the existing programmes in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about the direction in which the European policy of public health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1520"> According to my information, the Council also gave its agreement in principle. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1521"> In the European Union, paradoxically, the abolition of internal borders in order to promote the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is the maintenance of 15 in the fields of police and justice, of which the Member States have trouble in itself. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1522"> Finally, the initiative represents a considerable progress towards the creation of a judicial space, albeit partial and limited, but it needs a mass of European citizens who, when they are victims of an offence in the territory of their State of normal, are now virtually without appeal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1523"> That we asked for these groups of persons? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1524"> It is time to ensure a training professionals in direct contact with the victims. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1525"> The victims can become victims, victims of crime and the victims of the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1526"> In this context, it is also important that the parents that, the family of the victim, are facts and because if they wish and can also count on the support, as they learn all by the press. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1527"> This applies to the type of which it is about. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1528"> It is at the level of the Member States, or that of the Union, we must never deviate from the basic principle according to which all individual must always take the responsibility of its deeds. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1529"> In other cases, it might be possible to obtain useful information in a language of the Union which is not theirs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1530"> I am very satisfied with the duties of Parliament in this text on a subject which is so crucial, which allows the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building little by little to offer to our citizens a assistance in situations which are often difficult to live. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1531"> Vote on request for urgent procedure </SEG> 
<SEG id="1532"> (Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1533"> Thus, in the night of 23 to 24 November, we have an agreement with the Council on the essential points of a budget, which is certainly not brilliant, but which is Nevertheless sensible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1534"> The Commission had also a review to competition of EUR 300 million. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1535"> But I have also learnt from the debates that it is much more difficult to arrive at the wording of the position of the Council, to accept a mandate and to lead to the purely national in a common sense and a little. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1536"> I hope that the work for a common service, as they say in German, that is to say, a European initiative, will, so that we can respond to problems that all the institutions - the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions - in the coming years, namely the need to staff. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1537"> The Council refuses to carry out this review - it seems to me that we should already have - and I would like to use the instrument: two years - in fact, in less than fifteen months and the first six less of the approval of the financial perspectives - the flexibility instrument because it of its renewal and its accumulation, that the level of 600 million. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1538"> This amount is important, that the existence of needs in 2001, of the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to the level of EUR 200 million. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1539"> It is by taking account of this new element that the Council has proposed in second reading a budget increase of 2.5%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1540"> Finally, before you at the adoption of this budget, I wish to underline the commitment from the Council in respect of certain basis, in the matter of implementation in the reserve of appropriations, basis and classification of expenses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1541"> And contrary to Nice, the three institutions - Parliament, Council and Commission - are all, I think, be happy outcome. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1542"> Ladies and gentlemen, the results achieved by the appearance of cattle that makes an action in the context of the budget, and precisely for the protection of health, for the protection of consumers, but also to help the farmers concerned by this situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1543"> The Council has defined, for the framework programme of assistance to the reconstruction in the Western Balkans, an amount to only, of course, which is compatible with these financial perspectives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1544"> High conflict, we have managed to obtain a few million euros. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1545"> I thank Mrs Haug. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1546"> It thinks that this time for 1% of the budget of the European Union is good advice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1547"> If I understand what you have said, we should not resort to the reserve because it is contrary to the rules. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1548"> I therefore think that we have seen of good things, in addition to many others, that I cannot mention now because of the time of the word. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1549"> Although the appropriations, which represent almost half of the total budget, more than 5%, while taking account of the letter of amendment, the total increase of the budget is that of 3.5%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1550"> We see now the great danger that the opposition in the coming years between the plans for the countries of the Mediterranean and the Balkans, then that we all know that there is an urgent need for funds in this area. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1551"> Should have made so that the way towards the objective to meet the commitments entered into at Helsinki towards the candidate countries without making the Union, to allow the Europe of tomorrow to continue to work with. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1552"> They are real, even if they do not go as far as the Presidency - which has shown, I note, at national level, of a greater opening - would. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1553"> A new legal basis is planned for the status of political parties and the European Parliament is given the status of institutional foreseen in Article 230 of the Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1554"> These weeks, three important have been achieved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1555"> This is the sense of the declaration of Nice and to coordinate in the fight against doping. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1556"> Among the threats, there has, as everyone knows, the warming. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1557"> In addition, in Nice, the European Union has put in place the permanent authorities in the definition and in the conduct of a foreign policy and common security: a political and security, a military one. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1558"> For this cooperation, for your support and also for your welcome, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European institutions, the French Presidency thank you. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1559"> (Applause) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1560"> (Applause) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1561"> We now need to examine the text in Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1562"> (Applause) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1563"> I see a compromise not only in relation to the ambition of the European Union to change the institutions to be able to welcome the new Member States in improving the effectiveness of the European Union, and I see a also in relation to another important objective, which was perhaps too little, the position of the European Union and the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1564"> The good questions, it is in our opinion which was the impressive human tide that, of all the day on the eve of the Summit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1565"> Firstly, the fifteen have signed the and the Charter of fundamental rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1566"> (Applause) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1567"> My Group is disappointed by this Treaty and concerned for the future that we, as we all our forces. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1568"> Mr President, you have the floor. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1569"> I have already answered on this point and I support completely what he has said on the necessity of improving the public debate, and I will not go back on what I have said, but it is true that, all too often, the citizens feel the decisions that are taken in the authorities that they do not know. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1570"> Mr President, I would like to know if the European Parliament in the field of time is a new concept. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1571"> Jusqu 'then by the clinical trials, laboratories will find, in both by the States that by our Assembly, the courage of the market, even if it is not large enough to allow a return on investment! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1572"> It is necessary to accompany the change of time which had been instituted, in a purpose of energy, and which had until 2001? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1573"> The victims are not always as it has in the framework of procedures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1574"> Many passengers and profit of this initiative. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1575"> Mr President, the time for me to greet Mr President of the Commission and the Presidency of the Council that if you, and to stress that, probably not even in this Parliament, is such unanimity on the results of a Summit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1576"> The one that step, it is one which, under the leadership of the French Presidency, in six months, it seems to me, made all of his. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1577"> However, my fear is that the UK, France and Germany are currently in a position to reverse that existed between States of different sizes and between the institutions for several decades. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1578"> In fact, it is hard to see, in this decision, which is to facilitate enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1579"> Mr President, dear colleagues, I can be very brief. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1580"> In consequence of that, when we vote on the Treaty of Nice, my vote could be that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1581"> Mr President, the most important of the Union from Nice lies in the fact that they are all succeed in a Treaty, so that we can now prepare their place in the applicant countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1582"> The real winners of this Intergovernmental Conference, these are. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1583"> Then, forget Nice, look - and you will allow me to put my hope in the project of great Convention by Belgium for its Presidency, because the proof is made, we must make the above, it is necessary to change, it is necessary to consider the history: because it is too late, it is too far, it is too dangerous. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1584"> Instead of this the spirit that Nice was, instead of just how to advance the Europe of how one could block, how one could get a decision at Intergovernmental level, how one could claim, once in itself, to have been the national. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1585"> This before what we are after Amsterdam and Nice, it is a Europe, a Europe of the national administrations, and not a Europe of European policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1586"> We cannot continue without the essential. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1587"> It is true that - I Mr Bayrou - I am at this bench since this morning; all the different sides of the President of the Republic, then by myself and the criticisms, it seems to me,, critical, but all the same. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1588"> We must not forget that it is the first time, in fact, since 1957, that they form, that they will be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1589"> We are in the constitutional and powers may not be confused. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1590"> Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1591"> But it has not been incorporated into the Treaties and has not mentioned in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Treaty on European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1592"> Finally, there are some positive: the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty, the Article on the political parties and their status, the right of this Parliament to bring the other institution before the Court of justice - it is also an important element of political control, the new formula for the European Commission, which puts what they call "and the" in the Treaty, which increases the President and the new composition of the Commission - a reasonable compromise, which I accept and which will operate, with time, and, as my colleague, Mr Tsatsos, stated that, the path towards the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1593"> Mr President, we are already a rigorous evaluation of what happened in Nice, but it should be remembered that Nice is part of a restricted day. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1594"> Let things: the Charter has not been included in the Treaty, it is not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1595"> We want to show the Heads of government that we can do better. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1596"> In spite of the French government to its own subject this morning by the French government, the IGC is not finished. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1597"> Mr President, the French Presidency is not being present in this debate, it is not easy to criticise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1598"> Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the method of the Intergovernmental Conference has done his time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1599"> 2001 budget (continuation) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1600"> This does not mean, however, that they could do more and better. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1601"> These maximum oblige the Commission to set priorities within the limits of a budget as any must make. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1602"> The vote which will follow this debate concluded a long and complex process of adoption of the budget of the European Union for the year 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1603"> This is what we have done: we have a budget crisis in coming to Article 272; the financial perspectives have been maintained, even if we have used the flexibility instrument. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1604"> Let me just say to the Council that, regarding this game, it remains of us and that, from this side, we intend to play so that we have not got the right moment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1605"> We do not want a proposal to review for the next appears in the resolution Colom, because we want to wait for the results of the world Bank, but we share his point of view critical when she argues that this way of resolving the insufficiency in category 4, the great objectives of the Union and the definition of the financial perspectives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1606"> So that all this is possible, we will have to define, for the future also, on a large scale. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1607"> It is only in this way that the money that is put at the disposal of our fellow citizens, will be used properly and wisely. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1608"> If we add to this the next, they come, to 8%, whereas in all the other areas - that it is a matter of the policy of training, of all the area of internal actions, including the research, the political, the administration and the assistance, we only have a rate of growth of 1.1%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1609"> Since this collaboration is so good, we shall again found the opportunity to pursue in January, at the time of the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1610"> The criticism of the relations between Russia and the Baltic States which have still not could suits us also. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1611"> We are following with great interest the evolution of society and of the policy in Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1612"> Mr President, dear colleagues, the common strategy for Russia was the first in the history of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1613"> Even if the President can we guarantee the development of his country, it is not with the guarantees of a stable and democratic Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1614"> We must not be insidious but on the contrary to build a Europe of cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1615"> Regarding the Caucasus, Mr van Orden has perfectly right. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1616"> If one of Russia and that they receive and risk, they run the risk of leading to a series of a power that is in fact the picture that is made of Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1617"> On the political front, the common proposes to Russia to undertake a permanent dialogue on the policy and the security and create to this effect a permanent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1618"> In this paragraph, I wanted to stress how important it is to stress the fact that Russia is at odds with the political Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1619"> Do you believe that such a project, Mr Patten? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1620"> In this context, as Parliament knows, in the course of the last Summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi has a more in-depth dialogue on energy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1621"> I deeply make me personally to Kaliningrad, at the beginning of next year, and not only because Immanuel Kant has passed all his life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1622"> I congratulate once more the process of his excellent report, which concerns a subject of a very great importance, on which I am sure that we shall again and again in this Parliament over the coming years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1623"> You put me in a difficult position. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1624"> Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is very important, because the mad cow crisis has effects on the food products, on the production and import of food products. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1625"> The Council has expressed its concern at the many meetings with Russia, at all levels, in particular for the changes to avoid the excessive use of force so that an extension of the conflict, to undertake independent and effective on the violations of human rights, to support the OSCE assistance Group in the achievement of its mission and Finally to look to the delivery of humanitarian aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1626"> Mr President, it is a point of procedure: it is the custom in this Parliament that when the questions have not been the subject of an oral professionals, they are then. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1627"> (interruption from Mr Posselt) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1628"> This directive dates from 1992. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1629"> It is in this sense that it will work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1630"> These groups are obviously not the object of an exception in the new proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1631"> The Presidency and several Member States have already accepted the manufacturers of sugar relating to the proposal of the Commission which they take into account in their deliberations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1632"> Question 6 (H-0886 / 00): </SEG> 
<SEG id="1633"> I would like first of all to say that, in my view, the President-in-Office of the Council has not answered the question of Mr korokas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1634"> We must now put in place this and I believe that the decision of conscience is strong and that it will be necessary to go ahead. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1635"> In concrete terms, the representative of the Presidency, in the case of the Ambassador of France in Algeria, Mr Ahmed? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1636"> We congratulate the provisions proposed in this respect by the Committee and by the general Assembly of the United Nations with regard to the method of non-governmental organisations, and the extraordinary session of September 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1637"> The partnership includes several references to the European Convention on human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1638"> As the Council has emphasized by the honourable Member in his question, the process of mutual recognition of decisions to allow a better protection of the rights of the people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1639"> I want the us again. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1640"> It provides in particular political control and management of a military crisis management. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1641"> I would simply like to say that the Treaty makes a difference between the treatment of taxes and levies in which harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market - that is Article 93 - and the parallel, intended to Article 94, which have a direct impact on the functioning of the common market, including those which concern. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1642"> Take a brief look on these three great areas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1643"> If the classical according to which "no", "persists, it could do to the stability of the southern Europe based on the principle of cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1644"> We also need the cooperation with Yugoslavia and more cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1645"> Mr President, our Group supports the work carried out by Mr Baltas concerning the report on the possibility of negotiating a stabilisation and association agreement with the Republic of Croatia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1646"> Mr President, I have had, during the years I have the mandate of President of the parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the opportunity of many integration in their efforts towards the people and that they in the European institutions, the example of other people of our continent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1647"> In view of the Treaties by opening this year, I have to say that I do not doubt our ability to develop. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1648"> It is this that we believe, and the haste with which we have our policy in respect of Croatia in recent months. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1649"> We need to Croatia to bring the government and the people of this country all possible help in the years to come, and we are very grateful to the honourable Member that the wisdom to encourage us to continue in this way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1650"> In this respect, it is incomprehensible that thousands of Members of the Laskar Jihad have been able, in the spring, in order once again to the conflicts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1651"> In East Timor, the return of refugees and the do. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1652"> On behalf of the Committee on industry, external trade, research and energy, I shall confine myself to three points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1653"> Mr President, Mr Commissioner, dear colleagues, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen for her excellent work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1654"> However, in this respect, the country is no exception. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1655"> The violence, which are the province of Aceh, the province of Aceh and Irian Jaya cause great suffering to the population. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1656"> Tomorrow, we will be presenting the Sakharov Prize. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1657"> The news of the archipelago, however, we wonder if the position of President Wahid and is even more serious, more critical than does the rapporteur's analysis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1658"> If we want to help Indonesia, we must intervene with money and concrete actions, and not only with words. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1659"> This report is valuable because it on the result. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1660"> It is clear that the Indonesia will not be resolved in a day. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1661"> Protection of the financial interests of the communities </SEG> 
<SEG id="1662"> The obstacles to its independence, both at the level of the recruitment of staff and in terms of its structure, must be removed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1663"> It is therefore essential that by a process of reform of the Commission, Finally its declared will no longer tolerate any fraud and to follow them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1664"> I believe that it is this which must, and that must also. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1665"> We would like the Member States to start the negotiations with a view to the adoption of a in the field of the question, but we do not want our countries depend on a public raising of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1666"> I would also like to know why the publication of the communication from the Commission on this subject has been the following day the Danish referendum on the euro. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1667"> I introduced an amendment to designate these countries, because it is time to say clearly that they are and that they are aspects of it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1668"> I am certain that the OLAF, that it is in their interest to make transparency the choice of its leaders. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1669"> However, we must ensure that, within the European Parliament, not to miss him which is in our, that is in the it, the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1670"> We are trying to put out a fire, but we did. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1671"> Nobody can understand me either. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1672"> In order to take this matter, I would like to highlight four points that I consider to be fundamental in the work of the authorities of the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1673"> With regard to the Parliament itself, its problem is the Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1674"> It is rather disturbing, Madam Commissioner, that the Commission - the guardian of the Treaties - should be expressly with regard to respect for human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1675"> This last may by the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgets to freeze or to reduce the amount of the appropriations intended for the budget lines in the budget for the following year, or not to allow any transfer of credits then that it is a matter of increasing the lines and that, until the end of the ongoing internal it can go so far as to demand that the President of the Commission requires the resignation of or the Commissioners concerned by the serious problems which were, an end to sarienne in some way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1676"> The report claims inventories of irregularities, and as well as an internal audit of the parliamentary Committee. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1677"> Madam Commissioner, the legal basis relating to the transmission of information to the European Parliament is the Treaty this and not to the interinstitutional agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1678"> Without amendments, the outcome of this common position would, however, be a weapon not only in relation to the North America, but also in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1679"> I really do not see why we here as in all other cases to a compromise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1680"> It is a matter of a proposal which has gone a long - and, I fear - way, to overcome certain existing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1681"> The first amendment relates to Article 4, which must be the authority for the control of the offer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1682"> We are now with a proposal which would lead to a Constitution, a procession with his delicate potential in a moment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1683"> In the United Kingdom, the returns, by means of the voluntary code of practice implemented by the Commission of takeover bids, is a success: this is a good example of pragmatic approach to a complex legislation would be less. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1684"> But what is even more important, it is that it allows us to make progress in the Lisbon agenda, the creation of a competitive and dynamic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1685"> The important thing for us here in the European Parliament is Finally that the contradictory, for example, the executive board versus the shareholders, the large versus small shareholders, the companies versus the financial, are under a form to the minimum. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1686"> Certain amendments proposed by the European Parliament of the text of the Council common position. they put in fact points that can give rise to difficulties of interpretation and insist on a rapid transposition of the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1687"> In fact, it is not absolutely certain that the definition of price that is proposed is better than another, because the different currently in the Member States all fully. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1688"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1689"> In addition, during a period of three years, the artist will have the right to demand from the professionals of the art all information concerning the amounts that are due, this is because they have to keep a register of purchases and sales. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1690"> Consequently, it is the Austrian and that is not the European Parliament which frames positive for artists and auction houses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1691"> Moreover, in the subject which we are dealing with, the necessity of a common position is of much greater benefits from the common position will enable the European Union to influence at international level so that the consumers can be at world level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1692"> I trust in the wisdom and understanding of this Assembly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1693"> In Germany, for example, in 1998, on 7 000 of having their rights, Finally, without money, without counting that 40% of the resale right is in the recovery of sums owed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1694"> In short, there is no need for a harmonisation of this kind in the area concerned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1695"> A similar amendment had been rejected in first reading. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1696"> They thought that the translations could follow, in spite of this rather difficult. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1697"> Only, we reached a point where we can no longer postpone this debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1698"> We have already within the Commission to undertake a year earlier. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1699"> Our Parliament is of course from the side of these values and it will stop them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1700"> The technological revolution and the fluctuations of the market changes in any way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1701"> Here, we can find no justification I exclusion of competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1702"> The limitation of the universal service - the pillar of the postal sector - to 50 grams risk putting the national postal services in a position, in the sense that they will hardly be able to offer a universal service at an affordable price to citizens, regardless of their place of residence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1703"> I say to my Conservative colleagues the problems that they have had in the United Kingdom when they have tried to privatise the British post. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1704"> We have no more or less the net of the users of the postal service in a hammock in which the big players in the postal sector can continue and act in complete freedom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1705"> I am satisfied because, when, this notion of services out of the new technologies outside the scope of the universal service. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1706"> Madam President, Mr Commissioner, we cannot tolerate and such a situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1707"> This is the reason why the Commission has not proposed, as the second phase, a total of this sector. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1708"> It is a policy of this type that I wish to other States of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1709"> Mr Bolkestein has recently attitude of the French departments in the press, it is less than the title of the item in question. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1710"> In this respect, one could cite Spain, which has a Fund of this type and who uses, this legal framework on which the Fund is based, of its composition, its application. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1711"> We vote tomorrow: I hope that this vote will take place before the amendment from Mr Atkins or that of Mr Sterckx, otherwise I shall vote against this report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1712"> Royal mail participates in the competition, and to deliver my mail in Sweden. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1713"> Madam President, Mr Commissioner, that we have learned from the debate, or rather by Commissioner Bolkestein in its pursuit of a liberalization of the postal services, and in the absence of any assessment of the first stage and in violation of defined by this directive, under cover of, and promoting a, ', one in a regression of the quality of a country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1714"> The maintenance of the universal service to the assistance of a compensation Fund which enable engaging the advantage of public service will probably long fire. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1715"> These limits and these delays have also contributed to a debate in which they often confuses the end and the means. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1716"> They do not know about this, Madam President, to say nothing of the economic and social development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1717"> Madam President, allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, because he has really a complex, difficult and it is to find a balance between the proposals, and the points of departure and completely. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1718"> I fear that this proposal increases the current position of the monopoly in the cost of the taxpayer and increase the threshold of the new arrivals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1719"> I am also delighted to see that our friends from the continent, the example of the British. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1720"> Of course, I admit that the aim in itself is not a problem and that it can be advantageous for the consumers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1721"> Considering the, because it is part of the logic of the founders of the European Union, which put forward the accomplishment of the internal market by the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1722"> The universal service is the cornerstone of the policy of the Community in this area and that we are doing all this aims to create a climate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1723"> The services also constitute a sector where the innovation and modernisation must be encouraged. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1724"> According to him, before the end of the decade, opening up to competition of the internal market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1725"> I believe that it is necessary to give solid order in which the universal service and its obligations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1726"> This is why I cannot and will not remain silent when the future of the sector is threatened by a decision that would not as it has to respond to the challenges which we have all at Lisbon. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1727"> Thank you very much, Mr Simpson. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1728"> However, I would remind you that this common organisation of the market has the main objective of the guarantee of access to the Community market of its products. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1729"> I am happy that we have been able to reach a unanimous vote in the Committee on agriculture, and I thank my colleagues so that Mr Fernández Martín, rapporteur for the Committee on development and cooperation, for his support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1730"> We can express our concern for the production of bananas of some of the ACP countries, the small countries of the West Indies and some West African countries which are the traditional banana and with which we have taken from the commitments that we cannot forget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1731"> Consequently, I hope that this report is supported in its entirety by the Members of this Assembly, as it was the case to the Committee on agriculture and rural development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1732"> Meanwhile, the United States down in a first but now their own. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1733"> Of the interests at stake, in particular those of the Americans, who are not themselves producers of bananas, but which have the capital in the commercial businesses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1734"> Sometimes it seems that the Commission, in the proposals of trade and agricultural production, goes further than the Cairns Group. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1735"> It is a pity that the Commission and the Council to remain in a resolution likely to jeopardise this production, in particular after 2006. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1736"> The successive of the WTO does not say that it is forbidden to give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1737"> Thus, the period of transition should be around fifteen years and in any case ten years; the compensatory aid must include the guarantee of the incomes of Community producers and the production of the Committee of the regions. it should also include a humanitarian entities which bananas which are produced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1738"> I hope that it will listen to our arguments, because this system proposed by the Commission, this tariff, of 300 million, risks and in the ACP will by the said, 'first come, first served'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1739"> Votes </SEG> 
<SEG id="1740"> (Parliament approved the Commission proposal) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1741"> The Commission refuses to the other amendments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1742"> Before the vote: </SEG> 
<SEG id="1743"> (Parliament accepted the oral amendment) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1744"> Report (A5-0376 / 2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on budgetary control, on the reform of the procedures and the institutions of the budget (2000 / 2008 (INI)) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1745"> The majority of smokers do not know all the risks and does not support the real price of their choice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1746"> I am always kept to this principle in the course of my long parliamentary 35 years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1747"> I fear that their hopes are in vain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1748"> It is a matter of our ultimate attempt to put on the packets of cigarettes and reflect the real dangers of smoking. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1749"> Lehne report (A5-0368 / 2000) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1750"> This analysis seems to me at the time and justified even today, and this is why I have voted against this report in its entirety. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1751"> It is just that the Committee on legal Affairs of the refusal of a ceiling and in the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be 7%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1752"> Is opposed to this directive is also for my Group a means of giving a clear political signal: we must not waste our time to create in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1753"> If it is just the Stalinist dictatorship, how can the slightest confidence in Mr Putin, the people, the godfather of that, of all the opposition parties, civil, political parties (part), in order to reinforce its power? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1754"> Of course, the Indonesia deserves such relations because they cannot say that, over the years, its leaders are by their great spirit and by their great merits, but we need to take into consideration the citizens, and Consequently agreed to this development of relations and these quotas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1755"> The charge that the criminal acts committed by officials of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1756"> The Theato report on the fight against fraud allows to discover that the European Central Bank, without doubt better to prove its independence, was not good to adhere to the agreement on the anti-fraud office (OLAF). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1757"> That concludes the votes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1758"> Either we are part of the club, we are not and we must, therefore, we have to comply with this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1759"> It is therefore not at all - Let us not aim, dear colleagues, a change of name. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1760"> The system only is Nevertheless an important that the balance of the proposal of the Commission and is an important basis which must allow the Council to progress. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1761"> There are measures for the labelling of these bananas in the national programmes and promotion of rural development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1762"> Europe and the United States work related to the values that we share. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1763"> We propose to discuss a new round of the WTO and the implications for this cycle of many commercial initiatives that are the subject of debate in the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1764"> He has said, and rightly so, that the transatlantic relations are much these ten years - to a large extent, it is true, the American side Clinton; but I believe that history will there has also been a contribution to these new relations - positive all fundamental - with the 1990 transatlantic declaration and the new transatlantic agenda adopted under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1765"> It will therefore be important to undertake a reversal of the market and in fact making a transatlantic agenda for the year 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1766"> I will conclude with the Dominican Republic which has: "the WTO was an impartial referee applying common rules and where the countries could learn to play the game. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1767"> Secondly, even if they may be delighted with the decline of the Communist, the collapse of the Soviet Union single superpower: the United States of America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1768"> I know that it maintains a constructive dialogue with Parliament and with the committees dealing with these matters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1769"> The next item is the joint debate on the following reports: </SEG> 
<SEG id="1770"> These objectives, the objective of primary and secondary objectives, the cornerstone of allowing us to judge the concrete proposals by the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1771"> It is obvious that such a solution - in a single country, with the possibility of providing services in the whole of the Union - can bring an avalanche in countries where the rate of taxation is weak. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1772"> Thus, an agreement was reached in 1992, the President as a minimum harmonisation, which envisaged that the normal rate of VAT could be 15%, the Member States having the possibility of applying one or several not being able to 5%; being seen in this case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1773"> We have asked the European Commission to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and of putting a report on this subject in the Council and in Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1774"> In summary, the objective of this proposal is laudable but is badly and if we really want to encourage the economy of Europe, it would be good to our trade problems rather than try to impose our problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1775"> If we want to respect the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases, we have to take all possible measures to restrict their production. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1776"> The only case for which no tax is still being EU is one of a - in the change from a third country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1777"> The positive discrimination in respect of transport must cease. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1778"> The businesses from third countries which are not Members of the Union are not subject to any taxation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1779"> The are not so close, and it would be the tax, while the programmes that circulate by Internet would! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1780"> However, the solution can only be technically and stand in online transactions in the European Union, precisely at the moment where everyone wishes, on the contrary, their expansion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1781"> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the costs of the European Union and lose in yield. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1782"> We should seek to encourage trade and no new ways of the tax. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1783"> The we say that it is the least possible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1784"> The Group was simple that it should apply. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1785"> The Group that I represent in this Assembly, however, an objection and think that it is necessary to balance the situation between the daily, which enjoy a rate of VAT, and the daily in line, which did not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1786"> A taxation can then exist only in the framework of an international agreement, in order to guarantee competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1787"> I welcome the fact that the report highlights one of the points that I have raised in my report for the Committee on regional policy, transport and tourism, by this Parliament a few months ago, namely, that being that it is indeed politically difficult to reach an international agreement on the taxation of aviation, at least in the short term, we should use the tools to obtain the same effect, including a tax on emissions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1788"> In fact, the industry of 100% of its infrastructure via the traffic and the 4 billion, which is contrary to 4 billion dollars in 1998 - contrary to other modes of transport, such as rail transport or by road, which are still. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1789"> The current situation is favourable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1790"> On this subject, which is of note that there is a problem about the emissions caused by traffic without even if the percentage is not so, it increases significantly and we can therefore not underestimate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1791"> This system would be harmful for the SMEs within and outside the Union, in particular, if one considers the proposal to release at the level of the excessively low of 40 000 euros. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1792"> If we are too is in relation to the issue in the review, we are actually in danger of the future trade, important for Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1793"> The principle that the suppliers outside the Community and making the provision of services to customers of the Community should record that in a single and must not be a shift of fiscal income between the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1794"> Given that the debate is not yet finished within the Council, and given that the Commission wants to lead to its term the issue of VAT and trade rather quickly, I think that the most sensible would not yet formally accept the amendments put forward by Parliament, but to try to the greatest possible number of these proposals in the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1795"> I can therefore not accept the amendments proposed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1796"> Thank you very much for all the issues that you have this week. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1797"> Only three months after the accident, the Commission has, as it, its responsibilities by adopting a first package of measures, that the European Parliament has 30 November of this year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1798"> With more than fifteen directives or regulations in force, it is, in fact, an urgent need to standardise practices and to exercise a control of the application of Community rules, in order to avoid, important and unacceptable, within the European Union in the matter of maritime security. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1799"> Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her commitment in the area of maritime security. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1800"> I would like to recall that in the matter of security, in part and in the framework is not in other countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1801"> In the second place, I would say to you that it is the justice which could confiscating or the funds for a company to compensate some damage or other; it is the justice which could establish responsibilities beyond those views according to the basic objectives of the current international on hydrocarbons. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1802"> The Commission considers that such must go in the direction of a system of more also encourages a more rational and more efficient use of the road network. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1803"> Faced with criticisms, particularly those of Ireland and France, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has given a new interpretation: it is now a matter of resources for all users, including the drivers of heavy goods vehicles. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1804"> I am, to guarantee that the food consumers more stringent standards, that it comes from the internal market or the administration of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1805"> Of course I understand the concern of the honourable Member. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1806"> I am sorry to have to tell you, Commissioner, for your reply. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1807"> The comments of the process are important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1808"> In Nigeria, encouraging the violence in their employment and go up to pay soldiers to draw on the demonstrators at the basis of warri. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1809"> In its report on 15 November, the Commission has concluded that the aid the functioning of the regulation 1540 / 98 had not the problem of prices by the South. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1810"> I believe that all of us is reassuring, but, in the meantime, the fact is that our shipyards are closing their doors. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1811"> Question 38 (H-0868 / 00): </SEG> 
<SEG id="1812"> I understand, Commissioner, that you do not want to change your decision in spite of the fact that ten Member States are opposed to such as. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1813"> This initiative is based on a Council regulation amending the regulation, which defines the current GSP. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1814"> I represent some farmers and I am therefore very concerned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1815"> We are working on this in the Committee, we have not taken this week, Poul Nielson being absent because of movement in the Balkans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1816"> One is in the process of working on the safeguard clause and if Mr Clegg has need of arguments, to speak with his, I want at its disposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1817"> I would like to thank Mr Liikanen for his question, that is, which is very positive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1818"> I will discuss it with my services when the resources for next year will be defined. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1819"> Currently, the efforts by my services and myself aim to limit the consequences of the distance between the parties and the future Court. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1820"> The example of the courts in the patent law, and other German cities, but also of London, a Court in the matter of Community patents should be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1821"> In order to avoid this situation not to take a final, the Commission, on 13 July of last year, in a letter to the Member States of their obligation to indicate what are their effect in the field of Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1822"> As the honourable Member knows, the cost of a complaint in itself has no influence on the project. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1823"> Question 47 (H-0877 / 00): </SEG> 
<SEG id="1824"> This means, therefore, that the Commission makes use of the legal instruments that are at its disposal in the sense that, in the regulation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1825"> The question is to know which must address these to understand that, when they follow this cycle of 'and the' in Italy, they have the right to have results. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1826"> The King,, for example, could, for example, be chosen among the Finnish more. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1827"> It can also be as a question of competition, since they can continue to practise of duty-free sales in the southern part of the Baltic, on the line between Stockholm and Helsinki, whilst they are between Umeå and Vasa. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1828"> We must rectify the situation by stimulating and encouraging the multilingual content, given that it is absolutely crucial to the success of the European area of content. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1829"> The problem which is more than the small businesses do not always have sufficient guarantees, or to give investors. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1830"> To take the projects of this programme, it is necessary to simplify and procedures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1831"> It is for this reason that the measures of public subsidies in favour of the content industry of the EU (their usefulness has been) must also tend towards a culture and a high level and towards the cultural diversity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1832"> On the other hand, there is the fear of communication which need to fill the gap and that their potential as being one of the contents, hoard and exploit without care really production. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1833"> Mr President, I am very pleased about the launch of this programme and would like to draw attention to two aspects. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1834"> This is why I support the amendments which call for the adoption of actions in the field of new technologies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1835"> Firstly, the Commission is delighted that Parliament emphasises the social dimension and cultural content. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1836"> The assessment and management of environmental noise </SEG> 
<SEG id="1837"> I am indeed grateful for the support that the European, and that as a part of the Liberal Group, have brought to this amendment, to begin to restrict noise pollution caused by aeroplanes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1838"> It is that this year, six years late, and under the pressing pressure from the French government, that the Commission has presented its initial proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1839"> This is a proposal of Scandinavia has already stricter standards than those proposed for 2012. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1840"> , Schiphol, Barcelona and other meet strict standards. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1841"> Another important point by us and that all its importance in the framework of the problematic missions, relates, concerns the indications of the one mentioned by the rapporteur. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1842"> By lack of common standards in the European Union, we have situations of competition distortion of competition between airports and lack of equality between the citizens of the different Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1843"> This is why I find the amendments of my colleague, Bernd Lange so important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1844"> First of all, I must say that I am delighted with this report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1845"> This was the idea of principle behind amendment no 36, although I think that this idea is not yet sufficiently ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1846"> We should it carefully and adopt the approach on the two plans, that is to say to fix limit values for each source of on the one hand, and on the other hand, to define standards for these missions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1847"> We need more time and I regret that we have not prepared, even if, in a way, I support the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1848"> The Member States have given comparable information, the Commission will take into account the question of limit values in the Community, so that other measures in order to reduce the number of people affected by the noise and to refer to the Council and to Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1849"> Food additives other than colours and the </SEG> 
<SEG id="1850"> Those are the three criteria. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1851"> Thank you, dear colleague and I feel because of your question, because if you have a carrot in my throat, I have as I like in the says, as they say to us, but the flu runs somewhat here. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1852"> In addition, in the case of the problems of, the risk of cancer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1853"> It is then also found that the Commission did not have the instruments to intervene. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1854"> Tomorrow, a new stage in most of our colleague, Mrs Paulsen, from the Liberal Group, will then still and will have the opportunity to improve the present directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1855"> The Member States and the Commission will have to present a better instrument for ensuring that Community law in the field of animal nutrition is properly applied and to make sure that, in the case of situations of crisis appear in third countries, be possible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1856"> We know that the great majority of Europeans live in cities and that up to now, it is mainly the cities that have been the poor relations "in the matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1857"> The process of planning must be implemented in a fair and innovative. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1858"> The multiannual programme 'for sustainable urban environment is an instrument to achieve this, the application of the agenda 21 is an excellent means of coordination and actions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1859"> The reduction of transport and the abandonment of fossil fuels in the Community are necessary to reach a change from the point of view of the threats that we know today. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1860"> Many voices have suggested that this budget was too. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1861"> It is envisaged that the main partners in this part of the Commission and the local authorities, which again is to develop and implement policies relating to sustainable development in urban environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1862"> The Court of justice of the European communities and even the organs of the bodies of the WTO that the precautionary principle is to be applied in environmental or in the matter of public health, and sometimes even against, as the business cheese raw milk. </SEG>
