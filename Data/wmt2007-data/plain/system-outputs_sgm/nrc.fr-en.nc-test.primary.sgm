<seg id=1>The racial Europe's House Divided</seg>
<seg id=2>The extreme right is characterized by its European racism and its use of the issue of immigration as divergence policy.</seg>
<seg id=3>Northern League in Italy, the Netherlands, the Vlaams Blok supporters of the National Front of Le Pen in France, are all examples of parties or trained movements on the subject of the current aversion towards immigrants and promoting political simplistic to control.</seg>
<seg id=4>While people as Jorg Haidar, Jean-Marie Le Pen can go and (ever come early), the issue will disappear racial ever policy in the near future.</seg>
<seg id=5>An aging population and the borders increasingly open involve growing racial fragmentation in European countries.</seg>
<seg id=6>Mainstream parties of the left and of the law have faced this prospect implementing burying its head in the hoping, against all expectations that the problem would disappear.</seg>
<seg id=7>It will not, as history shows clearly racial of America.</seg>
<seg id=8>Relations even in the US have monopolised decades - and crisis - always to the fore policy, to the point that the divisions racial occupy a place as important as incomes, if not more, as factors of preferences attitudes and policies.</seg>
<seg id=9>The first step to address policy racial is to understand the origin and the effects of racial animosity, even if this means the discovery of unpleasant truths to hear.</seg>
<seg id=10>This is precisely the aim largely by research teams in economics, sociology, in psychology in political science and the US.</seg>
<seg id=11>This research shows that representatives of different races are much less confidence together; whites are less prone to support spending of welfare which, according to them, contribute minorities communities; more fragmented racialement governments have less efficient, of corruption and a traffic influence, greater rate higher crime and less productive public goods by dollar imposed.</seg>
<seg id=12>This does not mean we should eliminate the heterogeneity and create communities racialement homogeneous, but it is necessary to acknowledge the reality of these problems to begin to establish sound public policy concerning racial relations.</seg>
<seg id=13>Of course, the Americans contest methods use.</seg>
<seg id=14>Some will favour for action plans affirmatifs which offer minorities preferences in the allocation of employment, admission to university and public contracts.</seg>
<seg id=15>These policies are seen as a way to offer repairs for injustices of the past and, more importantly, to create models of role and overcoming discrimination remaining and perhaps unintentionally.</seg>
<seg id=16>Other protest against action and support so that a policy that does not concern the race, together with free market policies and values pro family, enough to create jobs for minorities and to help not separate the black families.</seg>
<seg id=17>The latter is crucial in any policy because one of the most important causes of poverty in the US is the spread of single parents understand (single mother) in Community black.</seg>
<seg id=18>Whatever the right response, the issue is that the measures to be taken concerning race represents a dominant problem in American policy.</seg>
<seg id=19>Of course, minorities have progressed towards more integration and economic success.</seg>
<seg id=20>In the 1950s, the black, could not sit down before the buses, today two of the main players of American foreign policy are blacks.</seg>
<seg id=21>To be sure, American politicians right-wing continue to deploy the "racial card" as a tool tactics.</seg>
<seg id=22>Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, former assistant to Nixon and Reagan which has brought independent presidential candidate during the last election.</seg>
<seg id=23>It recently published a book entitled "success at the death of the West: how dying immigrant populations and invasion imperil our country and civilization".</seg>
<seg id=24>But for every book as this, there are ten others who behave serious analysis of the question racial in America.</seg>
<seg id=25>The analysis and political debates on racial relations have considerable delay in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=26>At most, the question is addressed to close in terms of immigration quotas and restrictions of borders, not in terms of opportunities and social problems created by a Europe increasingly racialement mixed.</seg>
<seg id=27>Of course, an immigration policy clear is required to prevent the accumulation of immigrants illegally.</seg>
<seg id=28>But we must not stop there: controls at borders Mexico does not mean the end of the US policy on the internal problems of race!</seg>
<seg id=29>Europe is rich and its population is ageing quickly: Europeans, reinforced by programs generous of welfare, are no longer prepared to accept the "dirty" jobs in, say, agriculture and leather sector.</seg>
<seg id=30>This attitude makes inevitable increase of immigration.</seg>
<seg id=31>But Europeans are quick to criticise the United States for failures of their policy towards minorities and for manifestations of racism on the other side of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id=32>Reading the press European is often appear a complex of superiority towards the US issues racial: they (Americans) have problems with racism; we immunisés against him, with the exception of skinheads neo-Nazis crazy and their similar.</seg>
<seg id=33>What happened in recent weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, demonstrates that the problem is deeper and racial in Europe, as in the US, has to cause the sad truth that racial relations are inherently difficult and that confidence and conduct cooperative do not travel well on racial lines.</seg>
<seg id=34>If mainstream parties of Europe do not commit more seriously to understand racial tensions that exist in their countries and to put the "race" at the heart of their priorities, individuals like Le Pen will try always to try to fill the gap with their message of hatred.</seg>
<seg id=35>To combat exception French</seg>
<seg id=36>The attention of Europe is now all turned and with about towards enlargement and the Constitution being negotiated between Member States.</seg>
<seg id=37>However, the result of several taken of gauloises spats with the European Commission will not less important to determine the fate of the new enlarged Europe.</seg>
<seg id=38>France has unilaterally chosen to ignore the Stability and Growth Pact leaving run its public deficit beyond the limit of 3% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=39>The French like talking about the stringency rational their thinking, but where budgets are concerned, Descartes is for and confusion is entry.</seg>
<seg id=40>France did one of criticism of Ireland when, in 2000, the Irish Government does réduisit its budget surplus, who was then 4%, that a simple 0.5%.</seg>
<seg id=41>Other countries have not respected the Stability Pact, but France is the first country to do with a small smile satisfied méprisant openly.</seg>
<seg id=42>None of this should not surprise.</seg>
<seg id=43>France only apply to European regulations as usual well established to consider its own culture as an exception.</seg>
<seg id=44>Thus, France is systematically veto any reform of the common agricultural policy of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=45>As everyone knows, the CAP is a gift of dead offered to rich farmers Europeans (especially the French farmers) who does not deserve, at the expense of farmers in difficulty of developing countries and of European consumers.</seg>
<seg id=46>France also trying to return to the old policies of renflouement private companies in deficit and about to collapse to great renfort public money.</seg>
<seg id=47>The European Commissioner for competition, Mario Monti, cannot lose this battle: it needs the support of those faith in markets and equal treatment for all.</seg>
<seg id=48>The story is simple.</seg>
<seg id=49>The French government plans to bail out Alstom, a company which has developed products of high-tech, whose high-speed train the high-speed French, but who recently is bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id=50>The French government proclaims it never will abandon its rescue plan for Alstom, a plan which has all the usual dirigiste motives: maintaining employment, investor protection etc.</seg>
<seg id=51>Moreover, insofar as Alstom is a company of high-tech, the French Government plays the map of research and development, arguing that the investment in R & D is beneficial to growth.</seg>
<seg id=52>Save Alstom by nationalising the company is obviously a mistake.</seg>
<seg id=53>The company is educated of different units, some beneficial, other bankrupt: it is clear that the dismantling.</seg>
<seg id=54>Units beneficial, such as the TGV, will easily buyer; deficit units must be closed.</seg>
<seg id=55>French taxpayers' money can be spent in the costs of conversion of temporary workers rather than to keep alive a company is not beneficial.</seg>
<seg id=56>It is important that the European Commission does not allow to France to tailler laws on measure for itself in policies on competition, as it seems to be doing so with budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=57>The Commission must condemn the public financing of private companies in France as it condemns subsidies in any EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id=58>The Commission has already achieved some success on this side here, particularly in forcing Germany to cancel government guarantees the public banks.</seg>
<seg id=59>Alstom particular and France in general should not be exception and must meet the same standards.</seg>
<seg id=60>If the Commission does not respond, EU ressemblera even more to court for recreational French officials.</seg>
<seg id=61>France has already taken the lead in EU foreign policy with its Foreign Minister, Dominique de Villepin, who is and looks increasingly a Foreign Minister of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=62>At the same time, France ignored the regulations essential a common economic policy and government aid to companies.</seg>
<seg id=63>The European Commission will lose t it the credibility that it is finally to resemble a district in Paris less important?</seg>
<seg id=64>Losing on the question of Alstom would have serious repercussions in Europe and not just for policies on competition.</seg>
<seg id=65>The war for oil</seg>
<seg id=66>For decades, as the Republicans, Democrats continue objectives in the field: oil maintain as possible stability of oil prices, reduce smooth internal consumption, reduce the dependence on imports and related to diversify the sources of supply foreign.</seg>
<seg id=67>Despite appearances, these goals are always the same today, under the Bush administration.</seg>
<seg id=68>Many observers believe that with the invasion of Iraq, Bush chose another way.</seg>
<seg id=69>A significant increase in production increase probably the Iraqi oil dependency on us.</seg>
<seg id=70>The price of a barrel of oil fall probably with the emergence of a new source of supply, of which an increased dependence of us, particularly to the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=71>It is paradoxical to see that the US were more control over Iraqi oil in food program "against" of the UN oil before the war (it was when the UN, not Saddam Hussein who established the exports Iraqi) they can only do so in the context of future democratic Iraqi state.</seg>
<seg id=72>If the Bush administration sought of sources of supply oil stable, secure and diversified and cheap, it was sufficient to lift the embargo imposed to Libya, in Iran, Iraq, Sudan and to sink oil.</seg>
<seg id=73>But America's interest to Iraqi oil is not dictated by the economy or by energy policy.</seg>
<seg id=74>The Bush administration has admitted that Iraqi oil is primarily a geopolitical asset.</seg>
<seg id=75>Who controls Iraqi oil controls, Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=76>Saddam had its power controlled the fact that the second world oil reserves.</seg>
<seg id=77>He knew perfectly what it was in black gold.</seg>
<seg id=78>Faced with the possibility of the invasion and defeat, he threatened to to fire Iraqi oil fields.</seg>
<seg id=79>The saccage and plunder the facilities and Iraqi oil pipelines shows that almost everyone has understood that control oil is controlling the country.</seg>
<seg id=80>During the preparation of the invasion by the US, securing the oil fields was a priority.</seg>
<seg id=81>The aim was not an increase in supply or lower prices on the American market, but the overthrow of Saddam and its replacement by a new government.</seg>
<seg id=82>The future of Iraq is linked to the oil production.</seg>
<seg id=83>But given the vagaries of the oil market, especially in a situation as unstable, it is hard to see how the Bush administration will achieve its objectives in the years ahead.</seg>
<seg id=84>The problem is simple.</seg>
<seg id=85>The US must use oil revenues to alleviate the burden of change of Iraqi regime based on the American taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id=86>In the long term, any reconstruction plan depends on the ability of Iraq to export large volumes of oil.</seg>
<seg id=87>If Iraq does not produce oil, President Bush cannot keep the promises he made the Iraqi people, the American people and to the international community.</seg>
<seg id=88>Before the invasion of Iraq was a production capacity of three million barrels of oil per day.</seg>
<seg id=89>But it will return to that level of production in time to establish an Iraqi government.</seg>
<seg id=90>An increase in production requires development facilities oil, which requires large investments, a government in place and political stability.</seg>
<seg id=91>No one, the Bush administration, it is expected that these conditions are met soon.</seg>
<seg id=92>Political stability is the first condition to increase production capacity.</seg>
<seg id=93>The experience of Iran, Kuwait, Russia, and even of Iraq, shows that around three years of political stability before production capacity can increase significantly and sustainable.</seg>
<seg id=94>It will take several years for Iraq to draft a new Constitution, establish a democratic government, negotiate the distribution of oil revenue between different regions, investments and to regulate the economy appealing to foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id=95>He also need time to negotiate with the multinational oil companies and neighbors achieving feasibility studies and technical studies needed, as well as reconstruction, the State and the exploration of its oil fields.</seg>
<seg id=96>Also, even a period of 3 years seems optimistic, because it assumes that during this time the occupation, and the Iraqis are establish their own government, an end to political instability.</seg>
<seg id=97>But the real risk of any.</seg>
<seg id=98>The tensions important can survive for years.</seg>
<seg id=99>And it is not surprising that the production of Iraqi oil interrompe brutally, even with a democratic government.</seg>
<seg id=100>History shows that the strikes and social unrest that can désorganiser output occur more easily in a democratic context that under a dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id=101>If Iraq is unable to increase its oil production in the years to come, it will be a thorn in the foot, both for foreign policy for energy policy in the US.</seg>
<seg id=102>How recent able finance long-term reconstruction of Iraq?</seg>
<seg id=103>That payera for maintaining a fragile democracy in Iraq?</seg>
<seg id=104>The us able keep their occupation without ensuring the food the Iraqi people, medical care and other basic services?</seg>
<seg id=105>These are difficult issues, and we cannot respond before that democratic control and does not guarantee the Iraqi oil production.</seg>
<seg id=106>Let the murderous defend human rights</seg>
<seg id=107>If it was not so sad, it would be the joke macabre millennium: Libya was elected to chair the UN Commission on Human Rights!</seg>
<seg id=108>When caligula has appointed his horse in the Senate, horse, at least, had not blood on its sabots.</seg>
<seg id=109>Of course, the procedure was perfectly legal: the presidency changes every year a region of the world to another.</seg>
<seg id=110>This year, it was the turn of Africa to appoint the President and has appointed Libya.</seg>
<seg id=111>Only the United States and Canada voted against.</seg>
<seg id=112>Began their shame infinite, European countries have.</seg>
<seg id=113>This says a lot about moral bankruptcy UN that this decision comes at a delicate moment for this organization.</seg>
<seg id=114>President Bush has challenged the UN to demonstrate their serious about their own decisions mandatory Iraq: otherwise, they can see the same fate ignominieux that society Nations, which has been powerless in the 1930s when it has found facing the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany and Italy's fascist.</seg>
<seg id=115>The election of Libya to chair a United Nations body charged to respect human rights at present does little to support the legitimacy or the moral authority of the body.</seg>
<seg id=116>Remember that Libya is a tyranny totalitarian; its leader, Muammar Ghaddafi, combines conduct sometimes to changing policies extremists by supporting dictators around the world.</seg>
<seg id=117>He leads one of the most tyrannical regimes in the world, in which no sham election, and where opinions contrary are European instantly.</seg>
<seg id=118>Under his rule, Libya has supported terrorist organisations around the world, from the IRA to the many Palestinian extremist groups.</seg>
<seg id=119>It always encourt UN sanctions for the role it has played in the attack a theft Pan Am above Lockerbie in Scotland, ten years ago.</seg>
<seg id=120>Over the last decade, the position of the United Nations as a symbol of ideals a peaceful world community has regularly been undermined.</seg>
<seg id=121>They have entirely unable to stop the war in the Balkans and in at least one case, Srebrenica, forces for the Dutch UN peacekeeping remained here and have witnessed the worst massacre in postwar Europe while the Bosnian Serbs massacraient around 6,000 Muslims without defence.</seg>
<seg id=122>A committee of inquiry has admitted that the Dutch later battalion Dutch UN was, indeed, complicit in this war crime.</seg>
<seg id=123>In Rwanda, when genocide began, the United Nations representative for peacekeeping operations ordered the evacuation of UN forces of the country, leaving the scope to genocide the bloodiest since the second world war.</seg>
<seg id=124>The name of the United Nations representative, Kofi Annan.</seg>
<seg id=125>It is a past depressing and pathetic that the UN, probably trying in vain, to buy in appearing in the Iraq crisis, as the voice of reason and international legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id=126>But at a time when the UN inspections in Iraq like to send to the Salvation Army to remove a strip gangsters, it may be that the election of Libya head of the Human Rights Commission is an historic date, that of the failure of a final organization whose creation had raised great hope.</seg>
<seg id=127>The organizations do not usually die, and certainly, there is too much reason State not to ensure that the UN will continue obstacle.</seg>
<seg id=128>But they will not be a mere shadow of what they should and could be.</seg>
<seg id=129>The United Nations today to give hypocrisy a bad reputation.</seg>
<seg id=130>Supporters of the authority are</seg>
<seg id=131>Last Thursday, the judges of the Court's central Jakarta Indonesia was sentenced to one year prison.</seg>
<seg id=132>I am guilty, as editor of the weekly newsmagazine tempo, according to the tribunal, of defamation towards tomy winata, a magnat business, having heard under its possible involvement in a fire in the textile market of Southeast Asia in Jakarta and having fomented riots by broadcasting of lies.</seg>
<seg id=133>My case and other similar cases présagent they once again the end of a short experience democratic Indonesia?</seg>
<seg id=134>"The riots" I fomentée occurred in March of last year, when almost 200 thugs is demanding of winata attacked the offices of tempo, threatening to setting building, harcelant personnel and injuring a journalist.</seg>
<seg id=135>To try to resolve the situation in a peaceful, I was persuaded to negotiate the Bureau police central in Jakarta and there découvris, horrified that leaders that the clique had taken power as police.</seg>
<seg id=136>I was struck by the fist coups and foot while the police laissèrent do.</seg>
<seg id=137>Fortunately, many journalists came to our help with magnétophones and cameras register for events.</seg>
<seg id=138>The dissemination of these images déclencha the public outrage and força Parliament to open an inquiry.</seg>
<seg id=139>Officials of the national police and police in Jakarta were called and, because of the pressure of public opinion, the leaders of this clique were convicted.</seg>
<seg id=140>However, winata échappa himself to police investigation declaring simply publicly that its supporters agirent without the informed and without its agreement.</seg>
<seg id=141>It porta charges himself thereafter, against Ahmad taufik, the author of Article, teuku iskandar Ali, the editor, and myself.</seg>
<seg id=142>The hearings of the trial durèrent a year were marked by a series of developments suspects all support winata.</seg>
<seg id=143>First, the case mounted by the police and the prosecutor contained so clearly forged documents that two inculpa police officers.</seg>
<seg id=144>But the Court rejeta our request for suspension hearings until clarifying the law on the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id=145>The case against the officers involved does lead nowhere.</seg>
<seg id=146>On the contrary, one of them has been promoted to lead the new anti-terrorist unit in Jakarta which has just been created (and is financed by the US).</seg>
<seg id=147>The other, has been told, back to school police to receive a specialized training.</seg>
<seg id=148>Then, after six months of hearings, the judge's principal panel of three judges was suddenly promoted to take the lead a tribunal city at a time of Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id=149>One of my lawyers remarqua that 35 years of practice in court, he had never seen a judge main be replaced being affair.</seg>
<seg id=150>In fact, despite its promotion, the judge continua to preside another case in the building.</seg>
<seg id=151>A judge who in the past had ruled against tempo at the trial civilian brought by winata came replacing.</seg>
<seg id=152>Finally, winata in his testimony, présenta a false testimony by denying have been interviewed by tempo.</seg>
<seg id=153>Registration of the telephone was circulated in the hearings, the journalist having done the interview and the two editors are assistèrent témoignèrent under oath, the company of telephone produisit official documents attesting to this phone call as evidence of its existence and experts attestèrent that the voice of the registration was that of tomy winata.</seg>
<seg id=154>Yet the judges rejetèrent's request tempo asking the arrest of winata to trial for false testimony and we conseillèrent of complaint police, something that we made.</seg>
<seg id=155>The justices then rejected our request for postponement of the decision-making of court until the case of false testimony of Mr winata be judged.</seg>
<seg id=156>Given all these defects of form, my conviction and my prison are hardly surprising.</seg>
<seg id=157>But I guard hope to win in the end when the tempo will be brought to the higher agencies.</seg>
<seg id=158>The courts Indonesia higher are more environmentally ethics and the head of the Supreme Court is a defender of democracy and freedom of expression of the case tempo may become a decisive step for our democracy, as the infamous decision, the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of the New York Times against Sullivan.</seg>
<seg id=159>Having met the threshold of tolerance in the accusations against defamation, this decision has allowed us to press for those accounts public affairs.</seg>
<seg id=160>No country knows better than Indonesia that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are indicators tested democratic development and that the penalties journalists is one of the first symptoms of authoritarianism.</seg>
<seg id=161>Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the 1950s, before the gagging the press by President Sukarno, helped by the junta in 1956.</seg>
<seg id=162>Any criticism was suffocated, consolidation of power without against power was easy and, in July, 1959 Sukarno put declare the beginning of "democracy" enlightened.</seg>
<seg id=163>During the first few years that suivirent the fall of Sukarno in 1966, all the benefits of a real democracy, including freedom of the press were restored (except for Communists).</seg>
<seg id=164>But the regime of President Suharto lança is also muzzling the press in the early 1970s, by suspending various newspapers and imprisoning many journalists.</seg>
<seg id=165>The press muzzled, other political rights were violated quickly and democracy Indonesian disparut once more.</seg>
<seg id=166>Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the first Muslim community democratic of history.</seg>
<seg id=167>Free elections, fair and peaceful held twice for the European Parliament elections and the direct election of the President, including the last presidential elections, showing the co possible existence between Islam and democracy.</seg>
<seg id=168>The enemies of democracy will depend, never.</seg>
<seg id=169>The groups Islamic extremists have embarked in bomb attacks without distinction, while the groups to authoritarian tendencies been made a breakthrough in circles close President Megawati.</seg>
<seg id=170>But Mrs Megawati has losing the recent presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id=171>Susilo, the newly elected President, will he t of persecuting journalists?</seg>
<seg id=172>My conviction, and the trial and sentencing other journalists, t it will mark the beginning of the end of the third democracy Indonesian if hard won?</seg>
<seg id=173>The answer lies in the support that democratic activists Indonesia can generate nationalement and internationally.</seg>
<seg id=174>Losing Indonesia, torch potential in the hope of all democratic activists within the Muslim world, would be a terrible defeat.</seg>
<seg id=175>The moral of capital punishment</seg>
<seg id=176>We often reproach the US their refusal to abolish the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=177>Many people to claim today that the abolition of capital punishment is a necessary condition for a civilized system of criminal law.</seg>
<seg id=178>The Nobel Gary Becker is not view.</seg>
<seg id=179>European governments are resolutely opposed to the death penalty -- the European Union is completely forbidden, and some Europeans consider its use in the United States is barbarism.</seg>
<seg id=180>Indeed, many European intellectuals think that the death penalty, and any penalty in general, do not deters criminals.</seg>
<seg id=181>But while Europeans, with crime rate is lower than in the US during the last century, have long afford some "soft" about most crimes, it saw their crime rate increase brutal way over the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=182>On the contrary, American rates have fallen partly due to the increased use of punishment.</seg>
<seg id=183>The capital punishment in part.</seg>
<seg id=184>I am for the execution of some people accused of murder because, and for this reason only, that prevents other murders.</seg>
<seg id=185>If I do not believe was, I am opposed to capital punishment, because the revenge and other incentives possible should not serve as a basis to public policy.</seg>
<seg id=186>Serious empirical research on capital punishment in the United States started with a study Isaac Ehrlich in 1975, published in the American economic review.</seg>
<seg id=187>Some studies that followed sometimes have discovered a power of deterrence much weaker, other effect much stronger.</seg>
<seg id=188>However, the information available are fairly limited, should not be based solely on conclusions econometric evidence.</seg>
<seg id=189>Obviously, public policy on the punishment can hope evidence perfect.</seg>
<seg id=190>But even with the evidence quantitative limited, we have good reason to believe deterrent power of capital punishment are adequate.</seg>
<seg id=191>Most people, and the killers in particular, the fear of death, especially when it follows quickly and almost inexorably the perpétration a murder.</seg>
<seg id=192>As David Hume about suicide, "no man has never rejected life as it was worth being lived.</seg>
<seg id=193>That is our horror of natural death … "Similarly, schopenhauer believed that" when the horrors of life reach the point where they exceed the horrors of death, man puts an end to his life.</seg>
<seg id=194>But the terreurs of death oppose considerable resistance... "</seg>
<seg id=195>Opponents to death often proclaiming that the state has no right to life, morally, to anyone, even that of murderous most reprehensible.</seg>
<seg id=196>But it is a conclusion at the wrong to think that the death penalty is deterrent.</seg>
<seg id=197>To see why, supposez that for every murderous executed, (instead, say, to be sentenced to prison for life - the number of killing be reduced to three, which is a figure far below the Ehrlich and to other estimates the effect of deterrence.</seg>
<seg id=198>This means that for every murderous not even executed, three innocent périront.</seg>
<seg id=199>Indeed, the government would "" indirectly many lives if he did not use of the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=200>Save three innocent lives per person carried out seems a very attractive market, and even two lives saved by execution is a cost / benefit ratio persuasive for the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=201>We must agree however that the argument for capital punishment becomes less decided when the number of lives saved every execution fall.</seg>
<seg id=202>But even if one lives were saved in every execution, the market can be desirable if life saved is much better than life suppressed, which is usually the case.</seg>
<seg id=203>Much protest to the idea to compare the qualities of life saved and which is suppressed.</seg>
<seg id=204>But I do not see how such avoid comparison.</seg>
<seg id=205>Take the case of a criminal of career flying and killing a victim who was a life correct and leaves many children and partner behind it.</seg>
<seg id=206>Supposez it is possible to save the life of an innocent victim in executing a criminal such.</seg>
<seg id=207>It seems obvious that save the lives of such victim must weigh more heavily than to life criminal.</seg>
<seg id=208>Obviously, all cases are not as clear, but a comparison of individual qualities lives must be part of any social policy reasonable.</seg>
<seg id=209>That is also why the capital punishment should be used for the killing and not for less serious crimes.</seg>
<seg id=210>When it comes to choose between take lives and, for example, reduce the flight of private property, the thesis of punishment more Clément is more powerful.</seg>
<seg id=211>Although serious aggression, including some horrendous rapes, approaching sometimes killings in their seriousness, and possibly call the death penalty, I am not for its use in such cases.</seg>
<seg id=212>One of the main arguments de to death for killing is "deterrent marginal."</seg>
<seg id=213>If the aggression were punished with the death penalty, this pousserait the aggressors to kill their victims not to be uncovered (which is a major reason for the severity of punishment is proportionate to the seriousness of crimes).</seg>
<seg id=214>One of the complications could be but a murderous would fight with more pugnacity to avoid being caught, which could cause more deaths.</seg>
<seg id=215>But, although deterrence marginal is important, I believe that the resistance of murderous their capture, sometimes at the expense of their own lives, really is an indirect evidence that criminals fear capital punishment.</seg>
<seg id=216>Of course the risk to execute innocent concerns me.</seg>
<seg id=217>My support for the capital punishment faiblirait much if the rate of execution innocent people was important much the claim.</seg>
<seg id=218>However, I believe that the trial call in the US offer protection enormous, not so much against unfair that sentences against unfair executions, which means that there is that very little, or not at all, in cases of people out of which it is proven that they were innocent.</seg>
<seg id=219>And this was immensely consolidated by the development of the identification by the DNA.</seg>
<seg id=220>I say again that the debate on the death penalty is a debate on the power of deterrence (which can be diminished by calls too long).</seg>
<seg id=221>I can understand that some remain sceptical of the existing evidence, although I think they are wrong about this as well as on the question of common sense the problem.</seg>
<seg id=222>It is very disturbing to life someone, even that of a murderous but sometimes extremely unpleasant acts are needed to prevent the behavior worse causing the deaths of innocent.</seg>
<seg id=223>The people against Putin</seg>
<seg id=224>I contributed to the choice of Vladimir Putin to succeed, the first democratically elected President Boris Yeltsin.</seg>
<seg id=225>Given that such structures the KGB and the Mafia lead today Russia and manipulate the judicial system, it is agreed that Yeltsin itself wanted choose his successor to avoid prosecution.</seg>
<seg id=226>But we, who have chosen Putin, who were able to find a successor to pursue the reforms started by Yeltsin, not someone who, protect, he and his family.</seg>
<seg id=227>Yeltsin did fear of nothing and thought to its own survival, but to the survival of the idea democratic he introduced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=228>This idea is now threatened by the successor that we chose.</seg>
<seg id=229>I am not seeking to deny the responsibility of my support Putin.</seg>
<seg id=230>We were not intimate friends, but he and I worked together in critical situations, and I have never doubted its sincerity.</seg>
<seg id=231>Putin is According to convictions.</seg>
<seg id=232>The problem is that its convictions, including the belief that Russia can prosper only if it is led by a single source of power, are wrong.</seg>
<seg id=233>And this serious error is taking to Russia to its ruin policy.</seg>
<seg id=234>Obviously, no one can have a job to high responsibility without commit of misunderstandings, even the fundamental mistakes, and this is particularly true when times are troubled.</seg>
<seg id=235>Yeltsin was not exception to the rule, but it recognized its mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=236>When it from 31 December 1999, he asked forgiveness Having triggered the war in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id=237>Putin, by contrast, seems unable to recognize and accept its mistakes, and persists in policy that long after its failure becomes glaring in the eyes of the world.</seg>
<seg id=238>One of the mistakes of Yeltsin was its failure to put the moral priorities from the program of reform.</seg>
<seg id=239>Russia should have been repent Stalinism and system of gulags.</seg>
<seg id=240>The entire nation, without exception, should have repent, as the Germans have since 1945.</seg>
<seg id=241>This failure, because he has allowed the unconditional Putin's faith in the central authority leads to new capture of State by the security services.</seg>
<seg id=242>Indeed, a direct consequences of repentance national should have been the ban communist party and the disqualification of any political post of who worked for the KGB.</seg>
<seg id=243>Even if such TRIS policies are not mere in societies post-communist, where victims and collaborators were so many and the border between the two if sometimes increasingly, a viable solution could be found, as the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id=244>The choice of doing nothing has left the security structures Russian indemnes and capable of their return on the political stage, what they have now.</seg>
<seg id=245>The resurrection political structures KGB under Putin, and their efforts to silence dissidences, have again transformed Russia in a country transfuges.</seg>
<seg id=246>It is impossible to silence the politicians and independent media without stifling the financial sources independent, which explains the Kremlin, Putin has concentrated its attacks on the so-called "oligarchs."</seg>
<seg id=247>The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his trial were orchestrated for this precise reason.</seg>
<seg id=248>Removing independent financial sources, the security services which dominate the Kremlin hoped destroy independent politics in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=249>Without bases of independent thought, is a climate of fear that up.</seg>
<seg id=250>But the fear not only degrading, it does not allow to govern.</seg>
<seg id=251>Yeltsin had intuitively understood that fear and decision-making centralized and downward could not be the right way to lead a modern country, and it was therefore insisted reform relations between citizens and the state.</seg>
<seg id=252>Putin understands is still not a centralized political system is also unable to understand and errors today than it was in the Soviet era.</seg>
<seg id=253>Unless a robust education, Putin is, quite truly, carrying out Russia towards the same disintegration than that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet state.</seg>
<seg id=254>The people are beginning to realize.</seg>
<seg id=255>We see that the desire to create a modern state Putin sound and effective cannot be achieved, because a modern state is governed not the upper hand but by citizens informed which force their leaders to recognize and correct its mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=256>Putin, too, seems suspicion powerlessness of his regime.</seg>
<seg id=257>This is one reason made Russia if aggressive with its neighbours, Ukraine and Georgia, and that the push to maintain a military presence in places like transdniestrie, secessionist region of Moldova.</seg>
<seg id=258>In imposing the neighbouring regions, Russia, the Kremlin thinks that it can persuade the Russians his omnipotence.</seg>
<seg id=259>Given that the debates in Russia are châtrés and that the Kremlin is able to manipulate the election, a change of regime is the only way it is to preserve the idea of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=260>It is vain to cling to the illusions.</seg>
<seg id=261>Those who oppose Putin need to decide what they want and announce that if the regime fail to enforce the Constitution, they have the right to the force there by any means.</seg>
<seg id=262>Today, the question of power in Russia can no longer decide to vote.</seg>
<seg id=263>As in Ukraine, Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan, it will decide the streets.</seg>
<seg id=264>- (dépensez imposez svp)</seg>
<seg id=265>An excessive taxation can émousser the encouragement and impede growth.</seg>
<seg id=266>But a tax insufficient can also produce the same effects.</seg>
<seg id=267>Governments with a recipe fiscal thin cannot provide the essential public goods.</seg>
<seg id=268>Worse still, a low tax revenue in poor countries often result of faults inherent in recovery systems of tax (rather than tax rates low) that encourage the not productivity.</seg>
<seg id=269>India illustrates the importance of a fiscal system designed.</seg>
<seg id=270>In Bangalore, high-tech companies to have built on campus of class of international foisonnant pelouses impeccables and communications networks of data ultra-liberal faster.</seg>
<seg id=271>Out of these campus, however, extend the open sewers, waste not addition and roads in a state of decay forward.</seg>
<seg id=272>While companies technological pass instantly of téraoctets of data to continents distant, transport local advance a pace almost medieval.</seg>
<seg id=273>Therefore, companies to exploit their own Bangalore bus services, under dealing with private suppliers to have of drinking water, and to generate installent to protect themselves against the current failures.</seg>
<seg id=274>The state cannot compensate for this disaster because it is bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id=275>Debt Government of India exceeds 70% of GDP, so that more than half of its tax revenues are enshrined in repayment interests.</seg>
<seg id=276>But the debt is not the of excessive expenditure in the past.</seg>
<seg id=277>Spending Government of India represent around 15% of GNP, with an average of about 40% of GDP in the OECD.</seg>
<seg id=278>The financial difficulties in India have rather to cause a tax system ill-conceived and badly managed.</seg>
<seg id=279>Rates and the rules for income tax individuals and companies seem reasonable in view of international standards.</seg>
<seg id=280>Nevertheless, the Government of India sees the income tax representative only around 3.7% of GDP, approximately half of those of South Korea, and other Asian Tigers.</seg>
<seg id=281>Agriculture in India represents approximately a quarter GNP, but even rich farmers do not pay tax.</seg>
<seg id=282>The exporting companies in the software industry and in other industries have a temporary from taxation on their profits, although their employees pay taxes on their personal income.</seg>
<seg id=283>Despite reasonable rates of tax fraud is commonplace.</seg>
<seg id=284>Fraud is explained by the fact that the government has not invested in the personnel or in systems to discover the réfractaires taxpayers, who are rarely in prison and that can often be out of business by paying bribes when they take.</seg>
<seg id=285>More subtly still, the loophole "" direct taxes on income and benefits reflects disorder inherent in the system of indirect tax "" imposed on the production and consumption.</seg>
<seg id=286>Excise duties are over 60% of indirect taxes in India, which are in turn the same proportion of its total tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id=287>The right excise basic set to 16% of the value of production of a company.</seg>
<seg id=288>Then follow various cuts, exemptions and surtaxes.</seg>
<seg id=289>For example, a "rate right to conditions for" 8% is money on categories such as food, the allumettes, the son of cotton and computers.</seg>
<seg id=290>A "right" additional excise special 8% is money on products which include filaments in polyester, cars, and conditioners tyres.</seg>
<seg id=291>A "right" additional excise (not to be confused with the "right" special excise) is money on "products" of special importance.</seg>
<seg id=292>The exemptions from excise duties are many and complex, including businesses with total annual incomes below 10 million roupies and companies in certain areas or rough backward.</seg>
<seg id=293>In general, the exemptions to divide in 70 categories, under themselves divided into 259 entered, 52 conditions and 7 lists, each containing many elements.</seg>
<seg id=294>The exemptions incite the abuse.</seg>
<seg id=295>For a certain amount, officials are bottom of the hierarchy, which shows a discretion exemplary in implementing the conditions, can be encouraged to give interpretations are.</seg>
<seg id=296>Products imposed on high rates (for example, the granit polite) are sold as products imposed on lower rates (for example, as the granit not polite).</seg>
<seg id=297>Fraud concerning excise duty is more contagious that tax fraud on the benefits and incomes.</seg>
<seg id=298>If a company fraud excise duties and that the tax rates is high compared margins before taxes in industry, competitors must also frauder just to survive.</seg>
<seg id=299>While fraud increases, governments prélèvent rights "additional" or "special" which incite greater fraud.</seg>
<seg id=300>The perceptions of direct taxes suffer.</seg>
<seg id=301>The bribe paid to percepteur rights excise for a classification of, the difference between the value of granit polite and not polite omission, and the registration of real income create funds "black" which cannot be reported on declaration of forms of income.</seg>
<seg id=302>In addition to weaken the ability of the state to provide essential public goods, systems to escape indirect taxes discourage also companies to adopt technologies more productive, which requires technologies involving a large-scale deployment.</seg>
<seg id=303>But as indirect taxes can more easily issue by deploying several small units instead of one great unity, it is impossible to achieve economies of scale.</seg>
<seg id=304>It is important to note that in the software industry, where all units are exonérées of indirect taxes, Indian companies operate a scale effective.</seg>
<seg id=305>India could imitate the example of China, in which the streamlining of indirect taxes in 1994 has prepared the ground for a great boom?</seg>
<seg id=306>Or the coalition governments in a vigorous democracy are incapable of such reform?</seg>
<seg id=307>Last year, the government led by the BJP India's passed legislation enabling cuts considerable budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id=308>He then appointed a working group to formulate the necessary changes to the policy of public spending and the fiscal policies.</seg>
<seg id=309>In July, the working group has proposed increase taxes (rather than to reduce spending) removing most exemptions indirect taxes, among other things.</seg>
<seg id=310>The new government led by Congress of India seems also promote these proposals.</seg>
<seg id=311>If the Congress and the opposition parties, they will follow much to sustain economic growth of the country and to dispel the idea that democracies cannot take the necessary measures to encourage development.</seg>
<seg id=312>What is the problem with Turkey?</seg>
<seg id=313>On 16 December, Orhan Pamuk, one of the most famous writers Turks, must face a tribunal to Istanbul it must respond to the charge of "insulting national identity" to be in favour of an open discussion on genocide by the Turkish 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916.</seg>
<seg id=314>Pamuk encourt three years in prison.</seg>
<seg id=315>Turkey's efforts to impose fines and prison sentences to those débordent the official convince me that I was right to oppose the opening of negotiations on the accession of this country to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=316>In December 1999, the European Council has lent to Turkey candidate status of the EU, which meant that Turkey into the EU at a future date not yet set.</seg>
<seg id=317>The Council then asked the Commission to decide before October 2004 if Turkey met the political criteria needed for accession, which include democracy, the rule of law and respect the rights of ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg id=318>This was one of the last taken by the Commission, Romano Prodi, which I was a member.</seg>
<seg id=319>Among his 30 members, 29 said that Turkey met with sufficient criteria to continue.</seg>
<seg id=320>I was the only dissident.</seg>
<seg id=321>The report even of the Commission on Turkey, prepared by Günter Verheugen, responsible for EU enlargement, which has motivated my decision.</seg>
<seg id=322>The report mentioned that in 2003, some 21 870 Turks have asked for asylum in the EU, including 2 127 accepted.</seg>
<seg id=323>In other words, the EU governments themselves have recognized in 2003 that the Turkish Government was persecuted over 2,000 of its own citizens.</seg>
<seg id=324>In the meantime, the Commission published a progress report on Turkey believing that reforms will poursuivaient, although at a slower pace, under the government to orientation moderately Islamic Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id=325>This report was nevertheless state serious doubts: the human rights violations, including the practice of torture, continued; the influence military conservait too much scope; freedom of expression was not universally observed; non-Muslim religious minorities and cultural were victims of discrimination and violence against women is not a strong enough rencontrait opposition.</seg>
<seg id=326>The situation has not changed much since the discussions on accession started in October.</seg>
<seg id=327>Beyond the persecution which Pamuk is currently the victim, the unacceptable behavior abound.</seg>
<seg id=328>In March 2005, the police is back intervened in a demonstration celebrating International Women's Day.</seg>
<seg id=329>In May, the greatest Union teacher was banned for having supported education of 14 million Kurds in Turkey in their own language.</seg>
<seg id=330>It is undeniable that intolerance reached until the meetings the Turkish Government.</seg>
<seg id=331>The Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul recently cancelled a brutal a press conference in Copenhagen when he repéré a journalist Kurdish in public that the Danish refused to out.</seg>
<seg id=332>Such acts and such attitudes justify largely my disagreement October 2004.</seg>
<seg id=333>But even if these shortcomings were corrected, Turkey should not even be admitted into the EU, because this is not a European country.</seg>
<seg id=334>Christianity, the féodalité, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, democracy and the industrialization have made us Europeans that we are, but they have not made Turkey what they are.</seg>
<seg id=335>I am not sure that reforms in Turkey, implemented due to the insistence of the European Commission, be continued after accession.</seg>
<seg id=336>I suspect that there would be récidives.</seg>
<seg id=337>Moreover, Turkey's accession certainly lead to that of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and perhaps of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.</seg>
<seg id=338>These first three countries are certainly more European than Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=339>Leaving aside the three Caucasus republics but, including states that have succeeded in Yugoslavia, it would give EU of some 35 Members.</seg>
<seg id=340>What sort of Union would?</seg>
<seg id=341>The EU is not simply a club of friends.</seg>
<seg id=342>It is based on the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.</seg>
<seg id=343>The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, must protect these four fundamental freedoms, which means that it must persuade sometimes, if necessary, to force the Member States to change their legislation.</seg>
<seg id=344>Policies concerning alcohol in Sweden the law, Volkswagen in Germany and the discriminated against funds of foreign investment in France are examples of cases which have made the Commission unpopular.</seg>
<seg id=345>But they were necessary.</seg>
<seg id=346>When I left the Commission, I was by devers me a pile of 1,500 findings of irregularities style.</seg>
<seg id=347>In short, EU membership implies acceptance of deeply incisive measures which affect the internal affairs of a state.</seg>
<seg id=348>This is impossible avèrera with Members too disparate.</seg>
<seg id=349>The EU would fall victim of what historian Paul Kennedy called "imperial surextension."</seg>
<seg id=350>It would dilute in an unacceptable way.</seg>
<seg id=351>For this reason, the former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing feared that Turkish membership would leads to the end of the EU, and that is why the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said Turkey's accession would be more than the EU, could bear. "</seg>
<seg id=352>But the more reason to oppose Turkey's accession is a matter of democracy: the majority of the population of the EU, is simply not.</seg>
<seg id=353>The crisis, Bolivia failure of Latin America</seg>
<seg id=354>Bolivia is not a country typical of Latin America, far from it.</seg>
<seg id=355>And if it were the unrest Haitians, it would be the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere: it even less stable that Haiti as shown in its history and 200 coups State since independence.</seg>
<seg id=356>In a region in past indigenous strong, but at present dispersed and isolated, Bolivia is perhaps, with Guatemala, the only country in Latin America where indigenous peoples represent the majority of the population.</seg>
<seg id=357>Its topography and its distribution ethnic generate autonomy and even secessionist forces that threaten national unity in provocative more than elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id=358>And it is, of course, with Paraguay, the only country in the whole subcontinent deprived of access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id=359>Thus, it would be very careful to extrapolate the crisis currently Bolivia the rest of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=360>The generalization would be far too simplistic; moreover, the institutions are much stronger, poverty, particularly poverty has been reduced and the struggles of ownership of natural resources were usually settled.</seg>
<seg id=361>Even in countries like Venezuela, which possesses huge reserves of oil and which has a nationalist government in mind traditional, the status quo had enabled preservation foreign investment during the almost eight years of government of President Hugo Chávez.</seg>
<seg id=362>Although the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries, since the Chiapas to the "araucania", the Amazon until ayacucho, they have never asked any threat to any national integrity in Latin American countries.</seg>
<seg id=363>Thus, Bolivia not live a crisis prémonitoire, nor the eternal "theory of dominoes", to which Lyndon jonhson and Che guevarra believed both in the case of Bolivia, seems valid or even partially reasonable.</seg>
<seg id=364>But the current crisis in Bolivia shows the pointing the democratic deficit which afflicts Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=365>Elected leaders are implemented failure for one reason or another, Ecuador, Bolivia and in Haiti.</seg>
<seg id=366>Democracy is poor or absent Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua and is threatened pure some reason in Venezuela and in Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=367>None of these cases, looks like the other and they behave all different degrees of danger, of destruction and reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id=368>The question is what can be done against this state of affairs, which contrasts with hard encouraging prospects prevailed until in recent years.</seg>
<seg id=369>At the last meeting of the Organization of American States held in strong lauderdale, in Florida, the United States delegation has borrowed a good idea provided by others and has simply coulée because of its support.</seg>
<seg id=370>History began two years ago when Dante caputo, former foreign minister, Argentina and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) were charged preparing a report on democracy in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=371>Their conclusions indicated that an early warning system of democratic crises in the region help generate some actions before any loss of control, as is the case with Bolivia today.</seg>
<seg id=372>Mr caputo team and the UNDP had then convinced, Chilean President Ricardo Lagos, to take the initiative and to promote with many of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id=373>He has done, that the initiative not go very far.</seg>
<seg id=374>In fact, the UNDP report on democracy in Latin America, published in 2004, barely mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=375>The US and the new Secretary-General of the OAS, Jose Miguel Insulza have relaunched at the meeting of the OAS in Florida, but it was killed by reasonable fears of Latin Americans believe that this is an action against Venezuela, the Latin American fears associated anachronistic on violations of the sacrosanct principle of intervention.</seg>
<seg id=376>Despite the impossibility for the continent to agree on the principle, the idea of a system of warning anticipated deserves to be studied.</seg>
<seg id=377>Today, the Community has probably Latin American little possibility intervention on the situation in Bolivia, yet it is dangerous for everyone.</seg>
<seg id=378>Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and growers of coca leaf, is perhaps an honest democratic leader, somewhat malavisé but its supporters are all available will any authoritarian?</seg>
<seg id=379>Hugo Chávez not finance may not Mr Morales and other dissidents Bolivians, but Venezuela and Cuba are they not tempted to away affairs of this country where Che guevarra mourut to lead the guerrilla almost 40 years ago?</seg>
<seg id=380>The Community business of Santa Cruz in Bolivia will give may not following its threats of secession, but préfèreront they share the oil and natural gas reserves of their region with the indigenous peoples high land rather than with industrial Brazilian of São Paulo?</seg>
<seg id=381>Before events do not reach the extreme, it may be good the OAS (and not the US) would interfere.</seg>
<seg id=382>The region continues to need this participation, in terms of time, the message and appropriate democratic platform, distinct from traditional American intervention and indifference usual of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=383>The decline in France?</seg>
<seg id=384>The French are notoriously sensitive, if not on the defensive, about the scale of France abroad.</seg>
<seg id=385>The French State spends a substantial sum to the spread of language and culture French, but the French are painfully aware that the global position of their country is no longer what it was.</seg>
<seg id=386>In this context, it is thus not surprising that in the last presidential elections, the publication of a report of the European Commission declaring that the ranks of economic France among European countries had the 3</seg>
<seg id=387>The OECD and Eurostat, the European body charged to gather data, thought to end this aspect of the debate in showing that France, Germany, Italy and Britain had all levels of living almost identical per capita.</seg>
<seg id=388>But the controversy on a broader scale has not gone so.</seg>
<seg id=389>People are concerned about the decline in French "have re-emergence with no of protest held this year against pension reform, the growing differences on fiscal policy with the European Commission and bickering with America on the Iraq War.</seg>
<seg id=390>The book not romancé who wins successful in France at present is a controversial written by Nicolas Baverez, France which falls.</seg>
<seg id=391>The book of Baverez is full of quotes de Gaulle and of Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id=392>According to the author, the achievements of France back to the 1970s, with the train rapid, TGV, and the Airbus.</seg>
<seg id=393>It severely critical Mitterrand and Chirac combined with a "talent common to win elections and make France a loser.</seg>
<seg id=394>The success of the paper is itself a sign of malaise ".</seg>
<seg id=395>But what type?</seg>
<seg id=396>The evidence of degeneration provided by Baverez are not convincing as it does well to believe.</seg>
<seg id=397>For example, he cited the depletion of industrial jobs as proof the most flagrant decline of France.</seg>
<seg id=398>But the reality is a de-industrialization common to all countries advanced.</seg>
<seg id=399>Indeed, France indeed gets better results than most of its competitors rich neighbours and, unlike the Germany, the UK or the United States, it has preserved the same share of world market in the industrial sector than it had in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id=400>Moreover, according to a more precise of competitiveness and foreign investment, France gets a good results in these areas.</seg>
<seg id=401>According to a recent report published by the Council of economic analysis, direct investment in France are past 60 billion euros in 2001, is almost twice that Germany.</seg>
<seg id=402>Competitiveness French costs has also improved (20%) in the last three decades, productivity higher contrebalançant the rapid growth wages.</seg>
<seg id=403>But the heart of economic problems in the long term of France lies precisely in the fear losing the industrial jobs.</seg>
<seg id=404>France remains a strong industrial power in traditional sectors such as the automobile and aerospace, but it has fallen behind in markets where innovative companies say smaller new technologies.</seg>
<seg id=405>France, for example, spends only 30 billion dollars per year in research and development of high technology, against 51 billion dollars for Germany, 98 billion dollars for Japan and 265 billion dollars to the US.</seg>
<seg id=406>In short, the analysis of Baverez in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id=407>France has undertaken several important reforms on the last two decades: liberalization economic and financial, the elimination of exchange and price controls, the late restrictions of credit, liberalization European, reducing deficits inflationary and trade, the advent of the euro and globalization forced companies.</seg>
<seg id=408>The French malaise was certainly not misleading by these reforms.</seg>
<seg id=409>The problem of France has just what it failed to recognize the new world her already.</seg>
<seg id=410>Capitalism French is dead and France fails to accept its disappearance.</seg>
<seg id=411>France must be the only country in which a Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, has felt obliged to excuses having said on television that "the state is not all-powerful.</seg>
<seg id=412>There are several reasons why this schizophrenia French, but most important of them is the political game of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=413>Until in 1981, France was clearly divided between right and left.</seg>
<seg id=414>Since this period, administrations and Mitterand Chirac have émoussé their ideological side in order to implement the difficult process of adaptation to Europe and to globalization.</seg>
<seg id=415>A "by" electric shock treatment to Mrs. Thatcher two decades ago could forge a new political awareness.</seg>
<seg id=416>But the passage slow. and reforms enabled the French to live in a world and to believe in another.</seg>
<seg id=417>This state of affairs is largely the cataclysm policy that exploded in the last presidential campaign, when the leader of the extreme right Jean-Marie Le Pen reached the second round of the presidential elections in the outgoing Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin.</seg>
<seg id=418>The rise of the extreme Left, which has brought 10% of the vote during this campaign, attests also failure of politics.</seg>
<seg id=419>France needs a political revolution than a revolution economic if it wants to come to accept reality, including the fact that the "decline French" is a fear created by the French people.</seg>
<seg id=420>The value of European values</seg>
<seg id=421>European leaders have resumed discussions constitutional who had ended last December following a dispute on voting rights.</seg>
<seg id=422>These debates must of course lead to compromise, which cannot await.</seg>
<seg id=423>Yet to understand clearly what are the objectives of supposed constitution.</seg>
<seg id=424>Two fundamental principles have chairman to European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=425>These two principles take place at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, the economy, and the sociology of law.</seg>
<seg id=426>For years, they are an integral part of the legal and institutional structure of the European Union, in the treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which cited the preamble) and in the recent draft Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=427>In short, they are included in history and the ideals of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=428>But what is the real significance of these principles?</seg>
<seg id=429>Take solidarity, which is ready to both interpretations at least: solidarity static, concerns only the distribution of income and wealth, and the broader concept of solidarity dynamic which concerns the production of income and wealth.</seg>
<seg id=430>In post-war history of European integration, solidarity dynamic has strongly from in the first period of the European Coal and Steel Community, both in its economic development strategy (reconstruction) that in the Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome.</seg>
<seg id=431>This does not mean that Solidarity was dynamic thereafter suppressed: the European Monetary Union, for example, expressed this perfectly.</seg>
<seg id=432>So, although some countries have not benefited immediately of the euro, they have nevertheless accepted because they were convinced that would have positive effects on the long term.</seg>
<seg id=433>In other words, solidarity means encouraging dynamic policies that promote investment, innovation, economic growth and employment.</seg>
<seg id=434>However, as stated GDP growth in the EU, solidarity was dynamic country over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id=435>The discrepancy between the research and development is about particular concern.</seg>
<seg id=436>Implementation of the so-called Lisbon strategy of the EU, adopted in 2000 with the promise of creating the most competitive economy in the world, is threatened by the growing importance for solidarity static, reflected in the costs of the social welfare and high taxes needed to finance it.</seg>
<seg id=437>The primacy of solidarity static due to an ageing population which, together with growth slowed down, led structural fiscal imbalances.</seg>
<seg id=438>One of the greatest challenges posed to become the EU is to address the current predominance of solidarity static, which is oriented towards the elderly, at the expense of solidarity dynamic, which encourages young.</seg>
<seg id=439>After all, the Union cannot allow that current consumption continues to win on the investment needed to future prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=440>Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in what its interpretation is also dual: subsidiarity vertical and horizontal subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=441>The vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of powers between the various levels of government and of sovereignty: the EU Member States, the regions and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id=442>The application of this principle is the best known federalism.</seg>
<seg id=443>The European Treaties clearly express this vertical subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=444>But is it enough to encompass canevas institutional and constitutional emerging the Union?</seg>
<seg id=445>The horizontal subsidiarity is the responsibility and freedom of human beings and the social and economic powers.</seg>
<seg id=446>It comprises relations between the state, society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=447>But society and the market have their own rights and their own sovereignty which are not granted by the state.</seg>
<seg id=448>The problem arises: how to guarantee the autonomy of each Kingdom?</seg>
<seg id=449>These include example of subsidiarity horizontal European internal market, which has created a new type of economic freedom and increased competition between companies by eliminating protection that national governments their offraient.</seg>
<seg id=450>The horizontal subsidiarity means that in society and in the economic sphere, the state cannot violate freedom and individual responsibility, which must be respected at the highest possible level.</seg>
<seg id=451>It also means that a "superior power" must support whenever freedom and responsibility individual are not enough to achieve the objectives needed to human dignity.</seg>
<seg id=452>This support must be from using methods which promote the potential natural individuals, society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=453>But this is only possible if the role of the horizontal subsidiarity is clearly enshrined, which was not in the European Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights or the work of the European Convention.</seg>
<seg id=454>In short, solidarity means today redistribution rather than growth (for example, the current generation expresses solidarity with future generations) While the subsidiarity concerns the distribution of political power than definition cautious borders between state, civil society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=455>At present, these two values are defined in promoting the state.</seg>
<seg id=456>Indeed, the emphasis on growth oriented towards the market was often identified with values foreign semi-generics in America.</seg>
<seg id=457>But these values are deeply rooted in Europe and they must be uprooted again.</seg>
<seg id=458>The EU must restore its economic vitality in pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity, more balanced for the market and of society which would decrease the influence of the social state.</seg>
<seg id=459>The public institutions must produce public goods (such as security, justice and fiscal and monetary policy), society must offer goods social (as culture, education and help the needy) and the market must produce goods economic (related profits, for growth and employment).</seg>
<seg id=460>In the 21st century, Europe must review the value of these two principles (solidarity and subsidiarity) if it wants to achieve the goal of historical integration: freedom and well-being needed to overcome differences and divisions policies which have led the tragedies of the twentieth century.</seg>
<seg id=461>That is the spirit in which must be drawn up the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=462>The policy of values</seg>
<seg id=463>The debate on the American elections has not faibli.</seg>
<seg id=464>How President George W. Bush he could get three million votes more than Senator John Kerry, and, moreover, to provide a Republican majority in both houses of congress?</seg>
<seg id=465>It is agreed little on the answers, but are recurring themes in many explanations.</seg>
<seg id=466>One of these topics due to its personality.</seg>
<seg id=467>Our time was full of uncertainty and threat, citizens have placed their trust in a President they were rather than in a candidate have not yet proven.</seg>
<seg id=468>The second is that of values.</seg>
<seg id=469>People voted for a set of values rather than for specific policies.</seg>
<seg id=470>Indeed, some (told) agree with policies of Kerry but have brought their voices to Bush because they felt "at ease" with all its attitude.</seg>
<seg id=471>It is clear that the US is now deeply divided electoral terms.</seg>
<seg id=472>An ark States blue (Democrats) to the east, in the North and in the West extends around a huge area (red Republican) Central and South.</seg>
<seg id=473>Beyond the geographical division, divisions recur locally.</seg>
<seg id=474>The electoral charcutage, the practice of electoral retraçage borders to promote a political party at the expense of another, is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id=475>Voters tend to emménager in areas where the majority of people share their values, whether republican or democratic.</seg>
<seg id=476>What are these values exactly?</seg>
<seg id=477>These are the values that treat, that we are told, "of God, weapons and gay.</seg>
<seg id=478>Religion is role, especially with the truths own the Bible in the history of creation.</seg>
<seg id=479>The possession of a weapon is the ultimate test of individualism and use weapons in times of war is no odious.</seg>
<seg id=480>The gay and other practices "Modern" are rejected, because nombrilistes.</seg>
<seg id=481>As the political scientist Andrew hacker recently put it, "the candidacy of Bush was built to form a majority by giving 60 million voters the chance to feel much vis-à-vis of themselves.</seg>
<seg id=482>This is a phenomenon American, or is there other trends elsewhere?</seg>
<seg id=483>A responses to that as a phenomenon, American politics values can order a majority today but is by no means general.</seg>
<seg id=484>Europe and other parts of the world are divided in the same way.</seg>
<seg id=485>The personality, certainly, and the obvious political differences are also questions of values that have not yet been highlighted.</seg>
<seg id=486>However, differences traditional policies based on the disagreement about basic values play an increasingly important in elections.</seg>
<seg id=487>Prime Minister Tony Blair, for example, other leader to confront an election in his country, plays the map of personality and speaks of policies, but is above all a set of values of middle class.</seg>
<seg id=488>When he speaks of "modernization" or "to enter the twenty-first century", it fails to suggest a strange mixture but attractive for change and stability.</seg>
<seg id=489>This leaves opposition Conservative without effective response.</seg>
<seg id=490>Even the issue of tax and on asylum strict fail to fly on the strings of tune values that the Republican Party managed to hear the US.</seg>
<seg id=491>The situation is the same in Germany, where the influence manifesto of political values is even less.</seg>
<seg id=492>The debate in Germany Still, in its most political debate.</seg>
<seg id=493>When opposition offers the government to negotiate the reform of the welfare state or, more recently, to combat unemployment, underlying the challenge is not asked in terms of values but rather of competence.</seg>
<seg id=494>Yet in the fields of battles traditional political debate English or German, or elsewhere in Europe, clashs values threaten.</seg>
<seg id=495>The parties fighting those who can "feel at ease their own place", but perhaps they do not understand very well that this is only partly a question of policy.</seg>
<seg id=496>Religion will never be an important factor in politics: European opinion polls show that the religious practice remains one of the few major differences between Americans and Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=497>Arms also occupy a place in the different European minds is their absence that Europeans regard as important.</seg>
<seg id=498>Europe lives also undoubtedly be a current of values pacifist.</seg>
<seg id=499>And the question of political correctness (the "gay") also plays a part less so far in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=500>Above all, Europe itself divides Europeans, because the question "national" is present in all European States.</seg>
<seg id=501>It is a question of values inspired by fear.</seg>
<seg id=502>Citizens want to know where they are and, in the process, is back against the US and to Europe or against Europe and to their own countries.</seg>
<seg id=503>In all ways, we quittons then the Kingdom policies and even of politics and into the area of marécageux symbols and myths.</seg>
<seg id=504>What, in any case, is the main danger which democracies face, because the political values is a dangerous development.</seg>
<seg id=505>It reintroduced fundamental divisions of a society which most democratic achievement was precisely to banish fundamentalism of politics.</seg>
<seg id=506>A public debate enlightened should be a discussion on the policies by a Community of values.</seg>
<seg id=507>It is therefore essential to insist on this objective of policy freedom.</seg>
<seg id=508>The advent of interest</seg>
<seg id=509>A hirondelle does not spring and one month of normal growth of employment and rising prices in the United States does not mean that the Federal Reserve not fear more unease and economic deflation.</seg>
<seg id=510>But the time will come when interest rates global begin to increase as the central bankers preparing to resist the wave of rising inflation.</seg>
<seg id=511>When will this moment as autumn, in 2005 or 2006, or in 2007, America and the world economy will face the financial reflèteront vulnerabilities that the success of the last three years of monetary stimulation in arresting the decline of production and modérant in unemployment.</seg>
<seg id=512>Short term interest rates are surprisingly low: only 2% in the euro area, just 1% in the US and Japan zero.</seg>
<seg id=513>Monetary policy expansionist proved to be a success, but only after led interest rates low levels of historical and investors have convinced that borrowing costs remain at their current levels for long.</seg>
<seg id=514>The stimulating monetary mainly has had the effect of increasing asset prices: everything that happened a benefit, a dividend or rent becomes much more attractive, and therefore much more valuable in financial terms, when interest rates are very low and should remain so.</seg>
<seg id=515>This explains the considerable gaps between current real estate prices in the US, the actions ordinary in New York, London and Frankfurt, and obligations in the long term around the world and what should be in conventional, their basic values.</seg>
<seg id=516>What will happen when central banks begin to increase their interest rates?</seg>
<seg id=517>In 1994, the increase in interest rates in the short term has increased rates on long-term (and lower prices obligations in the long term) of at least twice as that in the standard model that year.</seg>
<seg id=518>Interest rates peripheral economies of developing have also increased far more than the rate of major advanced industrial countries.</seg>
<seg id=519>The first danger for 2005 and for the coming years, when global interest rates rise, as is likely, is another wave of financial crises in emerging markets.</seg>
<seg id=520>For countries like Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the record of the 1990s shows that differences of interest rates can grow and flows of capital to reverse remarkably quickly, whatever the degree of goodwill with which representatives of the IMF and the analyses by big banks see policies of a country.</seg>
<seg id=521>The gaps in interest rates are emerging markets are currently abnormally low.</seg>
<seg id=522>Monetary flows, international capital inflows exceptés the US, are not yet levels associated with a "irrational exuberance", but there is a good chance for this to happen before interest rates will begin to rise.</seg>
<seg id=523>This prospect is alarming because there is a lesson of the 1990s, is that nobody should overestimate stability international financial flows.</seg>
<seg id=524>The second danger from values high of active in the main advanced industrial countries.</seg>
<seg id=525>The way of thinking dominant within the Federal Reserve, which I endorse, fully supports the revolution in information technology continues, that production potential in the US is growing ever quickly and that the output gap is how relatively large.</seg>
<seg id=526>This means that interest rates will certainly remain low for a relatively long delay.</seg>
<seg id=527>Moreover, confidence in the Federal Reserve is great and the last vestiges of the premium the risk of inflation the 1970s do not include any interest rates.</seg>
<seg id=528>Therefore, even after that production levels are income at their potential, interest rates remain low standards in the 1980s and 1990s.</seg>
<seg id=529>This is, of course, good news for all those who hold assets such as obligations in the long term, actions and property.</seg>
<seg id=530>Indeed, the price of active in the long term was precisely what aspirait the fall in interest rates: make the bond, particularly real estate owners, richer gives after a blow to boost expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=531>But the bad news is that even if interest rates are supposedly remain low for a while, they will not as low indefinitely.</seg>
<seg id=532>The key is that when interest rates go up, the values of active fall.</seg>
<seg id=533>It is during these periods, particularly when the values of the active and rapidly falling dramatically, we find fully the degree of competence of our central bankers in their main task: reduce the financial volatility and promote economic stability.</seg>
<seg id=534>It is also during these periods that we find how people who hold the obligations in the long run, property or the actions have not because they believe that current prices are interesting compared with the basic price, but because their prices have increased in recent years.</seg>
<seg id=535>This is a crucial issue for political decision-making for individuals who have bought assets in the long term because prices seemed increase indefinitely are also those who sell once the trend will the reverse.</seg>
<seg id=536>In particular, the trade deficit leaves us predict a massive instability where asset prices on the long-term should fall substantially.</seg>
<seg id=537>Certainly, the challenges that will the decision-making of the economic policies of the world in the coming years diffèreront of those they have faced since the collapse of the illusion of NASDAQ.</seg>
<seg id=538>The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those generated by a fall in production and the threat of deflation.</seg>
<seg id=539>But, as we have learned during the 1990s, this does not mean that the challenges ahead will be easier to resolve.</seg>
<seg id=540>The futures opposed to America</seg>
<seg id=541>I recently found an interesting: American economists dealing with international finance and macroéconomistes American dealing with domestic economy have very different views -- indeed, opposed -- on the possible consequences of the huge deficit us.</seg>
<seg id=542>Economists of international finance see that a financial crisis is possible, followed by a painful and perhaps prolonged recession in the US.</seg>
<seg id=543>The macroéconomistes dealing with domestic economy instead see a next fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis but as an opportunity to accelerate growth.</seg>
<seg id=544>The macroéconomistes who as domestic economy generally see things as follows: at some point in the future, central banks will be less foreign enclines to pursue their purchases of massive security in dollar to support the Green ticket.</seg>
<seg id=545>When they put an end to their programs purchasing of dollar large-scale, the value of the dollar will fall and it will fall heavily.</seg>
<seg id=546>And, in this respect, if the value of the dollar declines, American exports will become much more attractive for foreign markets and the job market, the us resume workforce being redirigée towards the new export sectors in full boum.</seg>
<seg id=547>The situation will be comparable to that of Britain when it abandonna its indexation of exchange rate and laissa the pound to belittle the German mark, or what is produisit the US in the late 1980s when the dollar is déprécia the book, the mark and -- especially -- the Japanese yen.</seg>
<seg id=548>Economists of international finance describe a future more dark.</seg>
<seg id=549>They see the end programs purchasing of dollar large-scale by central banks will not only the decline of the dollar but also to rise soared interest rates American long-term, which will fall immediately household consumption and investment spending régulera after a short time.</seg>
<seg id=550>Certainly, economists of international finance American will also see that exports of the dollar, but the data in demand are like the extensive exports will happen one or two years after the decline in consumption and investment.</seg>
<seg id=551>Eight to ten million people will be the services sector and of the building sector the import-export of goods, which implies that structural unemployment will increase.</seg>
<seg id=552>Moreover, it will perhaps a financial panic: the large financial institutions with obligations short-term and long-term assets meet difficulties to bear a strong increase in long-term interest rates in dollar-denominated dollar.</seg>
<seg id=553>This factor of inequality may some tension and a financial bankruptcy equally easily than caused in the Mexican crisis in Asia and the East in the 1990s or the Argentine crisis of this decade because assets in local currency and obligations in dollar that détenaient banks.</seg>
<seg id=554>When economists of international finance put forward this scenario, the macroéconomistes specialized in their domestic economy meet that looks like a case of incompetence on monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=555>Why the Federal Reserve should enable the rise in long-term interest rates when foreign central banks to cease their programs purchasing dollar?</seg>
<seg id=556>Should then intervene and take over the purchase of obligation Treasury bonds long-term, thus maintaining long-term interest rates at a satisfactory level to encourage full employment?</seg>
<seg id=557>Economists of international finance usually respond that the Federal Reserve did not capacity.</seg>
<seg id=558>Obliged to choose between full employment and price stability, according to them, the Federal Reserve choose price stability, because its institutional memory of the 1970s and envolée of inflation remains very powerful.</seg>
<seg id=559>So, since the fall of the dollar's value is up prices import and thus works as a negative shock on the supply side in the economic sector, the Federal Reserve will increase, not reduce its interest rates and therefore sell rather than buying Treasury bonds.</seg>
<seg id=560>Economists serious that I respect greatly find themselves to take a position camps opposed this debate.</seg>
<seg id=561>I am not wise enough to agree to or to each other, but I know undoubtedly side I hope wrong.</seg>
<seg id=562>The bad pupils in Europe</seg>
<seg id=563>The us, the States pursue misguided fiscal policies are penalized.</seg>
<seg id=564>Their obligations to sell on the cheap compared with other States better managed.</seg>
<seg id=565>On debt servicing higher they pay serves, to a certain degree of disciplinary measures against the temptation to spend today and pay later.</seg>
<seg id=566>Naturally, discipline market is not perfect: the bond market, "is" not really the passive future implicit (as promised pension payments).</seg>
<seg id=567>However, in applying this fiscal discipline, associated with internal budgetary process of each State, prevented the great crisis of fiscal major United States since the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id=568>Consider the case of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=569>Before the advent of the euro, many states of southern Europe were suffering crises tax, producing waves inflationary high.</seg>
<seg id=570>But with the establishment of the single currency, the road to resolve a crisis fiscal by inflation was closed, since the European Central Bank (ECB) monitors monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=571>However, even if the nations can no longer rely on inflation to solve the imbalance of their finances, the single currency allows them to use the ability of debt which is in fact to other members of the European Union to extend their madness dépensière and push their political responsibility for periods of allow good time roulés [1] [sic].</seg>
<seg id=572>This is to avoid the possibility that the EU has created the Stability and Growth Pact: the budget deficit governments must not exceed 3% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=573>Last week, the German Government, once the European country the more careful and orderly at fiscal, has violated the rules of the Pact for the fifth year running, without really present () much of excuses.</seg>
<seg id=574>Finance Minister peer steinbrueck said he expected to what the European Commission applies sanctions against Germany: the credibility of the Pact would, he says, in jeopardy if any gesture was reported.</seg>
<seg id=575>So, Germany would not obstacle to sanctions this time, as was the case two and a half years ago.</seg>
<seg id=576>But steinbrueck also expressed clearly it is expected that a sanction purely symbolic in response to the budget deficit representative 3.4% of GDP, and not to penalties that would have a real cost for his government or its economy.</seg>
<seg id=577>The Stability and Growth Pact is not, or not yet, developing to function as originally scheduled.</seg>
<seg id=578>What about the discipline market?</seg>
<seg id=579>Will the German Government to increase its debt and increase their deficits is limited by the fact that the market recognizes and penalizes nations which leave their fiscal position to weaken?</seg>
<seg id=580>In a word, no.</seg>
<seg id=581>Interest rates on debt sovereign in twelve euro of governments in the eurozone are very similar.</seg>
<seg id=582>The market does not therefore take care that different countries have the potential to generate exports financing the necessary financial flows of debts, or differents ratios deficit / GDP current or projetés.</seg>
<seg id=583>Willem Buiter, the University of Amsterdam and in sibert, the University of London, believe that it is the acceptance of the ECB, the deficit in the euro area as guarantee that has undermined the will of the passenger market to become the fiscal restraint.</seg>
<seg id=584>As part of the marginal debt German is used as a guarantee for short-term borrowing or coin as central an operation pension fought to acquire the liquidity, its value is more likely to be determined by the terms under which the ECB accepts as guarantee that by its fundamental.</seg>
<seg id=585>The treatment by the ECB of any such as debt as important source of liquidity reserve of false now any analysis differential risk sovereign long-term.</seg>
<seg id=586>That is dangerous long-term.</seg>
<seg id=587>It is necessary to have both discipline of market and a solid fiscal management to have a reasonable chance to be price stability in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=588>Omettez today to sanction the market conduct which can become scrapping neck or to activate the levers institutional which give a voice to future generations, and you exposing will suffer serious consequences -- perhaps not today or tomorrow, but one day, and for the rest of your life.</seg>
<seg id=589>As time passes, the arrival of the single currency and how the euro was implemented generate more and more malaise.</seg>
<seg id=590>The policy of the euro in general too deflationary.</seg>
<seg id=591>The transfers needed to make the currency current bearable slow down or regions that are already in recession when the ECB applies a policy tighter are facts.</seg>
<seg id=592>The institutional foundations for a stable fiscal policy the long-term erosion in full.</seg>
<seg id=593>Now, Buiter sibert and convince us that the ECB gives the market less opportunity to reward the most economical and penalising the budget-spending than it should.</seg>
<seg id=594>The earth does not yet move, and that will not before time.</seg>
<seg id=595>But the ground under the euro may become slippery If things do not change.</seg>
<seg id=596>Milosevic and Hussein: even trial even farce</seg>
<seg id=597>The trials war criminals were once serious business.</seg>
<seg id=598>Remember photographs of Herman goering and Hess Rudolf sinister,, in the dock in Nuremberg.</seg>
<seg id=599>Some Nazi leaders have even been hanged after the trial relatively short but fair.</seg>
<seg id=600>Nowadays, the trial of most abjects world leaders have become farces.</seg>
<seg id=601>The trial of Saddam Hussein and his friends are the Baath a series of uninterrupted moments troublesome.</seg>
<seg id=602>The defendants singerie try one after another and Hussein shown to all forms of contempt possible all that it has not yet made is to show its fesses judge.</seg>
<seg id=603>It is difficult to wait for an outcome that might seem legitimate Iraqi or the eyes of the world.</seg>
<seg id=604>Meanwhile, the trial of Slobodan Milosevic has changed in funeral boring after four years of reports and $200 million spent unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg id=605>In Cambodia, the UN and the government have procrastinated for almost ten years how to bring the figures Rouge surviving in the courts.</seg>
<seg id=606>Killers in mass who took power in the twentieth century were sentenced to be killed in government popular or tried for their crimes -- at least, if they do not were dying during their term.</seg>
<seg id=607>Who can feel proud that the last Communist leader in Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, was fusillé with his wife without even the appearances a fair trial?</seg>
<seg id=608>The pitfalls formal genuine Court appear always preferable to an instant justice, even if the final result is also death.</seg>
<seg id=609>Today there are two ways to proceed plausible towards a tyrant deposed.</seg>
<seg id=610>A nation can send his former leaders to Court, as did the Argentine in the 1980s with general responsible for the disappearance of over 5 000 of their citizens.</seg>
<seg id=611>Internationally, the model of Nuremberg remains valid for a model for other trial, although under the conditions that unequivocal powers victorieuses sometimes ask accounts for certain crimes, such as "crimes against humanity," which are not properly defined when they are committed.</seg>
<seg id=612>There was a time when there was the benefits of trial both national and international.</seg>
<seg id=613>The trial at home were to the local community to give free rein to its grieve in participating to close the procedure.</seg>
<seg id=614>As judges and jurés, fellow of defendants could also provide greater sensitivity to estimate the guilt because they could appreciate the harsh conditions under which a dictator deposed were its decisions.</seg>
<seg id=615>The trial of generals in Argentina was a ritual successful in the painful transition of the military junta to democracy, but that experience ended in a larmoyante questioned.</seg>
<seg id=616>Even after their condemnation, generals have been strong enough to demand a denunciation of their trial and an amnesty next President.</seg>
<seg id=617>Politics Argentina is still enchevêtrée in the legal consequences of these trials of twenty years ago.</seg>
<seg id=618>Internationally, the decision of the UN Security Council establishing the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia () tribunal has also been welcomed with great confidence.</seg>
<seg id=619>The tribunal has several decisions founding under the leadership of Antonio Cassese.</seg>
<seg id=620>But then the judges had the misfortune to achieve their dream the most expensive: the judge scélérat chief, Slobodan Milosevic.</seg>
<seg id=621>We cannot be a clear idea of how the Serbs have found Milosevic within a trial locally.</seg>
<seg id=622>Many have dépendu party political which would controlled Court.</seg>
<seg id=623>Internationally, fears were not on an excess of political but on an excess of law.</seg>
<seg id=624>The trial of Milosevic had to be more than just, it should be the emblem of Justice of the UN.</seg>
<seg id=625>So Milosevic was allowed to defend itself himself -- grave mistake in terms of efficiency and length of trial.</seg>
<seg id=626>There was no limits to the number of people that the charge called to testify on even dreadful history of aggression and brutality Serbs.</seg>
<seg id=627>It will many months to determine the problem and know why this scandal of trial of four years.</seg>
<seg id=628>That is my intuition officials well-meaning the Court were too influenced by the Commission of truth and reconciliation, African model sold in schools of law as an alternative to desirable distributive justice.</seg>
<seg id=629>During the trial South Africa, the most important issue was not the future warned the past but victims.</seg>
<seg id=630>Every victim was encouraged to tell its history and the warned listening.</seg>
<seg id=631>In the case of massacres in the twentieth century such narrations can last dozens of years.</seg>
<seg id=632>Encouraging victims to speak and then to give warned right to monopolise the block and the trial in vantant its merits of leader policy are the ingredients of a never-ending session.</seg>
<seg id=633>One of the lessons we have learned the trial of Milosevic and Hussein is that we should not judge men or women for their losing their attractiveness charismatic.</seg>
<seg id=634>They renverseront the trial, especially if they are allowed to defend themselves themselves, and on hearing use to justify their path.</seg>
<seg id=635>The tyrants should be deemed that having been clearly défaits.</seg>
<seg id=636>Irony of history, the Court of Nuremberg has been lively by representatives of victors and powerful was advantage.</seg>
<seg id=637>They were a constant reminder for goering Hess, and their henchmen that allies commandaient, that the Nazis were defeated irremediably.</seg>
<seg id=638>Punishing the guilty, rather than forming how history be written, has always been the clear objective of trial.</seg>
<seg id=639>The tragedy of the trial of Milosevic and Hussein is that the points the "i" still lack of history and that history itself is on trial.</seg>
<seg id=640>The consequent hesitation leaders gave rise to the procedures, both national and international, who have facilitated the fantasies of justification and return.</seg>
<seg id=641>In the case of Saddam Hussein, this fantasy could still fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id=642>The divide the Iraqi economy</seg>
<seg id=643>All who analyse Iraq see a nation divided between communities of Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds.</seg>
<seg id=644>But there is another division as fundamental, a division which contributes as the insurgency continues that conflicts sectarian and opposition to the military occupation led by the Americans, that the growing gap between rich and poor from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=645>When Iraq was released, people, particularly the poor people, have taken to hope that a charismatic leader to save the harsh realities of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id=646>High in fear, they had no idea about how democracy could be applied to their society or how groups of human rights and other organisations of civil rights could help to shape their future.</seg>
<seg id=647>Iraq has recovered quickly face a new social divide.</seg>
<seg id=648>On one side were those who understand how work in a democracy, come to power and own ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=649>They have learned to speak the language of democracy, to gain at the same time, money and of influence, and to ensure the contest independent organisations to defend their rights and privileges.</seg>
<seg id=650>On the other hand, however, there is a vast population of Iraq without power, including women widowed, divorced or abandoned without one to take over, they and their children.</seg>
<seg id=651>For these, democracy and human rights does not mean much.</seg>
<seg id=652>They are poor, sick and uncultivated.</seg>
<seg id=653>Victims of an education system which collapsed over a decade ago, they are few trained to find jobs in the Iraqi economy in décrépitude.</seg>
<seg id=654>Under the yoke of Saddam, no effort was made to raise the standard of living of poor.</seg>
<seg id=655>I visited the big slums Iraqis and discovered families living in homes barely recouvertes a roof, shark-filled of pests everywhere, with sewers in open skies, écoulant under their doors.</seg>
<seg id=656>Night and day, they live in the black.</seg>
<seg id=657>With no need to nothing less than food, of decent homes and job opportunities, these families expect death, terrifiées by the cries of their starving children.</seg>
<seg id=658>When I met the women who live in these homes, they have bombed questions of democracy: it would give food and houses?</seg>
<seg id=659>Democracy it prevent men of fight their wives?</seg>
<seg id=660>Democracy it accorderait citizenship to their children?</seg>
<seg id=661>They give it the right to divorce the husband who have abandoned?</seg>
<seg id=662>To all these questions, I said yes.</seg>
<seg id=663>Yes, democracy will give you the right to live in a House and the right to learn and work, and it will give citizenship children and equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id=664>But you will need hard work and make every effort to demand these rights.</seg>
<seg id=665>What they répondirent: "Saddam taught to be unemployed, silent and timid 35 years.</seg>
<seg id=666>What we can do now?</seg>
<seg id=667>In these areas where live indigentes most Iraqis, people are prey to the temptations bitter.</seg>
<seg id=668>Many people are not within the scope of political leaders or Government.</seg>
<seg id=669>They easily fall in violence, theft and the sabotage.</seg>
<seg id=670>Poverty leads to accept some of the money in exchange for terrorist acts, complicit visited by the promise of a false heroism they could not exploit during the long reign of Saddam.</seg>
<seg id=671>Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of history violent wars and atrocities of Iraq, which has annihilé people's sensitivity towards the assassination.</seg>
<seg id=672>Although the conditions for existence in Iraq today drive many young men to violence, I am sure that is simply provide jobs and decent housing to save.</seg>
<seg id=673>Jobs, in particular, would help young people to forge new lives through serious jobs.</seg>
<seg id=674>We must not use jobs for factices maquiller army of unemployed.</seg>
<seg id=675>We must give people jobs which enable them to contribute positively to the reconstruction of the country.</seg>
<seg id=676>By nature, individual seeks to be helpful to its own society.</seg>
<seg id=677>But culture that Saddam has created has convinced that the Iraqis connections policies are the only way to acquire authority, money and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=678>Beyond such sentiments will take time and require a flourishing economy, which implies that the new Iraqi government must have limited powers to facilitate growth private-sector while encouraging widespread understanding of democracy and human rights.</seg>
<seg id=679>The religious groups are willing to participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id=680>We can also rehabilitate the technocrats who servirent under Saddam, so that they also have a chance to serve their country.</seg>
<seg id=681>And last but not least, we must offer loans to poor families to help them build a respectable life.</seg>
<seg id=682>The government must above all make every effort to convince people of Iraqi poor the value of democracy and freedom and the importance of the Constitution in achieving their aspirations for a better life.</seg>
<seg id=683>It will not be easy to achieve in a country where many people see that infringe the law is an act of heroism.</seg>
<seg id=684>We, however, Iraqis, we learned that power must not be concentrated in the hands of a minority, and that the establishment of justice requires to combat corruption in all its forms.</seg>
<seg id=685>If the Constitution should function as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, Iraqis poor must learn to make this their struggle.</seg>
<seg id=686>Islamic identity</seg>
<seg id=687>When you dirigiez your look at present, Islam is used () badly and used as a political force.</seg>
<seg id=688>Some Muslims would serve as incentives to action; many Muslims in the West (and in other countries - the perceive as a "other" containment and a "other" astreignants exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=689>As Turkish, I feel directly both sides of the debate.</seg>
<seg id=690>Why the Islam is like a religion of "the other" the eyes of Western is that the West has been a systematic désinstitutionalisation of religion.</seg>
<seg id=691>It is not religion that has disappeared from Western modern life, of course, but rather claims that religious institutions can make on how individual.</seg>
<seg id=692>Religion in the modern world is more than ever a personal experience and spiritual.</seg>
<seg id=693>However, a process of désinstitutionalisation experience of religious also happens within Islam.</seg>
<seg id=694>The politicization of Islam supplante authority of religious classes of Islam, ulema.</seg>
<seg id=695>As in the West, experience Islamic religious becomes more personal.</seg>
<seg id=696>The interpretation of religious texts by Muslims individual, including the political activists, intellectuals and women, is a consequence among many.</seg>
<seg id=697>These include the popularisation of knowledge, the religious teachings the Koran malmenés being out of context and to support their political objectives.</seg>
<seg id=698>Who decides now of what is legitimate and which is illicit in Islam?</seg>
<seg id=699>Who has the authority sufficient to interpret the texts religious?</seg>
<seg id=700>Who can make a fatwa or declaring the "Jihad?</seg>
<seg id=701>Nowadays, the activism and terrorism offer, or rather, impose a source of legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id=702>It is for outsiders to decide what means or does not Islam, without authority without religious schools and specialized training.</seg>
<seg id=703>Indeed, Islam today is essentially interpreted by political actors and cultural movements, not by religious institutions.</seg>
<seg id=704>This désinstitutionalisation enabled to Islam to the status of local and national social link to the Creator of imaginary links between all Muslims around the world who feel oppressed or displaced.</seg>
<seg id=705>Islam can unite and of accession that were deeply divided: Muslims soufis intellectuals and Muslims canonisés original shariat; Sunni and Shiite Muslims; Saudi Arabia conservative and Iran revolutionary.</seg>
<seg id=706>Islam is also dynamic, its believers leaving rural areas for cities, including Western cities.</seg>
<seg id=707>Many regard this movement as negative point and that these people are socially displaced and they basculent thereafter in alienation and, for some, terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=708>But social mobility is also a precondition for creating a modern perspective.</seg>
<seg id=709>Of course, migration causes a sense of distance among Muslims, if it is a complete break with their origins, social.</seg>
<seg id=710>Their experience is religious new, private or public, theological of Community institutions.</seg>
<seg id=711>Experience religious becomes rather a form of social imagination in which they reconstruisent a sense of belonging Islam in an environment both new and strange.</seg>
<seg id=712>This is not the distance with of modern life, but the proximity that life which trigger a return to the religious identity.</seg>
<seg id=713>Indeed, the vast majority of radicalism evident in groups which, by their experience of mobility and the trip, are familiar with the ways of thought and secular western policy of urban life.</seg>
<seg id=714>Confused by an environment unknown, these individuals have raccrochent to Islam which becomes their unique support.</seg>
<seg id=715>But for that support works, Islam should break free from its attitude traditionally obséquieuse, passive and docile face modernity.</seg>
<seg id=716>It is a veil or a beard, claiming the right to taking of places of prayer to work or to school and in demanding special food, Muslims identify openly as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id=717>They informed the world they are more and more zealous in their meticulous compliance religious that individuals who confinent their religiosity to privacy.</seg>
<seg id=718>For example, not Muslims see generally of the veil as a sign of the avilissement and inferiority Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id=719>A shame, however, become for Muslims a sign of their claim positive of Islamic identity.</seg>
<seg id=720>Young women Muslim of Europe to illustrate the perfection this transformation.</seg>
<seg id=721>Girls who adopt the headscarves in French and German schools are closer, as in many aspects (namely culture, youth, awareness of how the), and the language of their fellow of class that their mothers without education that are forced to stay at home.</seg>
<seg id=722>By adopting the headscarves for the European public sphere, these girls change without the want the symbol and the role of women Muslim.</seg>
<seg id=723>This trend goes well beyond simple scarves.</seg>
<seg id=724>All Western Muslims have a dual sense of belonging, a dual cultural capital.</seg>
<seg id=725>They define by their religiosity, but they also acquired knowledge of secular universal.</seg>
<seg id=726>The fact that they have this dual cultural capital, they can move freely relatively between different activities and spaces (home, school, houses of young and space for leisure URBAN).</seg>
<seg id=727>Etre Muslim and be Islamic are two different things.</seg>
<seg id=728>Today we are to change a Muslim identity for Islamic identity.</seg>
<seg id=729>For me the religious Muslims individual happening Kingdom private Kingdom public.</seg>
<seg id=730>The question which remains for everyone is whether this quest for identity can be happy with scarves and with a broad public acceptance of the Islamic religious practice or if a positive claim of Islam requires more fundamental renunciation of modernity.</seg>
<seg id=731>A new era for Islamic science?</seg>
<seg id=732>For hundreds of years, while science and mathematics were a period of great inventiveness, a region in the world is distinguait of others.</seg>
<seg id=733>The masters of these disciplines were révérés, medicine avançait to large and not people if interrogeaient on the functioning of nature.</seg>
<seg id=734>Nothing is surprising that the region has been globally respected.</seg>
<seg id=735>In the other half of the world experienced, scientists were punished, even killed.</seg>
<seg id=736>The mathematics, considered irréligieuses and foreign, were outlaw, and were later asservies to religion.</seg>
<seg id=737>The standard of living was low.</seg>
<seg id=738>The region was the prosperous Middle Islamic, while a Europe remained ignorant poor.</seg>
<seg id=739>Both regions were governed religiously (historians will not agree on the role and the nature of religions in this context), but science should épanouissait that in one of them.</seg>
<seg id=740>Today, of course, the roles of Islamic East and West are reversed.</seg>
<seg id=741>Since the second world war, the US is heads of global queue indiscutés in sciences.</seg>
<seg id=742>Throughout this period, students the most brilliant were lured out of their countries of origin by the prospect of better opportunities for career and research.</seg>
<seg id=743>Until a recent period, more than half of graduates of students in higher mathematics, science and engineering United States were born abroad.</seg>
<seg id=744>Many of these young talents remained after the taking of their degree, and so the industry that the government have benefited.</seg>
<seg id=745>Meanwhile, Islamic culture were in a historic phase in which science was equated with the influence of the West, and that is why even fuie.</seg>
<seg id=746>Even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant proportion of research, Arab leaders have not encouraged such investments, and the result is that their companies have not flourished, as they have been.</seg>
<seg id=747>Recently, a desire for more respect policy led the Islamic nations to invest in technological, which is particularly visible in the Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=748>But while such weapons have a political weight, science on which they depend is innocent and old.</seg>
<seg id=749>Respect from considered visions, rather than born discoveries of past, is much more significant.</seg>
<seg id=750>Imagine the influence that have a Pakistani Institute in mind global research on cancer.</seg>
<seg id=751>And the political rhetoric it would change if researchers in Oman découvraient a way to disappear aids?</seg>
<seg id=752>This opportunity does not come at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=753>But there is another, which is not limited to Islamic societies.</seg>
<seg id=754>The United States committed serious mistake recently.</seg>
<seg id=755>The "questions of faith" have substituées to science within the government, from the presidency.</seg>
<seg id=756>A prominent researchers saw their reports modified by members of the staff policy when the facts contredisaient the official version.</seg>
<seg id=757>Encouraged by an administration influenced by religion, school systems being divert their teaching of science to the "values."</seg>
<seg id=758>Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, the entry visas are less many and more difficult to obtain, which hinders the flow of young talents to American universities.</seg>
<seg id=759>Great scientific organisations have one without results.</seg>
<seg id=760>At the same time, tax laws have been revised to investors richer short-term, discouraging the long-term investment in research.</seg>
<seg id=761>Half a trillion dollars was devoted to the war in Iraq, a sum roughly equal to the funding of basic research of thousand years.</seg>
<seg id=762>Even if the us avoid a dark age of fundamentalism, they clearly risk losing their world domination in terms of research.</seg>
<seg id=763>Japan has acknowledged the link between political weight and science in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id=764>The main industrial Japanese, Akio morita, CEO of Sony, and the right-wing politician shintaro ishihara, made a series of speeches which have been compilés and published in 1986 under the Japan that can say no Japan which can [to].</seg>
<seg id=765>They have sketched a national strategy in which the influence of scientific découlerait world power.</seg>
<seg id=766>The main idea is that the military power could be made obsolete if the "food chain" of military technology was controlled by the other nations.</seg>
<seg id=767>The title of the Paper refers to Japan project to say "no" to influence us military once that Japan maîtrisera the main military technology.</seg>
<seg id=768>Building a knowledge-based economy through the wealth outcomes oil is possible.</seg>
<seg id=769>The Texas for example, like most States South, the US was once economically poor and declining.</seg>
<seg id=770>Even with oil revenues, the flow of dollars in the economy, in itself, is not enough to boost prosperity as might believe that.</seg>
<seg id=771>The Texas has therefore decided to devote oil money to money for education.</seg>
<seg id=772>Today, this amount is roughly equal to that of the University of Harvard, it extends to 15 universities.</seg>
<seg id=773>It has had a staggering: the aerospace industry has virtually disappeared from California but it explodes Texas.</seg>
<seg id=774>At research and the consortia of telecommunications have précipités Texas, until the giant Canadian Nortel telecommunications.</seg>
<seg id=775>Although industry knows a crisis in the United States, Texas has one of the most solid industrial economies.</seg>
<seg id=776>There is no reason why that the same results can be achieved in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=777>But above all, the Islamic world to rediscover and reconcile itself with its proud legacy.</seg>
<seg id=778>The debate on Iran Iraq</seg>
<seg id=779>No Middle East countries do follows events of the post-war Iraq as close to Iran.</seg>
<seg id=780>The geographic proximity, an intense and violent history of war with Iraq Saddam Hussein, of religious and emotional connections with Shia in Iraq, some concern in the United States and to their policy in the region: these are son who unite Iran to its neighbour western.</seg>
<seg id=781>Given the tensions endless with America, Iran is particularly concerned by the possibility of an American presence continues in its neighbour and by the dominant role of America in building the future of Iraq's post-Saddam.</seg>
<seg id=782>Foreign observers can find difficult to follow the internal discussions Iranians, but they exist, they are intense, even if they are not always visible to the public international in general.</seg>
<seg id=783>We can release three general approaches in the Iranian evolving debate about Iraq's post-Saddam.</seg>
<seg id=784>The pragmatistes Iranian support that Iran will inevitably cooperate with the US in Iraq's post-Saddam, even if only to ensure that the rights of the Shiite population of Iraq are respected.</seg>
<seg id=785>For this reason, Iran should win the assurance that the new Iraqi leader does it is hostile and will seek to gain the bilateral friendships.</seg>
<seg id=786>Other considerations are essential for pragmatistes preserving the territorial integrity of Iraq and repatriation tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.</seg>
<seg id=787>These are moderates who think that the Iranian Government should insist us for the extradition of members of the organization of moudjahidins Khalq MKO () based in Iraq, as well as the total dismantling of organization.</seg>
<seg id=788>In exchange, the Iranian Government should offer its support to ensure peace, stability and security in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=789>In sum, the pragmatistes want limit relations américano Iranian, focusing on a platform reflecting greatly concerns internal of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=790>In general, the conservative forces Iran support this approach.</seg>
<seg id=791>Another approach proposes a more active role and cooperative for Iran in the reconstruction of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=792>Advocates of this position support that Iran is well placed to facilitate the reconstruction, because of its infrastructure established of personal and institutional links with Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=793>Finally, we think t, the US and the international community will the value of cooperation Iran.</seg>
<seg id=794>Cooperation Iran should be rewarded by the dismantling of infrastructure of MKO in Iraq, perhaps in exchange for a promise Iran to address activities of Al Qaeda, as expel members of Al Qaeda to Iran.</seg>
<seg id=795>Above all, Iran should invite us to respond to its cooperation with the insurance a guarantee in return that Iran does not become in the future the target of US military actions.</seg>
<seg id=796>In short, the defenders of cooperation are calling for an open market: the explicit support of Iran to ensure stability for the transition stage today as its commitment to maintain relations of cooperation with any government permanent which will emerge Iraq in exchange for improving the position of regional and international Iran.</seg>
<seg id=797>This position is widely shared among reformers movements in Iran, within and outside the administration, as well as by the technocratic and business class which the orientation is more international.</seg>
<seg id=798>Finally, the radicals Iranians, the possibility of cooperation with the United States is pure fantasy.</seg>
<seg id=799>They are convinced that America does that seeks to undermine the security Iranian and endangering its national interests.</seg>
<seg id=800>The radicals, the United States to seek to impose the least changes to the Iranian Foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id=801>At worst, they say, America will seek to impose a change of regime in Iran to actively.</seg>
<seg id=802>It militera with enthusiasm against the acquisition of knowledge and nuclear energy by Iran and could even trying to weaken the military capability of Iran as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=803>Radicals perceive the American invasion of Iraq as reflects the will of American encercler Iran.</seg>
<seg id=804>In return, they think that Iran must adopt a position aggressive in defending its interests, forming strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers and use the influence Iran in Iraq to prevent the formation of a government pro-American and anti Iranian Baghdad.</seg>
<seg id=805>Supporters of the hardliners from all sides support this approach.</seg>
<seg id=806>The overthrow of Saddam and his regime was that the most difficult aspect the Iraq crisis.</seg>
<seg id=807>Now the most hard to do: to peace and security, win the war on terrorism and convince the Muslim masses that America does not intend to occupy Iraq to siphonner all its oil resources and redesign the middle to its image.</seg>
<seg id=808>Meanwhile, the opposition against the US, the expression of suicide bomb or other forms of terrorism, will probably only grow.</seg>
<seg id=809>Iran is designed to keep its position decisive in the region through its dynamism and its political identity Muslim whose ECHO rings around the Muslim world.</seg>
<seg id=810>What happens in Iraq has major implications in Iran and the US would do well to find a way to recognize this state of affairs.</seg>
<seg id=811>The American threats, or discussions on another war, fuel to the fire resentment and frustration in Iran, strengthening the most radical movements.</seg>
<seg id=812>If the US to avoid such effects, they must accept their influence to limit its own radicals, assuming that American interests in Iraq are best defended through cooperation with Iran.</seg>
<seg id=813>A solution for Iraq</seg>
<seg id=814>The situation in Iraq, came to the point where everyone wants conspicuously the same: the departure of the coalition forces.</seg>
<seg id=815>The recent disclosure of note confidential Ministry of Defence on British withdrawal comes to this aspiration.</seg>
<seg id=816>The only question is how to satisfy.</seg>
<seg id=817>As the coalition forces will remain, violence will increase.</seg>
<seg id=818>However, if they leave, the escalation of violence will take place, and even faster.</seg>
<seg id=819>The real question is how to Iraq to organize an army and the police to which one can trust to enforce the law and order.</seg>
<seg id=820>There is still a long way to go to approach this purpose.</seg>
<seg id=821>Despite the courage many Iraqis who join the ranks of the police and the army will surprise no one that some have incentives less than pure.</seg>
<seg id=822>In northern Iraq, one rule old accounts and the ethnic segregation is introduced in fact in some areas traditionally mixed as irbil.</seg>
<seg id=823>In other regions, the sharia is imposed.</seg>
<seg id=824>How Iraq can create bodies likely to enforce the law effectively and impartiality, regardless of ethnic, religious or kind?</seg>
<seg id=825>The answer is traditional to recruit and train inculcate, and the "good values."</seg>
<seg id=826>But the time lack.</seg>
<seg id=827>We must find other ways.</seg>
<seg id=828>In the absence of a system of value deeply rooted, Iraq needs associations embedded in civil society, in which the police and army will have to account.</seg>
<seg id=829>They may take various forms, but the most important is that they are really extended locally, and they have the support of the district authorities, the region and country when they indicate abuses.</seg>
<seg id=830>If a local monitoring is implemented, completed recognized and national level, while most of the members of the military and police, will probably be properly, otherwise, it will be easier to identify and manage.</seg>
<seg id=831>Such measures may appear disproportionately optimistic, yet in Afghanistan, a country which looks like Iraq under many aspects, many groups working well.</seg>
<seg id=832>The cooperation for peace and unity (cpau) gives a model of how to operate.</seg>
<seg id=833>In Afghanistan, in Iraq, the priority ordinary people was to reduce violence.</seg>
<seg id=834>The cpau worked throughout the country over the past three years to implement the committees peace in districts, supported by advice peace satellites in the villages.</seg>
<seg id=835>This initiative confront a culture in which violence is so rooted that children, at a time, apprenaient the arithmetic in cash Soviet soldiers dead.</seg>
<seg id=836>Committees have therefore tried to bring together all the groups of the Community, including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, the police and judges businessmen, so to devise ways of resolving conflicts without violence.</seg>
<seg id=837>Even if the committees do not officially play a role of control so far (is expected in the future), the fact that police, army, and justice in part the into contact with the rest of the Community allows a return of information, and contributes to the establishment of relations of trust.</seg>
<seg id=838>Some results are remarkable.</seg>
<seg id=839>In a workshops, the local military commander has come to a few hours out, and ended up remain all week.</seg>
<seg id=840>It is a party to apologise for its past violent and is committed to disarm his private army of 2,000 men.</seg>
<seg id=841>It makes today regularly offices to visit the committee.</seg>
<seg id=842>In Iraq, as the humanitarian projects linking center of Kirkuk begin to fill a monitoring function by offering to the population to various ethnic opportunity to expose its complaints and obtain assistance to resolve their problems.</seg>
<seg id=843>But too often, even in the case of a trial, the judgment is not applied for victims to give the threat.</seg>
<seg id=844>The US and British forces have already well worked to strengthen civil society.</seg>
<seg id=845>But we do not intend to speak workshops emancipation of women or the success of local elections in small-scale in the country.</seg>
<seg id=846>Mobilize civil society represents a huge challenge, especially when, as in Iraq, must be quickly and on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id=847>The military forces remain necessary, but as the encouragement to disarmament, which can take the form of prospects of economic opportunities more successful that crime and theft.</seg>
<seg id=848>Fortunately, such an organization of civil society is so expensive that important.</seg>
<seg id=849>The association humanitarian linking center treats all Kirkuk for an annual cost of $75,000 us.</seg>
<seg id=850>With 10 million dollars, we could implement a hundred centers of similar, and it will remain the currency.</seg>
<seg id=851>It is now to engage in this direction, to support without faillir the brave people that is the challenge to demand accountability in power.</seg>
<seg id=852>Otherwise, the Iraqi people may not know security which he desperately needs after so many years of suffering.</seg>
<seg id=853>The democracy on Nile?</seg>
<seg id=854>The decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak surprise to propose a constitutional amendment enabling of holding direct presidential elections and competitive could very well be a giant step forward for democracy in Egypt and in the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id=855>The Western accustomed to a pluralist democracy may have difficulty in understanding how this decision potentially considerable will change in a country accoutumé in military rule for over 50 years.</seg>
<seg id=856>Under the current system, the Egyptian citizens can manifest itself only the day a presidential referendum held all six years to say yes or no to the only name is on the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id=857>This explains why an individual like Mubarak has always received over 90% of the votes, albeit a middle participation rate indifferent.</seg>
<seg id=858>Men strong Syrian and Iraqis have even more with this system, probably because they have demanded that the names and addresses the voters are placed bottom of every election.</seg>
<seg id=859>Many people support long that democratization in the Middle East cannot progress as Egypt does not will fully in the process.</seg>
<seg id=860>Egypt would really commit a path of democratization without first amending its constitution, in order to reduce pharaoniques powers of its President and limiting the length of his term.</seg>
<seg id=861>Mubarak, after all, is already in its 24ème year as President.</seg>
<seg id=862>Thus, his announcement of presidential elections competitive represents a first step.</seg>
<seg id=863>The regime can assume that it will be able to use the process to its advantage, but events may be more difficult to monitor than expected once that citizens start to feel responsabilisés.</seg>
<seg id=864>The genius democratic came out of the bottle.</seg>
<seg id=865>In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this region troubled to engage the path to democracy.</seg>
<seg id=866>Turkey on one side of the Middle East and Morocco, the other already committed process.</seg>
<seg id=867>The real substance of lame seems this time result of proximity time and results of the recent elections held in Iraq, in Palestine, and to a lesser degree, Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=868>The unprecedented protests against occupation of Lebanon, Syria following the assassination of the former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, Al, do not seem to mitigate.</seg>
<seg id=869>Opposition groups Egyptian have also held steps increasingly bold and other forms of civil disobedience in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id=870>The catalyst for their anger was the arrest and detention of the opposition leader Ayman Nour, sick, end January.</seg>
<seg id=871>The attitude arbitrary government has reinvigorated the national Kifaya Movement (which means "enough"), which called for the end of Mubarak regime.</seg>
<seg id=872>Suddenly, conventional wisdom that the egyptiens are passive and have fear act has more appeared to verify.</seg>
<seg id=873>An alliance of forces local, regional and international it unites against tyranny permanent pressure on the banks of Nile.</seg>
<seg id=874>The recent wave of popular pressure appears rocked the regime.</seg>
<seg id=875>Only a month ago, muybarak écartait for constitutional reform in the taxing of "futile.</seg>
<seg id=876>But, whatever the combination of events has this U-turn, initiative relative elections must be welcomed.</seg>
<seg id=877>This is a first necessary step, although insufficient, to revise the stagnant political system in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id=878>The egyptiens distrust each already reforms symbolic in Tunisia, countries in which President Zine El abidin bin Ali, holding office long created a caricature of constitutional amendment which seemed the way the presidential elections competitive, but which has subsequently led a sham contest with some "opponents" sorted on results.</seg>
<seg id=879>In previous referenda presidential Tunisians, bin Ali récoltait systematically 99% of the vote; it has now achieved 96%.</seg>
<seg id=880>Hope that Mubarak is serious about electoral reform.</seg>
<seg id=881>To prove his sincerity, it must order the immediate release of Ayman Nour and take steps to end the emergency of 24 years, which prevents successfully organization of political campaigns.</seg>
<seg id=882>Mubarak must also approve a limit of two successive mandates for five years for every President.</seg>
<seg id=883>Equally necessary, measures to winning the trust of citizens, including open and equal access to the media, which are now controlled by the state.</seg>
<seg id=884>I announced that I intended to argue this presidential election coming to open the debate on these essential reforms.</seg>
<seg id=885>But I retournerai with pleasure in my life of private citizen when I have the assurance of a free and open election next autumn.</seg>
<seg id=886>If they are seriously implemented, these steps transformeront the legacy of Mubarak</seg>
<seg id=887>With the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine, they could well inaugurate a spring of Arab freedom, expected a very long time.</seg>
<seg id=888>The elections historical for Egypt?</seg>
<seg id=889>The Egyptian will go to the polls to elect a President 7 September among 10 candidate, whose Hosni Mubarak, power 24 years.</seg>
<seg id=890>So little doubt that it will be re-elected following the election, many to follow the steps with passion.</seg>
<seg id=891>Some 6,000 national electoral observers were trained for an opportunity, and hundreds of international observers will arrive in the country this week.</seg>
<seg id=892>Although all external signs of a real electoral competition are implemented, it is striking that several signs of authenticity lack the appeal.</seg>
<seg id=893>Despite the promises of the contrary, the conditions are far from fair game.</seg>
<seg id=894>Mubarak has a disproportionate number of benefits: recognition of the name, a virtual monopoly electronic media controlled by the state and nothing less than 85% written media.</seg>
<seg id=895>A week before the election, some of the opposition candidates have not yet had an opportunity to provide a single campaign on television Egypt.</seg>
<seg id=896>All members of the electoral commission presidential are appointed by Mubarak and the new electoral rules have eliminated all independent competitors.</seg>
<seg id=897>Since 2000, a decision of the Supreme Court states that the 8,000 Egyptian judges must oversee the elections and certify results.</seg>
<seg id=898>It is a major step towards fairer elections, because the Union professional judges remained relatively independent in the last half-century of stranglehold on the executive.</seg>
<seg id=899>Mubarak's regime therefore had to use various subterfuge to neutralize the Union judges.</seg>
<seg id=900>One was a étirer the definition of "judicial" to include thousands of employees graduates in law, without experience to court but faithful government. it leaves little room for real judges, because if they protest in boycottant their work of observation, the task will return once again to the police, the infamous Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
<seg id=901>Thus, in the past, the Union judges has acquitted its task, with results predictable.</seg>
<seg id=902>In the parliamentary elections in 2000, while the ruling party of Mubarak has received that approximately 38% of the vote areas watched by real judges, the results have managed to culminate to 86% when almost judges were responsible for observation.</seg>
<seg id=903>This year promises to be very different.</seg>
<seg id=904>In the spring, the judges held a meeting of national scope and resolved that unless the government will give them a complete independence and exclusive surveillance process elections, they do not contrôleraient the presidential elections (or parliamentary) ahead.</seg>
<seg id=905>On 2 September, they exposed their ultimate requirement: the regime must allow groups civilians to monitor the elections, to change the definition of judges in a legitimate purpose electoral, and accept that no ballot box leaves the presence of a judge legitimate without that its content is relied, certified and postponed.</seg>
<seg id=906>For now it appears that the situation is no outcome, as the head of the electoral commission presidential announced publicly on television Egyptian it refused any observation by citizens of elections.</seg>
<seg id=907>Among the interesting developments on the eve of the election, a figure heated public debate on the subject: should boycott the election or go vote?</seg>
<seg id=908>Many opposition parties have called their members to abstain to protest electoral restrictive rules which promote highly Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id=909>Moreover, the Muslim Brotherhood, considered forming the only group of opposition of weight with Egypt, push their supporters to vote according to their conscience but not to support any "governing corrupt and despotic."</seg>
<seg id=910>This is an implicit répudiation but clear of Mubarak, only Head of State for 24 years.</seg>
<seg id=911>Some 34 civil society organisations prepare thousands of young Egyptian to monitor the elections despite the objections government repeated.</seg>
<seg id=912>These groups argue that if the regime does not intend to rigging the elections, then the national and international observers should not pose any problem.</seg>
<seg id=913>The response of the regime is that any monitoring is external interference in Egypt, sovereignty and that the national observers would constitute an affront to the integrity of judges.</seg>
<seg id=914>This argument is fast fell when the Union judges spoke for observers from civil society.</seg>
<seg id=915>The Mubarak regime is afraid of votes from within and outside it who are the challenge of holding free and fair elections, or is it simply unable to remove the cheating within party as it became inherent in its operation, the current présagent signs do nothing good about the vote to Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id=916>Meanwhile, for the first time the Egyptian are experience of exciting challenge to tyranny, benefit, a new area of freedom.</seg>
<seg id=917>The European envy dollar</seg>
<seg id=918>The currency can play a vital role not only in commercial transactions, but also in the diplomatic and political wrangling.</seg>
<seg id=919>When this happens, commercial transactions and become difficult subject to greater uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id=920>The politicization of money in the interwar and depression proved economically devastating.</seg>
<seg id=921>But the violent wars of currencies have taken place recently.</seg>
<seg id=922>In the 1960s, the international monetary order became the subject of fierce political struggle.</seg>
<seg id=923>Each player had the theories and explanations markedly different situation.</seg>
<seg id=924>Europeans, particularly the French, were complaining that the General Charles de Gaulle qualifiait "privilege exorbitant" of the US dollar.</seg>
<seg id=925>The general and its monetary guru, Jacques rueff, supported that the US used the status of the dollar as a reserve currency major fixed exchange rate system of Bretton Woods to manage deficits and pay their military aventurisme abroad (at that time in Vietnam).</seg>
<seg id=926>France has responded by calling for monetary reform would end the special role of the dollar and tried to resurrect the gold largely discredited.</seg>
<seg id=927>Europeans have began a long discussion on the advantages of monetary union, whose implementation would enable them to compete with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id=928>But the view us the international role of the dollar was a trap.</seg>
<seg id=929>Other countries could change their exchange rate and could thus maintain greater competition in exports.</seg>
<seg id=930>The US government has proved powerless to yen undervalued, fueling the belief that the rest of the world the dollar used to attack the basis of manufacturing of America.</seg>
<seg id=931>The Nixon administration concluded that the only way to save the American economy was to engage in a unilateralism monetary (a monetary expansion spectacular so that other countries would be forced to adjust their exchange rates).</seg>
<seg id=932>These battles long forgotten seem very suddenly present again.</seg>
<seg id=933>The world has no more than a system of fixed exchange rate, but the dollar is a currency reserve major, a kind of Bretton Woods floating.</seg>
<seg id=934>For us, the role of reserve dollar threatens potential while not for the Americans would be instead of another example of imperial néo quest for American hegemony.</seg>
<seg id=935>Over the past decade, China has taken place of Japan the 1960s, preventing its exchange rates of up to push export growth.</seg>
<seg id=936>This has made it the target of American recriminations about unfair competition and to efforts to impose an adjustment exchange rate likely to deter the Americans to buy toys, equipment and clothing Chinese.</seg>
<seg id=937>American manufacturers have estimated that bra produced in China threatened the American way of life.</seg>
<seg id=938>Meanwhile, with Europeans (especially the French) complain of huge deficits Americans and the argument of de Gaulle claiming that the rest of the world pays for wars of America is again fashionable.</seg>
<seg id=939>Some Europeans suggest that Asian central banks should hold a greater share of their reserves in euros, an echo of the unsuccessful attempt of general to capitulate America by selling $against of gold.</seg>
<seg id=940>The 1960s have completed by a collapse of the "and" system by a major financial turbulence, accompanied by a wave of inflationary price goods.</seg>
<seg id=941>Everyone was hit and the role of America in the world has been undermined.</seg>
<seg id=942>A similar collapse at present should have a markedly different.</seg>
<seg id=943>The system of current floating rates is more stable and the costs of adjusting distributed differently.</seg>
<seg id=944>The majority of Americans do not suffer many marked the fall of the dollar because sellers foreigners should proceed to price adjustments to the American market.</seg>
<seg id=945>The Asian economies development vigorously and their central banks their rely on the US.</seg>
<seg id=946>They should continue this policy not to see their export sectors suffer sudden failure on the American market capital.</seg>
<seg id=947>The US will thus more time to deal with a deficit of Auditors currents which révèlera unsustainable in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=948>Regions economically dynamic world (North America and Asia) are linked together by a Pact that will ensure the continuity of the centrality of the US dollar.</seg>
<seg id=949>The Americans will continue to accumulate debts because the Asian encourage them.</seg>
<seg id=950>The repeal Pact would be contrary to the interests of both parties.</seg>
<seg id=951>This is not an American unilateralism because the Pact means cooperation with Asia.</seg>
<seg id=952>But for Europeans, who are excluded Pact, this pact is like a unilateralism monetary and economic.</seg>
<seg id=953>Meanwhile, the supremacy of the euro on the dollar is suffer the European industrial exporters.</seg>
<seg id=954>Europe is not, however, able to alleviate.</seg>
<seg id=955>Europe will indeed the greatest victim of new clashes of currencies.</seg>
<seg id=956>The answers pronostiquées in the 1960s (recovery of gold or invention of a common European currency) seem more helpful.</seg>
<seg id=957>A single currency did not provide protection consequent.</seg>
<seg id=958>The former version of the European reaction (what psychologists call "the envy dollar) only become more pénétrante.</seg>
<seg id=959>The European Central Bank will be invited to extend the monetary basis, as if the imitation dollar was the answer to all problems industrial, structural and demographic that taking over Europe.</seg>
<seg id=960>But we should remember that the problems of Europe are not the manipulation of currencies.</seg>
<seg id=961>The protests against the new version of privilege monetary exorbitant America's be seen for what they are: a means to compensate for real European powerlessness.</seg>
<seg id=962>The envy of the dollar is not ready to disappear and it will, the value of the dollar international disparaissant without provoke a clearly adverse effects on people's impriment and use.</seg>
<seg id=963>An outbreak of policy</seg>
<seg id=964>Americans, like the citizens of all countries in the world, came to accept the fact that policy plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public representatives.</seg>
<seg id=965>Few of us are surprised (although some may be disappointed) when a federal judge or a diplomat senior is appointed because he managed a crucial test of fidelity to an important principle in the eyes of the party of President or the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id=966>But science, in the view of all, occupies, and here the us beginning to be an example of warning to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=967>The scientific appointments must be based on objective criteria training, competence and performance.</seg>
<seg id=968>Has the evidence, it is legitimate to ask a future Secretary to health services and human ssh () on its views on abortion.</seg>
<seg id=969>But it is wrong to submit candidates accepted to sit in consultative committees to scientific tests on political loyalty.</seg>
<seg id=970>Similarly, membership agencies looking proposals scientists, a process for basic scientific progress, should undoubtedly be affranchie of all barriers that are not related to professional qualifications.</seg>
<seg id=971>Unfortunately, the United States collide Scientists increasingly to these barriers.</seg>
<seg id=972>During the last autumn, magazine Science published several reports on the issue.</seg>
<seg id=973>One of these reports was about the massive replacement of members of the Consultative Committee of the national health environmental, part of the central disease prevention and control (CDC), without prior consultation with the director of the.</seg>
<seg id=974>Similar cases were also seen in the advisory committee we lead poisoning and prevention of CDC, the Advisory Committee is national human research protections and the advisory committee is genetic testing.</seg>
<seg id=975>The current outbreak of ideology, where the advisory committees are dissolved then reformés with new members, and where the candidates are subject to tests of loyalty, outdated seems to some observers.</seg>
<seg id=976>Representatives of ssh have spoken as a "fair" common practice.</seg>
<seg id=977>This is not a common practice in America, or at least not until today.</seg>
<seg id=978>In any case, the fact that the Bush administration is to testing of the candidates in key positions to determine their compatibility with its "values" is not really worrying.</seg>
<seg id=979>The most alarming development concerns the degree of importance of ideological investigations which immiscent in areas so far immunisés against such manipulation.</seg>
<seg id=980>Indeed, the most revealing in this epidemic political growing may have concerned the overhaul of belonging to the section to study the National Institute of occupational safety and health, which assesses subsidies the study of wounds occurred at work.</seg>
<seg id=981>The consultative committees could have been vulnerable to an occasional overhaul of this kind in the past.</seg>
<seg id=982>After all, they have recommended policies that politicians or taking into consideration.</seg>
<seg id=983>But the sections study?</seg>
<seg id=984>In October 2002, Science published an editorial of David michaels and many of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id=985>Several of them were former distinguished officials who participated in some of the committees concerned and they have provided a valuable view the issue, based on their personal experience.</seg>
<seg id=986>Their article was a case in itself, but the consequences it has had were more interesting.</seg>
<seg id=987>It has triggered a stolen of letters which scientists évoquaient similar experiences.</seg>
<seg id=988>A candidate in muscular dystrophy research coordinating committee of the National Institute of Health told that an inquiry was conducted on it by a Member of the White House.</seg>
<seg id=989>Having been invited to about its views on the various policies of the Bush administration, no, it did in connection with the work of the Committee, it had to indicate whether it supported policy of President embryonic stem cells.</seg>
<seg id=990>Another person to be distinguished from, a professor of psychiatry and psychology told having received a call from the White House on his appointment in national Council one drug abuse.</seg>
<seg id=991>His interlocutor he said that he should be investigated him to "whether its views could them President".</seg>
<seg id=992>According to Professor, a series of questions has ensuivie representative of the White House takes a statement rating.</seg>
<seg id=993>For example: 'You have achieved two on three; President is opposed to exchange needles [for users of drugs intraveineuses] moral grounds, whatever the result. "</seg>
<seg id=994>Then the conversation took a round even more alarming.</seg>
<seg id=995>The representative asked the candidate if he had voted for Bush and, having answered negative, he asked: 'why did you not supported President? "</seg>
<seg id=996>This attitude is apparent a dictatorship, and not a democracy.</seg>
<seg id=997>The aim is to provide consultative committees scientific advice and impartial réfléchis the political process.</seg>
<seg id=998>There is nothing to gain and much to lose, when a political result sought is put forward.</seg>
<seg id=999>That is why the determination of research projects to support has been an issue to be addressed by objectively peers, not by politicians.</seg>
<seg id=1000>Indeed, the law that applies here (the law on federal advisory committees, the Federal Advisory Committee act) requires explicitly that the committees are impartial and "no influenced by inadequate in authority détenant power of appointment."</seg>
<seg id=1001>American Secretary to health services and the human Tommy Thompson and the office of the White House staff should set an example to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1002>They can do this very easily: respecting the law.</seg>
<seg id=1003>Murder Moscow</seg>
<seg id=1004>It is time to end the fiction that the "dictatorship of law" of Vladimir Putin made postcommunist Russia itself as a little law-abiding.</seg>
<seg id=1005>The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one journalists among the best and most bold of Russia, a woman who dared to day brutal killings committed by the Russian soldiers in Chechnya, is the ultimate proof that President Putin is runs a dictatorship innocent demonstrating the ordinary contempt about the law.</seg>
<seg id=1006>It is time for the rest of the world to acknowledge, especially for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1007>The German Foreign Ministry preparing a policy on relations between Russia and Germany, which should take indifference to the lack of respect for the law shown by Putin as national interests of the most powerful member of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1008>But indifference becomes the reconcile when it encourages Putin to continue on this path in the international arena, as demonstrated by his campaign today to economically strangle Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1009>The murder of Politkovskaya has a sinister taste of déjà vu: as in the days of glory of kbg in Russia, Putin people disappear, simply.</seg>
<seg id=1010>The assassination of Politkovskaya is the third murder apparently policy in three week.</seg>
<seg id=1011>Enver ziganshin engineer, chief of BP Russia, was killed by the ball irkoutsk on 30 September.</seg>
<seg id=1012>Andrei Kozlov, vice governor of the Central Bank of Russia, was a campaign against financial fraud, was murdered on 14 September.</seg>
<seg id=1013>The fact that the Prosecutor to Russia iouri tchaïka takes the investigation into the murder of Politkovskaya in hand, as it has for the Kozlov, is not a source of hope, as would be the case in real democracy if a high official if it meant in a survey.</seg>
<seg id=1014>In fact, involvement of the highest levels of government in Russia is almost an assurance that the murderous will never recovered.</seg>
<seg id=1015>The murder of Politkovskaya is a particularly bode sinister when one considers the fact that émettait virulent criticism of the place of the Russian President.</seg>
<seg id=1016>In its articles on one of the few newspapers, independent of Moscow, novaïa gazeta, and in his books "Putin of Russia: life in a democracy failing" and "a dirty war: a Russian journalist in Chechnya" Politkovskaya commentait removing the freedoms which sign Putin's presidency.</seg>
<seg id=1017>As is the fate of old businessmen exiles Boris berezovski and Vladimir gusinki, and the oil magnat imprisoned Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the fate of enemies Putin can take three forms: the prison, exile or the grave.</seg>
<seg id=1018>I am not being to blame the government in Putin have ordered the killing of Politkovskaya.</seg>
<seg id=1019>After all, as the investigative journalist enragé campaign, it has many other people, Putin, of which the current Prime Minister Chechen Ramzan Kadyrov is not least, it has accused of pursue abduction against ransoms.</seg>
<seg id=1020>But even if the associated, Vladimir Putin had nothing to do with murder by ball of Politkovskaya in a lift its building of central Moscow, its contempt of law created a climate in which murder was committed.</seg>
<seg id=1021>Like the murder of Thomas Beckett in its Cathedral of Canterbury there are centuries, the crime was committed with the clear conviction that King to be satisfied.</seg>
<seg id=1022>Given what Politkovskaya was — the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies — the government should ensure that it does not happen.</seg>
<seg id=1023>Putin's Russia has already lost 12 prominent journalists, murdered in the last six years.</seg>
<seg id=1024>None of these crimes have been élucidé, which would not be the case if the "dictatorship of law" of Putin was more than an public relations strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1025>The six years that have passed since the arrival of Vladimir Putin's Kremlin were marked by signals deeply contradictory.</seg>
<seg id=1026>On one side, the world sees a young leader diplômé commit to modernize Russia, and particularly to align the application of the law and judicial practices to international standards.</seg>
<seg id=1027>A side, President does is look without saying nothing while his former colleagues the Security Service (FSB Russian the former KGB) does not protect those who are kill, and even are a series of cases of espionage notorious against journalists, scientists and ecological activists.</seg>
<seg id=1028>Among these "néo spies" are the journalist Gregori Pasko, the expert in arms control Igor soutiagine, diplomat Valentin moiseïev, physicist Valentin Danilov and many others.</seg>
<seg id=1029>The influence supposément civilising that involves the fact of being a partner Western, chairing the G8 Summit in Saint Petersburg, for example, appears not count for anything in the Kremlin cabal of Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1030>Once again, contact with the values of the West gave rise to another Potemkin village; Russia presents a facade of laws and democratic, but behind this décor in cardboard it is the same butes arbitrary that make the law.</seg>
<seg id=1031>Globally, the danger is that the laws throughout shown by Putin to exports.</seg>
<seg id=1032>Close borders Russians, a form of diplomacy criminalised is about to take root.</seg>
<seg id=1033>Think of how Putin tried to rigging the elections in Ukraine, and the charges made without cesses remote and against the leader of the opposition Yulia Timoshenko.</seg>
<seg id=1034>Consider the secessionist regions playing the tireurs francs in Moldova and Georgia, who only exist because they have the support of the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1035>Look like the Kremlin seeks to sing its neighbours by threatening their energy supplies.</seg>
<seg id=1036>All police know that when you ignores the behavior criminals, in that they become more daring.</seg>
<seg id=1037>It is high time that the world recognizes Vladimir Putin for what it is: a man who Russia back to countries shadows.</seg>
<seg id=1038>The world must now consider this old Latin maxim which tacet consentere videtur: who does what word agrees, question whether it is really wise to consent to quietly construction by Putin a superpower of energy where the law does not.</seg>
<seg id=1039>A pipeline to strengthen empire in Russia</seg>
<seg id=1040>Gerhard Schröder, that there is less than a month, was still German Chancellor accepted to become President of the company responsible for ‘ building a pipeline from Russia to Germany across the Baltic Sea and Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1041>In many countries, Schröder easily be accused of offence of conflict of interest.</seg>
<seg id=1042>Its apparent failure moral is amplified by the fact that at the same time, Russia threatens to stop gas supply of Ukraine if this does not give in to demands tariff of the gas giant Gazprom, property state Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1043>The strategic objective of Russia is clear. now, no more distribute gas to Ukraine also means that much of Europe will no longer approvisionnée, because most of the major pipeline across Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id=1044>Bypassing Poland, Ukraine, and of course, the Baltic States, the new pipeline will influence the Kremlin which seeks to impose again in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1045>President Vladimir Putin and his government of clones of former KGB no longer have to care reactions of Western Europe when they decide how tough pressure on the post-communist neighbours of Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1046>Europe should really equip Putin such a weapon imperialist?</seg>
<seg id=1047>Worse still, Russia should use this weapon to the EU to boot-shaped energy?</seg>
<seg id=1048>As a former German Chancellor takes the leadership of the company that will provide Russia way to manipulate the European economy testifies to the dangerous complacency of Europe against the imperialist ambitions of néo Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1049>Of course, the Russian media are aware of the growing dependence of Europe by reports of energy resources of Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1050>They will until the délecter. The éditorialistes Russian wrote "when we will have integrated and extended our energy trade with Europe, it will keep silence on the issue of human rights."</seg>
<seg id=1051>Putin expresses this position more oblique in engaging to pursue what he calls a "political" of independence.</seg>
<seg id=1052>So does simply mean that Russia must remain "independent" concerns of Western democracies concerning ethical and human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1053>It may be that some European leaders really believe that maintaining the soft prosperity the EU justifies are taise about human rights and other topics which fâchent the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id=1054>Of course, we must express ourselves briefly issues "trade ', as expropriation of Yukos. But if the Kremlin would monnayer values or our critical of it -- as about Chechnya bloodstained -- it seems that Europeans préfèreraient shut up that to confront a potential energy prices or even a blockade, like that which Ukraine is facing.</seg>
<seg id=1055>While Putin réorganise its court, by submitting the Duma to its desire, the hopes of the EU to see Russia become increasingly 'European' should be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=1056>Russia that Putin is becoming build has gradually transformed has délaissé its hopes of freedom post-Soviet to become a bulwark oil and gas in the new elite of former KGB.</seg>
<seg id=1057>Indeed, Matthias warnig, the director of the consortium gas pipeline led by Schröder, is a friend of long-standing of Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1058>Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal revealed that warnig, the director of the arms of Russian Dresdner Bank, is a former officer of the Stasi, former secret police to Germany's east, and that he met Putin in the late 1980s while Russian President was KGB spy in the GDR.</seg>
<seg id=1059>That Russians accept a government formed former KGB men, for which the lack of compassion and refusal of dissent are the rule, reflects their exhaustion towards the turmoil the last twenty years.</seg>
<seg id=1060>Now the Kremlin estimates that what is good for the Russians basic is also to citizens independent nations. no pity will be given to small countries weak once that Russia détiendra the means to intimidate, to isolate and threaten the blockade of energy.</seg>
<seg id=1061>As a former head of state of the new independent Lithuania, I have often had such threats.</seg>
<seg id=1062>The European Union signed many agreements with Russia, including on a "common" area of freedom and justice.</seg>
<seg id=1063>The Kremlin is very strong to ignore such idealism.</seg>
<seg id=1064>Its control on Eastern Europe has always been imposed on the basis of "Treaties of friendship" and Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 were missions "fraternal.</seg>
<seg id=1065>But look at how Putin violates this space "common": treatment barbaric the Chechens, the imprisonment of businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky, harassment of foreign NGOs and the charge of Yuliya Tymoshenko, one égéries the Orange Revolution, by the Russian military judges on charges completely invented.</seg>
<seg id=1066>If Europeans truly believe in their area of human rights and freedoms, they must nevertheless acknowledge that these values are not shared by the men in hand calculateurs of Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1067>The same is true with regard to regard Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=1068>Is it really conceivable that the homeland of terror "red", the countless crimes punishment of the Soviet era and even hands dirty blood of Lithuania to Caucasians really can help to combat the threat world brandie by Iran and North Korea?</seg>
<seg id=1069>It seems more likely that minds heads Kremlin is contenteront to exploit every crisis to increase their power of destruction and influence.</seg>
<seg id=1070>For decades, the region I come from, Europe has been left at the mercy of evil.</seg>
<seg id=1071>That is why I cannot remain silent when Europe trébuche blindly in a new appeasement.</seg>
<seg id=1072>We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have learned from our history that behind every act diplomatic Russia's behind an imperialist ambition.</seg>
<seg id=1073>The Western Europeans, who have forgotten this story, should take account of our warnings.</seg>
<seg id=1074>The dependence on Russia -- even if it takes the face of the so-called "charismatic" Gerhard Schröder -- can we lead right in the wall.</seg>
<seg id=1075>Iraq: the bullets against the ballots voting</seg>
<seg id=1076>When the war in Iraq began in 2003, the Bush administration caressait of ambitious projects: the image of Germany and Japan post 1945, a long and peaceful occupation was envisaged, during which the increase in oil production would ensure a growing prosperity while democratic structures would édifiées coin by coin.</seg>
<seg id=1077>The Foundation should be a constitution, liberal or post-modern premium in, with the guarantee of 25% of parliamentary seats insured for women.</seg>
<seg id=1078>Iraq is current knows or peace or prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1079>The Constitution should be passed on 15 October next this includes the 25% rule, but is nothing Liberal.</seg>
<seg id=1080>The key provision (Article 2) stating that no law can contradict "undisputed laws of Islam" violates the basic principles of parliamentary sovereignty, and will prevent the legislation correspond to international standards.</seg>
<seg id=1081>For example, the age of consent for sex for girls can be high above nine years, because Mohammed itself had a wife of nine years.</seg>
<seg id=1082>It follows that the children of nine years are also adults in view of the criminal law, passables of the death penalty, for example, conversion to another religion.</seg>
<seg id=1083>The Shia can use this clause to put their ayatollahs above the elected Parliament, as in Iran, because they alone are allowed to determine the "laws of Islam.</seg>
<seg id=1084>Foreigners and the few liberal Iraqi worry most of this clause, but of Islamic opposition to the Constitution, widespread among Sunnis, seeks other provisions: exclusion of "saddamiste Baath Party" of politics and Government, and the provisions federalists who agree autonomy of Iraq's 18 provinces and enable them to join in regional governments.</seg>
<seg id=1085>The law exclusion is staff for the elites Sunnis, which include thousands of businessmen, Liberals, even of artists, who, with few exceptions, all were members of the Baath.</seg>
<seg id=1086>In theory, the constitutional ban might not be retroactively.</seg>
<seg id=1087>But in practice, administrative laws are implemented to exclude members of the Baath so-called "of high-ranking" any form of government in employment, with thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id=1088>The Sunnis would accept probably arrangements federalists if they are applied to the Kurds.</seg>
<seg id=1089>They know that the alternative is not a return to centralisation, but the secession of three provinces in Kurdish majority of dahuk, Arbil and sulaymaniyah as to form an independent Kurdistan, with its own Treasury, his army (the pesh merga), and its oil production around Kirkuk, second largest reserve from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=1090>The Sunnis reject this same federalism for Shia because they see them as fellow Arabs, who always accepted law Sunni in the past and will do so again, unless they have their own government.</seg>
<seg id=1091>This is what would the new Constitution, because the southern provinces - which have the main oil reserves - to Iraqi Shiite majority could form their own regional government.</seg>
<seg id=1092>In the Middle East, the usual style leaders Sunni disappointed and the Constitution now threaten to use violence.</seg>
<seg id=1093>But the federalism is not the only reason why supporters of supremacy Sunni and Islamists are deadly attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1094>Their opposition is most elementary: they do not accept the principle of democratic government by majority.</seg>
<seg id=1095>Instead, they seek to restore the rule of the Sunni minority.</seg>
<seg id=1096>For the Islamists, all deserve Shia death anyway, as apostats.</seg>
<seg id=1097>A leader, Shiite moqtada Sadr, has also vehemently opposed to federalism.</seg>
<seg id=1098>His followers, largely illiterate, are the poorest and violent Shia of slums in Baghdad and beyond, including the "Mahdi militia" has fought the troops in 2004, even while Americans protected Shiites, Sunnis attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1099>As a young priest drift his authority of his father, a Ayatollah died populist himself, Sadr facing the ayatollahs Iraqi opposition living, which disregard its ignorance and its violence.</seg>
<seg id=1100>Sadr absolutely cannot compete with them in terms of religious authority, so he chooses to a party Arab nationalist against them, often reminding the highest dignitaire religious Shiite, Ayatollah Sistani, is not Arab but perse.</seg>
<seg id=1101>Similarly, it reminds us in his followers that El Laâlam, who are the Supreme Council of the Islamic revolution in Iraq (sciri) and their militia "Badr" were subsidized exiles in Iran, including many fought the Iranian side during the long and bitter Iran-Iraq war, until the Americans "bring."</seg>
<seg id=1102>Sadr opposes the federalism because a regional government Shiite obéirait to its enemies Sistani, and the sciri, and says it t, fall under the Iranian.</seg>
<seg id=1103>To highlight its message, Sadr sent its militia men fight Badr, successfully in Baghdad, where mahdis many, but not in Najaf, where Sadr is haï after the destruction he has caused last year until his men are massacred by the Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1104>It was difficult enough to confront the villain Sadr. Now, a simple calculation political leaves thinking it will probably the main figure to decide the outcome of the vote by the Constitution October.</seg>
<seg id=1105>To reject the Constitution and cause new elections to a constitutional assembly, opponents need a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces.</seg>
<seg id=1106>The Sunnis are likely to win that in two provinces, but if Sadr ordonne to his supporters of slums of Baghdad to vote not with local Sunni, it will probably fall the capital hands of opponents of the Constitution and will its defeat.</seg>
<seg id=1107>As any rogue policy, Sadr is naturally to sell.</seg>
<seg id=1108>Last year it was sought for murder.</seg>
<seg id=1109>Today it seeks recognition as a statesman, it is the money, and at least implicitly, the humiliation of Sistani and sciri.</seg>
<seg id=1110>It may well receive proposals and negotiations have perhaps already begun.</seg>
<seg id=1111>But some of the Shiites he attack with words and bullets have thousands of armed men available to them and for them, it deserves to receive the bullets in return.</seg>
<seg id=1112>In the end secrecy</seg>
<seg id=1113>Transparency is not always an easy exercise in the new democracies of Eastern Europe. This would be discovered the Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, when registration where avouait the lies of his government triggered riots.</seg>
<seg id=1114>As Hungary, Romania postcommunist has to encourage openness and honesty in a society which once had the most closed in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1115>But the persistence of a culture of secrecy has explode corruption and abuses of power.</seg>
<seg id=1116>One remark but genuine development towards more transparency, evolution recognized by the European Union who gave the green light to Romania for membership at the beginning of the year 2007.</seg>
<seg id=1117>Besides the establishment of what the EU is today in a "market economy" operational, essential reforms in the political and legal, for which I am responsible, will the strengthening of transparency and control funding of political parties to the reorganization judiciary.</seg>
<seg id=1118>The judicial reforms contribute déraciner corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1119>The ministers and the former ministers, members, magistrates, lawyers, and members of the police, customs and other public bodies, as well as heads of businesses, have been review.</seg>
<seg id=1120>Moreover, new forms were developed for the statements of wealth and financial interests by people occupying functions official government, Parliament, in the public administration and local and the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id=1121>The new how declaration are more detailed in Europe, and above all they made public.</seg>
<seg id=1122>The progress of Romania are confirmed by a report published this month, that the people of Eastern Europe have now access information government as well as those established democracies of long-standing.</seg>
<seg id=1123>The report transparency and silence, the open society justice initiative (available on www.justiceinitiative.org), indicates the new democracies are sometimes better than the former Romanian government bodies: some are more to requests for information citizens that their French counterparts or Spanish.</seg>
<seg id=1124>More precisely, 60% of requests are satisfied in Romania, against 31% in France and 24% in Spain.</seg>
<seg id=1125>Among the other good performers, can quote Peru and Mexico, two countries that have adopted legislation on the freedom of information in 2002, soon after Romania.</seg>
<seg id=1126>But it is not always easier access to information in sensitive democracies in transition.</seg>
<seg id=1127>I worked as lawyer for defending human rights within the Romanian Helsinki Committee, and we have often had to seize the courts to demand the communication of information under the Romanian law of 2001 for freedom of information.</seg>
<seg id=1128>For example, when we formally gained access to data on telephone tapping allowed by the prosecutor, it has simply ignored this decision.</seg>
<seg id=1129>We have attacked the civilian, and the judge set a fine for every day to delay in information.</seg>
<seg id=1130>Only when the media were interested in the case, that the data - many tapping allowed during the previous decade, and people in duration operations - were made public.</seg>
<seg id=1131>Romania has then finally started to turn their backs on a past marked by the omnipresence Securitate.</seg>
<seg id=1132>I am now part of the government, and I realise that it is not always clear to share information with the public.</seg>
<seg id=1133>But sometimes painful that reforms are necessary.</seg>
<seg id=1134>We should not completed economic and political reform which will enable us to join the EU without submit our policies to the examination of the public and not accept the increased participation of citizens in decision-making that accompanies inevitably such openness.</seg>
<seg id=1135>Indeed, access to information became a precondition of democracy throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id=1136>When the United States adopted the Freedom of Information Act in 1966, they were the only, with Sweden and Finland.</seg>
<seg id=1137>Today, 65 countries have with such legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1138>In Romania, who fought for the adoption of a law on the freedom of information in full from party.</seg>
<seg id=1139>According to the study of Justice initiative, people who are the Romanian Government receive without great difficulty information that would have been unthinkable to communicate a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id=1140>Thus, the Romanian Ministry of Defence has leaked the number of soldiers dead in 2003, as well as the circumstances (including 13 suicide, two deaths ball, two deaths in fighting in Afghanistan).</seg>
<seg id=1141>Another example, the Court of Bucharest received a request concerning the number of judges with the subject of a disciplinary procedure since the beginning of 2000 and the motives of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=1142>The Court has transmitted request higher Council of the judiciary, which gave a comprehensive answer: four pages listing all the magistrates punished, motives and the measures taken.</seg>
<seg id=1143>This process is both the product and the engine of the pursuit of reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1144>The rulers have not always been very at ease with openness, the battle continues for the most sensitive documents.</seg>
<seg id=1145>But in the postcommunist countries, benefits of transparency are undeniable.</seg>
<seg id=1146>Yet the experience of Romania shows that official secrecy is always a threat, that no country is safe, and that only a vigilance of all moments can prevent the undermine the foundations of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1147>Save the trees Life</seg>
<seg id=1148>No one can end up its day without having used product derived from forest.</seg>
<seg id=1149>To larger than the generally, the paper on which it is written, water flowing from our taps, medicines which we soignent, wood, our homes and our furniture are facts from all the forest.</seg>
<seg id=1150>Forests we give the air we breathe and costs are home species on the way out.</seg>
<seg id=1151>They offer us also places of leisure, which is becoming increasingly important in the complexity of our world.</seg>
<seg id=1152>Approximately 1.5 billion people living in rural areas poor depend directly forests for their basic needs in food and timber of heating.</seg>
<seg id=1153>However, deforestation continues.</seg>
<seg id=1154>Every year, we lose 14.6 million hectares of forest, an area is almost as great as four times Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id=1155>Management irresponsible forests, accentuée by regulations and obligations government too weak, and the markets which reward slaughter all illegal conspire to deprive the world of its forests most precious and most under threat.</seg>
<seg id=1156>When forests are beginning to disappear, a whole set of environmental problems, social and economic follow generally, which affect us all in one way or another.</seg>
<seg id=1157>The island of Sumatra in Indonesia is a good example.</seg>
<seg id=1158>Companies of pasta and documents are an endemic destruction and illegal forests which are home the greater diversity of plants in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1159>It is very likely that plants yet unknown away in the process as developing disappearance of species such as rhinoceros and the elephant and Sumatra, as orang outang.</seg>
<seg id=1160>When the forest and Sumatra will have disappeared, whole communities will be also places without appropriate decent living or no way of living.</seg>
<seg id=1161>Moreover, the distortion that trade in illegal products and products to cheap imposes on world markets is because of difficulties for people responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1162>Developing countries lose 15 billion of tax revenue each year because of slaughter illegal.</seg>
<seg id=1163>To complicate the demand for all, timber for reconstruction following the tsunami of last year, has intensified demand already unsustainable vis-à-vis forests and Sumatra.</seg>
<seg id=1164>The water of the Amazon and Congo are the subject of similar threats.</seg>
<seg id=1165>A recent study of the UN, the assessment of the millennium ecosystems (em), shows that forests and other important areas know a serious decline because of their mismanagement and continue to disappear if serious protective measures are not implemented.</seg>
<seg id=1166>The information published by the Brazilian government show deforestation of irreplaceable forests in the Amazon, because the agricultural conversions, reached 2.6 million hectares last year, which is the total area of deforestation of the Amazon to 17%.</seg>
<seg id=1167>Yet, the battle against deforestation has not yet lost.</seg>
<seg id=1168>Different organizations, movements of defence companies and about the state forests global working together to overthrow the phenomenon of deforestation and improve the management of forests.</seg>
<seg id=1169>For example, the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) and the World Bank helped the Brazilian Government to launch an initiative designed to establish new areas of forest protection over 17 million hectares form of national parks.</seg>
<seg id=1170>Cooperation WWF and the World Bank has also motivated other partners to establish a fund to trust to manage these protected areas life imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id=1171>Similarly, a summit meeting of leaders Congo Basin has cross-border cooperation for the conservation of forests and their management enlightened.</seg>
<seg id=1172>This led thereafter the flows of 53 million dollars to the US State Department to promote the conservation of forests Congo.</seg>
<seg id=1173>Since the first meeting of leaders in 1999, 3.5 million hectares of protected areas have been newly organized in Congo Basin.</seg>
<seg id=1174>Nevertheless, given the consequences of the Asian tsunami of last December, the weight of arguments provided by the em and statistics deforestation regions most critical, we must continue our efforts.</seg>
<seg id=1175>The World Bank and the World Wildlife Fund have recently promised to work on reducing rates of 10% of global deforestation for 2010 and work with the institutions of the public and private sectors to enable the achievements ambitious for the conservation of forests.</seg>
<seg id=1176>The WWF studies show that if global forests are shared between different uses, including the protection of certain areas, managing trade responsible and restoration of countryside forestry, we can provide the needs in global forest products while values environmental and social essential to our future.</seg>
<seg id=1177>Leaders of companies, governments, civil society organisations all must play their part in achieving this vision.</seg>
<seg id=1178>The Saudis are fanatics?</seg>
<seg id=1179>The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia led many to question the prospects for survival of the House of Saud ruling and wonder about the question of whether Kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive or not.</seg>
<seg id=1180>For one reason or another, it seems that Saudi society has produced a current of fanaticism violent which puise inspiration in an extreme religious orthodoxy.</seg>
<seg id=1181>The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers in air who took part in the attacks of 11 September 2001 on the US were Saudis has crystallised a perception rooted Kingdom as the bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.</seg>
<seg id=1182>In some ways, this perception is right, but it cannot be applied to the Saudi people as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=1183>On the contrary, it would be a serious mistake to assume that the Islamic fanatic defines entirely attitudes towards Saudi religion.</seg>
<seg id=1184>Between 2001 and 2003, I was part of a team of a study large-scale values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, in Iran and Jordan.</seg>
<seg id=1185>Our results have produced a image surprisingly nuanced Saudi attitudes.</seg>
<seg id=1186>By comparison with respondents capita other countries of the Middle East, the Saudis proved the least of all religious in general, and their attitudes towards democracy and marriages arrangés also indicate a sense underlying moderate.</seg>
<seg id=1187>Certainly, in the four countries, religiosity is widespread, more than 90% of respondents indicating collectively they believe in God, into a life after death, and in the paradise and hell.</seg>
<seg id=1188>But the Saudis seem less than their religious coreligionnaires Muslims.</seg>
<seg id=1189>Sixty-two percent of Saudis have described as individuals against religious, 82% of Iran, 85% of Jordanians and 98% of egyptiens.</seg>
<seg id=1190>The Americans also appear to be religious the Saudis, with 81%.</seg>
<seg id=1191>This variation can be explained in part by transnational differences on the meaning of the term "religiosity.</seg>
<seg id=1192>For example, the Americans can define the religiosity different people in the Middle East countries, with perhaps a less pronounced attachment to religious beliefs in Islamic countries.</seg>
<seg id=1193>This could also realize partly differences between the Muslim countries.</seg>
<seg id=1194>But the gap between the Saudis on one side and the Iranians, the Jordanians egyptiens and the other on autodéfinie religiosity is so great that challenge the widespread perception of Saudi Arabia and extremely conservative religious.</seg>
<seg id=1195>Indeed, the actions that are more parlantes words: only 28% of Saudis have declared that they were attending services against religious weekly, 27% of Iran, 44% of Jordanians, 42% of egyptiens and 45% of Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1196>These conclusions, though contrary to perceptions of popular culture Saudi, are no less surprising they appear.</seg>
<seg id=1197>Sociologists of religion support long in an environment that religious monolithic, or when the religious institutions are closely linked to the State, the overall religiosity population decline.</seg>
<seg id=1198>It makes sense to believe that when the authorities of the State apply codes of behavioural rigid, people tend to rebel and to move away from religious institutions officially entérinées.</seg>
<seg id=1199>So it is surprising that the egyptiens and Jordanians, who live in countries where the state does not apply the piété, that the Iranians are religious or the Saudis, who must deal with the police "under" local supported by the State.</seg>
<seg id=1200>Even on the question of marriage, many Saudis have expressed opinions surprisingly liberal.</seg>
<seg id=1201>The respondents were shared almost equally on marriages arrangés, half backing the idea that marriage must be based on consent, parental against 48% who saw love as basic marriage.</seg>
<seg id=1202>Given the gender segregation and dominance paternal firmly embedded, this outcome seems to be a great desire for individual choice more marked in what was always, traditionally, a decision family.</seg>
<seg id=1203>Finally, the Saudis are supporters of democracy, strenuous contredisant once again image of widespread Saudi conservatism.</seg>
<seg id=1204>On all Saudis polled, 58% saw democracy as the best form of government that is, 23% were in disagreement and 18% have not expressed.</seg>
<seg id=1205>The massive support for democracy in a country without history and secular nationalist seems against intuitif.</seg>
<seg id=1206>Indeed, support for democracy corresponds to many other liberal attitudes that we have seen Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=1207>Advocates of democracy tend to be less religious, more secular, most tolerant towards others, more critical actions public sector, and more worried by the western cultural invasion.</seg>
<seg id=1208>Beyond the data of the study, history has shown that the liberal ideas become more widespread when a monarch despotic governs with the support of religious institution.</seg>
<seg id=1209>A strong tide of liberalism emerged at the end of the ninth century in Syria Ottoman in response to the religious despotism Sultan Abdulhamid.</seg>
<seg id=1210>At the same time, a secular movement anti clerical on behalf of the constitutionalism made its appearance in Iran, in reaction to the alliance between absolutiste shahs quajar and religious institution.</seg>
<seg id=1211>In light of historical similarities between these precedents and the current conditions in Saudi Arabia, we should not rule out the possibility of reform.</seg>
<seg id=1212>The data of the study also suggest that the Saudis could well demand policy more transparent and less interventionist a religion.</seg>
<seg id=1213>European Museum.</seg>
<seg id=1214>At the end of the nineteenth century, Asia represented for Europeans an inspiration artistic or the target of imperialist ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1215>Unlike, Europe was a symbol of modernity - for the era of Japanese Meiji -- or decadence -- for Chinese.</seg>
<seg id=1216>A century later, with the Japanese economic miracle, Europeans saw at least a small part of Asia as a focus of technological and industrial rapidly.</seg>
<seg id=1217>Today, at the dawn of the 21st century, the mutual perceptions of Europe and Asia's are changing radically with the Asian economies, and a successful EU in full identity crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1218>Some Asian important figures such as former Prime Minister singapourien Lee Kuan Yew, are warnings to Europeans: if they continue on this launched, their continent will soon more interest than for tourism and the range of high housing.</seg>
<seg id=1219>A businessman Chinese influential, which shares his time between Hong Kong and London, was even more specific.</seg>
<seg id=1220>He said a few weeks ago, when a demonstration in Paris private together the political leaders and big business managers: "You are becoming of third world countries. you lose your time with the constitution, the welfare state, crisis funding of pensions, and your systematically bad questions asking".</seg>
<seg id=1221>The idea that Europeans are of Asia in general, and China in particular, is more complex. It is lucid adaptation to a new competitor respectable, the rejection ideological pure.</seg>
<seg id=1222>In mai1968, some French students took to the streets to invent a new world dreamt of Mao's China, a country yet plunged a cultural revolution brutal and insane.</seg>
<seg id=1223>This absurd - as was the result of ignorance of crimes of Maoist regime, that of boredom felt in a prosperous society near full employment.</seg>
<seg id=1224>Today, their heirs openly critical the capitalist model Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1225>China, once star anti capitalist of utopian revolutionary, became the enemy ultra-liberal redouté by a new generation of utopian reactionary who defend the status quo in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1226>Students who demonstrated recently on the streets of Paris do not want imitate the Chinese and the Indians; they refuse logic of globalization and abandoning the social acquis hard gagnés.</seg>
<seg id=1227>The attitude of European economic elites is very different.</seg>
<seg id=1228>They understand that their views post colonial teintées of nostalgia, that China and India are vast market of exports and huge reservoirs of labor cheap, are obsolete.</seg>
<seg id=1229>These countries have become real competitors worthy of respect, or admiration.</seg>
<seg id=1230>The quality, the costs and the deadlines delivery - in the car industry for example - are reaching the European level.</seg>
<seg id=1231>Europe retains an advantage in the scientific disciplines, such as the pharmaceutical industry, but new enterprises very successful, especially in India, are increasingly to recruit graduates mit and Harvard, -- through wage costs still less -- to remain competitive at world level.</seg>
<seg id=1232>Unfortunately, if European leaders took awareness of Asian challenge, they have failed to bring the lesson of realism, in a context of globalization irresistible, or in a call to arms in the social and economic.</seg>
<seg id=1233>Indeed, European politicians, with very few exceptions as Tony Blair, have long overdue to adapt fulgurantes developments in Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1234>Without a long-term strategy, obsessed with short-term interests, the European politicians - unlike heads companies - have not gained respect their Asian counterparts.</seg>
<seg id=1235>That is, a continent that has failed to bury the past and to put an end to the spectrum of nationalism, the EU is also a model of reconciliation, peace and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1236>But this picture can survive a continuing decline?</seg>
<seg id=1237>For the Asian model could become a political version of Venice: a place to visit with nostalgia for greatness past, as a museum admirably.</seg>
<seg id=1238>Red and blue</seg>
<seg id=1239>The appointment of Condoleezza Rice as US Secretary of State Colin Powell in replacement of shows that the presidential elections have still powerful repercussions.</seg>
<seg id=1240>It is important that the Americans but above all the rest of the world understand what these elections we reveal America's.</seg>
<seg id=1241>The presidential election of this year shows that démocracie American is healthy, and that some gain to be improved.</seg>
<seg id=1242>Unlike the election of 2000, where President Bush had not received the support of the popular vote and barely gained the vote of the electoral college, Bush has prevailed over 3.5 million votes this time.</seg>
<seg id=1243>While some Democrats remain bitter, the legitimacy of the victory of Bush cannot be questioning.</seg>
<seg id=1244>America is strongly divided between States, red Republicans, Democrats and states, blue.</seg>
<seg id=1245>If 100,000 votes had basculé in the Ohio State red John Kerry would become President (despite a popular vote minority).</seg>
<seg id=1246>The electoral college was included in the American Constitution to protect small States in the federal system and means today that the election campaign focuses now largely over a dozen States at most, fields of battle where public opinion is closely divided.</seg>
<seg id=1247>Fundamentally, there is something to implausible in the election of Presidents without popular majority.</seg>
<seg id=1248>It is therefore time to discuss the amendment of the Constitution for abolishing the electoral college.</seg>
<seg id=1249>Some observers complain of rhetoric and advertisements negative to good cause contention that have characterised campaign.</seg>
<seg id=1250>This must be appreciate in a historical perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1251>At the time of the founding fathers, newspapers were easily Party and George wahsington sums be appalled by the harshness of language policy.</seg>
<seg id=1252>For most of its premium history, not to mention civil war and the period of reconstruction, the country was closely divided as it is today and the rhetoric of bitter campaign has always reflected this close competition.</seg>
<seg id=1253>However, despite the negative advertisements on both sides, the three national televised debates have raised important questions in a format and serious were largely followed.</seg>
<seg id=1254>In general, all President in office enjoying economic growth has every chance of being re-elected.</seg>
<seg id=1255>In that sense, the real surprise the re-election of Bush was the margin of its majority.</seg>
<seg id=1256>This is largely due to the unpopularity of the Iraq war.</seg>
<seg id=1257>Kerry has tried to turn the war, the low rate of employment, the inadequate medical coverage and tax credits for Bush towards the classes favored central issues in the campaign but some observers have felt that could not to send a clear message.</seg>
<seg id=1258>Bush has contré with the issue of security against terrorism and a populism cultural issues such as abortion, gay marriage.</seg>
<seg id=1259>Finally, the cultural populism and security have prevailed against economic populism.</seg>
<seg id=1260>The interpretation elections was influenced by the surveys of exit polls, during which voters were to vote (having voted) on issues which ontle relied more for them.</seg>
<seg id=1261>Most (22%) replied "moral values", by comparing only 20% have cited economy and 19% terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=1262>Social conservatives have interpreted as meaning that they had won the election of Mr Bush and that their agenda should dominate his second term.</seg>
<seg id=1263>However, a Pew poll conducted a week after the election was that the category of "values" embrassait a wide variety of issues and more rights to abortion and gay marriage.</seg>
<seg id=1264>Indeed, polls show that 25% public defends gay marriage and 35% are for the unions civil legal gay couples (position that was defending Kerry).</seg>
<seg id=1265>Nevertheless, for 37% who oppose the gay marriage particularly in States red central to the country, the question has allowed to rally the supporters of Bush to come to the polls.</seg>
<seg id=1266>The question is, globally, if the US are divided beyond all hope.</seg>
<seg id=1267>The map electoral States red and blue led to Internet jokes and cartoons humoristiques on the secession of the two shores of the blue red central.</seg>
<seg id=1268>Some appelent côtopie "".</seg>
<seg id=1269>But the divisions are not so net.</seg>
<seg id=1270>In both sides, many States were won by a small margin and if one colore cards by county rather than by State, most of the country has violet.</seg>
<seg id=1271>Cities against suburbs and rural areas would be a better description of the situation instead of coast heart against the country.</seg>
<seg id=1272>Indeed, public opinion polls show that most of us are concentrated at moderate spectrum policy rather than the two extremes.</seg>
<seg id=1273>But the political elites such as political activists and the Congress tend to be more extremist the public.</seg>
<seg id=1274>At first, this seems surprising, since they should feel lured by the central, rich in votes.</seg>
<seg id=1275>However, many Members of Congress are districts that are granted to their party and the real threat to their re-election is the primary parties, dominated by the wings most militantes and most extreme parties.</seg>
<seg id=1276>This trend is reinforced by the rise of television câblée, which attracts viewers through programmes controversial Info of entertainment, and editors of chronic Internet called blogs, who are in polemical persistent no filter editorial.</seg>
<seg id=1277>A reform which would change the borders of districts of Congress to make them more competitive permettrer respond to this problem, but little elected will vote such changes that may increase the risk of their defeat.</seg>
<seg id=1278>The margin results suggests that Bush does not really change the mandate he thinks have won.</seg>
<seg id=1279>Given the difficult issues in foreign policy, fiscal and dociale, it would be advised to look to the central rather than reconcile its conservative basis, but politics which prevails between the politics of conviction or pragmatic policy remains uncertain.</seg>
<seg id=1280>In oil décrochons!</seg>
<seg id=1281>The Chancellor Angela Merkel made the fight against global warming the great priority of German presidencies of the EU and G8 who débutent in January.</seg>
<seg id=1282>Its practical proposal is quite general for leaders into account and accept, and clear to the other governments and businesses to understand: the next G8 summit, it will simply set a date from which the vehicles running in essence will not registered in the major industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg id=1283>This decision will have a positive impact considerable levels geopolitical and economic.</seg>
<seg id=1284>Today, the real concern in energy is not related to the reduction of world oil reserves, but rather the decline of internal production of the biggest consumers -- Europe, the US and China -- at the very moment the growing demand from Asia strike the market.</seg>
<seg id=1285>The available reserves will focus more Middle East, because the other parts of the world will soon to SEC.</seg>
<seg id=1286>Moreover, the major oil exporters are not willing to submit their investment policies to market conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1287>Saudi Arabia is only manage its production of oil and its part, Iran is afraid to potential investors with its bureaucratic obstacles and its corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1288>Iraq suffers from a lack of safety, while the foreign being failure to every attempt investment in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1289>These four states contain half the world's oil reserves, two-thirds could potentially be exported.</seg>
<seg id=1290>These factors, apart from production costs, cause of high oil prices and the race for contracts in Africa and in Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1291>The fact to believe that the increase in oil prices is good for the environment does not take account of basic data of international politics.</seg>
<seg id=1292>First, in most poor countries of Africa and Asia, the import of oil represents some larger spending that national in the industrialized countries, which means that economic growth and social development are compromise, and that new crises that threaten debt.</seg>
<seg id=1293>The rents in oil production hamper reforms in the main exporters.</seg>
<seg id=1294>The strengthening of their financial power, regimes such as those of Venezuela and Iran feel less forced by international rules.</seg>
<seg id=1295>The latest entrants among big countries consumer of energy, such as China, reproduce old habits of the West industrialized and their tradition of a blind eye to violations of human rights, to ensure lucrative contracts with authoritarian regimes and oil-rich.</seg>
<seg id=1296>Only the heavy political and economic, industrial countries are by far the main consumers of oil can initiate a change in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1297>It is important to start from the transport sector, which is at present more than half of consumption oil -- proportion which will certainly in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1298>Consequently, the G8 will agree to no longer register of new cars rolling in essence from 2025.</seg>
<seg id=1299>This decision is not directed against individual mobility, but against the waste of a scarce resource to serve primarily to produce synthetic materials.</seg>
<seg id=1300>Political leaders should not about or such technology.</seg>
<seg id=1301>They should rather incite the automobile industry to develop alternative technologies which use biofuels, the éthylène, hydrogen and even natural gas, for a transitional period.</seg>
<seg id=1302>Countries that have opened the way to the political will in this as collateral benefit, are national industries in first place in technology of energy ensure subsequent markets.</seg>
<seg id=1303>The important expected reducing CO2 emissions could eventually lead to progress the necessary international political climate.</seg>
<seg id=1304>Economic development and also at stake: if we soignons "" our dependence on oil, poor countries and less developed, and the new industrial countries, could be more, which would prices down and calmerait competition energy.</seg>
<seg id=1305>In geopolitical, profits would be equally obvious, including the large oil exporting countries would be less able to sing industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg id=1306>This turnaround would force the negotiation of the international community in the Middle East and consolidate the social forces countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia, seriously want to promote economic and political reform from within.</seg>
<seg id=1307>Large automobile and producer countries to advanced technology, Germany is well placed to launch an initiative.</seg>
<seg id=1308>Angela Merkel, which is right a Ph.D. in physical and began his political career as Minister for the Environment -- chairing in 1995 the first Conference of the UN framework convention on climate change -- would be more credible than any other colleagues in the EU and G8 to deal with the problem.</seg>
<seg id=1309>It is high time to achieve an act of bravery.</seg>
<seg id=1310>The myth of humanitarian aid and trade</seg>
<seg id=1311>Humanitarian aid and trade have become fashionable words.</seg>
<seg id=1312>A humanitarian increased (accompanied by a debt relief) and better market access rich countries products in poor countries: this now seems to have taken at the top of the international agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1313>Indeed, the debate today is not about more should be done, but on the quantity of measures to take and how quickly.</seg>
<seg id=1314>Lost in all of this: the clear lessons from the past five decades of economic development.</seg>
<seg id=1315>The first of these lessons, we discovered that economic development is largely left in the hands of poor nations themselves.</seg>
<seg id=1316>Countries that have much débrouillés in the recent past have managed through their own efforts.</seg>
<seg id=1317>Humanitarian aid and the markets have played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id=1318>Consider a developing country which has a free and preferential access to the market its largest neighbour, which is also be the most powerful economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1319>Suppose moreover that this country is able to send millions of its citizens work on the other side of the border, receive a huge volume of foreign investment and to be fully integrated production chains international.</seg>
<seg id=1320>Moreover, the country's banking system is supported by its neighbour rich and its willingness to act as lender of last resort.</seg>
<seg id=1321>Globalization could not stand under the best auspices that these, is it not?</seg>
<seg id=1322>Consider a second now.</seg>
<seg id=1323>It faces a trade embargo on the biggest world market, is not or foreign aid or any form of support from the Western world, is ruled out international organisations such as the WTO and cannot borrow IMF and World Bank.</seg>
<seg id=1324>If these handicaps external were not sufficiently debilitating, we can add an economy that interview itself barriers against international trade (in the form of trade State, of tariffs and quantitative restrictions on imports).</seg>
<seg id=1325>As has been the guess the reader, these countries really exist is Mexico and Vietnam.</seg>
<seg id=1326>Mexico shares a border long of 3 200 miles with the US, which offers not only privileged access to a market of goods and workforce, but also to share of resources Treasury bonds (as the experience of the peso crisis in 1995, has demonstrated the).</seg>
<seg id=1327>By contrast, America has maintained its trade embargo against Vietnam until 1994, has not restored diplomatic relations before 1995 and has granted the status of most favoured nation to imports Vietnamese that many years later.</seg>
<seg id=1328>Vietnam has still not entered the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1329>Now consider their economic performance.</seg>
<seg id=1330>Since the signing of NAFTA in December 1992, the Mexican economy has been average annual progress is barely over 1% per capita.</seg>
<seg id=1331>Not only figure is much lower than the rate of champions of Asian economy, but it is only a fraction of growth performance own Mexico decades before the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).</seg>
<seg id=1332>Vietnam, however, has been annual progress of 5.6% per capita since the infancy from its economic reforms in 1988 and restoring the diplomatic relations with the US in 1995, has grown faster continued at the rate of 4.5% since.</seg>
<seg id=1333>Vietnam witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty while Mexico has experienced a fall in real wages.</seg>
<seg id=1334>Both countries have experience a pronounced takeoff international trade and foreign investment, but the overall picture is very contrasté where it matters most: in improved living standards, especially among poor people.</seg>
<seg id=1335>What these examples show that efforts domestic éclipsent all other factors in determining the economic fortunes a country.</seg>
<seg id=1336>Everything the American market had to offer Mexico was unable to offset the consequences of policy mistakes on the internal market, especially the inability to overthrow the real appreciation of the exchange rate or the peso to extend productivity gains achieved in a narrow sector activities export the rest of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1337>What matters most is the adoption by a country a growth strategy appropriate.</seg>
<seg id=1338>No benefits which bénéficia Mexico, Vietnam has pursued a strategy contrée on diversification of its economy and improving production capacity local suppliers.</seg>
<seg id=1339>The experience of the overall post-war underpins proof that domestic policies are what is most important.</seg>
<seg id=1340>South Korea has décollé in the early 1960s, not when subsidies were foreign their summum, but when they commencèrent tarir to.</seg>
<seg id=1341>Taiwan has not benefited from foreign aid or privileged access to certain markets.</seg>
<seg id=1342>China and India, the economic superstars of time, have flourished largely through their own efforts to economic reform.</seg>
<seg id=1343>It is tempting to account for foreign to export their products to the few success African, Botswana and Mauritius (respectively the diamond and clothing), but this cannot go very far.</seg>
<seg id=1344>Obviously, these two countries would be poorer without access to foreign markets.</seg>
<seg id=1345>But, as in any case of successful development, which distinguish the benefits are not external enjoy but their ability to exploit these benefits.</seg>
<seg id=1346>Look at what other countries have wasted the advantage that they provide their natural wealth.</seg>
<seg id=1347>The word "diamonds" does not specially created in mind an image of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.</seg>
<seg id=1348>Similarly, few areas treatment exports proliférant throughout the world have experienced the level of development that there in Mauritius.</seg>
<seg id=1349>This does not however emerging rich countries from their obligation to help.</seg>
<seg id=1350>They can lead life hard to corrupt dictators, by sharing best financial information and refusing to acknowledge the international contracts that they sign.</seg>
<seg id=1351>Likewise, increasing the number of workers in poor countries allowed to work in rich countries and a broader range of political oriented towards growth through relaxation of the WTO rules and conditions imposed by the US produce a greater impact on long-term development.</seg>
<seg id=1352>It is not proven that enlargement of the market access and grants represents the best use to political capital the northern hemisphere.</seg>
<seg id=1353>Development should focus on improving the environment policy in poor countries, rather than on aid and trade.</seg>
<seg id=1354>Interdependence</seg>
<seg id=1355>If the great economist Argentine Raul prebisch was living today, there is no doubt that it would be if the world has put to turn towards.</seg>
<seg id=1356>His theory largely influential of dependency avançait that if poor countries themselves reposaient too on exports of raw materials, they have never atteindraient industrial the level needed to support rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id=1357>They are embourberaient in place in a cycle of decline of global commodity prices and endless reduction from income.</seg>
<seg id=1358>The answer to favorite prebisch, protectionism, proved disastrous for many countries of Latin America and Africa which followed.</seg>
<seg id=1359>But the fact is that for years, prebisch appears to have had the reaction just about trends in commodity prices in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=1360>Permanent efficiency gains in the areas of agriculture and the extraction of natural resources have lower the commodity prices, especially in the 1980s and 1990s.</seg>
<seg id=1361>With few exceptions, countries that have focused on exports of raw materials have achieved the poor results, while Asian countries do that with a few resources made rapid progress.</seg>
<seg id=1362>Today, however, with the Asian giants, India and China, to join the world economy, the price of petrol, but the wheat and virtually all other materials are.</seg>
<seg id=1363>Yes, there will always be cycles (the oil prices, for example, probably will fall again before its rise again) but the long-term trend many raw materials will clearly up for some time yet.</seg>
<seg id=1364>What many negotiators trade and other policymakers have not appeared acknowledge still, while the prebisch have understood right away, is that this sudden reversal of situation has enormous implications for the global balance of power.</seg>
<seg id=1365>Indeed, any other aspect of the economic globalization will launch the greatest challenges to the leaders of the world over the coming decades.</seg>
<seg id=1366>Many questions are.</seg>
<seg id=1367>The rich world of today are prepared enter a period of CO dependence, where they will be equally desperately applicants raw materials that the developing countries are the industrial products and technologies?</seg>
<seg id=1368>Are they prepared the inevitable flow of power and influence to countries producers of raw materials as they enrich?</seg>
<seg id=1369>How both super powers of the world, China and the US, will deal with the fact that large parts of export raw materials in Africa and the Middle East to Central Asia are covered in nation poorly trained?</seg>
<seg id=1370>Some prophets self-appointed expose the problem as limits of reserves and claim that the raw materials most critical indeed at an alarming rate.</seg>
<seg id=1371>Nowadays, many followers of the theory of the "peak hubbert" of oil production, which supports that we have reached the limits of our higher production capacity, the wells, assèchent and that the situation can only deteriorate.</seg>
<seg id=1372>However, as is the distinguished historian Dan yergin oil, birds of ominous have clamé that resources black gold were about to be tarir at least four times already.</seg>
<seg id=1373>Each time, radical technological progress made it off these threats.</seg>
<seg id=1374>In the late years 1800, oil extraction meant to draguer with mulets.</seg>
<seg id=1375>Today, forer to 3,000 like under the ground the oceans seem natural to everyone.</seg>
<seg id=1376>Such progress has also been made in the areas of the extraction of metals and agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=1377>No, the world is not facing a shortage of raw next.</seg>
<seg id=1378>In reality, it happens that the integration of 2.5 billion people (or China and India) in the world economy produces a trip to demand likely to put more pressure on the prices of raw materials that no gain technology will probably able to counterbalance.</seg>
<seg id=1379>Therefore, and this for at least 50 to 75, perhaps even until humans are being to forer on March over centuries to come, prices many natural resources will rise.</seg>
<seg id=1380>The new balance of economic powers which will will destabilize the political situation world?</seg>
<seg id=1381>The first world war was partly triggered by concern of Germany to the accaparement by other colonial powers of too much global oil and raw materials.</seg>
<seg id=1382>Similarly, during World War II, Japan has fears for stability in its supplies in pétroles and other natural resources come from abroad.</seg>
<seg id=1383>Such tensions will appear between China to uncertain resources (even the scarcity of water is problematic) and the West?</seg>
<seg id=1384>Fortunately, this does not seem likely for now, especially in view of the approaching sober also that pragmatic problems in their country's shown by Chinese leaders.</seg>
<seg id=1385>The Chinese look regions such as Africa in the hope of finding stable partners.</seg>
<seg id=1386>They do not share the évangélisme policy American, who do not want only to trade with the exporters of raw materials, but also want to convert.</seg>
<seg id=1387>Then there are those who talk American leaders even to make the US self-sufficient in terms of energy resources.</seg>
<seg id=1388>It is a joke: sufficient, perhaps, but sufficient Auto, never.</seg>
<seg id=1389>Much of the Arab world, and it is understandable, that the invasion of Iraq is the cornerstone of the American strategy to obtain stable energy resources.</seg>
<seg id=1390>If they are right, we can only hope that America has a solution relief.</seg>
<seg id=1391>Meanwhile, the commodity prices will continue to increase, and the oil exporting constitute the largest contributors to the trade deficit yawning us.</seg>
<seg id=1392>Perhaps the real American strategy is t it duty to try to oil exporting countries money so that they will become dependent on the happiness that they provide to America!</seg>
<seg id=1393>This is a turning point prebisch never have anticipated.</seg>
<seg id=1394>The choice of radical Iran</seg>
<seg id=1395>The choice of Iran to power the mayor radical in Teheran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, risk of deteriorating relations with the West and exacerbate the isolation of internationally.</seg>
<seg id=1396>But in terms of domestic policy, the Islamic regime would will probably better than if a candidate more moderate had prevailed.</seg>
<seg id=1397>It is clear that Ahmadinejad has a real basis for support.</seg>
<seg id=1398>That will be presented as a populist, he has spoken to help the poor, condemned the government acted and almost as a candidate to opposition does not: he incarnait choice regime, has finally receive aid official including against the rival radical.</seg>
<seg id=1399>The regime has demonstrated a great skill.</seg>
<seg id=1400>He turned the candidate a little more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani, disagree with some government policies, figure in harmony with the established order, and his own candidate in rebel.</seg>
<seg id=1401>The government has used and the resentment against establishment to consolidate its own power.</seg>
<seg id=1402>Given that former President Khatami, Mohammad, supported the reformist movement, like me, he was very foolhardy and he has ultimately nothing achieved, this merely point to how leaders have returned to their advantage the political situation.</seg>
<seg id=1403>Ahmadinejad is a representative activists the younger the Shah anti revolution of 25 years ago.</seg>
<seg id=1404>It is directly involved in the taking of hostages American in Iran, whatever we do not really knows how to.</seg>
<seg id=1405>The most worrying is that is close to the two main groups representing the most extremist elements of Iran: the body of guardians of the Islamic revolution and organization basij.</seg>
<seg id=1406>The first is an army parall to the pro regime; the second is an organization which intimide opponents and anyone is to search for a more open society.</seg>
<seg id=1407>Nevertheless, this concern to see Iran hands of leaders more radical is mixed by two factors.</seg>
<seg id=1408>First, Ahmadinejad will probably focus on probl to my national, and try, we can predict its chances of succ, about - to improve the living conditions of Iranian poorest.</seg>
<seg id=1409>Deuxi to mement, the group in power since revolution will continue to conduct the ideological and political étrang re �.</seg>
<seg id=1410>President has fewer powers than it appears to be, and it is this particuli rement overshadowed by the guide supr to me Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</seg>
<seg id=1411>In any case, the election of Ahmadinejad clarifying cr lying to the challenge that Iran is to Western policy and stability in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1412>First, it sends a signal more extremist elements of Iran and the customers terrorists of that country -- Hezbollah Lebanese Palestinian, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and many small groups acting against Iraq, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries -- they have the green light to launch their attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1413>They will probably believe that Iran will support, albeit do.</seg>
<seg id=1414>On the surface, Iran has often shown relatively careful, while playing to cover the role of global commanditaire of terror.</seg>
<seg id=1415>The Iranian officials who have been individually, act to order and coordinate operations specific, now feel freer to do so.</seg>
<seg id=1416>Moreover, Ahmadinejad openly calls an intensive programme of achieving nuclear weapons.</seg>
<seg id=1417>Most Iranian politicians, at least those that allows the government to act in the open, supports this agenda, but more discr promote an approach which you and cautious.</seg>
<seg id=1418>Rafsanjani, for example, is to the establishment of better relations with the West before the breakthrough on the nuclear front.</seg>
<seg id=1419>If the President Ahmadinejad of Iran nuclear, it is more likely to employ weapons in hasardeuse.</seg>
<seg id=1420>This does not mean that the use, but rather that would serve to blackmail for diplomatic, making up the threats to levels of crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1421>Since the Iranian leaders daily proclaiming their desire to wipe Israel the map and to combat the US (Ahmadinejad has market on the image of a flag in us from voting), the risk of confrontation has increased.</seg>
<seg id=1422>Finally, Ahmadinejad is likely to enhardir to jeopardize stability in Iraq, and his victory will encourage Iranian officials and radical extremists Iraqis.</seg>
<seg id=1423>Iran send already many agents in Iraq and supports the customers who seek to transform this country to clone.</seg>
<seg id=1424>Iraqis, including Shia Muslims, who follow the same to me version of Islam, the Iranians, usually reject such interference.</seg>
<seg id=1425>A position Iranian more militant will increase the friction with Iraq, and to draw more violence, anti-American.</seg>
<seg id=1426>In short, the result is dangerous Iranian, like me, if its potential destabilising depend acts of Ahmadinejad and the degree of power that it will Khamenei.</seg>
<seg id=1427>Moreover, have a case to Iran also openly extremist and radical me to me the crit a res a regime already hard -- will constitute a challenge not only for the US, but also for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1428>European countries will continue to claim that the rhetoric militant and provocations of Ahmadinejad does not matter and that it is possible to diplomatic solutions to Iran's nuclear ambitions?</seg>
<seg id=1429>With Rafsanjani, a real agreement or at least the appearances of cooperation have been easy to maintain.</seg>
<seg id=1430>But, with Ahmadinejad will require an immense dose of appeasement to maintain even the most minimal diplomatic procedure.</seg>
<seg id=1431>Some reformist and Iranian exiles rejoice in the election of Ahmadinejad, because they believe that his administration is more likely to be the true face of the regime and détromper any hope of compromise of western.</seg>
<seg id=1432>But it can also succ, the symbol of regime to return to its advantage the discontent caused by a quarter of that if cle of R � gne radical Islamist.</seg>
<seg id=1433>Whatever the consequences, the victory of Ahmadinejad mean the West that everything connected with that Iran will become even more difficult.</seg>
<seg id=1434>Take the poor, give rich</seg>
<seg id=1435>President Bush seems to destroy the American budget for years to come.</seg>
<seg id=1436>When President Bush took office, the forecasts anticipaient budget surpluses for as long as the could imagine.</seg>
<seg id=1437>Today, through a mixture of tax irresponsible launched by the Republicans, an economic slowdown, the collapse of the bubble of the stock market and a massive increase in military spending, the horizon tax is dominated by large deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1438>Worse still to come, because the Bush administration and Congress to Republican majority preparing worse fiscal disorder.</seg>
<seg id=1439>The havoc they will probably affaibliront the united and increase instability of the international economy.</seg>
<seg id=1440>Usually, American Republican Party was defending balanced budgets.</seg>
<seg id=1441>This changed with the Reagan administration, when the conservative Republicans have montrèrent in tax cuts, even if it did by large budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1442>President Reagan annonça the American people he could enjoy both of tax cuts, the strengthening of the army and the continuation of their favourite programmes of expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1443>The result, unsurprisingly, was a series of important budget deficits and whose eliminating took several years.</seg>
<seg id=1444>President George Bush senior as President Bill Clinton last raise taxes to order into chaos of the Reagan era.</seg>
<seg id=1445>These increases tax have probably contributed to defeat President Bush's father by Bill Clinton in 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1446>Yet bravement Clinton decided to complete the process to restore balance fiscal, partly to protect financing long-term programs pension and social security.</seg>
<seg id=1447>When Clinton quitta Presidency in 2000, the budgetary situation was best for decades.</seg>
<seg id=1448>Then came President George Bush son, ready to rejouer the Reagan with large tax cuts, a considerable increase in military expenditure and continuing and even the development of programmes of expenditure popular.</seg>
<seg id=1449>The result was predictable.</seg>
<seg id=1450>In January 2001, the budgetary forecasts cumulatives for the years 2002 to 2011 anticipaient budget surplus of 5.6 trillion.</seg>
<seg id=1451>Mid-2002, these surplus anticipated were évanouis.</seg>
<seg id=1452>In the light of these new economic conditions, and to the shadow of war with Iraq could be expected that the Bush administration and Congress Republican be cautious in defending new tax cuts.</seg>
<seg id=1453>But far from their main priority is to implement more tax reductions which only the classes easy benefit largely.</seg>
<seg id=1454>At the same time, the government demanding important increases military expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1455>With the approach of the presidential election of November 2004, we can be certain that no significant reduction in spending, will not military programmes.</seg>
<seg id=1456>It therefore seems that massive budget deficits are destined to continue.</seg>
<seg id=1457>If spending domestic simply remain constant, at a fraction of national income, budgetary forecasts cumulatives the next decade global anticipate a deficit of 1.5 trillion.</seg>
<seg id=1458>But this figure could be very optimistic, because it takes into account the cost likely not likely a war against Iraq or another set of tax cuts, or the risk of increasing interest rates for years to come.</seg>
<seg id=1459>Why the Republicans, they show little affected by this disorder?</seg>
<seg id=1460>Some Republicans care more for tax cuts classes easy than anything else.</seg>
<seg id=1461>Others believe that deficits will by force cuts important internal government spending, reducing the participation of the State, which is their wish the more expensive.</seg>
<seg id=1462>The problem of the latter analysis is that most taxpayers are committed to social and do support not easily large cuts to spending.</seg>
<seg id=1463>The question remains most intrigante to know why the Americans vote for such policies when they should know that it will probably problems.</seg>
<seg id=1464>A possible answers is the fact that many voters see no future budgetary problems.</seg>
<seg id=1465>A better answer is that the most Americans did not actually voted for these policies.</seg>
<seg id=1466>The turnout in the election of 2002 was that 40% of the voters, and only half of those 40% votèrent for Republicans, approximately 20% of people entitled to vote.</seg>
<seg id=1467>Of course, the prospects should not necessarily be so bleak.</seg>
<seg id=1468>The war against Iraq will be avoided.</seg>
<seg id=1469>Tax reductions or pressenties could be moderate abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=1470>But I predict a large budget deficits in the years ahead and a sense of growing malaise within the United States and abroad on macroeconomic situation of America.</seg>
<seg id=1471>Foreign investors could decide to reduce their budget financing government and the current account deficit in America in terms of favourable.</seg>
<seg id=1472>The dollar may faiblir, and the fear of inflation could become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id=1473>All this will lose confidence in us policymakers who will then be less flexible in their responses to economic shocks.</seg>
<seg id=1474>The poor classes, the US and abroad, could suffer most, as President Bush declare the Congress and the American people and the world that there is no money available to address the question of poverty, health and education, because the large budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1475>If the US does not way opens eyes these risks tax, the classes easy could benefit of another gift of several billion dollars while the country and the world in bear the harsh consequences for years to come.</seg>
<seg id=1476>Lessons to learn from the insouciance fiscal America</seg>
<seg id=1477>George W. Bush has much more to destroy economic policy of the United States that all other American presidents of history, even exceeding its mentor, Ronald Reagan.</seg>
<seg id=1478>In just three years in office, he has destroyed political consensus fragile that requested ten years of effort and which might need another decade to be rebuilt.</seg>
<seg id=1479>In doing so Bush risky health economic and social stability in the long term to America.</seg>
<seg id=1480>Given that the challenges budget in the long term that run the US in a very clumsy are not the only existing challenges, fiscal blunders America's offer of important lessons to other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1481>The main problem with fiscal policy is that politicians can easily visit temporarily popular reducing taxes and by increasing public spending while accumulant of public debt repayment massive and leaving their elected in future.</seg>
<seg id=1482>This stratagem can last few years, but budget deficits and public debt growing impose earlier than expected a painful change policy.</seg>
<seg id=1483>A politician but cynical can buy his re-election and perhaps be party to retirement when the crisis reaches.</seg>
<seg id=1484>We could imagine that after decades of similar episodes of political irresponsibility in countries around the world, voters would allergic to such stratagem.</seg>
<seg id=1485>However, the Bush applies again in buying today a popularity in distributing tax cuts massive while simultaneously increasing military expenditure and spending on education and health.</seg>
<seg id=1486>The budget deficit and obtained equivalent to more than 5% of GNP.</seg>
<seg id=1487>Worse, the prospects long-term budget America's were already worrying before Bush starts to apply its political imprudentes.</seg>
<seg id=1488>The population is aging us, so that the costs pension systems and healthcare financed by public funds increase soared.</seg>
<seg id=1489>The detailed calculations show that revenues to be reached thanks to fiscal policies advocated by Bush are likely not to achieve the dozens of trillion dollars which represent costs public pension, health care and other fiscal spending expected by the population.</seg>
<seg id=1490>At some point in the future, it will increase strongly the recovery of taxes, drastically reducing public expenditure, or both, to offset the actions of Bush.</seg>
<seg id=1491>So why the population supports its policies?</seg>
<seg id=1492>Because it includes little these consequences in the long term, or it would attaches little, even if these consequences will ultimately an impact on the majority of Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1493>The taxpayers the richest are of course pleased because they benefited from most tax cuts.</seg>
<seg id=1494>So it may seem astonishing, the 5% of the richest Americans taxpayers benefited from about half tax cuts and these rich taxpayers expect clear that the other 95% (the middle classes and poor) bear most future spending cuts and increases taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1495>Meanwhile, Bush convinced many voters of voters the poor and middle class they should also be satisfied to their fate, without tell them that they have to pay their small tax cuts by much more consistent in future government services if policies of his administration prevail over the long term.</seg>
<seg id=1496>If the Americans had a political memory, they would they have already gravi this "mountain Russian" tax over the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=1497>Ronald Reagan also took office in promising to massive cuts and large increases military expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1498>It has finished by a huge budget deficit in the mid-1980's.</seg>
<seg id=1499>The cuts made Reagan extremely popular and helped him to be re-elected in 1984.</seg>
<seg id=1500>He then took a decade (from second term of office until the Reagan of George Bush and Bill Clinton, Sr.) to return to a budget surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1501>Of course, this result has for the approval of new tax increases, which has cost re-election to George Bush, Sr. and led to political polarised the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id=1502>History has great opportunities to repeated.</seg>
<seg id=1503>Some ideologues right-wing in the Bush administration believe that budget deficits current mean in the end a dramatic reduction in social spending government.</seg>
<seg id=1504>They hope to dismantle programmes such as social security, Medicare.</seg>
<seg id=1505>But the American people strongly supports these programmes.</seg>
<seg id=1506>And the strategy of first to reduce taxes to lead inevitably thereafter cuts in the social programs is doomed to failure and will inevitably increase tax rates.</seg>
<seg id=1507>Other ideologues of the Bush administration support that the tax play a crucial role for the US out of the recession.</seg>
<seg id=1508>This argument is also wrong.</seg>
<seg id=1509>America's economy could recover without tax cuts, and perhaps even more solidly.</seg>
<seg id=1510>In any case, it is a monumental mistake to base the long-term fiscal policies on short-term economic cycle.</seg>
<seg id=1511>Other countries have two essential lessons to learn from this situation.</seg>
<seg id=1512>The first is that the deficits imminent of us restricted sooner or later the international power of America.</seg>
<seg id=1513>Americans supported the Iraq war only because they had to subsidize by higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1514>When the Americans will be forced to choose between the foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be less prone to support expensive operations abroad.</seg>
<seg id=1515>Indeed, the US will be deeply divided internally when population to be taken with the disorder fiscal left by Bush.</seg>
<seg id=1516>The second lesson is that the countries must plan their budgets according growing fiscal costs resulting from an ageing population.</seg>
<seg id=1517>The budgetary conditions long-term are rarely taken into consideration by the taxpayers or Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1518>Governments must be brought to submit assessments budget in the long term at the same time their proposed budget to reduce the trend towards a political manipulation on short-term budget.</seg>
<seg id=1519>The US can play the role of an alarm signal for other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1520>The White House should give other countries the same Council that magicians on television give their spectators: "do not try to make such among you.</seg>
<seg id=1521>The politicization of securities markets</seg>
<seg id=1522>Many analysts economic and financial complain that the securities markets of emerging countries often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political and economic.</seg>
<seg id=1523>By contrast, a force primitive the economic rules of the securities markets in countries advanced and predict their performance is indeed to predict growth trees.</seg>
<seg id=1524>This description of the securities markets in emerging countries is not false, just one-sided, because the same description applies to the securities markets in advanced countries.</seg>
<seg id=1525>Indeed, the best analysts know predict the performance of the securities market in any country is basically to predict the degree to which the government wants investors of the securities markets involved in environmental policy.</seg>
<seg id=1526>Take the securities market, united, by far the most important in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1527>The government leaves firms peaceful and returns on investment in the securities market forces us reflect fundamental a capitalist economy sound.</seg>
<seg id=1528>This partly explains why the United States attract investors portfolio of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1529>But the returns which make markets American Securities so attractive reflect a fragile political balance.</seg>
<seg id=1530>In particular, the tax rates affecting securities have varied over time with the change of political pressure.</seg>
<seg id=1531>During the second world war, for example, political support for large fortunes has diminished and Government has greatly increased taxes on capital gains, the dividends and high incomes in general.</seg>
<seg id=1532>When World War II helped to redress significantly economy weakened by the Great Depression of the 1930s, President Roosevelt and Congress have established a income tax windfall to ensure that the shareholders, are therefore not a benefit too.</seg>
<seg id=1533>By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but that the securities market was low, American voters have elected Ronald Reagan, a man felt by many as much right to be President.</seg>
<seg id=1534>He asked for, and obtained, the tax on capital gains, dividends and incomes.</seg>
<seg id=1535>The political interference in the securities market, are not only on taxes on capital gains, the dividends and incomes.</seg>
<seg id=1536>Taxes land, indirect taxes, import duties and taxes on sales, which are all paid directly or indirectly by companies, may have an extended impact on company profits and therefore on the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1537>It is no coincidence that wherever develop of the securities markets, governments to ensure that these taxes abaissent maximum company profits after tax.</seg>
<seg id=1538>Indeed, the policies of the securities markets do not stop at tax.</seg>
<seg id=1539>On the contrary, virtually every activity government concerns company profits and then the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1540>After the krach of the securities markets of 1929, the US government has suspended much of activity anti-trust which allowed firms to acquire a monopoly that increase their value.</seg>
<seg id=1541>This policy has delayed the lowering of high unemployment, but has not enough to control the political forces deployed to support the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1542>Similarly, one of the most important action taken by President Reagan was to destroy much power remaining trade unions of America, which rivalisaient for their share of the cake industrial.</seg>
<seg id=1543>The victory of Reagan during the strike of air traffic controllers in 1981 represented a great turning point for the trade union movement us, and also for the securities market which launched his spectacular market up in 1982.</seg>
<seg id=1544>The US government has shown particularly hard to support the securities market since the culmination of the illusion price actions in 2000, and particularly to reduce interest rates repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id=1545>Of course, this measure was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy, not in terms of supporting the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1546>But it is very revealing of the scale of the American market securities that one of the most important factors that are on the economy is falling prices actions.</seg>
<seg id=1547>Indeed, the response of authorities has not limited to monetary stimulus.</seg>
<seg id=1548>National accounts of products and income of the United States show that the rate effective tax on company profits (the percentage of really benefits paid to the government in the form of taxes) has risen in Crete in 33,7% in the first quarter of 2000 (the record of the securities market and the economy in general) and fell to 20,2% during the fourth quarter of 2003, when the market was low.</seg>
<seg id=1549>Much of this decline of tax relief reflects the measures adopted by the Congress as the perception, among companies, that in the current economic and political environment, they can be more combatives to avoid paying tax.</seg>
<seg id=1550>Moreover, after the krach the securities market, the tax on maximum paid dividends on securities has increased from 35% to 15%, providing a new substantial benefit to investors in the long term and intensifying the combined effect of reinvesting of dividends after tax.</seg>
<seg id=1551>Again, this reduction of tax justified to stimulate the economy which can, of course, be applied to almost any measure to support the securities market.</seg>
<seg id=1552>But it is the balance of political forces which determines the credibility of such justification.</seg>
<seg id=1553>It could be argued that the same variables, including the hostility high taxes and a weak union movement, have worked in the US over the past 200 years and that they should continue to function in the future, producing high returns on the securities markets and attractive capital inflows of foreign considerable.</seg>
<seg id=1554>Those who believe that investment in the American market in securities follow the same trend growth high for decades may well be right.</seg>
<seg id=1555>But it is important to be clear about what we predicted.</seg>
<seg id=1556>The forecasts are above all not only on the economy, but also the political or even on cultural values which shape policies and economic performance.</seg>
<seg id=1557>The housing market global</seg>
<seg id=1558>There is no investment more local that investment estate. The residence to buy is rooted in a specific place, as a tree, fleurit or dépérit wishes to local economic conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1559>The world défile on our screens of television, but the market housing, almost composed of only local amateur, crosses rarely geographical boundaries local.</seg>
<seg id=1560>Soon, however, this could change.</seg>
<seg id=1561>Within a month, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), together with my MacroMarkets society and with fiserv and Standard & poor' on, launch options on futures contracts ten cities on home prices in the US.</seg>
<seg id=1562>The contracts will be based on evidence on real estate prices & P / case Shiller, established on research speculative that my colleague Karl case and myself conducted, there is almost twenty years.</seg>
<seg id=1563>Long, we démarchons for housing market to run, but no stock, until now, only wanted to use these indications for creating such a market.</seg>
<seg id=1564>The futures markets on home prices in the world will allow investors to invest indirectly in American housing, through these markets.</seg>
<seg id=1565>A buyer in Paris, Tokyo or Rio de Janeiro will have the possibility of investing in housing occupied by their owners in New York and Los Angeles, Las Vegas, among others.</seg>
<seg id=1566>One of the fundamental principles theory financial -- the diversification or the distribution of risks -- implies that interest these new contracts will be strong.</seg>
<seg id=1567>Companies and people in New York, for example, are home to risks surexposés local but in selling their housing to run, they should succeed to reduce these risks.</seg>
<seg id=1568>Investors in Tokyo will a share risks by buying in terms of housing in New York, if the price is right.</seg>
<seg id=1569>The new yorkais continue to live in their housing, while having spread risks investment around the world.</seg>
<seg id=1570>The experience of a real futures market on vacation-home united family was not retentée since 1991, when the London future options and exchange (now called euronext.liffe) has failed the launch of such a market.</seg>
<seg id=1571>This trial has never generated of large volumes of transactions.</seg>
<seg id=1572>The stock market has launched a concept that has convinced.</seg>
<seg id=1573>British markets of Paris diversified on real estate prices, as some retail markets online, have never reported much either.</seg>
<seg id=1574>Will it different this time?</seg>
<seg id=1575>Of course, the launch of a new market remains uncertain. people interested in idea if it in séduit already many others; if nobody is séduit, it did not attract more.</seg>
<seg id=1576>The same goes for the market, there is no investors interested, it will not happen enough of transactions to generate profits for to attract others.</seg>
<seg id=1577>However, as is the case for all brilliant ideas, we never know very well why they séduisent. So we cannot predict the start of this new market, but we know that sometimes success is the holds.</seg>
<seg id=1578>The initial indicators suggest that the growing interest in transactions to run for home prices, particularly because of the prevailing speech on "bubble building", highlights the importance of diversification risks.</seg>
<seg id=1579>After the announcement of the CME, one of competitors, the Chicago board options exchange, declared its draft create options on futures contracts in the largest American regions, based on real estate prices means published by the National Association of Realtors (association of national estate agents).</seg>
<seg id=1580>But also the strong interest for public investment and housing cover risks, another thorny issue must be resolved for markets to work well run: prices must have openly and investors need to understand the significance.</seg>
<seg id=1581>I believe that ‘ there are great opportunities for these futures markets soon lead a prices in US cities.</seg>
<seg id=1582>It will be to "déport say", as the traders. Today, the price in the market is lower than the price of property.</seg>
<seg id=1583>Probably, the déport does not emerge from day one of transactions building, but it should happen after a few months.</seg>
<seg id=1584>We may need to déport some of these markets actually perform their functions.</seg>
<seg id=1585>Everyone knows that these cities have experienced a huge housing boom in recent years (this is a global phenomenon widespread).</seg>
<seg id=1586>The international investors do not seem very prone to invest in these cities, without the prospect of lower prices based on markets to term residents of the Tokyo taught at their expense.</seg>
<seg id=1587>But if the déport important enough, even investors who believe that the US housing market is in full decline can always expect a good return home prices to run, because they already benefit from a lesser market price to run.</seg>
<seg id=1588>Nevertheless, the new yorkais will need to make some adjustments to cover their own property investments, if they want to sell futures contracts leads naturally lower prices.</seg>
<seg id=1589>They will be the idea that the market has already anticipated this decline and they cannot protect themselves that the tiny margin potential beyond this anticipation.</seg>
<seg id=1590>In fact, such adjustments in our way of thinking probably occur if there is carefully prices future market.</seg>
<seg id=1591>Until now, the development of real estate prices has largely been the result of various opinions.</seg>
<seg id=1592>When markets create international consensus on home prices in all the major cities of the world, it will be easier to manage the risks they meet in stabilising the their economies and on the other hand, our own living standards.</seg>
<seg id=1593>But what is moving the markets?</seg>
<seg id=1594>Since the 10 May around, most of the world markets have accused of strong déclins cumulative, particularly in the two weeks around the 23 May, with average prices which persist downward.</seg>
<seg id=1595>The worry on the stock markets are synonymous with global worry for the world economy?</seg>
<seg id=1596>Consider the cuts the marked.</seg>
<seg id=1597>Among the main countries, the most impressive crash is India, where prices have fallen by 16,9% between 10 May and on 22 May.</seg>
<seg id=1598>The debacle on the other side of the globe has taken nearly so magnitude. Here, the ups and downs had a few days of discrepancy with those of India: in Argentina, prices have fallen by 16,1%, Brazil's 14,7% and Mexico to 13.8%.</seg>
<seg id=1599>The European markets have also suffered large losses.</seg>
<seg id=1600>In Sweden, prices have dégringolé of 15.2% between the 9 May and on 22 May; almost over the same period, they have fallen 9.7% in Germany, 9.4% in France and the United Kingdom and 9.3% in Italy.</seg>
<seg id=1601>In Asia, prices have fallen by 11.5% in Korea, of 9.3% Hong Kong and 8% in Japan about over the same period.</seg>
<seg id=1602>Many commentators trying to combine these events the situation in the US.</seg>
<seg id=1603>Yet, the Americans have accused a lowering of 5.2% between 9 and 24 May.</seg>
<seg id=1604>China does not be behind this global decline because prices have risen there during this period.</seg>
<seg id=1605>The explanations standard of economists are monetary policies.</seg>
<seg id=1606>In the wake of the great fear of deflation in 2003, the central banks around the world have reduced interest rates, causing explosions speculative markets for real estate and stock.</seg>
<seg id=1607>But today, according to this view, rising interest rates are beginning to effect, which leaves predict déclins new markets.</seg>
<seg id=1608>There is undoubtedly an important element of truth in this arguments.</seg>
<seg id=1609>The US Federal Reserve has indeed increased its interest rates of 10 and its President, Ben Bernanke, then indicated that other increases could happen in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1610>On 17 May, a worsening American data has pointed out, which suggests a future monetary durcissements.</seg>
<seg id=1611>Economists like to think that the world is logical and manageable, which means that they understand what is happening.</seg>
<seg id=1612>But in so doing, they often exagèrent role of central banks.</seg>
<seg id=1613>Indeed, the increase in American rates that was to be a series of increases in rates -- the 16th of row.</seg>
<seg id=1614>No other large Central Bank has increased its rate after the start of the decline of stock markets in May to 7 8 June, when there are several implemented (the European Central bank, India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).</seg>
<seg id=1615>Another factor: the oil prices, which rose by 24% between 22 March and on 2 May by all its record.</seg>
<seg id=1616>That would undoubtedly be a major event able to influence the world markets.</seg>
<seg id=1617>The oil price increases play the role of the guilty in practically all economic recessions since World War II.</seg>
<seg id=1618>Yet the exist oil prices do not correspond when stock prices have fallen, in the middle of May.</seg>
<seg id=1619>Forward that these increases caused the déclins markets requires a discrepancy of several weeks.</seg>
<seg id=1620>But the stock markets are not very logical, and answer décalée the oil price shock possible.</seg>
<seg id=1621>As for all the in any financial market, increase always attracts attention.</seg>
<seg id=1622>When oil prices increasing rapidly, people look information that to speak and discuss them of these increases, creating their own an increased sensitivity to these new.</seg>
<seg id=1623>The crisis in the Middle East is linked to oil prices, and she was dominant information of May.</seg>
<seg id=1624>Signs of ominous and the strong language used by various political figures have amplified in mind investor by increases in oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1625>8 May, the deputy Prime Minister Israeli Peres, in response to statements hostile the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has asséné "that Iranian President should remember that Iran might also be wiped off the map".</seg>
<seg id=1626>Similarly, around the beginning of the stock market collapse of May, Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia, the country with the largest number of Muslims in the world, and newspapers reported on 13 May he received a genuine ovation from students of two of the best universities.</seg>
<seg id=1627>This story may have been interpreted as proof that the strategy of the tightrope Ahmadinejad in the field of nuclear it provides the political dividends, fueling the perception that the tense situation in the Middle East could lead to other oil price increases.</seg>
<seg id=1628>These articles of newspapers may appear more distant from stock markets that monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=1629>But the public response they light, as well as the recent increases in oil prices, could enter for good measure in the change market psychology.</seg>
<seg id=1630>The attitudes in may change with time, and events such as the remarks of Ahmedinejad and Peres can precipitate changes.</seg>
<seg id=1631>So, although these events are difficult to quantify, perhaps analysts should also pay attention to the words of Ahmadinejad than those of Bernanke when they try to understand the direction that taking stock markets world.</seg>
<seg id=1632>Economists like perhaps did not focus on the public's mentality and about the way it interacts with the price fluctuations, the new world and dynamic speculative.</seg>
<seg id=1633>Would indeed that economic events are less predictable (and economists less omniscients) than they are like to imagine.</seg>
<seg id=1634>However, speaking intuitif it would be logical to do.</seg>
<seg id=1635>Is there really in the head investors?</seg>
<seg id=1636>Ahmadinejad is a figure charismatic, not Bernanke.</seg>
<seg id=1637>Ahmadinejad has embarque in an adventure, not Bernanke.</seg>
<seg id=1638>And, perhaps most importantly, Ahmadinejad influence destabilizing, not Bernanke.</seg>
<seg id=1639>Whatever their because in the end, the world stock drops in the middle of May indicate a market psychology unstable.</seg>
<seg id=1640>Hard to believe that they were linked to opinions about the possible monetary policy, and not to questions broader and deeper, concerning energy policy and the tension, which are the foundations of performance of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id=1641>Why pay more for fair trade?</seg>
<seg id=1642>Marks & Spencer, the chain of supermarkets and clothing owner of 400 stores around Britain, has just announced that convert its full range of cafés and thés including 38 different products symbol in fair trade, the symbol of marketing "production ethical".</seg>
<seg id=1643>The chain sells already only tea and coffee regarding this label in these 200 of coffee shops "coffee revive".</seg>
<seg id=1644>It also encourages the purchase of shirts and other goods worked from cotton from fair trade.</seg>
<seg id=1645>Announcement took place during the fortnight "fair trade" over two weeks to promote products labellisés, the presentation of proceedings were held with producers in developing countries to explain how the British this form of trade has helped their communities.</seg>
<seg id=1646>The movement towards a more consumption ethics is also a significant advance in the US. consumers are looking increasingly towards food biological or locally products such as eggs from hens high in freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1647>In the UK, a study has shown that over 50% of the respondents reconnaissaient symbol of fair trade and included that products with this symbol respectaient more working conditions producers third world.</seg>
<seg id=1648>Currently there is no study comparable to the US, but data reported and the discussions I have had with my own students suggests that the figure be lower for Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1649>The traders eager to obtain certification fair trade producers must pay a price covering the costs of sustainable production and a living wage enough.</seg>
<seg id=1650>For example, the minimal in for a pound of coffee is $1.26 falling, no matter the level of the market.</seg>
<seg id=1651>If the market price exceeds figure, tariff on trade fair rise to stay higher cents of 5 / book.</seg>
<seg id=1652>As far as the small producers, they must organize in cooperatives or in other types of groups to a democratic participation.</seg>
<seg id=1653>Plantations and factories can demand of fair trade label if they offer a decent wage their workers, if they comply with health standards, environmental and safety, if they permitted the unions or any other form of associations of workers, if they provide a housing worthy workers who work far from home and if they do not use or forced labour, child or work.</seg>
<seg id=1654>But, everyone not agree with fair trade.</seg>
<seg id=1655>Brink Lindsey, Director of the study on trade policies the Cato Institute, body pro market, estimates that the campaign for coffee labellisé fair trade is a deadlock "paved with good intentions.</seg>
<seg id=1656>It explains in justifying the real cause of the fall in coffee lies not in achieving excessive profits by multinationals, but considerable increase in the production of coffee in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with new techniques allowing culture caféière working less and therefore cheaply.</seg>
<seg id=1657>In view of the Lindsey, if we want to help the coffee growers, we must encourage them to abandon the coffee to turn cultures more beneficial -- it insists here, rightly, on trade restrictions imposed by the rich and on subsidies which are obstacles to be removed -- or to products with high added value, such as the cafés special that can be paid more expensive.</seg>
<seg id=1658>What is odd in's arguments Lindsey, however, is that the campaign for coffee fair seems to be exactly what he recommends, is to encourage the coffee growers to produce cafés special can be paid more expensive.</seg>
<seg id=1659>Economists pro market does not oppose companies which use openly the attractiveness of luxury to promote their products.</seg>
<seg id=1660>If people are prepared to spend $48 for a book of coffee Jamaican blue mountain, because it is the coffee preferred of James Bond, economists believe does not, in this case, that the market is distorted.</seg>
<seg id=1661>Why, then, be so critical consumers who want to pay $12 a book of coffee, they know that he was grown without pesticide, under trees ombrageux support survival birds, by producers who can now feed decently and educate their children?</seg>
<seg id=1662>Economists could répliquer that if we want to help people feed and educate their children, it is possible to buy a book of coffee not fair taste for the same pay $2 and $10 remaining a charity which distribue food and scolarise poor children.</seg>
<seg id=1663>This is indeed a strategy possible but fair trade presents real benefits.</seg>
<seg id=1664>Producers know they manufacture a coffee appreciated consumers not only for his taste, but also for the way he grown.</seg>
<seg id=1665>If their coffee is sells well, they are proud to have a product manufactured sought throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id=1666>From the standpoint of farmers, receive a premium in selling a product labellisé fair trade is better than the taking of charitable assistance they would in any case, they work or not, whatever the quality of their production.</seg>
<seg id=1667>Pay more for a product labellisé fair trade is not more "anti market that spending more to buy a product of marks Gucci.</seg>
<seg id=1668>Moreover, the label reflects better ethical priorities.</seg>
<seg id=1669>It is not just a subsidy granted by governments, its success dependent on market demand and not the lobbysme policy.</seg>
<seg id=1670>Fortunately, in Europe, this request is growing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id=1671>Let us hope it will soon such levels everywhere in developed countries, where consumers as they can decide how to spend their money.</seg>
<seg id=1672>The calves, pigs and US democracy</seg>
<seg id=1673>Among the flood securities on the return of the democratic majority in Congress after the elections in November, the result of an important vote has largely unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id=1674>Although it has highlighted the shortcomings of the American political system, it has also allowed me to think again the sympathy of ordinary American citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1675>In Arizona, citizens can, if they have met a sufficient number of signatures, submit a draft law popular vote directly.</seg>
<seg id=1676>This year, one of the issues subject to popular suffrage was a law to ban that sows gestantes, or calves high for meat, are sanglés or confined in a way that prevents them from turn freely, to bed or to extend their members.</seg>
<seg id=1677>Those who do not know the methods of intensive farming, will perhaps the need for such legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1678>Traditional farming, as pratiquait around the world fifty years ago, and in some countries even today allows animals to move and to étirer.</seg>
<seg id=1679>But today, almost 90% of sows reproductive -- mothers pigs and slaughtered for meat, the bacon and the ham -- spend most of their lives stalls which measure some 60 by 2, 2 meters.</seg>
<seg id=1680>They cannot turn, or extending their legs once couchées or forward or back to more than one.</seg>
<seg id=1681>They are also sometimes sanglées to limit their movements.</seg>
<seg id=1682>Similarly, the calves are confined their lives in individual boxes where they cannot be return, bed or if étirer.</seg>
<seg id=1683>Essentially, these methods aim to save the costs of labor. They facilitate management and allow animals to employ workers, less and less qualified.</seg>
<seg id=1684>They also prevent animals of waste of energy in the déplaçdant or in themselves by them.</seg>
<seg id=1685>A few years ago, as a result of protests organizations security animal, the EU Commission asked a report to the Standing Veterinary Committee the EU on methods of intensive farming.</seg>
<seg id=1686>The report's conclusions indicate that animals suffer no power to move and boredom, have nothing to entire days.</seg>
<seg id=1687>Of course, the simple good sense allows get the same conclusions.</seg>
<seg id=1688>Giving following the report, the EU has set the dates from which the containment of animals will be banned.</seg>
<seg id=1689>For the calves, 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id=1690>The individual stalls for sows, already banned in the UK, Sweden, will be banned from 2013 throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1691>Measures to improve the welfare of laying hens, high battery in cages in treillis without enough room for extending their wings, are also applied progressively.</seg>
<seg id=1692>The United States, nothing that is expected.</seg>
<seg id=1693>Earlier, when my friends Europeans were asking me why the US accusaient such a delay in farm animal welfare in Europe, that I did not respond.</seg>
<seg id=1694>If they emphasised, I had much to say an explanation was that the Americans less souciaient animal that Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1695>Then, in 2002, associations of defending animal parvinrent people to vote on a proposal ban individual stalls for sows in Florida.</seg>
<seg id=1696>To the surprise overall, the proposal was accepted by 55% of voters.</seg>
<seg id=1697>Last month in Arizona, despite an opposition generously financed by the food industry, the prohibition of boxes of containment for calves and pigs was also approved by 62% of the voters.</seg>
<seg id=1698>Neither the Florida, nor the Arizona are States particularly progressive -- both voted for George W. Bush against John Kerry in 2004.</seg>
<seg id=1699>The results of these two votes popular so strongly suggest that if all Americans were to vote on maintaining sows gestantes and calves in containment, a large majority to opposerait.</seg>
<seg id=1700>Ultimately, it seems that the Americans care as Europeans the living conditions of animals.</seg>
<seg id=1701>To explain the difference between the farm animal welfare in Europe and the United States, must certainly compare political systems.</seg>
<seg id=1702>In Europe, concerns the voters on conditions for animals found an echo among members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, with the consequence adoption of national legislation and directives of the EU to improve their lot.</seg>
<seg id=1703>In the US by contrast, those same concerns had no visible effect on Members of Congress.</seg>
<seg id=1704>There is no federal legislation on farm animal welfare and so to no legislation in Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1705>àb my view, the tens of millions of dollars on food industry empochés by officials seeking to be re-elected there is for something.</seg>
<seg id=1706>The movement of defending animal, despite strong popular support, does not the weight in the arena of lobbying political and electoral donations.</seg>
<seg id=1707>In the American electoral races, money in the opinion of voters.</seg>
<seg id=1708>Discipline of party is low and congressistes themselves must together most of the funds necessary for their re-election -- in this case, every two years for Members of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id=1709>In Europe, where discipline parties is respected and where parties, not the candidates, financing election campaigns, money play a less important.</seg>
<seg id=1710>The US, a country is proud of its democratic tradition, calves and pigs are far from not only losers.</seg>
<seg id=1711>What of nine on new army composed entirely of Afghan?</seg>
<seg id=1712>The assassination of Afghan Minister of aircraft by a crowd (perhaps incited by members of the own interim administration of Afghanistan) shows that Afghan society remains deeply fissurée.</seg>
<seg id=1713>The first reforms on Afghan army will only exacerbate these divisions.</seg>
<seg id=1714>Defence Minister of temporary administration of Hamid Karzai Kabul has already designated officers higher this new army.</seg>
<seg id=1715>Minister, General Mohammed Fahim, Tajikistan is a district of Panjshir in the North, which has three months earlier leader forces of Northern Alliance that have caught Kabul after the bombers Americans have their déblayé way.</seg>
<seg id=1716>As a group, its use is a direct challenge to the objective of reunification of the country of Mr. Karzai.</seg>
<seg id=1717>Afghanistan is a nation multi-ethnic, the largest group in the pashtounes, which are both three-fifths of the total population.</seg>
<seg id=1718>The Hezaras and Tajiks respectively constitute a fifth of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1719>The 38 officers high as a general by Mr. Fahim, 37 are Tajiks, thirty eighth being a Uzbek.</seg>
<seg id=1720>If, on the 15 to 17 million pashtounes country, some are recruited as soldiers, they serve as a command structure almost entirely comprising Tajiks.</seg>
<seg id=1721>The language of pashtounes differs but the Tajik as Spanish, English, and millions of reaching pashtounes age military service did at best a few notions of Tajik.</seg>
<seg id=1722>The geographical profile of the new military authority is also restricted that its ethnic composition.</seg>
<seg id=1723>Thirty-five on 38 officers higher come from a small area in the North of Kabul including province of parwan (where airport Baghram) and close the Panjshir Valley, along the bastion of Northern Alliance.</seg>
<seg id=1724>In other words, the heads of potential from 27 twenty-nine provinces of Afghanistan have been excluded from the new military elite of their country.</seg>
<seg id=1725>If a group restricted could perhaps overcome the impression that its Members are a clique closed if they represented a broad sample of dozen parties.</seg>
<seg id=1726>But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id=1727>Eighteen of 38 higher officers from a single party, the jamiat be Islami, the Islamic faction that has long been led by Mullah Burhanuddin Rabbani and former teacher of theology.</seg>
<seg id=1728>It was this party who gouverna Kabul a short time in the mid-1990s, creating the carnage and chaos that led most Afghans came to welcome the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id=1729>The Communists égalent almost the number of members of the military hierarchy jamiat.</seg>
<seg id=1730>Sixteen of 38 officers have long line this party whose tricks in the late 1970's led to the Soviet invasion of 1979 89 which cost two and a half million Afghan lives.</seg>
<seg id=1731>Most Afghans see today Communists with the same degree of sympathy that the Czechs or Poles reserve the national socialists of Hitler.</seg>
<seg id=1732>It is true that the Afghans, as elsewhere, joined the Communist Party for various reasons and they were certainly all hardened ideologues.</seg>
<seg id=1733>But in the case of the General Marshall Fahim, six were workers professionals Communist Party and continued to serve the party after the invasion of the Red Army.</seg>
<seg id=1734>These six men, three more Communists who served as officers in Afghan army, actively collaborated during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which lasted for a decade.</seg>
<seg id=1735>Imagine how the French have reacted if a quarter of the body's French officers after World War II was rangés on the Wehrmacht during this it their country.</seg>
<seg id=1736>In Afghanistan, the new travel quickly by the mouth ear.</seg>
<seg id=1737>Nationalists Afghans (that is almost all Afghans) soon discover the political reasons Members of intimate circle of Marshall Fahim, if it is not already done.</seg>
<seg id=1738>Even this overwhelming evidence of biased and prejudice in training of high command of the new military might be neutralisée if generals intégraient a professionalism and a commitment to the values of truly national patriotic forces in their task.</seg>
<seg id=1739>Unfortunately, only ten of 38 officers promoted by Fahim received a training of military officers professionals.</seg>
<seg id=1740>An eleventh has served as pilot.</seg>
<seg id=1741>By contrast, 24 on general 38 (the training of four general remaining remain unknown) are civilians, who had a profession, which come offices Communist Party or, in a case which were Mullah.</seg>
<seg id=1742>All mean that these statistics in terms of everyday reality?</seg>
<seg id=1743>They mean that when the Heads of international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, as well as the official military and diplomatic Americans, meet the under Afghan Minister of Defence, they meet Abdul Rashid Dostum, a Lord of war and a Communist notoriously corrupt and brutal which remains in contact with former friends of the Red Army which are still in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id=1744>This means that the chief armed forces Afghan as leader operations and the head of the intelligence service army are also Communists, men whose loyalty remain uncertain and which many Afghans distrust each.</seg>
<seg id=1745>This team has opportunities to unify a Afghanistan torn by war?</seg>
<seg id=1746>The presence of Kabul a team if dubious did opportunities to instil of confidence among three-quarters of the Afghan people, who are excluded from the military high command?</seg>
<seg id=1747>Or is this list t it rather the harvest of "approach to all the winner" government (which is forced to a point in the future) to déchaîner another bloody reaction national by those whose legitimate were cynically piétinés?</seg>
<seg id=1748>The UN and politicians Europeans and Americans must reflect on these issues before consent to taking a relentless power by a small minority unpopular.</seg>
<seg id=1749>The celebration irrational</seg>
<seg id=1750>Hurra for new winners of Nobel laureate: Daniel Kahneman's Princeton University of Vernon Smith and the University of George mason Virginia.</seg>
<seg id=1751>Like many Nobel, these rewards recognize not only in the work undertaken by Mr Smith Kahneman and But schools of thoughts they have helped to develop.</seg>
<seg id=1752>Mr Kahneman, psychologist, demonstrated that people behave systematically in less than traditional does the classical economists believe.</seg>
<seg id=1753>Work not only show that people sometimes act differently predictions of theoretical standard economic, but also that they are regularly, systematically, and in a way that can be understood and interpreted through different assumptions which are in competition with those used by economists traditional.</seg>
<seg id=1754>For most of the market participants, and indeed the observers ordinary, this does not seem to difference.</seg>
<seg id=1755>Brokers of Wall Street who traffic with actions they know to be wrong exploit the irrational that by Kahneman and Smith demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id=1756>Much of the - which led to gonflement markets was based on the exploitation of psychology investor.</seg>
<seg id=1757>In fact, this is not new irrationality for economists either.</seg>
<seg id=1758>John Maynard Keynes décrivit once the stock as not being based on the fight of individuals to discover rational foundations of markets, but rather as in a beauty contest in which the winner is the best Devine those that judges say.</seg>
<seg id=1759>The Nobel this year the famous criticism of the market economy simplistic, like that of last year (I received with two other colleagues).</seg>
<seg id=1760>The laureates of last year were emphasis on the fact that different market participants have different information (and imperfect), and that this asymmetry information has a marked impact on the functioning of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1761>In particular, the laureates last year's under intended that markets are not generally effective; it is governments to a large role to play.</seg>
<seg id=1762>The invisible hand of Adam Smith, the idea that free trade leads to efficiency as guided by an invisible hand, is invisible in part because it does not exist.</seg>
<seg id=1763>This, too, is not new for those working daily with markets (and wealth are taking advantage of this asymmetry of information and the exceeding).</seg>
<seg id=1764>For more than twenty years, economists have passionate for these models of so-called "forecasts rational" that caused the principle that all parties have the same information (even imperfect) and act in perfectly rational, that markets are fully efficient, that there is never any unemployment (except when it is caused by the unions eager or minimum wages imposed by governments), and that there is never any rationing of funding.</seg>
<seg id=1765>Such models are predominant, particularly during the third round of the US, despite the evidence of opposite which demonstrate the triumph of ideology on science.</seg>
<seg id=1766>Unfortunately, the students of these programmes in higher education are now makers many countries and they try to implement programs based on these ideas, known as today's market fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id=1767>Let me be clear here: the models of forecasts rational contributed significantly to economic theory; the stringency that their advocates imposed on economic thinking helped to highlight the weakness many underlying assumptions.</seg>
<seg id=1768>Good scientific thinking knows recognize its limits, but the prophets of forecasts rational generally have demonstrated a little modesty.</seg>
<seg id=1769>Vernon Smith is one of the leaders of the development of experimental economy, the idea that you can test many economic proposals in a laboratory.</seg>
<seg id=1770>One reason for making that economics is a subject so complex, which is also the many disagreements between economists, just because economists cannot conduct controlled experiments.</seg>
<seg id=1771>Nature imbalance the experiences greatness nature, but in most circumstances, so much can change quickly if it is often difficult to démêler causes consequences.</seg>
<seg id=1772>In principle, in a laboratory, one can lead experiments controlled, and thus to inférences more reliable.</seg>
<seg id=1773>Critics of the economy experimental worried because the issues are the contexts experimental ways of thinking determined outside the experience, and that and experiences and inférences are not also parts and clear in science physical.</seg>
<seg id=1774>Nevertheless, the economic experiences provide some knowledge of many issues, such as improved design of auction.</seg>
<seg id=1775>Above all, the irrationality of market participants, the question of the work of Mr Kahneman, has checked in repeated in the context of laboratories.</seg>
<seg id=1776>A results the more fun made by experimental economy is the altruism and selfishness.</seg>
<seg id=1777>It seems (at least in situations experimental) that the experimental subjects are not also selfish economists believe that, apart from a group that economists itself.</seg>
<seg id=1778>Would that be because the economy is discipline which attracts individuals who are, by nature, selfish, or because economy makes mouler people so as to make them more selfish?</seg>
<seg id=1779>The answer, surely, is certainly a bit of both.</seg>
<seg id=1780>There is no doubt that the experimental research and the future work will resolve the issue of the relative importance of both assumptions.</seg>
<seg id=1781>The Nobel prize shows how important it is to study individuals and economies as they are and not as we want to see.</seg>
<seg id=1782>Only by including the best human behavior real hope that we can design policies that will also make better work of our economies.</seg>
<seg id=1783>Bush and his energy policy of bad faith</seg>
<seg id=1784>An episode most surrealist happened, this year, during the World Economic Forum in Davos. experts of the oil industry have explained that the melting of the CAP polaire -- much faster than all forecasts announced ­ -- is not only a problem, but also a chance in that new huge quantities of oil will now accessible.</seg>
<seg id=1785>Similarly, these specialists have recognized that the United States' refusal to sign the law of the sea, the international convention which determines the access to sources of offshore oil and the other mineral resources, sea represents a risk of conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1786>But they also insisted on the advantages: the oil industry, in its quest for continuing new reserves, does not need supplier Congress to obtain the right to plunder the Alaska.</seg>
<seg id=1787>President George W. Bush has not strange ability to understand the important messages.</seg>
<seg id=1788>For years, it is increasingly clear that its energy policy is not right.</seg>
<seg id=1789>Some members of his party even refer to a former draft energy, produced by the oil industry, as being very advantageous for all lobbyists.</seg>
<seg id=1790>As for the naked the virtues of the market economy, the sole purpose of Bush is to grant enormous subsidies to the oil industry, despite the growing deficits which the country faces.</seg>
<seg id=1791>But the market is not working properly when it comes to energy intervention Government should take a sense totally opposed to the Bush administration proposed.</seg>
<seg id=1792>The fact that the Americans do not pay the price of pollution -- especially of their enormous production of greenhouse gases -- resulting from their waste energy leads to a devaluation of the price of energy and the coup, an excessive consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1793>The government must encourage energy savings. His intervention on pricing, mainly through the energy tax, is an effective method.</seg>
<seg id=1794>But, instead of promoting energy savings, Bush if entête in a policy of "first assécher America" its own resources, making it in the future even more dependent on external oil resources.</seg>
<seg id=1795>Never mind that a strong request make up oil prices and thus creates a manna for many countries of the Middle East, which are not the best friends of America.</seg>
<seg id=1796>Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it seems that Bush has finally taken the measure of dependence on America's growing. It had become difficult for him not to see the consequences of galloping rising oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1797>But, again, the hesitant gestures of his government will fail to worse problems in the immediate future.</seg>
<seg id=1798>Bush refuses even to act for energy savings and spending ultimately very little money to support its continued prayer of technological salvation.</seg>
<seg id=1799>What, then, of the recent statement of Bush on its commitment to reduce, in 25 years, the oil dependency of America on the Middle East by 75%?</seg>
<seg id=1800>For investors, the message is clear: no more investissez new reserves in the Middle East, which are by far the oil resources are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id=1801>But if there are no new investment in the Middle East, reserves unrestrained growth in energy consumption in the US, China and elsewhere implies that demand exceeds supply.</seg>
<seg id=1802>And to crown it all, the threat of sanctions of Bush against Iran could provoke the interruption of supply of one of the largest producers of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1803>With a global production of oil almost to its maximum and prices with almost doubled since the war in Iraq, this leaves predict price even higher and more profits for the oil industry, the only real winner of Bush's policy in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1804>In any case, no one should blame Bush for having recognized that there was a problem.</seg>
<seg id=1805>But, as always, its proposals are nothing more than a small sleight of hand of its administration.</seg>
<seg id=1806>Besides its refusal to recognize the of global warming, to encourage energy savings or allocate enough funds to make research, the great promise of Bush to reduce dependence on oil with us in the Middle East does not mean much.</seg>
<seg id=1807>With only 20% American oil from the Middle East, the objective of Bush could simply be achieved by increasing modestly supplies from other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1808>The Bush administration must realize that oil benefits the world market.</seg>
<seg id=1809>Even if America were completely independent oil Middle East, reducing energy production in this region would have devastating effects on world prices and, especially on the American economy.</seg>
<seg id=1810>As is too often the case with the Bush administration, there is no clear explanation of official policy.</seg>
<seg id=1811>Bush is becoming playing with politics in agitant sense anti Arab and anti Iranian American?</seg>
<seg id=1812>Or is yet another example of incompetence and confusion?</seg>
<seg id=1813>Depending on what we saw last five years, the answer is certainly contains more than a little of bad faith and pure stupidity.</seg>
<seg id=1814>The road map to China</seg>
<seg id=1815>China is about to adopt its 11th five-year plan, listing the stage to prolong what is perhaps the most remarkable economic transformation of history, while improving well-being of almost a quarter of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id=1816>Never before the world had grown as sustainable; never before there was there had such poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id=1817>The explanation of long-term success of China is partly in its unique association of pragmatism and vision of the future.</seg>
<seg id=1818>While much of the rest of the developing world, following the Washington consensus, is launched in a quest for increased GDP worthy of Don Quixote, China has once again made clear that it sought increases sustainable and fairer levels of real life.</seg>
<seg id=1819>China is see it entered a phase of economic growth imposing enormous demands to environment that cannot last.</seg>
<seg id=1820>Unless a change of course, living standards will eventually be compromised.</seg>
<seg id=1821>For this reason, the new five-year plan really put emphasis on the environment.</seg>
<seg id=1822>Many parts of China among the most backward have grown so rapid that the crierait well if other parts of the country were not even faster growth.</seg>
<seg id=1823>While this has reduced poverty, inequality has increased, with growing disparities between rural and urban areas, and between coast and within.</seg>
<seg id=1824>The report this year, the World Bank's World Development Report explains why inequality, poverty, should not just raise concerns is the 11th five-year plan of China frontalement to attack the problem.</seg>
<seg id=1825>The government evokes for several years more harmonious society, and the plan described ambitious programs to achieve this.</seg>
<seg id=1826>China also acknowledges that separating the least developed countries in the most developed countries is not only a disparity of resources but also of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1827>It has therefore established projects daring to reduce these disparities and create a basis for an independent innovation.</seg>
<seg id=1828>The role of China in the world and in the world economy has changed, and the plan also reflects this.</seg>
<seg id=1829>Its future growth should be based more on domestic demand that on exports, which implies an increase in consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1830>Indeed, China suffers a problem: a rare excessive savings.</seg>
<seg id=1831>People save partly because of weaknesses in social insurance programs government: strengthening social security (pensions), health and education simultaneously reduce social inequalities, increase the sense of well-being of citizens and promote common consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1832>If this working (and so far China has almost always even surpassed its own high expectations) These adjustments might impose huge pressure on a global economic system already destabilised by the enormous fiscal and trade imbalances us.</seg>
<seg id=1833>If China is put at least save -- if, as was announced its representatives, it pursues a policy more diversified investment of its reserves, who will finance the trade deficit of more than $2 billion a day from us?</seg>
<seg id=1834>This is a subject to address another day but day may not be distant.</seg>
<seg id=1835>As with a clear vision of the future, the challenge will in implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1836>China is a great country, which could not succeed both without a vast decentralization.</seg>
<seg id=1837>But the decentralization raises its own problems.</seg>
<seg id=1838>The greenhouse gas emissions, for example, are global problems.</seg>
<seg id=1839>While America proclaims that it does not have the resources to do anything about it, the most Chinese officials acted more responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1840>In the space of a month after the adoption of the plan, new ecological taxes on cars, petrol and the wood products were imposed: China uses the market mechanisms to solve its environmental problems and those of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1841>But the pressures on the responsible local governments to create economic growth and jobs will be enormous.</seg>
<seg id=1842>They will be very tempted to say that America is not capable of producing to protect our planet, how could the them?</seg>
<seg id=1843>To bring this vision into action, the Chinese Government will need a strong political, especially of consistent increases taxes on the environment.</seg>
<seg id=1844>While China is transformait in a market economy, it saw develop some problems which are the scourge of developed countries: specific interests hiding personal interests under a masks the ideology of market.</seg>
<seg id=1845>Some évoqueront the trickle down effect: do you not do for the poor, ultimately everyone will eventually benefit growth.</seg>
<seg id=1846>And others will policies of competition and strict laws of corporate governance: allow the Darwinism operate its wonders.</seg>
<seg id=1847>Arguments of growth will be advanced to counter strong social and environmental policies: for example, increase taxes on petrol will kill our automobile emerging.</seg>
<seg id=1848>Such policies so-called pro growth does not only fail to provide growth, would threaten the whole vision of the future of China.</seg>
<seg id=1849>There is only one way to avoid this: the open discussion of economic policies to expose the sophisms and the means to implement creative solutions to the many challenges that China faces today.</seg>
<seg id=1850>George W. Bush showed as it is dangerous to abusing secrecy and to restrict the decision-making to the narrow circle sycophantes.</seg>
<seg id=1851>Most people outside of China, are not realize how its leaders, on the contrary, committed in deliberations extended and broad consultations (even with foreign) when they were fighting to solve the enormous problem they face.</seg>
<seg id=1852>The economies of market are Auto regulatory.</seg>
<seg id=1853>They cannot simply be left on automatic pilot, especially if we want to ensure that their profits are widely shared.</seg>
<seg id=1854>But manage a market economy is not easy.</seg>
<seg id=1855>It is an act of balance which must constantly respond to economic change.</seg>
<seg id=1856>The 11th five-year plan of China provides a road map in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1857>The world opening the eyes, full of hope and fear, for the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to be processed.</seg>
<seg id=1858>The lessons on democracy Tocqueville</seg>
<seg id=1859>Because of the Iraq war, 200 years after the birth of Tocqueville, the world is discussing the nature of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1860>Tocqueville is famous rightly to have rejected the reactionary nostalgia looking that democracy was our destiny, we alertant but the dangers that it contains for freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1861>Do we share his concern?</seg>
<seg id=1862>Tocqueville not regarded not democracy first as a political system, but primarily as a system that intellectual shaping the customs and habits of society, so it by a psychological and sociological dimension.</seg>
<seg id=1863>Tocqueville thought that democratic regimes guide the course of our thoughts and our desires and our passions.</seg>
<seg id=1864>Similarly there was man's revival and the XX 20th century the Homo sovieticus, "human democratic" is a form of human beings.</seg>
<seg id=1865>For Tocqueville, systemic effects of democracy can bring people to abandon their faculty of reasoning.</seg>
<seg id=1866>They can only pretending to judge events and values by themselves, while in fact they simply réductrices repeating the views of the majority.</seg>
<seg id=1867>What Tocqueville called the stranglehold of the "power" social on opinion may be stronger in democratic systems - a point which left predict the level of demagoguery and manipulation of the media in the modern world.</seg>
<seg id=1868>Tocqueville believed that in the long term, nothing can oppose really to this trend.</seg>
<seg id=1869>Neither local democracy, nor of small groups within society, or against the powers, or civil rights cannot stop the decline of critical thinking that democracy seems produce.</seg>
<seg id=1870>School is at best an enclave immune from influence irresistible that society has in mind.</seg>
<seg id=1871>Similarly, Tocqueville believed that research of virtue to how the old or a religious faith could sometimes raise soul, but one and the other are incompatible with the democratic ideal from the moment they are imposed by the authorities in public life.</seg>
<seg id=1872>In that sense, the theorists néo Marxists of school of Frankfurt and Hannah Arendt who feared above all the disappearance of reason in modern societies are the heirs of thinking of Tocqueville.</seg>
<seg id=1873>We can also note the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet entitled, one of these recent books against democracy itself.</seg>
<seg id=1874>For these authors, democratic way of life tends to eliminate any thought original and to prevent the emergence of a culture of level, giving the place to mediocrity that leaves people vulnerable against the enemies of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1875>If history agree in criminal regimes supported by masses intimidées and manipulated, the greatest risk of democratic countries is that their citizens sink into indifference and just a short-term thinking in search of their immediate interest.</seg>
<seg id=1876>The past - despite the rituals which aim to the commemoration of the historic events - is masked by dependence on the moment now and the last novelty.</seg>
<seg id=1877>Even the ruling class, supposed well educated, is victim of this grip.</seg>
<seg id=1878>The main problem of mentality democratic lies in its lack of historical awareness.</seg>
<seg id=1879>As the proclamait Tocqueville, the defects of democracy they do the pessimism resigned the only realistic way - but unacceptable - which is opening up in us?</seg>
<seg id=1880>I do not think.</seg>
<seg id=1881>There are ways to combat what we might call the 'Stupidity democratic "that sees spread today.</seg>
<seg id=1882>The first of these resources is to develop an education system which form real critics, including through education of materials largely neglected (nowadays) that are the literature, history and philosophy.</seg>
<seg id=1883>If the form of citizens informed and able to think for themselves, which is essential to the functioning of democracy, our schools must stop to run after the last ways underway and begin to develop capabilities analysis of schools.</seg>
<seg id=1884>Because of their tendency to cultivating the superficial and the distraction, the mass media constitute the main obstacle to such education.</seg>
<seg id=1885>Today, many people spend more time in their lives to the television that in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id=1886>Passivity induisent the mass media is the exact opposite of the citizens, active commitment to democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1887>But it is difficult to imagine that the mass media (from newspapers quality) accept their own wishes to become the tools of education that développerait mind critical citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1888>This focus on the mass media, not reflects an elitist contempt for popular culture.</seg>
<seg id=1889>It is not just a question of popularity - Mozart was popular to its time and parts of Shakespeare attiraient poor as rich - but the refusal of the mass culture of questioning and provoke.</seg>
<seg id=1890>The result is a widespread indifference and public passivity.</seg>
<seg id=1891>Long, a culture media globalized spreading increasingly, unable to create any critical or raise sentiments.</seg>
<seg id=1892>Because of its disinterest for these issues is a culture that threatens the democratic freedoms because it creates no a sense of duty towards society, history or of the Community.</seg>
<seg id=1893>Is it too late to defend themselves against a culture which émousse to this minds?</seg>
<seg id=1894>Tocqueville méprisait the elites of his time because of their convenience against the dangers of democracy mass.</seg>
<seg id=1895>The myopia of our leaders will promote the achievement of its worrying prophecy?</seg>
<seg id=1896>A Europe for all</seg>
<seg id=1897>Members of the European Union seem long-standing doubt on the future of the European Union but Ukrainians look EU with some hope and some admiration.</seg>
<seg id=1898>The basic objective of our foreign policy is to integrate the European progress, because Ukraine has found that the national autonomy is not an end in itself, but simply a beginning.</seg>
<seg id=1899>Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when a nation is victim of ostracism, no nation is free.</seg>
<seg id=1900>We in Europe are all bound by a link which we cannot escape, linked in a single destiny.</seg>
<seg id=1901>Every aspect of our shared culture, let alone the century of suffering We have we share, confirm this.</seg>
<seg id=1902>Everything which affects a European directly affects us all indirectly.</seg>
<seg id=1903>We will not be never allow ourselves to live with the notions of close two Europes, a Europe of rich and poor, of a Europe of elected and banned.</seg>
<seg id=1904>Anyone who lives on the continent today cannot, indeed, should not be considered a foreign its Union.</seg>
<seg id=1905>The great Pax Europe of today, as prosperity pan-European today, depends on it.</seg>
<seg id=1906>Some will say course that Ukraine is not part of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1907>They come to Kiev and meet its people, young and old, workers, the wives of farmers, lawyers and doctors and teachers who rose and remained standing in the cold and the snow of weeks to defend their freedom last winter.</seg>
<seg id=1908>Are they not united to those who rassemblèrent around the General de Gaulle within French resistance?</seg>
<seg id=1909>Not only do they body with those moururent in fighting to defend the Spanish Republic in the 1930s, those libérèrent Budapest in 1956 and mirent end the fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970s?</seg>
<seg id=1910>Are they not animated the same spirit as the Union Polish solidarnösc and masses of peaceful amorcèrent the Velvet Revolution in Prague in 1989?</seg>
<seg id=1911>This is true the soul of Europe and doubt cannot destroy it.</seg>
<seg id=1912>In all those who consider that Ukraine is too behind for membership of the Union, I say: they come too visit my country and see mothers who remain in office until late for teaching to their children use of computer of their office.</seg>
<seg id=1913>They come to attend the language of every village and city where our youth prepares for Europe by learning the French, German and English.</seg>
<seg id=1914>Those who doubt the European vocation of Ukraine should understand that Europe is not a simple matter of equipment and highways - the insatiable desire for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=1915>I believe that our future is also promising that the past of Europe is proud, and that our intended is not that of a land border forgotten in a region troubled but that a participating influential peace and unity of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1916>Self-determination is synonymous with isolation because achieve national independence nowadays simply means the return on the world stage with a new status.</seg>
<seg id=1917>The new nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that France has established with Germany: a relationship based on equality and mutual interests.</seg>
<seg id=1918>This is the type of relationship that my government to establish with Russia, that is how we can help to extend the area of peace in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1919>It is premature, of course, to go beyond the indication of high consideration that we give the opportunity to enter the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1920>We know that our role in this great edifice will not come about in a night.</seg>
<seg id=1921>We know that the major of European unification are not confined to documents and the statements but taking root in the creative action designed to improve living standards and provide security for all Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1922>Building a dignified Ukraine to join the European Union will not be easy, or fast, or without effort.</seg>
<seg id=1923>But as the European Union itself, and it will build it.</seg>
<seg id=1924>We know that the challenge is great But the game is worth it, and Europe must understand that this is our goal.</seg>
<seg id=1925>The renovation of Ukraine happening partly by a battle for creative ending a century nightmarish during which fascism and communism, of ideologies from the heart of Europe, have affrontés to take power.</seg>
<seg id=1926>Through the Ukrainians has cited a few months ago still, parents and children affrontaient armed troops, the dogs grondants and even death.</seg>
<seg id=1927>Only a few years ago, still, a young journalist Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public about the corruption of the old regime, and was brutalisé beheaded by men's hand regime.</seg>
<seg id=1928>Our Orange Revolution, last winter, proved that Ukraine and its people and could win.</seg>
<seg id=1929>Thus, despite the doubts and the difficulties, I retains a between faith in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1930>I refuse to accept despair as final answer to ambiguities and horrors of history of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id=1931>I refuse to accept the idea that Ukraine is so tragically doomed to live at the core of night without stars of communist legacy to power never see the point of day of peace and a genuine European unity.</seg>
<seg id=1932>When the citizens of the European Union consider instead of Ukraine in Europe, they will see closely and to look beyond their show that we face.</seg>
<seg id=1933>See beyond the areas destroyed we imposed communism, beyond poverty and the social divisions through which our former leaders today répudiés sought to prolong their hand implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1934>They will instead consider closely in the face of our President, Victor ioutchenko, ravaged by the poison it was administered during the election campaign of last year, and remember the words of that great French that was André Malraux, so that "the most beautiful faces are those have been wounded.</seg>
<seg id=1935>Muslim civil war</seg>
<seg id=1936>The gap between Sunni and Shiite Middle East is far deeper that antagonism between Israel and the Arab?</seg>
<seg id=1937>We could believe in seeing the reaction of some Arab governments to Hezbollah's decisions to attack Israel.</seg>
<seg id=1938>While bombs Israeli fall in Beirut and tyr, Saudi Arabia, perhaps the Arab Muslim conservative most of all, has openly condemned the acts of Hezbollah Shiite who initiated the conflict against Israel.</seg>
<seg id=1939>Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, a state which sees itself as the leader of Muslim Arab people had supported Israel so openly.</seg>
<seg id=1940>Moreover, the breakdown of Saudi Arabia with Hezbollah is not a unique.</seg>
<seg id=1941>Egypt and Jordan have also categorically condemned Hezbollah and its leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, for their aventurisme.</seg>
<seg id=1942>What is behind this astonishing situation?</seg>
<seg id=1943>We are living a fundamental turning point in relations between nationalism the Arab and Islamic sectarianism?</seg>
<seg id=1944>The government of Sunni Saudi Arabia feels it more fear and concern Islam Shiite that it means in Arab unity and the Palestinian cause?</seg>
<seg id=1945>The denunciations of Hezbollah by Arab suggest that the gap sectarian Muslim, already evident in the daily violence in Iraq, widening and intensifying throughout the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1946>The will of President George W. Bush to destroy companies frozen Arab world was doomed to review the forces of modernization against elements traditional Arab and Islamic societies.</seg>
<seg id=1947>It seems to place have released forces most atavistic in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1948>The opening of this Pandora's box, could give rise to an era even more horrific for widespread violence, which cannot be called probably than "civil war Muslim."</seg>
<seg id=1949>The gap is Shiite Sunni since the dawn of history of Islam, but the geographical isolation and ethnic Iran's Shiite not Arab, as well as the domination of their minorities by Sunni, Shia Arab countries generally has left this rivalry in the background.</seg>
<seg id=1950>These tensions have fallen more at the wave of "Islamization" created by the Iranian revolution, because in its wake the identity of sectarian Sunni Arabs was more back into the background to measure that appeared a claim "Islamic" widespread.</seg>
<seg id=1951>All this changed when al-Qaeda, a terrorist group Sunni who is based largely on ideology and staff wahabbites Saudis, launched its attacks on America of September 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1952>A branch of specifically Sunni militant Islam was in March.</seg>
<seg id=1953>When the US launched wars both against the Taliban in Afghanistan Sunnis and against the regime Iraqi Sunni, this new trend radical Sunni has acquired more boldness.</seg>
<seg id=1954>Sunni Arabs in the region, who have now gained in insurance, see Israel and the West as a single threat, the other including the so-called "growing Shiite" -- the arc of land extends to Lebanon to Iran from Syria and Iraq, inhabited by supposed heretical Shia.</seg>
<seg id=1955>Leaders of Saudi Arabia, as guardians of the sacred sites of the Muslim faith of Mecca and médine felt, perhaps this threat with more acute.</seg>
<seg id=1956>For Sunni, Shia are simply not to dominate oil-rich regions of Iran, Iraq and of the regions is of Saudi Arabia, they are also, by the actions of Hezbollah to usurp the role of the central "protector" dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cause.</seg>
<seg id=1957>This is because the Saudi royal family drift legitimacy a stringent form of Islam Sunni and put into question the loyalty of its population, which the Kingdom Shiite Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id=1958>The irony of the thing is that America, protector of long-standing of Saudi Arabia, made by responsibility Shiite possible by toppling Saddam Hussein and putting parties Shiite power in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=1959>The Bush administration seems recognize it has done; as the arc Shiite amounts in the east of the Arab Muslim world, the us try to consolidate their protection of Arc Sunni -- Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia -- in the West.</seg>
<seg id=1960>Israel, once implacable enemy the cause Arab, seems today encastré in this structure defensive.</seg>
<seg id=1961>But such a defensive position is necessarily unstable, by the only made panarabes feelings.</seg>
<seg id=1962>Today, people are not ordinary Saudis décollent to Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite TV networks to follow events in Gaza and in southern Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id=1963>They see sink the blood Arab (not only), and Shiite Hezbollah answer.</seg>
<seg id=1964>For them, Hezbollah has become a model of heroic resistance.</seg>
<seg id=1965>This situation leads to state the growing Saudi Sunni schism Shiite.</seg>
<seg id=1966>After the official denunciation of Hezbollah by the Kingdom of Saudi state asked his clergy Wahhabi official issuing fatwas condemning Hezbollah as hérétique and Shiite déviant.</seg>
<seg id=1967>Such sentences can only exacerbate divisions sectarian inside the Saudi Arabia and in the region.</seg>
<seg id=1968>Before the worsening of these antagonism, Sunni regimes by will they believe that they need their own Hezbollah to fight in their corner?</seg>
<seg id=1969>If they manage to this conclusion, they will not need to look far, because fighters of this kind have already followed a training - from by Al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id=1970>Why is Europe can ignore Georgia</seg>
<seg id=1971>When Europe could rely on America to make war, peace and democracy in its own Court is over.</seg>
<seg id=1972>With the enlargement of the Union, as demonstrated by the recent gas crisis Russian this Court now includes not only Ukraine but also Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1973>Indeed, in Georgia, as in Ukraine, democracy is being tested and Europe cannot afford to ignore.</seg>
<seg id=1974>Georgia was the first country in the post-Soviet space to operate its "revolution", colour and to thus proof, with dignity and mature, choice of its people for democracy and European values.</seg>
<seg id=1975>The flags of the European Union who flottent on all public buildings Georgians since show the attachment of natural, as old as history of this country that, as the ancient Greeks, part of the world's time.</seg>
<seg id=1976>Prometheus, médée, amazones and Armenia in neighboring Noah's ark, are all signs that Europe of our myths starts here.</seg>
<seg id=1977>By its history, its civilization, its old traditions, but also most recent, when Georgia is distinguait of other republics of the former USSR, by its critical, independent or frondeur, Georgia is probably still the place of that area where the democratic transplant can take best.</seg>
<seg id=1978>It is therefore all the more worrying to see democratization of threatened.</seg>
<seg id=1979>All seemed to have sufficiently well begun.</seg>
<seg id=1980>Thanks to launch blow férir without a policy of reforms, of privatization, the fight against corruption, research into new frameworks and thus indemnes of compromissions with the previous regime, the implementation of a foreign policy marked by a return of Europe in the game Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1981>The state of mind totalitarian has resurfaced among these leaders who, declaring that representatives of the majority, have appropriate ever more powers.</seg>
<seg id=1982>It is a caste that such a Hydra a thousand warheads is ultimately not to die and revive its ashes.</seg>
<seg id=1983>These and their methods of power that the "Rose Revolution" in November 2003 wanted for once expurger have reintroduced heart power, with their networks, with ramifications including outside their borders, considerable financial burden, their skill to intrigues and manipulation aircraft political and electoral.</seg>
<seg id=1984>It is a power that does not respect enough the essence of democracy is not in the polls in but separation and the balance of power.</seg>
<seg id=1985>Every day, the government to interfere the legislative, the great majority of laws has written to the Chancellery presidential; Parliament wants the daily exercise control of government policy, including, in my case, the nomination of ambassadors and their daily work!</seg>
<seg id=1986>Finally, and this is the most serious, the judiciary is sometimes still not to from the tutelage of the executive and no longer represents or even for the citizen or the investor the guarantor and the protector, without which it is not the rule of law, or of Economic Freedom</seg>
<seg id=1987>It is a company to be democratic in his head, is not yet in its legs. It still reluctant to engage in politics leaving stage to those who care for too long.</seg>
<seg id=1988>Because this democracy is in danger of shift, but because it is still there, strongly established in the population in civil society organisations, in a press, which seeks but which does not lose its faculty criticism...</seg>
<seg id=1989>This is the time for Europe to save democracy to not annihiler all these hopes.</seg>
<seg id=1990>The US has already done what they have been, since independence, and they are alongside Georgian stability.</seg>
<seg id=1991>Stability was certainly not identified to democracy under the rule of Édouard Shevardnadze, former Foreign Minister Soviet that rose revolution was removed from his post President of Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1992>But the Americans have invested very generously in survival elites Georgian and in their learning of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1993>The critical initiatives Soros, now fashionable, seems most unjustified: the revolution in November was not created to all parts of the US, with all due respect to propaganda of Russian nationalist too accustomed to direct interventions to think differently, but the democratic substrat which enabled the was certainly represent, encouraged and supported by the aid the Soros Foundation.</seg>
<seg id=1994>The course to be crossed today for Georgia évacue its body -- this time permanently evil totalitarian, is a complex stage which requires support of another nature, that Europeans are more able to provide.</seg>
<seg id=1995>The models which must be proposed for the balance of power, the institutions of the rule of law, the functioning of judicial or of local democracy must inspire forms of Europe closer to reality than Georgian the Anglo-Saxon model, American variant.</seg>
<seg id=1996>If Europe today rejected this task, it trahirait its fundamental duty towards this country, small, Mediterranean, flexible, of historical tradition, where democracy has a much better chance of success than in Ukraine, which is both very great and always very Soviet in spirit, not to mention Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1997>Not assist Georgia is accepting that democracy and stability are so long ahead not only in Tbilisi, Kiev, but even more in Minsk, to say nothing of Moscow.</seg>
<seg id=1998>It is especially take a very serious risk.</seg>
<seg id=1999>Moscow which, with senior and low, of procrastination infinite, a domestic torn, began to resign itself to the idea of the inevitability democratic, at least to his around, not without having to give up its imperial dreams and their instruments of domination, could suddenly review its perception.</seg>
<seg id=2000>This resignation hesitant, this acceptance of normality in its relations with its neighbours, was in its infancy,, can be emportée by a sudden outbreak of the irrational the Russian power of this too infamous "derjava" that is not resist the attractiveness of weakness in the sense of vacuum, the temptation to be again not equal, but the stronger.</seg>
<seg id=2001>This is what explains the recent gas crisis Russian.</seg>
<seg id=2002>Any sign of step of democracy, of slowdown of democratic wave, will be taken by Moscow as a sense of hope réversibilité where gradually Russia if accoutumait to believe it.</seg>
<seg id=2003>It is the responsibility of Europe to convince Russia that it place tord his hope for a return to the past.</seg>
<seg id=2004>Europe has a responsibility to itself, to its future energy independence. It also has a responsibility to show that there are also strong European values -- of liberty, democracy, justice between peoples.</seg>
<seg id=2005>For that Europe needs instruments of its policies: great public private foundation for Europe and democracy, a university to form the framework of tomorrow democracies which is still seeking a police, an army of judges and magistrates who live models close societies we want to convert.</seg>
<seg id=2006>Europe has particularly need of conviction.</seg>
<seg id=2007>If Europe does not convint itself it is interested in the fate of its neighbours, of their democracy and the future of its values and their spread, which therefore croira in it tomorrow?</seg>
