<seg>Our Charter of Fundamental is first in this millenium.</seg>
<seg>We must succeed to arrange the union of the fifteen in such a way that we can take up the countries, which knock on our door under reasonable conditions.</seg>
<seg>To article 87 must be taken up the range of the precaution for existence for social, cultural and karitative interests with, so that these important mechanisms can be also permanently protected.</seg>
<seg>Some it are the opinion to be that one can create a domestic market in Europe, without itself over fundamental values and principles united.</seg>
<seg>I would like to welcome meinerseits also the clear and substantial speech contribution of president Prodi.</seg>
<seg>As you know, one decided in Amsterdam consciously to separate these two functions clearly. The High Representative expresses itself - contrary to the commission - not completely independently, but his task exists in the coordination of the outside and Sicherheitspolitiken, which fall into competence of the Member, and here must we to government co-operation surely a larger place grant.</seg>
<seg>He expressed the desire that the presidency in Nice points the future way out.</seg>
<seg>One can wish oneself indeed a more comprehensive and better result, but I was open the opinion that we made a good beginning.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I that the European Council in Nice this project it agrees and will decide, hope concretely it as project, not as fait accompli to bring on the way naturally after those were decided now necessary reforms.</seg>
<seg>I pointed out also concretely however that we can achieve major objectives with the joint method in the today's reality extremely, as for example now a more effective procedure on the Balkans.</seg>
<seg>Only if we bind Russia to the west and to the European Union, we will be able influence to take also on its politics and with Russia in contact and in the discussion will remain.</seg>
<seg>Resolution request (B5-0767/00) of Mr. Napolitano in the behalf of the Committee for constitutional questions for the Charter of Fundamental of the European Union</seg>
<seg>In addition it continues this genocide at present and tries to eliminate medium freedom and rule of law in Russia, which anyway hardly exist, completely.</seg>
<seg>In, which expectations of this pensioner, who is called Giuseppe Italia, in Cremona lives and gladly would drive on the Po with the ship, fairly to become, endeavor I for the report Piecyk been correct, which concerns the development and the development of the sea and inland ports as well as the intermodal terminals.</seg>
<seg>The aim of the directive, which was recognized and endorsed by all speakers and the commission, is made by the voting result of the high house unattainable.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I has, as I during the discussion, thus before the vote, clearly made, for the report Skinner was already correct, because I regard risk capital as very important.</seg>
<seg>My parliamentary group colleague Armonia of board got unmistakably straight yesterday that only one minority is on it out, to use community funds and old age pension insurance contributions for the covering from contractor's risks to.</seg>
<seg>Therefore the Charter serves rather, the present to affirm even rückschrittlichen practices of the nation states that it represents a real progress.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, finally lies a Charter of Fundamental of the union citizen on the table, in which a whole article, i.e. article 25, which is dedicated to elderly people.</seg>
<seg>But if it received legally binding effect and to the contract were taken over, as this demands the European Parliament, it inevitably with the time to a standardization of the national law of the individual European countries would lead. It would cause that the Court of Justice would receive one disproportionately considerable power that the centralization was strengthened around the European institutions and the independent deciding match area of each people was limited.</seg>
<seg>· An overloading of the Charter with detail regulations should remain reserved turned off and these for the subordinate right.</seg>
<seg>I will be correct for another Charter, by taking part in the demonstrations to 13. and 14 October in Biarritz and in 7 December 2000 in Nice.</seg>
<seg>Progress of the 12 applicant countries on the way to the entry</seg>
<seg>I mean the fact that a number of Member did not understand it until today yet that there is this connection and that hesitant advancing us to the diplomatic conference into serious difficulties can bring to implement the extension in the necessary period.</seg>
<seg>All we will only be able to intersperse this, about what I talked so far, in the long term, if in the entry candidate countries as well as in the European Union the policy and the elite - and in this limited connection I give you quite, Mr. Kommissar - finally for the fact to recruit that the extension of the European Union for them from use is.</seg>
<seg>This is the generally accepted principle.</seg>
<seg>Let me now to the second objective come, with which the presidency wants to make progress with the extension process in this half-year.</seg>
<seg>I suggest to you from there working in this direction with the conception that we must examine regarding 2003, which candidates am ready to follow us to this date.</seg>
<seg>I thank the correspondent of the committee for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Brok, for its comprehensive and clear report.</seg>
<seg>It concerns in not one case in the negotiations “whether”, it is a matter only of “how” and “when”.</seg>
<seg>But they did it also, because the perspective of the membership in the European Union gives them hope for the solidarity of European people and because so firm political and economic anchorage is ordered to them.</seg>
<seg>A set of countries also with the second economic criterion of the competitive ability on the domestic market so well it advanced that they approach briskly the entry-ripe.</seg>
<seg>We search from there confine possible coordination with the programs of the national governments, the parliament and other institutions.</seg>
<seg>Annually - and that becomes shortly, on 8 November, again the case its - in everyone of the countries willing to join with very large tension the judgement of the commission is expected over the progress obtained by them.</seg>
<seg>Rightfully we decided for the principle of the differentiation, according to which each entry candidate country is evaluated according to its progress and achievements.</seg>
<seg>This debate is a further opportunity for my parliamentary group to affirm that the entry of the central and Eastern European countries, in addition, Cyprus and Malta, which are best future protection for us all in Europe in the east and in the west.</seg>
<seg>This is an affair of all-largest importance, which receives attention however in the public hardly.</seg>
<seg>Many mean jokeful that after the fall of the Berlin wall the time up to the extension remained always alike: five years.</seg>
<seg>The next natural opportunity is offered in connection with the following elections to the European Parliament in the year 2009, but we want to strive that as much as possible countries can join 2004.</seg>
<seg>In all other respects there are six contentwise aspects, to which we have doubts because of the applied method.</seg>
<seg>In reality it is the selected model of the European agreement, i.e. the simultaneous inclusion of all sectors independently of the traditions and characteristics of the involved ones, which leads into this dead end.</seg>
<seg>“This in central and Eastern Europe end of the 80's feeling to lend, represent for us all almost generally articulated shape up to the present day an obligation.</seg>
<seg>To call but around the things clearly with the name: There cannot be Beitritte to the off-peak rate.</seg>
<seg>It is a large and at the same time beautiful conception that we the extensions not against the public distinguished and that the best way exists to make the extensions in agreement with the public in its participation in the elections, because the elections are expression of democracy and a form of the involvement of citizens into the political system.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, my very much admired ladies and gentlemen! I would like to say something briefly to the conditions for a scenario, which was wished here by several sides.</seg>
<seg>I would be very much surprised, if they would not make pressure.</seg>
<seg>But I had already pointed out that all countries the entry-ripe approach relatively fast.</seg>
<seg>That is, the trade liberalisation within the range of the agricultural products is already arranged, without those have Poland the concern that therefore the Polish agriculture breaks down.</seg>
<seg>It gave also loads, but peace and trade brought the citizens and citizens of the countries of the Union on the whole each other more near. The monetary union continues to strengthen this development.</seg>
<seg>The negotiation results should be decisive.</seg>
<seg>The only request for modification, which was so far submitted, is already contained in my report, but I am pleased that the parliamentary group of the Greens underlines the meaning of the equal treatment of the citizens and citizens.</seg>
<seg>In addition belongs not only a law in the public service, but also that there is chances and an appropriate payment for the young administration secretaries.</seg>
<seg>That is valid both for Latvia and for the European Union!</seg>
<seg>The binding of the Litas at the euros is planned in the second half of the yearly 2001.</seg>
<seg>. (IT) Mr. Präsident, Mr. Kommissar! Poland, for which I am a correspondent, is the largest and most important, but as we know at the same time also the most problematic of the countries, which prepare for the entry to the European Union; it exhibits such an abundance from problems that there are even rumors over a possible exclusion of Poland from the first group, i.e. the group that first candidate countries.</seg>
<seg>As Poland and the eastern, formerly too many promises, gave which we did not hold to Communist countries.</seg>
<seg>If one point, that again and again, remains if it concerns Czech Republic, emerges. That is the problem of the Roma.</seg>
<seg>The Slovakia was not referred into the second group, and logically it would like to join at the same time with Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg>Finally me at the same time still another only one remark is permitted to the home policy.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, which the agriculture concerned, whose productivity level is to the European Union still under that, will be, then it necessarily, the agricultural commodities market completely for the privatisation of reason and ground to open modernization of the agricultural enterprises and the sales structures as well as for the increase of the yields necessary capital.</seg>
<seg>Bulgaria is very much because of an entry to the European Union and to NATO.</seg>
<seg>The acute poverty is since 1990 one of the most serious problems of Romania, but appears under the present government that the economic situation actually turns to the better one.</seg>
<seg>These topics will become hopefully priorities in 14 days of the assembling new parliament and the Slovenian Government.</seg>
<seg>It is to be underlined however that a final fair and lasting solution must consider both the relevant resolutions of the UN security council, i.e. nothing but valid international law, as well as the European Union at the basis lying principles.</seg>
<seg>Malta has beyond that stable, functioning democratic institutions.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Mr. Kommissar, rates colleagues and colleagues! In the behalf of the Committee for economics and currency questions also we would like to contribute our part to this discussion.</seg>
<seg>They must be also converted. The European Community law is evenly not only law into the books, but must also in the entry states law in action be.</seg>
<seg>In addition, this change makes hard demands against humans in the applicant countries, secures at the same time their future and the future of their children.</seg>
<seg>Special attention - and I close there the previous speaker on am on the border regions to be put.</seg>
<seg>The commission may not be left in this connection alone!</seg>
<seg>The countries willing to join strive for a rapid economic growth, even if this goes debited to nature protection politics already specified.</seg>
<seg>It came for a change of bad habits, so also in the field of health.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! The extension is essential for the structure of a strong and united European continent.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament and its committee for regional policy, which is responsible also for the field of transport and the transeuropäischen nets, are aware of the necessity to coordinate the different sparkling wine-oral Community policies in favor of a global regional planning policy.</seg>
<seg>Before however still another reference to the fact that the traffic infrastructure of central importance for the success of the extension will be.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I follows those, which see the largest task of the European Union in the forthcoming enlargement.</seg>
<seg>Into the former plan managing of central and Eastern Europe on the traditional social values considerable pressure is expenditure-practiced.</seg>
<seg>The EVP would not like to remove the responsibility for the entry speed from the candidate countries, because we cannot fix an entry date.</seg>
<seg>The second point is the denomination of data.</seg>
<seg>There is still another another reason.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly: Acceptance of enlargement and its positive perspectives for the individual countries and for the European Union as a whole depend - that showed Denmark - considerably on the fact that the social and democracy deficits of European policy are reduced.</seg>
<seg>Populism is the down-appreciating designation, with which Technokraten defame the people will, if it expresses itself in a way, which does not fit them.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and Gentlemen, you have meal and recovery break! It concerns to far 21.00 o'clock.</seg>
<seg>It will give, although in the long term, a common currency for the entire continent.</seg>
<seg>“Over these questions internal arguments in the individual countries are kindled.</seg>
<seg>We demand it on to the fight for another Europe, Europe of all peoples, which is liberating from this inhuman Stigmata, in that all peoples their fate to determine and among themselves relations of the peace, the freedom, which fraternity and co-operation can manufacture to the mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg>I would like to appreciate the work of these organizations hereby publicly. In addition above all also the Romanian Challenge Appeal, which have its seat in Birmingham, as well as organizations from Ireland, which are supported by many humans, counts so also from the Irish maintenance artist Daniel O'Donnell, which committed itself to a donation at a value of 1 million Pound and collected this sum in Ireland and other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg>The summit in Nice must bring above all clarity to become in time expandable, whether and how the European Union can put itself for its part into the position even comprehensively and.</seg>
<seg>Poland ask themselves: Are they joined paid then, if we, also us, or are we countries of second class?</seg>
<seg>I am that with good will and with the help of the European Union a solution can be found, the two communities harmonious living together and a life in prosperity made possible, like that as this the case was for many centuries however sure.</seg>
<seg>We worried in addition, about the question of minorities, because the issue of integrating of these minorities, also their linguistic integration is, in these countries likewise of importance.</seg>
<seg>The conditions for the membership is actually the fulfillment of the basic criteria of Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg>We heard much over the advantages of the extension, but that is a range, within which we can learn from Lithuanias.</seg>
<seg>Imagine, we would like that be all!</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Mr. Kommissar! I would like to likewise thank Mr. Brok and the remaining correspondents and congratulate her, but I would like to concentrate particularly on the Slovakia, in particular on the minority politics.</seg>
<seg>I request you to specify in Nice a date to when you with the furthest advanced candidate countries - without denomination - intend to terminate the negotiations.</seg>
<seg>The European Union must help Bulgaria further on its way to the entering the union and naturally cause that the planning of this assistance takes place still more decentralized.</seg>
<seg>The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of the civil society, the government and the parliament plays thereby an important and - as we determine - positive role.</seg>
<seg>We are nevertheless about to overcome the division in two parts of Europe and create no new.</seg>
<seg>All of this is contained in the report of Baroness Nicholson OF Winterbourne, and I thank her completely cordially in the name of our parliamentary group for this report.</seg>
<seg>According to this understanding Cyprus might be in my opinion the topic absolutely, that over the ability of Europe to accept politically shape will decide.</seg>
<seg>I live close of the Baltic Sea, which is for us everything a common concern.</seg>
<seg>The political vision remains existing.</seg>
<seg>Thus we took the desire of Klaus Hänsch with particular pleasure to the knowledge, which for the PSE parliamentary group it spoke that the commission may give an proper assessment of the impacts of enlargement and also the economic consequences, if it does not come to the extension.</seg>
<seg>I divide nevertheless the opinion of our correspondent, the colleague Wuermeling that it will not go without transition periods in the interest of both Contracting Parties, and straight as delegates of a border region, which possesses as the colleague Schierhuber a farm in the proximity of the Czech borders, is it me a request that developing close common marketing areas without larger problems can be mastered and to a positive result on both sides leads.</seg>
<seg>I want to underline three points as a Social Democrat.</seg>
<seg>The questions of the first column grants containing EWR to the economy in the applicant countries entrance to the domestic market, does not obligate the youth and science for legal exchange change, the European Union on the other hand however yet to expand their system of the farm subsidies since these countries. Thus from the EWR agreement positive impulses would proceed, in particular for the economy in the applicant countries - they need growth, in order to make their society fit for the entry - as also for the national economy in the European Union, if that the cost of enlargement constitutes even two thirds over the economic growth, in the EWR model possibly even still more is estimated.</seg>
<seg>Secondly: say good-bye to that big fearing for idea to take up many candidate countries at the same time this the principle would contradict to take up each country according to its progress.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly: We must do everything, in order to prepare to 2003 the European Union in the sense of the great speech of the commission president Prodi for the extension process.</seg>
<seg>I want to address the relationship in the connection parliament/advice with the reference that there are in the meantime considerable delays during the answer of written questions.</seg>
<seg>It is correct precariously that this happens in a country, which wants to join the European Union.</seg>
<seg>I request the return transfer to the committee, in which the necessary steps are to be prepared.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! Today will we altogether three reports to this topic, under it two of me, discuss and on it to perhaps co-ordinate.</seg>
<seg>That would affect all stages of the grocery chain favorably.</seg>
<seg>Safe food means in the entire chain costs.</seg>
<seg>We must agree thus Mrs. Paulsen and the commission and take up the blending prohibition, so that the animal fodder more surely will and the European consumers are really protected.</seg>
<seg>The guideline of 1999 was well durchdacht, and it can register still a success, because loads could be reduced demonstrably.</seg>
<seg>But then simply a mixture to permit, is not the solution.</seg>
<seg>Completely briefly, we must penetrate on the request for modification 37 concerning the dioxin problem.</seg>
<seg>In this point are we an opinion.</seg>
<seg>In the result its we will buy meat, milk and their by-products, which are not made on the world markets of by any means the swelling and limit values corresponding animal feeds specified by the union as European consumers further, i.e. thus in a system, into which raw materials on the world markets is acquired, where each material or each preparation can be mixed unhindered, before the products are introduced to the area of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Up to the second reading the commission should inform us about the planned procedures for the risk evaluation.</seg>
<seg>However it would be consequence-fraught, if for example the requests for modification 39 and 40 were accepted, since there would then be no more possibility for the member states to intervene with again discovered dangers fast.</seg>
<seg>Consumer protection begins already with the animal fodder, with the animal feed contents materials, defining and finally official controls.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, much admired colleagues and colleagues! The report of the colleague Paulsen to the undesirable substances in the Tiernahrung concerns an major issue, which is a most disputed like all major issues.</seg>
<seg>The discussion over the excellent report of Mrs. Paulsen, who is present us today, was strongly emotional coined/shaped in some points, and following which current discussion must we with it probably go out that for the animal feed industry strict conditions are valid, the quality by admixtures however later be changed can.</seg>
<seg>Each of these three proposals will contribute both separately and in the common cooperation to the removal of the most important lack, which came by the dioxin crisis to light.</seg>
<seg>With request for modification 33 the re-exportation is to be prevented by animal feed portions, which do not meet the requirements of this guideline, into the export third country.</seg>
<seg>The commission rejects the requests for modification 41, 42, 43 and 44, in which is suggested introducing the possibility of the dilution of contaminated animal feed basic products under certain conditions again.</seg>
<seg>This should be sufficient in view of our promise that we will create a system for rapid information exchange in the context of the fresh proposal over the mechanism of a food authority, which will take the entire food and animal feed chain off.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Kommissar Byrne! With this directive on the marketing with mixture animal feeds our old problem covers itself, i.e. the question of the open declaration in the reason.</seg>
<seg>And that is for me already the profit of the today's in the morning.</seg>
<seg>Because if we would make that, if we would convert that here fast and also fast through the joint decision procedure to go, that is surely a large profit, and I am surely that we the advice opposite very strongly and united will be.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, loves colleagues and colleagues! Also in the future it can occur, at least is it however not to be excluded that contaminated basic products arrive in animal feeds.</seg>
<seg>The BSE scandal was the worst, most well-known example.</seg>
<seg>As our correspondent already said, it would be most meaningful, if we had a label with open declaration, on whom added is listed.</seg>
<seg>I think, the technical qualification and the faculty of judgement of the members in the agriculture committee in things agriculture and thus also in things animal nutrition stand except question, in the sense of a practice-oriented and a workable solution, which are to be used and understood about the farmers and consumers concerned.</seg>
<seg>So far the positive part.</seg>
<seg>I regard this as a legitimate right on information, to which we must consider.</seg>
<seg>In the name of my colleagues of the fishery committee and in my own name I ask you, Mrs. Präsidentin, the relatives of the victims and the local authorities of Brittany as to be conveyed also by Marín, Galicien, from where most victims come, the sympathy of the parliament.</seg>
<seg>(The parliament accepts the resolution.)</seg>
<seg>- Would like to express itself someone against the collecting main of this verbal request for modification?</seg>
<seg>Thus the correspondent the state of affairs explained us.</seg>
<seg>Most technical proposals earn our strong support, as for example within the range food security, disconnection of the nuclear power stations of the first generation, environmental protection, fight of the social dumping, the essential code of conduct for enterprises from the west, active in the east, and much more besides. These tasks are enormous and from there absolutely priority.</seg>
<seg>Simultaneous also further considerable difficulties are to be mastered, in particular within the household range.</seg>
<seg>An extension by 13 countries does not only change the geopolitical framework of the European Union, but it changes also their structure, since on the one hand the total population will increase (+ 28%), on the other hand in addition, the number “disadvantaged” regions.</seg>
<seg>It is to be noted that in the entry countries a competitive land and food production will be due to its high economic and social weight for the successful transformation and restructuring process of crucial importance.</seg>
<seg>In this connection would like I desire to express that those receive far outermost regions, from which six of seven rank the poorest European Union still among the ten structural fund means not only alone due to the Gross Domestic Product criterion, but also due to geographical, demographic and above all social indicators.</seg>
<seg>Since we reject this Europe in the interest of the Frenchmen, we can its extension around the countries and peoples of the east, who are liberating from the Communist dictatorship straight only and cannot yet know, into which technokratische and totalitarian trap them with this step will grope, not with clear conscience to agree.</seg>
<seg>We would have it with the reports on the situation in the countries and during at the most a short however concise resolution bewenden to leave to be supposed.</seg>
<seg>The system of aid, subsidies practiced at present and ratios must be replaced by free trade and adjustment to the market.</seg>
<seg>The meaning and consequence of the problems, which the extension brings with itself, do not get along with the deviousness, with which about it in the European Union one speaks.</seg>
<seg>About the extension to speak is not called for me to affirm the affiliation of some countries to Europe or not.</seg>
<seg>Our neighboring country strove purposefully during the last ten years around the fulfillment of the entry criteria.</seg>
<seg>Latvia has its place in this house, not only, because it its altogether the right to this “credit of trust” regards progress grants, which is essential for a successful conclusion of such negotiations, but above all and primarily, because it is in Europe at home.</seg>
<seg>My judgement is Poland the state, which earns our support and our commitment from all candidate countries earliest, because without the extremely important initiatives of Poland communism would not have been brought to case, and we would be today not here, in order to treat this problem.</seg>
<seg>For the Polish population, who consists still to a large extent of Euroskeptikern, this is not valid possibly in the same way.</seg>
<seg>I appeal at Prague, this indication, to correspond this request, to take up this request for dialogue and ensure together with this house that this inheritance of a nationalistic era can be overcome.</seg>
<seg>. (EN) I welcome the report of Mr. Wiersma over the request of the Slovakia for entry to the European Union and can the largest part of its conclusions support.</seg>
<seg>With large joy entbiete I on this occasion elderly people and the pensioners of the Republic of Bulgaria mean special greeting.</seg>
<seg>Even if Romania makes further progress and the European Union adapted their institutional structures and Politiken, in order to be able to master the extension, I do not see a reason, why Romania should not be taken up to the union.</seg>
<seg>The position represented in the report is clearly too hard, however a solution to the problem of the settlers could look, which is extremely difficult just like the land return for both sides.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately some the statements, which are contained in the report draft of the committee for Foreign Affairs, human rights, Common Security and defense policy over the application by the Republic Cyprus on entry to the European Union, straight are not helpful.</seg>
<seg>In view of the missing good intentions the Turkish zypriotische ethnic group and Turkey this no easy task will be.</seg>
<seg>Report Stenzel (A5-0243/2000)</seg>
<seg>I was unfortunately victim of one, although easy, food poisoning, which I fatal-proved in the European Parliament had tightened.</seg>
<seg>For all these reasons I was correct for the blending prohibition suggested by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg>We must request the ASEM countries in this resolution request to exert pressure on the military regime in Burma so that the democracy is repaired there.</seg>
<seg>We are not consistent in our approach and during the conversion of our measures.</seg>
<seg>Now is not the time for small courage and desperation.</seg>
<seg>Some key points in the regulation are first of all: Regulation of the burden of proof.</seg>
<seg>Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>“Thus are the reasons, for which we need statutory regulations for the fight of discrimination.</seg>
<seg>Also due to its us now numerous specializedlegal requests for modification are present, by which a same protection level before discrimination from grounds of race on the one hand and from grounds of religion, a handicap, the age or the sexual orientation is to be guaranteed on the other hand.</seg>
<seg>It had to be endeavored around balance, circumspection and a good right technology, and its report reflects in my opinion these qualities.</seg>
<seg>In addition are these members of the view that discrimination is not so frequent that special legislation will issue would have.</seg>
<seg>The financial resource of the scheme is not sufficient, in order to replace the work, which is carried out in the fifth master program and resumed hopefully also in other framework programs. Our task is to be guaranteed it that over the program borders away one co-operates.</seg>
<seg>Over the necessity to fight discriminations general agreement, over how, exists into which measures and with which means the opinions go however apart.</seg>
<seg>In the committee I had the opportunity to resist me that also experts can come to word, who no NRO belongs.</seg>
<seg>Likewise we welcome to a considerable degree the guideline regulation, according to which equal treatment also means for handicapped ones that appropriate adjustments on the job are presupposed by the enterprises.</seg>
<seg>We create it only in such a way to fight discriminations within all ranges of the human coexistence in Europe effectively.</seg>
<seg>All in all also the large anglo-saxon democracies teach us that racism and discrimination with the help of the liberal democracy, and not by the restriction and gradual softening of the liberty of opinion, which freedom of the expression of opinion, which freedom of association and the economic freedoms are fought.</seg>
<seg>In a proposal the equalization of homosexuality with the holy marriage is demanded.</seg>
<seg>In this way the European Union in particular cases, in which it concerns discrimination or the equal treatment of its citizens, can take a clearer attitude.</seg>
<seg>I would like to likewise deal with the question of the exception regarding the religion.</seg>
<seg>Doubts were expressed from different sides over the potential interpretation of the reason to article 1, which is still somewhat unclear, in which however between sexual orientation and sexual behavior are differentiated.</seg>
<seg>In this way a hierarchy of discrimination develops.</seg>
<seg>Into Neukaledonien one comes due to the skin color into the benefit of advantages.</seg>
<seg>Together with the recently adopted guideline 2000 this adjustment of the guideline proves the stated desire of the European Union in-be entitled for an open society which is free from hackneyed thought patterns and particularly from the stigma of racism deeply rooted in European history.</seg>
<seg>Those thus, which explain here in this parliament, the values, which we all want to defend, needed to be fixed not in an European directive, are mistaken.</seg>
<seg>These hard compiled successes may not be touched.</seg>
<seg>Finally also an important role comes to the media with this task.</seg>
<seg>The experience also showed us that the promotion of legislative proposals to the fight of discrimination is not sufficient indispensably, but.</seg>
<seg>We must prevent a senseless bureaucratic disorder, by which Europe was only reduced to a purely materialistic, politically correct community without deeper sense.</seg>
<seg>This parliament decorated my judgement the actually reserved legislation, which wanted to suggest the European Commission, to a Christmas tree.</seg>
<seg>Let me first the two correspondents, Mr. Mann and Mr. Cashman, for two excellent reports thank.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore I can accept your requests for modification, by which both the meaning of prevention and the fight of discrimination are to be underlined.</seg>
<seg>The second category aims off to get the text of the proposal straight of the commission contentwise while the third category consists of numerous requests for modification, with which this proposal in agreement with in June the last yearly adopted guideline against racial discrimination to be brought is.</seg>
<seg>In particular in the requests for modification 9, 10 and 20 one suggests painting the reference to discrimination due to the race and the ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg>I know your referring in the requests for modification 21 and 45 to natural and legal persons and did not-formalise groups of people not to approve of, since this proposal is valid over the occupation only for individuals.</seg>
<seg>The vote takes place tomorrow at 12.00 o'clock.</seg>
<seg>We cannot expect public support for peace-creative employments, if our troops are threatened with the weapons, which we ourselves supplied.</seg>
<seg>In my homeland I could not even purchase without permission a shotgun, while I for the opening of an arms traffic in my garden shed any permission did not bräuchte.</seg>
<seg>A further key point is the prohibition of export, sales promotion and marketing of articles of equipment or of know-how, which serves the torture primarily for purposes.</seg>
<seg>After these prefaces I would like to congratulate the correspondent, colleague Titley, to its excellent report naturally.</seg>
<seg>Apart from the questions of the commitment we must expand our view on the one hand also since emphasis, which aims at an military operation directly, since disarmament, conversion, intensification of the activity of the police and tariff organs, and on the other hand since the straight candidate countries addressed by colleague Wiersma.</seg>
<seg>If the money circulation was controlled, then it would be substantially more difficult to go around the regulations valid for the arms traffic.</seg>
<seg>The goal of the annual review consists of determining such potential improvements.</seg>
<seg>The European Union examines at present whether this project can be continued also beyond the extent of the project, which ends in the November of this yearly.</seg>
<seg>A methodology and indicators were specified, which are introduced on the forthcoming Council “research”.</seg>
<seg>I thank you, Mr. Busquin.</seg>
<seg>Concerning the problems of the KMU we naturally made certain that the KMU, like in the household decision, is planned considered in the master program being entitled.</seg>
<seg>This seems to out-crystallize at least from the debate over the budget in Greece, and many appoint yourself thereby even to the attitude of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Which concerns the multidiscipline character, then I divide your doubts.</seg>
<seg>The first point, which it mentioned expressly in its explanation, is the participation of the European Union in national programmes.</seg>
<seg>We could not speak from there of a European research area, if we only 5% of the research budget financiers.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, Mr. Busquin.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand was due to the efforts to bind the means up to the end of the year 1999 completely at the beginning of this financial year the number of the requests standing for decision for the financing of new projects accordingly low.</seg>
<seg>However I would like to point out again that Portugal in the preceding period fulfilled everything to our satisfaction.</seg>
<seg>Inquires No. 2 of (H-0730/00):</seg>
<seg>The definition of the oil tax on an high level finally does not have as a consequence that the joint competition regulations are not kept.</seg>
<seg>Mr. MacCormick will secondly the following admits to be: If the member states with fiscal means favour a certain industrial sector, they injure the regulations over subventions, in this case fiscal aids, which equal subsidies in approximately.</seg>
<seg>Completely a clear case is for example the nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg>Concerns: Euros experienced and reached household line minority languages since 1983 existing budgetary appropriation of the European Union in favor of of minority languages until 1995 a constant increase in the year its highest level with 4 millions.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! Surely it knows the colleagues in the parliament that the structural funds - and that is new - prove a great many means for cultural activities, because I attached importance together with Michel Barnier to it that the structural funds invest not only in roads and in airports, but also into humans.</seg>
<seg>Therefore the commission will enter next year no further financial commitments.</seg>
<seg>Which concerns concrete proposals for a financing, then I can take here in addition no position since we must accept the usual linear path.</seg>
<seg>I considered different possibilities.</seg>
<seg>And it is valid to prevent, because we speak here of millions smaller and sized enterprises in all of Europe.</seg>
<seg>Do the regulations concern the moose hunt, also the treatment of the meat intended for the power consumption over the hunt, for example?</seg>
<seg>If one would apply the regulations to meat of animals hunted for the internal requirement, then a bureaucratic disaster meant for the moose hunt.</seg>
<seg>After conclusion of this report I intend to submit proposals to the improvement of the livestock transports. I will deal also with the problem of the insufficient penetration of the transportation time limits.</seg>
<seg>We discussed this question before on my meeting with the parliamentary group of the Greens.</seg>
<seg>Our question was clear: which measures does the commission seize?</seg>
<seg>General product security obligates also the manufacturers to clear their customers up over possible risks.</seg>
<seg>The case Maryam Ayubi is extremely disturbing.</seg>
<seg>Inquires No. 14 of (H-0745/00):</seg>
<seg>The attitude of the European Union regarding this meeting on Ministerialebene in Vientiane, naturally also in relation to the question, whether it should at all take place and/or on which level the European Union be represented should on the developments in Burma by December will be dependent.</seg>
<seg>A final comment.</seg>
<seg>The elections are a significant step during the inclusion of the inhabitants Kosovo into the organization of their municipalities.</seg>
<seg>I can insure you, these elections was more democratically and better accomplished than elections in our countries, in which I participated frequently either or with which I as an observer was present.</seg>
<seg>However we did not see it as beginning and under any circumstances as end of the process.</seg>
<seg>Therein a more efficient and more coherent control of the arms as well as a larger transparency are endorsed.</seg>
<seg>Now I state that each year more supply contracts for weapons and accessories are closed.</seg>
<seg>On the basis of false informations, of virtual realities we cannot make pertinent decisions.</seg>
<seg>The regulation, with which these activities were made of and the same central management, should be examined.</seg>
<seg>These organs must have the possibility of using an internal invoice controller it would however quite be sufficient to make for the finance director certain minimum requirements regarding the audit the edition.</seg>
<seg>This proposal encounters, like the Mr. Kommissar very well white, in the parliament not unanimous support.</seg>
<seg>Thus - nothing against an independent, internal audit service, for which we give van Hulten green light today with the report of the colleague!</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Mrs. Kommissarin! First I would like to congratulate the correspondent.</seg>
<seg>We are the opinion that the modernization of the administration is urgently necessary.</seg>
<seg>An independent Gegenprüfung is essential, in order to avoid errors.</seg>
<seg>The money is to be spent in the future more purposefully and more effectively, and naturally is to be also better ensured that the means are spent also on the purposes, for which it by the budgetary authority were intended.</seg>
<seg>Now to the suggested changes the briefly following: The introduction of this additional consideration reason the commission agrees.</seg>
<seg>I would like to therefore thank you for your proposals and your consultation.</seg>
<seg>I would like to summarize the proposals of this report, which are my judgement most important and most effective. First of all: Installation of a team of experts, which builds itself out from the member states appointed high-ranking personalities up, in order to contribute to the definition generally appreciative parameter for protection of minors in the media area; secondly: Introduction of a Selbstkontroll Kodex by all television companies; thirdly: Possibility of the promotion and the entrance to filter systems both for the television and for the Internet.</seg>
<seg>I cannot agree the demands of the liberals unfortunately.</seg>
<seg>That is and remains mainly a task of the legislation of the Member, which does not exclude however a konsensuale communication on certain benchmark figures in the dialogue with all involved ones on the European level by any means.</seg>
<seg>Under the given conditions it is in my opinion task of parents to protect their children at home this kind of programs.</seg>
<seg>Parents are particularly dependent on assistance in this range, that must contain the following: Parameter for protection of minors in the media area in the entire area of the European Union, the installation and economical availability of filter systems, legislation to protection of minors and the responsibility of media, enterprises and offerers in the private and in the public sector.</seg>
<seg>If then during committee debates some it say that there are no proofs for the negative influence of the different forms of violence on the television on children, then I am surprised and regard this as a fatal minimization.</seg>
<seg>Concerning the introduction of a Selbstkontroll Kodex it is to be marked particularly in technical point that broadcasting corporations in some member states already compiled a control code for the television, which is to make parents possible to switch the television off.</seg>
<seg>The discussion is closed.</seg>
<seg>Above all in my report the actually praise-worth Verallgemeinerungen are replaced to the power of decision by the return to the member states.</seg>
<seg>That would be the Mindeste, in order to ensure the area of freedom, which is a fundamental right of each union citizen.</seg>
<seg>There are still payment arrears from the year 1996.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Mrs. Kommissarin, admired colleagues and colleagues! First I would like the correspondents, Mr. Evans and Mr. Mantovani, for whom performed work thank.</seg>
<seg>I recommend this report to the high house and endorse the acceptance of Mr. Evans of brought forward requests for modification.</seg>
<seg>Our human resources are our exclusive future in a world, in which knowledge everything means.</seg>
<seg>And I know still many more. One does not solve problems with green, white, black or red books, but by means of concrete measures.</seg>
<seg>But the parliament fulfilled its function and expenditure-practiced pressure, so that the researchers are accepted nevertheless to the text.</seg>
<seg>Their current visit takes place at one time, which is of great importance for the future of the European agreement work.</seg>
<seg>We know however that this process is not yet completed and thus the risk runs to lose its Vitalität.</seg>
<seg>If we do that not now, in this difficult and stormy radical change phase of European and international history, when we become it to then manage?</seg>
<seg>Nobody of us can state today to know exactly when and in which order we will achieve these goals. But we all are us over the fact in the clear one that, if we believe in them and aims at them persistently we already brought half to the distance behind us.</seg>
<seg>It must be carried for the fact concern that Mrs. Nutznießerinnen of the induced occupations are, whereby again the same inequalities may not arise as in the more traditional sectors, i.e. fewer quality jobs, part-time job on sometimes not voluntary basis limited, work contracts as well as difficult entrance to decision positions.</seg>
<seg>The advice could be evaluated concerned with a proposal to the indicators, on the basis those the relevant progress.</seg>
<seg>In short, concerning the fourth column the equal chances mean a support of the integrated approach of the equalization by Gender Mainstreaming and the specific guidelines.</seg>
<seg>I think in particular of acts of violence against women, one of the central topics of interest of my government activity, and I know that this topic also you is completely a particular concern.</seg>
<seg>Us it is well-known that the measures favour the women to the reconciliation of family and occupation in particular, even if it is still missing at studies over the current situation of the family and the role of women in the family, which is not any more the traditional role, because the society have themselves strongly changed and with it also the family structure.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes some people seem, also to believe that nevertheless like that would be, but it does not tune some colleagues in this house.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, you let me stress to the conclusion that the equalization in the own four walls begins.</seg>
<seg>Consider such a position I precarious and zwielichtig, and over it should be thought my judgement regarding the projects planned by you because it is not sure that we arrive thereby at the practical implementation.</seg>
<seg>In this range no equality exists.</seg>
<seg>The picture of the European women, as it results from our reports, from our guidelines, does not correspond those Danish womens, which give by the majority a refusal to the euro.</seg>
<seg>So it is in my opinion designating that the report takes off on it, in all sectors of society, for example on the job market, must a numerical equilibrium between men and women be manufactured.</seg>
<seg>Straight one therefore is it a missed chance that in this report marriage and family became to ausserachtgelaßen completely.</seg>
<seg>That should take good heed of also the Committee on Women of the woman and equal chances better!</seg>
<seg>We heard that the preceding council presidency restructured and then abolished the equalization Ministry only.</seg>
<seg>The middle pay of the women is on the average to 28% under that of the men, which contributes to the fact that the women constitute the largest part of the poor population, and makes their participation more difficult in the social and political life.</seg>
<seg>That is really excellent.</seg>
<seg>European-wide today a process of the depletion of the employed persons women, also in France, carries out itself where nevertheless less than 3,650 FF has 15% of them monthly to the life.</seg>
<seg>It succeeded to not all countries to follow your example and I hope that the example of France in other countries will carry fruits.</seg>
<seg>The history of the women goes back obviously far.</seg>
<seg>Must be really helped to the entering candidate with the assumption of the joint possession conditions.</seg>
<seg>I need however your assistance.</seg>
<seg>That is not the case, but it is a satisfactory text, and the legal committee decided after mature consideration and an extensive discussion to submit no alterations.</seg>
<seg>The legal committee arrived after long debate at the view that it was not appropriate, juridical insecurity over six years to keep upright, and that the fixed period of three years was a more than reasonable period, in order to be able to determine with the appropriate means and an average care whether with an explanation irregularities were present or not.</seg>
<seg>That is request for modification 15, in which it concerns the fraud.</seg>
<seg>The goal, above all a simplified, but qualitative communication with nevertheless sufficient flexibility of the basis regulation to manage improvement of the procedures for the collecting duty and larger adjustment of the regulations concerning the registration with the tariff fulfills one of the demands of the single market, and that was reached here, even such that many countries could be inspired in order to be able to participate also fast in the world trade.</seg>
<seg>It thanks the parliament and in particular the committee under presidency spent by Mrs. De Palacio Vallelersundi for the efforts, the two institutions on this dossier, and the interest, which they brought to it.</seg>
<seg>Greetings</seg>
<seg>I would not like that the casting of votes is affected by it, but the translation of the French version must be really examined.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I was correct for the report Evans.</seg>
<seg>It is recognized that Fremdsprachenkenntnisse are a necessary condition for the mobility.</seg>
<seg>In addition we mean that the member states to a considerable degree should decide on the taxation.</seg>
<seg>A little regretted I that we did not have a chance, received a majority for the necessity too to formulate a period of limitation for keeping from documents to.</seg>
<seg>- (FR) with the negotiations over the contract of Amsterdam we had at that time the inclusion of Article 13 concerning discriminations from bases of sex, which race, which ethnic origin, which religion or (not sektiererischen) the world view, a handicap, the age or the sexual orientation welcome.</seg>
<seg>The problems of certain minorities in these countries is conscious of all.</seg>
<seg>From the reasons to the request for modification it follows unmistakably that thereby also the intention is pursued of proceeding against the age relevant provisions valid in the member states which are not perfectly justified however for development-psychological reasons and in the occupation life any meaning have.</seg>
<seg>I consider also all what was written together in a new article 12 a), renounceable.</seg>
<seg>To religion and Glaubensbekenntnis. The EPLP welcomes the principle of the relevant worthy of protectionness.</seg>
<seg>. (Sports association) We Christian democrats welcome on the whole the proposal for a directive to the definition of a general framework for the implementation of equal treatment in occupation and occupation.</seg>
<seg>But only something states over the personnel occupation of an internal audit service and nothing over the financial meaning and thus over the use of such a service.</seg>
<seg>The European Union decided the structure of a common military competence, in order to fulfill the so-called Petersberger of goals (crisis fight and conflict resolution outside of the territory of the European Union), had however no own defense policy.</seg>
<seg>Without weapons the world would be by far safer.</seg>
<seg>The resolution request aims not at a drastic reduction of the weapon sales to the promotion of a policy of disarming off, but would like to only make regulations for in order securing for the arms companies further profits.</seg>
<seg>In its report the commission recognizes the problem, suggests however no concrete measures, because it is arrested the thought of the liberalisation of the market and the competition. All their proposals pass in the reason - particularly for children - the harsh reality of the Zügellosigkeit of the multinational companies, it unimportant to which in its profit greed, which effects its transmissions and products have, and which push over any responsibility to parents, which are stimulated even still for the acquisition of new products, in order their children to protect.</seg>
<seg>Like the Berichterstatterin, then am also I the opinion the fact that the measures are not to be limited no more to protection of young before violent and harmful programs to the conventional television but for all media to be valid must.</seg>
<seg>With on the average three hours daily are television apart from sleeping and - for the adults beside the work - the most important human activity.</seg>
<seg>Beyond that women occupy frequently “flexible” jobs; limited work contracts and low wages are typical for the sectors, in which mainly women are busy.</seg>
<seg>They are the first victims with shortening public funds, the privatisation in the health sector, the restriction of the right on health care and medical treatment - shortening, are still more noticeable with the right to vorbeugungs and information programs.</seg>
<seg>B5-0792/2000 of the delegates Marset Campos and Di Lello Finuoli in the name of the Konföderalen parliamentary group of the United European Lefts/Nordic Green Left to the crisis in Peru.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! I would actually wish myself that we would have other urgency here once not only in connection with or, but after a well prepared discussion in the committees a debate over Latin America.</seg>
<seg>We must set everything to it so that Peru with candidates can achieve the goal, who are the challenge grown and able, of fulfilling the demand of Peruvian people after political renewal and substantial democracy.</seg>
<seg>The joint debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>Now know we, Afghanistan lie not far from it, Afghanistan are the world-wide largest Opiumproduzent, so that we can introduce ourselves, which role these political - by the way not only political - mafias during the expansion of the drug trade do not play.</seg>
<seg>The commission is requested to a balance of the humanitarian aid programmes in favor of Afghan people, so that nobody is locally forgotten.</seg>
<seg>This conflict brings inexpressible suffering with itself.</seg>
<seg>Since years there is a household line, within whose framework mine clearing and prevention programs are financed.</seg>
<seg>Let me here to the reference of the Mrs. Abgeordneten Paciotti say the fact that I will ask the question naturally this very day within the commission, which happened with the means for mine clearing operation and is to happen.</seg>
<seg>B5-0794/2000 of the delegates Medina Ortega, link ear and Fava in the behalf of the Group of the social-democratic party of Europe for kidnapping with the Guerilla Spanish Jesuit in Colombia, in negotiations;</seg>
<seg>We all regret this and would wish ourselves not to have to speak again about Colombia.</seg>
<seg>The commission already offered to coordinate the measures of such a package. The commission plans in the next days already to assure considerable means for this.</seg>
<seg>Again once with two different measure is thus measured, what I to consider regret worth.</seg>
<seg>Me the behavior of the Albanian opposition party is particularly incomprehensible, locks it nevertheless here consciously for a necessary solution of an Albanian problem in Macedonia.</seg>
<seg>I regard it as an unusual achievement of the Mazedonier to come within their country clearly with one another.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I believe also the fact that this reconciliation can be durable, but the government, that found a solution for the university question and many other questions with large courage, needs visible indications of success and needs strong support, otherwise is endangered the peace in the whole region.</seg>
<seg>Within the framework of the national programme for the year 2000 made available PHARE means can be used also for the support of the university in the coming academic year, thus 2001 and 2002.</seg>
<seg>I may stress that today already all Greek Members in the European Parliament expressed themselves to this circumstances.</seg>
<seg>Since all concern these problems Greece, which has the largest navigation sector in the European Union, they concern strictly speaking the security of each kind of navigation in the European Union.</seg>
<seg>In the last years in our waters by far more humans their life lost, not only by large Fährunglücke, but all too often also in our fishery municipalities.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, innocent victims must now hold out, so that the shipowners can implement their goals in the broadest sense.</seg>
<seg>We must be over the fact in the clear that it concerns also the reliability of the European Union here.</seg>
<seg>I would like to finally stress that the commission is convinced firmly of the fact that the question of the European legislation must be over the security of passenger ships a question of highest priority in the European Union and that it depends to guarantee that these legislation in the whole community is used strictly and uniformly.</seg>
<seg>Please excuse the fact that I was late for reasons, which to you sufficiently admits is somewhat. I would like to deliver a brief statement to the two topics standing on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade and in the former Republic Yugoslavia generally as well as the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Kommissar Verheugen will speak like Mr. Solana to the two topics, which stand this afternoon on our agenda, i.e. the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg>We must be ready to redeem this promise as soon as the will of the people is respected.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, Mr. of High Representative, Mr. Kommissar! I take part in this discussion not completely without reservations; I did not want that our parliament appears in view of the dramatic consequences of the new outburst of violence in the Middle East, only one month after here expectations created so confidently in this Saale, today exclusively as a judge, who is authorized to condemn this or that one.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin! My current contribution is based not on all kinds of remote analyses, but on my own experiences of the past week, because I was coincidental in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip, when it came there to the outbursts of violence.</seg>
<seg>Also as opponents of the force one cannot place the force of the Israelis and those the Palestinian on the same stage.</seg>
<seg>I would like to request the parliament in this crucial hour to adopt an explanation of the solidarity with the courageous people who defended the freedom today in the roads of Belgrade, the same solidarity, which we to Europeans still a few years ago humans of other capitals assign become let, which likewise fought for their freedom.</seg>
<seg>The Europeans would be certainly well advised to seize us here in this house of the president of the Palestinian Legislativrates required opportunity with the tuft.</seg>
<seg>The position of Jerusalem is one difficult point in the negotiations.</seg>
<seg>For many years he succeeded in deceiving with its propaganda machine and with brutal pressure on the media humans in its country but unfortunately also many in the Western world to feign them a false picture of the reality.</seg>
<seg>Since the curtain falls to this drama, it is the obligation of this parliament as symbol of united, free Europe, to support the masses before the Yugoslav parliament and help Mr. Kostunica with the perception and fulfillment of its mandate.</seg>
<seg>Exactly this irreconcilable attitude lets the worst fear at the same time - and the events of this instant underline these words, which I noted a few hours ago.</seg>
<seg>I ask myself whether the commissioner in this point plans already steps, in order to show that we really regard Kostunica as that rightfully elected representatives of Serbian people and as the partner, with which the European Union has to do from today on.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament would like to protest it in this historic moment, since tyranny comes into staggering and the democracy triumphiert, its unrestricted solidarity.</seg>
<seg>After the agenda the debate on the report (A5-0237/2000) of follows Mr. Seppänen in the name of the budget committee over the proposal for a decision of the advice to the modifying Decision 2000/24/EG regarding the expansion of the guaranteeing of the community for any losses of of the European one investment bank after loans for projects in Croatia (KOM (2000) 289 - C5-0336/2000 - 2000/0122 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg>The new political course hit after the parliament and presidential elections in this country is to be welcomed.</seg>
<seg>It works an advisory task Force, a whose goal consists of offering to Croatia its authority and technical aid with the treaty negotiations.</seg>
<seg>We may not forget that Croatia was until recently the classic example of a privatisation program completely failed, by which only some few from the privatisation profited. This whole process must be supported.</seg>
<seg>The contribution in form of a EIB loan over 250 millions euros for the period, standing to the discussion, 2000 to 2007 can be for it no milestone, probably however a carrying assistance.</seg>
<seg>Therefore it is not completely correct, if in this report of a democratization the speech is.</seg>
<seg>When Croatia and the Slovakia became in particular independent a half century ago for the first time, they were Vasallen of the Hitler regime.</seg>
<seg>We cannot see naturally also the question of the guaranteeings and the question Croatia detached by the discussion in the evening of yesterday and the development in Belgrade.</seg>
<seg>If it like that is that Milosevic fled and the will of the people won the upper hand, then we hope that it takes days up to the practical admission of normal partnership relations between Serbia and our union of the democracies only.</seg>
<seg>I explain on Friday, interrupted parliamentary session of the European parliament for again taken up 6 to October 2000.</seg>
<seg>(The parliament rises to one being silent minute.)</seg>
<seg>My question reads: Who is authorized to speak in the name of the European parliament to the statute?</seg>
<seg>I ask you, Mrs. Präsidentin, to undertake all conceivable steps in order to accelerate the current thing procedure in the committee on petitions regarding the submitted the protest letter, in which the Petenten expresses itself against the current situation, in which community regulations to the radiation protection in flagranter way are injured, of more than thirty social groupings and NRO.</seg>
<seg>The Autopsie made in Georgia resulted in that it concerned clearly a murder, probably in connection with torture.</seg>
<seg>We have the opportunity, your dream - im Übrigen not my actual the long way to make progress with.</seg>
<seg>This is the fundamental legislation and the basis for every other legislation of genetically changed plants.</seg>
<seg>It steps obviously from a fat cell into the other one.</seg>
<seg>(The meeting is interrupted at 17.40 o'clock and taken up at 17.50 o'clock again.)</seg>
<seg>After the agenda the report (A5-0291/2000) of Mrs. Van Lancker in the behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs follows over the Commission communication to the advice (KOM (2000) 379 - C5-0508/2000 - 2000/2219 (COS)), the European Parliament, the economic and social committee and the Committee of the Regions to the sociopolitical agenda.</seg>
<seg>The meaning of this open coordination method to emphasize does not mean, this method is to step social of minimum standard to the place of the social legislation, since we specify social right also in Europe, to formulate to dare and social laws to issue have, which are necessary in the context of a European domestic market.</seg>
<seg>We plead in our statement in addition for the dialogue and co-operation with the civil society and particularly with the woman federations in the countries, which prepare at present for their entry to our European family, because also there must we in time an harmonious development introduce, which follows the model of remaining Europe in theory and practice.</seg>
<seg>To the fields of activity enumerated in the Commission communication likewise general agreement exists.</seg>
<seg>On this point of my speech I would like to remind of a seminar, which is organized to this topic on 4 and 5 December in Biarritz, and which I will lead.</seg>
<seg>Regarding the fight of exclusion we obtained occupation and Social Affairs” major steps on 17 October on the advice “and defined appropriate objectives in the fight against the poverty and social exclusion, which are to serve as basis for the national action plans.</seg>
<seg>From some circles I heard that one agrees after reading the report the diagnosis, not however the ordered prescription.</seg>
<seg>Technological development and the new organization forms speak surely also for a flexible co-operation, in which on rigid process controls, but rather on goals and results one sets less.</seg>
<seg>Exactly on it the old-fashionable opinions are to be led back in our eyes, which are charged those, which do not expect from a liberalized market that it regulates everything to the best one.</seg>
<seg>That contributed considerably to the social peace in our country and the confidence with foreign direct investors strengthened.</seg>
<seg>The selected method appears to me meanwhile rather doubtful.</seg>
<seg>If we speak of a Charter of Fundamental and face an European Constitution in a well-meaning manner, we may be not short-sighted, but must openly express that all necessary steps must be undertaken, even if it requires in addition more accurate regulations.</seg>
<seg>To critically mark I would like missing initiatives to the new challenges in the industrial safety, in the employee participation and in the work relations.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, also I would like the Berichterstatterin, to which to Mrs. Kommissarin as well as the Mrs. to minister Péry to this representation congratulate to the sociopolitical agenda.</seg>
<seg>We know that these points are fought by the conservative ones in Europe. We however, in our parliamentary group, put completely particular importance on it.</seg>
<seg>The third contentwise characteristic concerns the extension.</seg>
<seg>The vote takes place on Wednesday at 12.30 o'clock.</seg>
<seg>The Commission actions should be supplemented by an examination of the effects of the entrance for the particular to medical care, for social security and to the old-age pension system as well as by an investigation of the lack in the Labour Organization and perhaps also the question of general shorter hours.</seg>
<seg>In this way the Mrs. Europa close will feel, in addition, will profit to Europe from the interesting and innovative ideas, which will arise from the connection to this program.</seg>
<seg>We expect ourselves an annual report of the President of the Commission in the context of an annually taking place discussion in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>Besides I am pleased that an improvement of the measures is intended for care of children, whereby the compatibility is to be facilitated by occupation and family lives.</seg>
<seg>My parliamentary group will consider this in its final vote.</seg>
<seg>(The president rules out of order to the speaker.)</seg>
<seg>My judgement is expressed positively and the proposal for a Council Decision to the programme for the period 2001-2005 well durchdacht the fresh approach of the commission.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion the numerous reflect, from us endorsed requests for modification the common position, which the commission and the woman committee in this question takes.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand I received inquiries in the course of the past yearly from several enterprises, which felt a certain powerlessness in connection with the testing methods, not least in those cases, in which an appointment had to be inserted against the Commission decision with the court of first instance.</seg>
<seg>I would like to likewise use the opportunity and ask Mr. Kommissar Monti, when the conversion of a public, effective and well working listing is to be expected over subventions, and in addition, when that is realised already for a long time in prospect indicators placed.</seg>
<seg>The moreover one I would point out Mr. Monti that broader area should be granted to the credit trade in the next report.</seg>
<seg>Which I said, is not only valid within the range of the energy policy, but it is valid altogether also for other ranges.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Kommissar Monti, in name that Italian Radical would like also I correspondents for good work to thank, which they carried out with the two reports, in which they deliver a flatterful evaluation of the activity of your person and the central management competition.</seg>
<seg>I stress this, because the market cannot regulate everything and there is and give may no boundless competition in this sense also.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! Nobody denies nowadays - and I naturally also not - the fact that the subventions change the competitive conditions and in as much from evil is as they favour the inefficiency of the enterprises.</seg>
<seg>Thus it was to be heard at least already strangely that it abstreitet the decrease of the subventions in the period 1994-1998, although the commission grants this nevertheless.</seg>
<seg>My statement concerns naturally the XXIX. Commission report over the competitive policy, but we come now once not to look back on the past.</seg>
<seg>In me the available the speaking time I would like to deal with the following three topics: Modernization of the competition law of the community, activity in the year 1999 for the penetration of the rules of competition and finally the subventions.</seg>
<seg>The commission intervened always decided against Kartellbildungen and against the abuse of dominating the market positions.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Rapkay, the commission puts considerable importance on the support of its competitive policy by the European Parliament, and I do not have the impression that this support decreases.</seg>
<seg>This system can be activated either on request of a Member State or in accordance with article 119 of the contract for the establishment of the European Communities, a regulation, which during the third phase of the economic and monetary union only for the states with special arrangement, at present thus for Denmark, which United Kingdom and Sweden are valid.</seg>
<seg>In the future the resort to the capital market should remain only those possible option.</seg>
<seg>I ask therefore that the report in the present form meets approval of the House and that thus also within the range of the Rebpflanzgutes the European domestic market can be used.</seg>
<seg>The fact that it must be changed now is to be due to the advancement of the phytosanitären regulations and to the scientific and technical progresses, which were reached particularly with in-vitro-increase.</seg>
<seg>As by this precaution principle furthermore to the possibility of genetic modifications is referred, for example the intensive employment can be lowered by plant protection agents.</seg>
<seg>Finally I would like to say that we demand the winegrower, who would have to therefore follow opinion of Marianne Isler Béguin and committee for environmental questions, public health and consumer protection and be correct for its cancellation in the interest of precaution principle, if just now the articles and requests for modification mentioned by me should not be withdrawn regrettably then, like it also.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, if you permit: Mr. Kommissar, you could state your point of view to us for the request for modification of the committee for environmental questions, public health and consumer politics? This concerns the request for modification 1.</seg>
<seg>The only disputed point was whether I had been supposed immediately to take the decree over the deprivation of the mandate of Mr. Le Pen after its transmission by the French Government to minutes or not.</seg>
<seg>I remind you of the fact that this vote takes place only at 12.30 o'clock.</seg>
<seg>In the range law and inside I am optimistic regarding a solution for civil justitielle co-operation.</seg>
<seg>The group of preparations becomes their task fully by 19 November, which date of the future sitting at Minister level, to continue.</seg>
<seg>We needed such an invigorating climate, how Mr. Moscovici stated, and also I had been able to notice the very strong feeling of a common, historic responsibility with the heads of state and government to one historic moment of the European agreement.</seg>
<seg>It must be paid attention only to the fact that we do not stay now in these questions of the qualified majority behind the spirit or the climate of Biarritz.</seg>
<seg>The tiny countries are not the command receivers of the large countries of the European Union!</seg>
<seg>I would be grateful to the acting Council President, if he would get this point straight.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand the presence of President Kostunica was an historic event.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, Mr. Ratspräsident, Mr. Kommissar! Progress was reached during intensified co-operation and the expansion of the decisions with qualified majority, but exists still profound differences of opinion regarding the composition of the commission and the voice weighting in the advice, as you underlined.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me rather that we move in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg>Who does not follow intensified co-operation, has the freedoms of a passenger on the rear seat of a motor vehicle.</seg>
<seg>Also I would like to interfere non still less than you - into the Home Affairs of Germany, but am I the opinion that this point of view is completely coherent and in all other respects goes into from the commission the desired direction, if I am not mistaken.</seg>
<seg>We began an exchange of views with the member states over this question, from which it follows that all member states endorse the maintenance of this upper limit after the extension.</seg>
<seg>This will be surely not the case.</seg>
<seg>First of all, one had occasionally the impression that in Biarritz a certain obsession of the debate between small and large states predominated.</seg>
<seg>Relevant it is to be said after my view not sufficiently, the community procedure must be protected.</seg>
<seg>Also after the entry of the today's candidate countries each member state must keep a junior or a senior commissioner.</seg>
<seg>The wording of Article 93 is all the more problematic in view of the fact that it will be so well impossible after the first successfully carried out entry wave to reach progress toward qualified majority.</seg>
<seg>The citizens of these countries must be convinced by the undisputed advantages, which each new European Treaty brings with itself.</seg>
<seg>It would be called to misjudge the deep-seated reasons of this crisis wanted one to assume that the fears without new vibrations of a final pacification, which is the precondition for a reconciliation preserved since generations, could make place.</seg>
<seg>Also the only quite weak echo worries me on the demand of the parliament after democratization.</seg>
<seg>Can be accused nevertheless probably rather to the forces, which demand the execution of comprehensive reforms still before the extension.</seg>
<seg>On the one side the decision of the head of government of Israel stands to freeze the peace negotiations because of the use of force in the zone and its efforts on the education of a state of emergency government with the leader of the opposition, Mr. Sharon, to concentrate.</seg>
<seg>Of course we took the victory of Yugoslav people and the choice of Mr. Kostunica with indescribable joy to the president to the knowledge.</seg>
<seg>I recommend Mr. Barón Crespo to ask its Italian colleagues nevertheless for a reason for it why they take part in Italy with one expressed Communist Party in the government and itself with another expressed Communist Party, which Partito prepare della rifondazione comunista, for the participation in the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg>Here there would have to be progress in the procedure of the joint decision.</seg>
<seg>The commission is with the possibility of the simple majority with votes in the commission rather able of giving these impulses in the future.</seg>
<seg>Now in the union no visionaries are used, whose view is fixed on the year 2030, but people with solutions, which are able, to recognize the problems which the extension which can be managed within 3-8 years brings, to find and answers to it.</seg>
<seg>It concerns thus a work carried out under open conditions, which was given or was not interspersed not from above.</seg>
<seg>The discussion is closed.</seg>
<seg>If this fundamental orienting point is lost, one does not understand at best any longer, at worst kills itself one mutually.</seg>
<seg>The democracy is better into Europe, but the European democracy is ailing.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament made today, on 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg a simple and serious statement: Yes, you can realise the European condition, we want them.</seg>
<seg>Therefore the island situation is actually a sufficient criterion.</seg>
<seg>I to the heart of the matter will be limited, by concentrating on the essential points of the report of the Mr. chairman Gil Robles, to which I to mark briefly would like that I find him excellent.</seg>
<seg>First the simplification and clearer organization of the contracts.</seg>
<seg>I would like it bewenden to leave, because the report of the university institute of Florenz stands here - at least for me - not to the discussion.</seg>
<seg>According to the information - it now very technical, see it to me please the post, which are present the presidency, seems in a clear majority of the language versions contrary to the Italian version for the application of the coherence politics only to most strongly the favoured islands and not to the islands to be generally referred.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Duhamel, Sie it are itself surely united with me in the statement that there, if Nice does not become success is no place or at least no reliability for considerations of the future of the European integration, at least not in the current framework.</seg>
<seg>Also it is necessary in this European condition to specify the task distribution between the member states and the European Union clearly and to include the dynamics of the European integration in ranges with, where it is indispensable, together to act, as in the outside and security policy.</seg>
<seg>It could make itself also necessary, in order to overcome continuous blockades.</seg>
<seg>We need a clearer distribution of the responsibilities and a clearer Subsidiaritätsprinzip.</seg>
<seg>Acquaintance measures there are in addition most different views in the different member states, with the different social forces.</seg>
<seg>The final aim of a European condition would be however regrettably exactly the opposite, and from there we cannot agree it.</seg>
<seg>Because in the strengthened European house it will possibly give peoples at the military, at the monetary political and at the tax political table, and then the others, which apart.</seg>
<seg>The second version is clearly not correct, because on the one hand the economically backward areas are taken off by the structural funds anyway and it would not have given on the other hand after this interpretation a reason for the adoption of the explanation to No. 30.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I will concentrate in my modest short 60 seconds on the report of Olivier Duhamel, which is excellent, since he really calls the things with the name. And the Lyrismus of our correspondent a while ago convinced us finally of it.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion the unit of Europe only political nature can be.</seg>
<seg>After our view the new condition should be present already to the next European elections and be able into force to step.</seg>
<seg>Therefore the designation is applied “most strongly disadvantaged” both on the island regions and to the remaining areas, and after the proposal of Mr. Barnier here, in accordance with the provisions of the agreement of Vienna, a change of the Italian contract text must be made.</seg>
<seg>The discussion is closed.</seg>
<seg>Because the Mrs. Kollegin said, she wanted to be correct against it, is void this request for modification.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, one looks here obviously for a prescription for the chaos.</seg>
<seg>- (EN) I welcome the adoption of the report Trakatellis by the parliament, determine he nevertheless high quality and safety standards for derivatives from blood or blood plasma.</seg>
<seg>If the European parliamentary immunity is independent, then the French authorities with the waiver of immunity of the delegate Le Pen would have had themselves to turn at us.</seg>
<seg>I am particularly disappointed over the vote behavior of the EP with the report over traffic with vegetative propertyproperty property of vines.</seg>
<seg>Alcohol such as tobacco and drugs for a product, which can arrange huge damage with consumers and their fellow men, the others hold the one however see in it a means to job creation and gushing financial resources.</seg>
<seg>The Berichterstatterin welcomed generally the proposals to this topic, contained in the Commission White to be decentralized is however anxiously because of the possible effects of the reform, which aims in principle, the penetration from competition regulations to.</seg>
<seg>In the discussion I could last night congratulate Jonathan Evans to its work, but had I equal initially my clear criticism to liberals, if do not even ultraliberalen adjustment of its report express.</seg>
<seg>The group again aligned this emphasis, in order to secure itself in the coming three years half of all new jobs developing with projects on the Green meadow in the Ziel-1-Region.</seg>
<seg>In view of the indignation, which the consequences of this politics cause, succeeds every now and then at least partly defusing by state interventions, aids and other economical or tax incentives the situation.</seg>
<seg>(The meeting is interrupted at 14.06 o'clock and taken up at 15.00 o'clock again.)</seg>
<seg>Thus we stand now in October 2000 shortly before the adoption of resolutions over the number stand of the household 2001.</seg>
<seg>That did not prevent the advice however to shorten with the agricultural spending altogether 555 million euros.</seg>
<seg>Besides we are naturally the opinion that 400 places may not be created simply additionally, simple obendrauf.</seg>
<seg>I can only say, follow you to the advice us!</seg>
<seg>Therefore the administration of this house for the delegates did not turn around there and.</seg>
<seg>The European Court of Auditors makes us at present to few concerns.</seg>
<seg>Finally also the household of the Ombudsmanns from us is to be worked on to.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary are we the opinion that straight should be forced regarding the entry countries the research range.</seg>
<seg>In addition we suggest that the parliament is further regularly informed.</seg>
<seg>And if a legislation Konzertierung takes place to Social Affairs, to culture or environment - which will give then builds commissioners me up right -, we us, the commissioners for household, the Ministers of Finance and the members of the budget committee, in order to pray together that no financial inconsistency is committed.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Ladies and Gentlemen delegate, Mrs. Kommissarin, much admired ladies and gentlemen! Thank you for friendly welcome.</seg>
<seg>Rather it already approved in first reading the budgetary appropriations, which appear justified for 2001 to it, without being issued oneself in tactical considerations, those the goal of an appropriate utilization of funds, which the institutions for community must aim at further, would have been only detrimental.</seg>
<seg>Before you decide on the budget draft 2001, I would like to emphasize a number of objectives, over which concord between advice and parliament exists and which to an agreement between the two branches of the budgetary authority lead can.</seg>
<seg>In the structural policy we are in a similar situation.</seg>
<seg>Also the Konzertierung in the summer - whereupon Mr. Colom i Naval referred to - had a good result, i.e. that information improved in the future is put with expenditure-effective legal bases also to the parliament at the disposal.</seg>
<seg>I may remind of the fact that in the last year the decided financial plan for the Balkans only 1.85 billion were intended for the whole period until 2006.</seg>
<seg>I ask again for it - the commission leaves its proposal on the table -, to examine and consider as a possibility this proposal also impartially.</seg>
<seg>The material was obviously very useful both for the planning of the household 2001 and for the discharge for the year 1999.</seg>
<seg>So much I as a member of the budget committee the work of this committee estimate, and so much I also the work of the Berichterstatterin and the correspondent of the budget committee worthy, do not want to miss I it as correspondents for the Economic Committee and currency nevertheless to refer to two requests for modification which the committee in the plenum again presented and whose meaning is not completely insignificant despite smaller amounts.</seg>
<seg>With these measures we want to make judicial control fully functional again, to repair the confidence into the legal security of the European Union and to strengthen the European Union as community of rights.</seg>
<seg>The spareless cancellation of this initiative made by the commission was a clear ignoring of the political will of Lisbon and the priority of this house.</seg>
<seg>This decision was very disconcerting and left many of us with the feeling that this major programme had become simple the ball between the budget committee and the commission.</seg>
<seg>My third point is European agriculture, as it is present us now in the household scheme.</seg>
<seg>If the occupation represents a political priority of the union, then the fishery may remain as a further sector of the economy not outside forwards.</seg>
<seg>Particularly I am pleased about the fact that the financing for the programs decided to the last turn of the year could become secured SOKRATES, YOUTH and CULTURE 2000.</seg>
<seg>The arrears with our Mediterranean assistance for example amount to the households of several years.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, into whom past years was I speaker of the Committee on Culture, youth, education, media and sport, in whose name this afternoon Mrs. Iivari spoke.</seg>
<seg>But I would like to also say the delegates in the today's afternoon that we should not lose sight of that the European Union 1% of the Gross Domestic Product is only used and a large part is administered of it in the member states.</seg>
<seg>I may turn now to the general strategy.</seg>
<seg>Here I would have concerned now at the strategy of my parliamentary group, because the tendency forms the starting point of our convictions to secure for the European citizen as favorable a cost-benefit ratio as possible.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, we must work on a parliament, which enters for transparency, efficiency and an effective democratic control of the European organs.</seg>
<seg>Then we must think, how we solve this problem.</seg>
<seg>We want to advance democratization processes, and we want a balanced relationship between the classical politics policies of the foreign policy, which we have now before us.</seg>
<seg>The main problems in the new budget draft concern the external actions.</seg>
<seg>Economical managing is naturally necessary, by us is supported, and over it we should not us also away mogeln.</seg>
<seg>This is an unusual initiative, in particular in the first reading, and it is an ungrateful initiative, since it will not find majority of votes under the current circumstances.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless the range of the budgetary provision for Kosovo some problems raises.</seg>
<seg>With the budgetary policy we must win public confidence into the European policy.</seg>
<seg>All measures for the stabilization of the small and medium-sized enterprises are to be also supported from there.</seg>
<seg>the range of the implementation of the budget,</seg>
<seg>If one maintains this strategic line as beginning for the households of this and the coming years, then the parliament takes its place in the budgetary procedure completely.</seg>
<seg>With the transmission of 175 millions euros are to us about 25 millions euros more at the disposal than we had expected.</seg>
<seg>As the topic the advice, the commitments of funds explained MEDA was no problem, since eight years long payment arrears were accumulated.</seg>
<seg>I believe, Mr. Duff was this morning present, when we dealt with the European Council of Biarritz.</seg>
<seg>My answer to it is completely simple.</seg>
<seg>Ramiro Zapata was the last one of the murdered 25 human rights activists, and recently the Colombian press published the “plan 100” of the paramilitary groups, after which 100 human rights activists should be murdered.</seg>
<seg>The current attitude of the Council tunes me somewhat more contently than from July, seems nevertheless the European Union, as we it already in many crisis situations experienced, internationally always than the latter into action to go and their voice to hearing to bring.</seg>
<seg>My inquiry reads, and thus I come in the end whether there is no possibility to exert a stronger pressure than by the president in its information was suggested, and whether the help, whom we want to render will to that extent fundamentally differ from the assistance of the United States that she sets not on the Fumigation of the planting, but on the new cultivation of other cultures and not on the military, but on the social aspects.</seg>
<seg>The questions posed by me and the other delegate refer completely concretely to the situation in Colombia.</seg>
<seg>Since they concern the same topic, the inquiries No. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 are treated together.</seg>
<seg>Concerns: Taxation of the financial transactions the demand for a taxation of speculation capital gains more in the last months ever ground. Thus numerous ATTAC committees (Association pour une rating sur les Transactions of financières et pour l'Aide aux Citoyens) were used into France and Europe and brought in the French national assembly as well as in the senate proposed amendments.</seg>
<seg>The moreover one one should answer also to the question, she would have which influence on the volatility of the foreign exchange markets, in particular with a sentence of 0,1 parts per thousand, while the speculators count on devaluations in the order of magnitude of 20 to 50%.</seg>
<seg>Under number 26 it demands the moreover one the installation of an international arbitration organization for the cancellation of the debts of the countries of the South.</seg>
<seg>Those was independent of by the way also in the yearly yardstick with the euro the case, whether one regrets or welcomes this.</seg>
<seg>What said Danielle Auroi a while ago concerning the countries of the South, I would like to add that the estimations of specialists contain interesting number data, so for example that a tax in the kind that would furnish rave-in-expensively incomes from 50 to 250 billion dollar, while according to computations of the UNDP 40 billion dollar per year would be sufficient, in order to secure a minimum of living conditions for the hundreds of millions humans, who it lacks in the countries of the third world everything.</seg>
<seg>In the past months the epidemic arose among other things in different parts of France.</seg>
<seg>Now, since the representative of the French presidency is present, I would like to know, whether the slaughtering of the cows from the EU budget or from the national budget is paid and whether it is attached in your view, to settle it from the EU budget.</seg>
<seg>I ask you for your consent that she can be now answered.</seg>
<seg>The scope of action both of the government concerned is thus limited by the international law.</seg>
<seg>Me is veilful, as the commission can express itself in February in addition, what it needs, and the advice in July.</seg>
<seg>If the union in name of subsidiarity puts such a procedure to the day, it relieves itself in reality of one from it to task which can be fulfilled, as it this in the last weeks both in north Italy and in Spain did.</seg>
<seg>How can I as a delegate of the European parliament, to which this majority is because of the heart, permit that 11.5 billion Pound from British tax funds - which is our present annuity - is spent, if the broad public does not stand behind it?</seg>
<seg>With an flexible approach on the part of the advice an agreement could be found, in order to lock the household in second reading.</seg>
<seg>If someone must be still convinced, then look it on the proof.</seg>
<seg>Joan Colom i Naval, the vice-president responsible for buildings, already presented this strategy.</seg>
<seg>As Mrs. Kommissarin Schreyer already mentioned, the budget draft of this year contains many political messages. The reorganization of the agricultural policy, new structural programs, protection and improves execution of the structural policy, implementation of the decisions of the summit from Lisbon to the creation of a stronger and more competitive European Union and for the fight of social exclusion.</seg>
<seg>The NATO war destroyed too much and to large suffering left.</seg>
<seg>Despite the met agreements I ask occasionally, whether it can possible be attained this goal in the context of the existing household obligations without the agrarian budget, which is essential for a lasting agriculture sector in the present Members, to undermine itself.</seg>
<seg>And I answered clear them klipp and: Kostunica must get its chance here and then hopefully in the next weeks or months also for an amnesty will provide, in the meantime however quite is I for the fact that on political level and regarding the household to the introduction of these two new household lines, democratization and reconstruction, political conditions are attached.</seg>
<seg>The elections in Yugoslavia showed two different kinds: Humans have finally enough from the dictator Milosevic, and they have confidence in professor Kostunica.</seg>
<seg>I am sure me that also the Albanian political prisoners are soon released.</seg>
<seg>If we do not do that, it will come down inevitably to a “financial plan”, on rearrangements and shortening both with the general, social and environmentalpolitical expenditures and in co-operation.</seg>
<seg>Initiatives are in demand for the solution of the large social problems, like e.g. unemployment.</seg>
<seg>Of course I classify a circumstance as enormously important, i.e. that we began with column 4, tackled them. Still however it is not perfectly clear, whether now a solution succeeded to us there, also not, because the advice is not under any circumstances sufficiently to cooperate determined.</seg>
<seg>With each household work is important it to set emphasis.</seg>
<seg>That is with view of running out the contract in the near future not much engraving, but it would be precarious, if would give the following right frameworks the practices such on the EGKS the possibility for the continuation.</seg>
<seg>That leads to my third remark, which stands now before us.</seg>
<seg>The new financial agreement does not give that. The distrust opposite the politicians in the European Union grows, then I experienced.</seg>
<seg>But acknowledgment is entitled to them.</seg>
<seg>The dialogue readiness of all institutions concerned made an unparalleled co-operation possible, which it us, which I hope, will permit deeply, to arrive in the first reading at an agreement.</seg>
<seg>We, who we stand for the European values in a European Union-sceptical country, have now a further argument for the European Union: a more effective protection of personal data, which is of great importance for the citizens in the modern society.</seg>
<seg>I determined that in my own country now an amendment of the law is to be accomplished over personbound data, by which the influence possibilities of the delegates to the decisions by the Commission been allotted.</seg>
<seg>At numerous further points we see problems likewise. Here the judgement of practice must be waited for, in order to go surely.</seg>
<seg>. (FR) The commission would like to refer first to the obligation, which we all have opposite the citizens to ensure the protection of the personal data processed by the institutions.</seg>
<seg>With this explanation the commission accepts that the range of application of the regulation is limited exclusively to the activities in the context of the first column.</seg>
<seg>In accordance with the political agreement, which obtained the commission with the advice and the Berichterstatterin for acceptance in first reading, them become from there each further request for modification, which is not contained in the report Paciotti approved of by the Committee on Freedoms and right of citizens, reject, apart from request for modification 69 the correction of the request for modification 41.</seg>
<seg>From there it is essential that the personnel status of the agency-spreading group is supplemented immediately within the Secretariat-General of the commission, so that by legal instruments with general in scope for their examination by the Kollegium on the basis of Article 299 paragraph 2 a detailed subsequent estimation can be attached to all proposals.</seg>
<seg>From the view of the Committee for right and domestic market it is to me because of the heart to stress that one can really only treat directly, which is also alike.</seg>
<seg>In view of the importance of fisheries for the regions in ultra peripheral me that betrübt much.</seg>
<seg>Since under the presidency by Delors a agency-spreading group for the regions in ultra peripheral was formed, to have we a long and fruitful way put back, and I must that, which led this group so far, which low-felt thanks that express in ultra peripherals living European.</seg>
<seg>Thus the Treaty of Rome already contained a reference to the French overseas sections, but still lasted it until 1989 and up to the pos egg programs, the programs for the solution of the specifically problems which can be attributed to remoteness and island situation, until European Union finally it recognized that the constant character and the clenched occurrence of the structural disadvantages of the regions in ultra peripheral justified a special treatment compared with the other regions of the Community.</seg>
<seg>I do not doubt that the proposals, which the commission will submit to the advice will be coined/shaped by these characteristics.</seg>
<seg>This question becomes the more relevant, the more near the European Union extension to the East moves.</seg>
<seg>This right to differentiation is nevertheless nothing else as a result of the principle of equality to treat therefore also that differently is, which is different.</seg>
<seg>It is a document, which my team and I as rich at ideas and proposals regard, which penetrate to the heart of the issues and turn into none of the topics, which are in the regions in ultra peripheral cause for concern.</seg>
<seg>In your report, Mrs. Sudre, is emphasized rightfully the necessity for permanent working.</seg>
<seg>During the revival of the economic diversification we obtained progress in several essential areas.</seg>
<seg>Now it depends on the fact that a number of projects is suggested in the context of the EPPD, but parallel to this activity locally we must the selective demand, which comprehensively analyzes specific entrance of each of these regions in ultra peripheral.</seg>
<seg>Approval of the Minutes of the preceding meeting</seg>
<seg>Of course I will inform the president about your reference.</seg>
<seg>I make myself concerns over the fact that numerous devices could fail and be placed the decisions of the house in question, because the necessary regulations for such a case are missing.</seg>
<seg>Both this food authority and to us submitted Legislativvorschläge, which are directed toward the guarantee of food security, the support of this parliament are received, Mr. Kommissar.</seg>
<seg>The emphasis of their activity is on the scientific consultation, because the discussion over food security must be led equally on a material basis.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I would not like to miss it, the correspondent for its constructive contribution and for its readiness to consider the statements of the other committees means thanks to express.</seg>
<seg>If we are confronted with a potential risk, the precaution principle must be used.</seg>
<seg>Which concerns those still controversial issue, to what extent we are to include topics into the field of this authority also like the nutrition as well as the consultation and support of the places, which would drive through the risk management, are we the view that at least the possibility should be granted to this authority for food standards in all questions of food security of delivering a statement and of offering their support.</seg>
<seg>Thereby retaining the rich traditions is of central importance.</seg>
<seg>Such an acknowledgment will find it not by legislation, not by regulations, but by integrity, by scientific top quality, by independence, by accountability, by transparency and by comprehensibility.</seg>
<seg>Good scientific knowledge is surely essential, if one liked to evaluate the risks in connection with the food chain, from the stable up to the table, better.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, it does not exist a doubt to the fact that the mechanism of a European agency for food security, as our correspondent would like to call it is supported generally.</seg>
<seg>Even if the WHO program receives further the necessary resources as well as the necessary support, we do not need an additional agency. That is valid particularly for an agency with one on the 15 member states of the European Union in such a way limited range.</seg>
<seg>Food security is the fundamental requirement for the consumer, because the consumers want to nourish themselves healthy, and but we must take care.</seg>
<seg>If we do not get a new framework guideline, we will only be able to smile about much within the range of food security.</seg>
<seg>Therefore changes are in the European Union contract necessarily, so that capabilities of sanctions in the foodstuffs sector are given to the commission to the hand, as it these today already on the area of competition have.</seg>
<seg>I support all partners involved whether in political, administrative or in other working groups, which work on the strategy “food for all”.</seg>
<seg>I do not agree this statement in as much as humans are evenly more than only a body.</seg>
<seg>The authority must be the actual head of the coordination of the net of the national agencies, which must bring and coordinate again a network of the point research centers for food security on the level of the individual regions on the way.</seg>
<seg>Therefore its request for modification 11 and my request for modification 17 might have to be brought quite with one another in agreement.</seg>
<seg>The reform of the food regulations in the European Union should take place on the level of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>In its report so much proposed amendments are not set submitted as rather emphasis.</seg>
<seg>In the report we formulated this demand clear, what I welcome extraordinarily.</seg>
<seg>The creation of a European authority for food security is to be extremely positively evaluated however.</seg>
<seg>In the interest of all union citizens it is to be wished that these criteria are then also kept.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion concrete periods must be specified to inform within those the European Commission about each case, which gives justified cause for concern, are.</seg>
<seg>The European Union must guarantee their citizen in the foodstuffs sector if possible high standards.</seg>
<seg>The commission suggests now the mechanism of a European food authority.</seg>
<seg>I have the concern that Europe runs again the risk to afford a blown up bureaucracy unable am to be acted.</seg>
<seg>The more new levels of bureaucracy we create and the more funds we spend, can the less thereby be caused.</seg>
<seg>Prevent similar and parallel work in several institutions.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless it is valid to avoid that in the shade of the debate on the White the fear of the public before bureaucratic Europe, which on quality of products influence takes, without proceeding effectively against the health-endangering deception and misleading consumer, is strengthened.</seg>
<seg>How you know, the strategy for food security in the commission enjoys highest priority.</seg>
<seg>The commission will adopt a proposal for a regulation, that will form the framework for future health protection measures in the foodstuffs sector and by which the superordinate principles and goals of the food right is specified.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, Mr. Kommissar.</seg>
<seg>But now to our report: I evaluate the Commission proposal as positive and must say that the committee for Foreign Affairs, human rights, Common Security and defense policy as well as the Committee on Development and co-operation of our parliament an hard work to have carried out, in order to improve him after possibility, in particular in particular points, further.</seg>
<seg>How already our colleague mentioned Bonino expressly and clearly, with the proposal for Regulations of the commission a further step was done forward.</seg>
<seg>We consider the proposal for a regulation of the commission too vague.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary that the equipment for mine clearing operation is reasonably organized according to and that we research work financiers for detection and evacuation work, for instruments, which can be used locally easily and way, so that they bring straight in the developing countries assistance.</seg>
<seg>In the past eight years we made available more than 200 million euro from the community center stop for the fight against landmines.</seg>
<seg>We cannot punish however the population for their incapable government.</seg>
<seg>As I already said, it would be from my point of view meant good, but nevertheless counter productive and wrongly to make the entry to the convention from Ottawa to the obligatory and condition for the support of mine clearing actions, which can be fulfilled immediately, by the European Union.</seg>
<seg>I reject request for modification 19.</seg>
<seg>Secondly the international community must completely particularly improve the coordination on global level and in the countries in question.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! The social-democratic parliamentary group agrees the remarks of Mr. van Orden and is likewise proud on the role of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>We remember the Soviet toy bombs in Afghanistan!</seg>
<seg>Thank you for the excellent report.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, the mines call the Kambodschaner eternal guards.</seg>
<seg>In relation to university-formed forces humans have a justified distrust, which developed itself in long war years.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! I am pleased that there is finally an European legislation in form of a regulation over the anti-person mines and that us today an excellent report of Mrs. Bonino is present over this regulation.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Mr. Kommissar, my very much admired colleagues and colleagues! We have to do it today with a very sad topic.</seg>
<seg>Coincidentally the mines do not lie mainly in crisis zones, i.e. in areas, where differently constituted initiatives could be seized, in order to master these crises.</seg>
<seg>Into two kilometers distance of a Bosnian village refers in the year 1999 a sign the mine danger to a field, which does not prevent however that a small boy plays there.</seg>
<seg>It is tragic, if the civilian population under the inability of its leaders must suffer.</seg>
<seg>If you permit me, dear delegates, them in the name of our institution to be called welcome with you country special relationships in the context of our joint project for the setting up a zone of the prosperity, which maintains security and the peace in the Mediterranean area.</seg>
<seg>All mines are in depots.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! Since I agree with nearly everything, which my colleagues and colleague said before, I do not want to repeat that.</seg>
<seg>Their view of open co-operation is equivalent to a relapse into the institutional pattern dominated by commission officials.</seg>
<seg>We believe also in the Subsidiaritätsprinzip, in it that resolutions as close are possible seized to the concerning as.</seg>
<seg>Since however the substantial requests of the EVP parliamentary group could find just now a substantial majority, I had agreed the report.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! I contained with the vote over the results the informal European Council of Biarritz for two reasons of the voice: On the one hand, because I had opportunity to co-ordinate in particular on the numbers 2 and 5 separately and lend thus to my refusal in relation to both expression.</seg>
<seg>In other words, at the table of the common European home will some à la carte to feed, while others must be content with the unit menu.</seg>
<seg>And democratic control may not diminish. Nevertheless the priority problem of the European Union does not exist in enumerating these rights or their admission into the contracts in our view.</seg>
<seg>The instrument of the referenda and the relevant requests for modification to this report were already addressed.</seg>
<seg>With the choice to the European Parliament of 1999 the election turnout amounted to 40% only if one accounts for the countries with obligation to vote and those, which at the same time accomplished national elections with the European choice.</seg>
<seg>In order to achieve the desired objective of a European condition, it is not advisable to oktroyieren strict right figures and methods whose fatal consequences would be missing the desired objective.</seg>
<seg>A genuine social condition would have the most important achievements in favor of the working sphere, the women, to which migrants and the citizen upward adapt.</seg>
<seg>. (PT) I was not correct for although I do not agree upon it an laudable intention of the reinforcement, lighting and recess of the European Union as well as the simplification of the texts, which are necessary for their public-friendliness.</seg>
<seg>the authority distribution</seg>
<seg>In my opinion it is of crucial importance that the Charter of Fundamental in the European Union means a connection to the convention on human rights of the Council of Europe.</seg>
<seg>The report of the colleague Gil Robles comes me however to assistance, because it contains the proposal that some member states of the European Union within certain questions, sectors and ranges co-ordinate an joint action.</seg>
<seg>If on ever more major issues by qualified majority resolutions one decides, basic standards of the democracy are injured.</seg>
<seg>Today it tries to obstruct making intensified co-operation flexible and also here will be subject.</seg>
<seg>The present report is to make the appropriate point of view concrete of our parliament (resolution from 13 April 2000).</seg>
<seg>We face on the whole a so-called flexible co-operation positively.</seg>
<seg>The British labour members of the PSE parliamentary group welcome the agreement to its contribution for the work of the diplomatic conference on the problem of intensified co-operation, even if they do not agree with all details.</seg>
<seg>These island areas must feel as an active component of the European Union, which them, then I hope, into a Paradies for the tourists as also for the local population will transform.</seg>
<seg>In the Middle Ages these areas and their population did not belong to Europe, and also today they are not considered as really European.</seg>
<seg>Indeed make the characteristics of these regions, which generally from their island situation and their distance necessarily for the European mainland, in addition, from their chronic dependence on some few products or a single product to result, that for the overcoming of these obstacles suitable, special measures are met.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I please around apology, if I stop the presidency and the interpreters again thereby, to sound oneself my last explanation for vote and I would like in particular my solidarity with the translators of our vote explanations, in my case of the Italian Ornella Buson, to state.</seg>
<seg>From these texts it follows clearly that this agency aims at the restriction or paralysis of the national protection powers, in order to place it into the service of the commission goals.</seg>
<seg>This does not prevent the commission and the parliament however to call this institution “European Food” although this designation contradicts philosophy standing behind this mechanism perfectly.</seg>
<seg>This does not correspond exactly what us the report Bowis suggests, with which one the feeling has, which food security essentially regarded as a further pretext, by means of whose one the well-known process of strengthening of the powers of the Commission debited to the national body and safety of citizens to advance further would like.</seg>
<seg>Therefore consider I it attached, by this explanation in the name of our European parliament, which always entered these unbelievable acts for the attention of the freedom of religion and the tolerance between all religious communities, to condemn.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin! I understand would throw in the Berichterstatterin, but one does not only co-ordinate with the requests from the Committee for agriculture and Rural Development on money, but it is co-ordinated also on a particular direction.</seg>
<seg>I would like to also ask you to carry here that we the household line A-206, acquisition of real estate, accordingly to adapt, depending on which requests for modification are accepted, so that we do not exceed our own delimitation on 20% of all administrative costs.</seg>
<seg>Before the vote over proposed amendment 929</seg>
<seg>Single diagramme VI, economics and social committee</seg>
<seg>Report (A5-0276/2000) of Mr. Nicholson in the behalf of the Committee on Fisheries over the proposal for a regulation of the advice with additional technical measures to the refilling of the Kabeljaubestandes in the Irish Sea (ICES area VII a) (KOM (2000) 0190 - C5-0219/2000 - 2000/0071 (CNS))</seg>
<seg>(The parliament accepts the resolution request.)</seg>
<seg>The food surplus is brought by the export subsidies to the European Union to dumping prices on the world market, which leads again to serious competitive disadvantages e.g. for the foodstuffs industry in numerous developing countries.</seg>
<seg>In order to set sufficient financial means free for additional relief work on the Balkans, the member states the means from the existing household must umverteilen.</seg>
<seg>The parliament succeeded in nevertheless interspersing a number of important tasks - not least of all because of increased efforts in the fight against unemployment and poverty, numerous important environmental and equalization questions etc. we were correct against the attacks that rights to the LIFE program and the European Women 's lobby.</seg>
<seg>Which concerns the travel expenses reimbursement for the delegates of the European parliament, then we hold to our view that this may be paid only for the costs actually developed with official travel.</seg>
<seg>I go of it to out and I hope that the commission turns on appropriate solutions constructionally also - that we will fill the three years between 2002 and 2005 with a temporary agreement.</seg>
<seg>In order to give above all to the national parliaments a proper muzzle, the European Commission has a proposal for a directly obligatory regulation in the context of its adjustment and liberalisation rage, instead of already stepping a guideline submitted, which is to be whipped in a proper striking jerk procedure by the parliament and the Council of Ministers, in order on 31 December of this yearly into force.</seg>
<seg>We support thus the reform movement of the commission and reject the further preference of this sector.</seg>
<seg>Thus they came into strong dependence on raisings of credit.</seg>
<seg>Report Nicholson (A-0276/2000)</seg>
<seg>The misuse of means for military targets must be avoided.</seg>
<seg>We always held the opinion that the cost of the reducing emission are borne by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases primarily by the actual causers, i.e. by the large-scale industry, and debited to their superprofits to go to have.</seg>
<seg>Report Moreira there Silva (A5-0271/2000)</seg>
<seg>These funds should be used, as the expenditures for the research policy in all 15 member states of the European Union are co-ordinated and coordinated.</seg>
<seg>In order to meet for it precaution, it is correct to provide for us clarity over these substances.</seg>
<seg>Thus the vote hour is terminated.</seg>
<seg>It is to then step to the place now of the national format used already everywhere.</seg>
<seg>The balance of payments-doistic loss as consequence of this change is minimal.</seg>
<seg>They must imagine that by it primarily small and sized enterprises are affected.</seg>
<seg>We urge for years on a harmonization of the efforts.</seg>
<seg>I mean to actually integrate that this report is of central importance, in order the citizens and citizens, the small and medium-sized enterprises also into the euro area and to increase the acceptance of the economic and monetary union.</seg>
<seg>With free capital traffic with the common currency no obstacles or larger differences may exist.</seg>
<seg>Regardless of its European Parliament and the commission give large attention to that.</seg>
<seg>I support the double-railed procedure of the Berichterstatterin, with which she wants to arrange the hesitant banks to move.</seg>
<seg>We cannot force the banks to loss-pregnant business, but as politicians we know the request for modification of Mr. Radwan and Mrs. Peijs, whom they submitted for the PPE DE parliamentary group, support, where still before end next yearly measures seems and at the best also the existence of appropriate standards during introduction of the euro-coins and is demanded.</seg>
<seg>The request of the colleague Peijs and me aims also in the direction to unite the banks at a table not to make in order defaults but because we cannot increase the pressure evenly from the political side any longer.</seg>
<seg>If the completion of transnational transfers remains just as expensive as today, the reliability of the new coin and note system is questioned.</seg>
<seg>Our judgement represents this form of the collection of statistical informations over the internal union exchange a relic of the past, which is to be justified no more in an integrated, single area and the proper functioning of the domestic market impaired.</seg>
<seg>If I hear the contributions of some my colleagues in the committee, who belong to this house already longer than I, then I have the impression that the exercise with the multi-yearly program for enterprises and business initiative, to which the European Parliament undergoes now for the fourth time belongs into this category.</seg>
<seg>I thank you in advance for the support of my report.</seg>
<seg>If one withdraws oneself however on European level, then one must the regions again increases possibilities to give.</seg>
<seg>The KMU stands in the first place with job creation, both in qualitative and in quantitative regard, and plays in this way a key role for social cohesion and the spatial planning.</seg>
<seg>Through the careful study of the proposals and the vote with numerous interested parties it made a contribution for the clearer formulation of the program and its optimal preparation.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly we must strive for an additional European use.</seg>
<seg>From this it follows that small and medium-size enterprises well are only if unemployment is small and if the public budgets on all levels are free from debts and over sufficiently means order, in order to adjust these into the investment budget.</seg>
<seg>Enterprises need clarity.</seg>
<seg>Above all, if an one-man operation or an enterprise among 250 persons employed has a project, it is not only to be possible with Sicherstellungen of reason and ground with 120% - protection, but it should be also possible with an excellent idea to be financed.</seg>
<seg>The nation states and also the regional or local authorities already function as gigantic financial pumps, which are there in addition, the money of the taxpayers, i.e. from the majority of the population, also from the poorest ones to pump driven amounts to the large-scale enterprises and thus to the bags of their owners and shareholders.</seg>
<seg>The small and sized enterprises bring thousands of tender seedlings out, which serve the large-scale enterprises as seeds for human work strength and ideas.</seg>
<seg>I would like that the Mr. Kommissar worries in connection with all measures suggested here with priority about the fact that a lighter and a fast entrance to assistance and information are created, so that those, which lead these enterprises, are able, for using these information effectively.</seg>
<seg>They all will find their place in the multi-yearly program.</seg>
<seg>Finally I welcome also the idea that we meet once in the year, in order to draw balance over the implementation of the programme.</seg>
<seg>The recent actions against the Greek minority in Himare order still seriously, measures for democratization, to strengthening of the institutions and to protection of human in Albania.</seg>
<seg>A substantial number of Albanians leaves its homeland because of the uncertainty in their country, because of the social difficulties, because of the prämodernen society and family structures.</seg>
<seg>We need particularly on Albania cut preventive measures, which represent an assistance with the structure and/or reconstruction of the country, in order to make such a human being-worthy life possible in the region.</seg>
<seg>Thus the documents are pushed from an instance to the other one, and the European Commission refuses for example publishing the report, which concerns among other things also the Customs Assistance mission (CAM), compiled by the Albanians.</seg>
<seg>Let us the truth in the eye look.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Karamanou, mean congratulations on broad and comprehensive route ïhorizon your report.</seg>
<seg>It concerns one extremely major issue, which results from historical, social, political and economic conditions.</seg>
<seg>We will never experience the true number of the dead ones.</seg>
<seg>Common business creates peaceful connections.</seg>
<seg>Which however complete I find unakzeptabel at this report and on which I would like to refer to openly am that a cause and effect, i.e. illegal immigration with a procedure of the weighted visa distribution and the migration possibility are thus confounded. It turned around exactly!</seg>
<seg>The large institutional reforms derived from the contract from Amsterdam had effects on the treatment of problems of the refugee and immigration policy.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly and letztens the plan of action and its conversion must be regarded regionally.</seg>
<seg>But this request is naturally issued also to us to deal economically with European regimentations.</seg>
<seg>This strength of joint acting must be now particularly stressed straight.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore I plead for it that on changes of existing legislation of the EEC codified proposals are submitted, into which the changes at the existing directives or regulations am trained.</seg>
<seg>The Subsidiaritätsprinzip, correctly understood, points us into both directions: To meet decisions on the lowest possible level to see but that the lowest possible level can be every now and then one much high level, if it concerns general values, whose loss threatens, if they were not equally protected everywhere.</seg>
<seg>The report is an example for concise, clear wording, and I hope, which becomes colleagues and colleagues also with large Ernst the knowledge to take.</seg>
<seg>The report by the Committee for right and domestic market did not push members with its to enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg>Whereupon I was received in the report over the SLIM project, because us with reading out one has the legislation of the community Mr. Medina the article of the Treaty a straight sample given is with difficulty understandable even for specialists.</seg>
<seg>Therefore some aspects of the report in me cause little enthusiasm, because I would have wished myself more strongly “to community-end” report to one regarding the domestic market, and completely obviously the report is not filled of it straight.</seg>
<seg>For the institutions for European Union it is importantly that we have the strong commitment, quality of legislation, in particular with view of the Subsidiarität to improve.</seg>
<seg>The discussion is closed.</seg>
<seg>Continuing this condition could affect the attitude and the acceptance of the citizens negatively in relation to the euro.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! We prepared the report Karamanou with very large care in the Committee on Citizens and right of citizens, law and Home Affairs.</seg>
<seg>But when chairmen of the Committee on Fisheries I would like to use our oral question and this discussion, in order to speak both sides - our draft resolution addresses itself to both sides - some considerations, and I would like to do that with large consideration.</seg>
<seg>This is the demand of people of the Union, whom we represent here.</seg>
<seg>Much water flowed the Rhine down, that agreements ran out and was not replaced nevertheless.</seg>
<seg>I can understand the reasons of the Mr. Kommissars, but not those of the general manager.</seg>
<seg>We could say that we paid 11 months after the shutdown of our ships further for the previous agreement and for the previous of the previous.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! We one year ago, and the fact had a similar debate that it took one year, before negotiations are at all only taken up shows, how difficult it becomes to find fish existence for our extensive European Union fleets.</seg>
<seg>With the second agreement the state of affairs was clear.</seg>
<seg>But we must understand that everything is finite, also fishery resources!</seg>
<seg>From there I am to be gotten straight particularly interested in it that the parliamentary group of the EVP-ED did not out-do only to support the fishery agreements to defend and favour, but also decided to promote their expansion.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly the exploitation of the catch reason Sahara was continued since the suspension of the fishery agreement by Community fleets and others, which are subject neither to control by the commission nor by the member states: One speaks particularly of an important fleet from the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg>I quite understand that, because the fishery was a source of income and created jobs for one, based on European conditions, poor region.</seg>
<seg>A further aspect, to which I would like particularly to refer, is running out the limited aids for Fischer and Schiffseigner at the end of the month, who served as reconciliation for this one year's stop. This situation is intolerable, because everyone wants to nevertheless rather work than aids to refer.</seg>
<seg>I as Andalusian parliamentarians am about for one year, on the courses, in the offices to negotiate in the fishery committee and in the discussions with the Mr. Kommissar and suggest initiatives, so that the completely special characteristic of the Andalusian fishing fleet is considered, which accomplishes the catch enterprise in Morocco.</seg>
<seg>Spain positively developed the difficult neighbourhood, which gave it also again and again in history between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco, in a outstanding way.</seg>
<seg>As Spanish and Andalusian delegates demand I the right thousands Andalusian and Spanish families on receipt and protection of their jobs, which are endangered for nearly one year and which we must protect also from this parliament.</seg>
<seg>We come now to the vote.</seg>
<seg>One nearly twelve-year-old boy history full chancellery comfort, delaying tactics, hopes, also personal emergency, around placebos for the concerning, around the tough defense of old rights opposite citizens, who looked for nothing else as their good right.</seg>
<seg>As you know, the affair is extremely complex and concerns approximately 700 employees at 25 Italian universities.</seg>
<seg>If the Italian legal order is reformed and changed, as it was for the university personnel the case, the commission of our judgement cannot intervene, as long as each European citizen has the same entrance possibilities for all groups of careers.</seg>
<seg>Injustice consists of it that two humans perform equal work, side by side works, but to be differently paid and different conditions of work had.</seg>
<seg>At the worst one it is, thinks I, if one must make attentive to the fact that a court decision exists to its favour possibly only of some few reassuring words and is not for their further life actually of importance.</seg>
<seg>I expect an answer from the commission on the point the fact that it in accordance with the decision of the Court of Justice in the case Allué against article 48 (2) of the EEC contract offends, if the legislation of a member state the duration is limited to one year by work contracts by foreign language assistants in each case, with the possibility of the extension, while regarding other teachers such a delimitation does not exist in principle.</seg>
<seg>Now, in my opinion these affairs concern the actual core of the fundamental principles of the freedom, in particular the liberality connected with the European law, and from these principles there may not be exceptions.</seg>
<seg>We have, as also the today's debate shows, still a great many chains, a great many obstacles for this domestic market, not only in this case.</seg>
<seg>We come now to the vote.</seg>
<seg>(The president rules out of order to the speaker.)</seg>
<seg>In Kondolenzschreiben at Austrian Federals President Klestil and at Federal Chancellor dish I expressed the member and the entire Austrian people in the name of our house in this heavy hour our sympathy.</seg>
<seg>Are there in addition remarks?</seg>
<seg>I support the proposal of Mr. Ceyhun and would be very grateful, if the advice could communicate whether it actually intends to submit a fresh proposal in this affair.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, loves colleagues and colleagues! Our parliamentary group holds this event for so important that we mean that it was not treated appropriately in form of an urgency.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Barón Crespo, I has the impression that you follow, if I understood you correctly this reason.</seg>
<seg>, Some time ago we debated Mrs. Präsidentin in this house the sanctions opposite Iraq.</seg>
<seg>It is absolutely necessary that we would drive a discussion still before conversion of the announced changes through the British authorities for this, and the commission must express itself clearly to the legal provisions in this question.</seg>
<seg>(A5-0314/2000) of Mrs. Roure in the behalf of the Committee for the freedoms and right of citizens, law and Home Affairs over initiative of the French republic regarding the conclusion of a Convention on improving of the legal aid in criminal actions, in particular within the range of the fight of of the organized crime, washing the yields from criminal offences as well as the financial crime (10213/2000 - C5-0394/2000 - 2000/0815 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg>Concrete steps must follow the declarations of intent, so that determines the yields from criminal offences, to be frozen, seized and drawn in.</seg>
<seg>The creation of Europe of the freedom, security and the right may not remain in the hands of a specialized mechanism under exclusive control of the national governments.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand article 8 of draft convention limits the reasons for the refusal of the legal aid, to which an asked member state can appoint itself, to the essential interests.</seg>
<seg>First I would like to congratulate Mr. Marinho to its work and point out that with the efforts around the fight of the white-collar crime support, in addition, caution are required.</seg>
<seg>If terrorists and weapon or drug dealers operate money laundering, that must be uncovered, pursued and punished naturally!</seg>
<seg>Our task is it to seek out the yields from the organized crime to determine to freeze, to seize and draw in.</seg>
<seg>In order these points goes it in the requests for modification, and by the discussion in the committee to judge, I am very confident that the parliament is correct for it.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me that this catalog points from initiatives into a direction, which makes the protection intended in article 6 of European Convention for the protection of the human rights and basic freedoms possibly destroyed.</seg>
<seg>In reality the things do not lie however so simply.</seg>
<seg>Finally the EVP parliamentary group supports the compromise request for modification over the activity of the attorneys, at which we arrived with Mrs. Roure.</seg>
<seg>The second measure, the second instrument is the harmonization.</seg>
<seg>That is an Portuguese initiative, to which already several previous speakers expressed themselves praising.</seg>
<seg>And in such a way also the goal of the joint meeting of the advice “law and inside” read and the ECOFIN advice on 17 October of this yearly.</seg>
<seg>The best form for a stabilization of parliamentary and justitiellen control of EURO POLE is the complete integration of the euro pole convention in the right frameworks of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>A step into the right direction, which aims at the European Parliament for a long time, is the creation of an provisional unit to justitiellen co-operation.</seg>
<seg>Of it the sense of the warranties consists, i.e. in the development of this aspect of the freedoms.</seg>
<seg>And the European Parliament is the supranational joint instance, which specifies these relations. With my contribution I would like to request you to profess themselves to the bases of these relations and our Berichterstatterin your agreement give.</seg>
<seg>Only if clarity over the institutional model and the rules exist for the future European right area, the citizens and citizen and the European Parliament to the individual measures suggested by the advice will be able themselves to express.</seg>
<seg>Therefore EUROJUST a logical part of the efforts, the citizens is by the fight of the heavy organized crime an area of freedom to offer to security and the right as well as an high level at security.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Mr. Kommissar, admired colleagues and colleagues! One can congratulate the Mrs. Abgeordnete Gebhardt only to its excellent report, which she submits in execution of a resolution seized by the advice in Tampere.</seg>
<seg>One speaks however as with EUROJUST of coordination on the level of the national public prosecutor's offices and judges, in order to fight all forms of serious crime - and I am correct there the beginning of the Berichterstatterin too, - then explains an extension of the concept: it concerns here no longer only co-operation with purely transnational crimes, but it concerns co-operation to the fight of criminal acts.</seg>
<seg>We will already have opportunity starting from 1 January 2001 to engage us in this provisional unit to justitiellen co-operation. But the commission intends to give the discussion over the appearance of the final EUROJUST place upswing.</seg>
<seg>It was referred by all sides honestly position - I mean -, without purging however into rigid front positions.</seg>
<seg>The problems in connection with the expenditures were not too causing concern for the fishery committee; other ranges are from larger interest.</seg>
<seg>It is not acceptable really that we cannot no clear targets have and the results measure. That gives it in no other mechanism.</seg>
<seg>Second point: In the range of the hierarchy with the instruction power it here too actually came unakzeptablen overlaps, Mr. Kommissar.</seg>
<seg>I would like to make clear with the fact that the program played a positive role with some questions.</seg>
<seg>It is obvious that this work does not lead automatically within consortia to a duality regarding the joint financial responsibility. The problem is more complex.</seg>
<seg>We thus really supported to back-get these 3.4 million and one can say that to more than 90% succeeded to us.</seg>
<seg>Are there objections?</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, Ladies and Gentlemen! After work of nine months and long struggle for a consent now the Charter of the European fundamental rights in the draft is present.</seg>
<seg>I hope the fact that this parliament, even if it says today only to this fundamental right Charter, into which next weeks will not let a doubt about it arise that it of the advice the legally binding effect of this Charter required and that this Charter must open humans also an entrance to the European Court.</seg>
<seg>This position agrees as well known with that of the heads of state and government on the European Council meeting in Biarritz, which approved of the Charter unanimously and unreservedly. I can only request you from there in the behalf of the Council to follow this position by stating some reasons for it to you.</seg>
<seg>Above all however the Charter becomes after my conviction by their contentwise weight one - as I would like to say - epochale meaning to attain.</seg>
<seg>The European trade union federation for his part has itself over - how it calls it - presence of gaps weights, as for example the absence of a reference to the right to a minimum income.</seg>
<seg>Independently of it several personalities, and in particular some members of the European parliament, suggested taking up an explicit reference on the fundamental right Charter to article 6 of the Treaty of Union which already contains a reference to European convention on human rights.</seg>
<seg>Our parliamentary group agrees with exception of the British delegation of the Charter unanimously.</seg>
<seg>We enter as European People together and unanimously for the fact that the fundamental right Charter is taken up as soon as possible to the contracts, so that it unfolds also direct validity in law for humans in the European Union.</seg>
<seg>They showed us that one can approach the European issues in a new and exemplary kind, which is superior due to their democratically open and transparent function and the possibility of the citizens' participation of the form of the diplomatic conference.</seg>
<seg>The right to health, to social security, on dwelling or on a minimum income are missing completely or are referred into the range of the solidarity.</seg>
<seg>Fourth: The Charter - and that is particularly important for me - proceeds from the indivisibility of the civil and political human rights and social rights.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, Mr. acting Council President, rates colleagues and colleagues! In my opinion this Charter is only the x-Te demonstration of capacity of the Union produce meaning-meaning texts and declarations of intent again and again.</seg>
<seg>The representative of the Court of Justice already gave to recognize that one could be inspired from the Charter, and the representative of the Commission in the convention in Turin attaches legal meaning to the document.</seg>
<seg>To the time of the market thereby perhaps finally the hour of Europe of the rights came. The term of the citizenry is in the European Union a relatively new term.</seg>
<seg>The Charter is indeed drawn up like a text, which can exhibit legally binding effect.</seg>
<seg>With pride I can also state that a representative of my parliament parliamentary group in my homeland, Mr. Gunnar Jansson, played a very important role with the development of this Charter.</seg>
<seg>How I said already last night, and I do this today again, exist in this regard union far still too many lack. Thus we succeed in our effort around justitielle and police co-operation not always, determined side effects of the crime prevention switch off and prevent that innocent ones become thereby passive victims.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, the draft resolution of the European parliament to the fundamental right Charter is based on the same ambiguity as the work of the committee.</seg>
<seg>The Italian Constitution plans for example the border of the morality, and convention on human rights the border of the rights of others and/or the public order.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! During the today's vote at 12 o'clock we lock a process, which began 1984, when this parliament accepted the draft Treaty over the European Union, during which a declaration of rights was already demanded, and which 1989 with the resolution De Gucht were resumed.</seg>
<seg>The Charter will have consequences whether it is embodied in the contract or not.</seg>
<seg>That is to be welcomed and not, like Mr. bonding to think seems to fear.</seg>
<seg>Obviously the bending century, with all its fights for the freeing of the disadvantaged social classes, elapsed useless and us nothing taught.</seg>
<seg>The Charter closes a gap in the EEC right and strengthens the protection of the particular in relation to the European police, opposite the authorities, which fight frauds, as well as the competition regulators.</seg>
<seg>, I cannot understand the refusal however, which is justified with the incompleteness of the Charter.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I can continue, where Mr. Gahrton stopped.</seg>
<seg>Permit me a third side remark to the rights of citizens of third countries.</seg>
<seg>The Council of Europe gained wealths of experience with such forms of the monitoring beside the Court of Human also, on which we can develop.</seg>
<seg>In view of the text of the Charter, to which we will give today our agreement - as I hope, with vast majority -, are obvious it that we will achieve more and a fundamental right protection more up-to-date with our Charter, than the entry to European convention on human rights would have furnished it.</seg>
<seg>Therefore it is valid to in front-walk further.</seg>
<seg>I believe that we must pursue this goal, if we want to reach the necessary support for the Charter by the citizens of Europe.</seg>
<seg>After its acceptance by this parliament the fundamental right Charter will serve me as analysis pattern for this report, and so far it my personal intellectual possibilities and me provided the human resources it to permit, I become one to rights and countries subdivided analysis of the adherence to the Charter in the fifteen Member States of the Union make.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Mr. Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen delegates! The commission would like to follow first the words of president Moscovici and to appreciate the major contribution of the members of the European parliament to the debate in the convention and in particular the role of Mr. Mendes de Vigo, whom it played in the Presidium of the Convention during the elaboration of the fundamental right Charter.</seg>
<seg>I would like to deal only with some the most salient points this debate.</seg>
<seg>The convention fixed fundamental rights, itself from the individual right instruments of the Council of Europe, which result in contracts and the constitutions of the Member.</seg>
<seg>After the agenda the joint debate follows over the following two reports:</seg>
<seg>With the current state of the things our parliament has to make also clear for Turkish people that there are at present at least three preconditions for its entry.</seg>
<seg>Such conditions besides alone by resolution of the parliament have been placed could not.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I took the suggestions made by Mr. Morillon to the conditions for the accession of Turkey to the knowledge, the considerable interest to earn.</seg>
<seg>I am to be able to say happy that the Turkish government recognized in the meantime this entry partnership as basis for further co-operation, so that we can have an entitled hope to reach exactly that what we wanted to reach, i.e. with our politics the reform forces in Turkey to help, the reform process fresh impetus to lend and it regarding the membership desired in the European Union to advance.</seg>
<seg>For me most important ones is that after Helsinki in the Turkey, in which Turkish public a debate was released over the conditions of an entry of Turkey to the European Union a debate, which supports and demands the reform forces of the country.</seg>
<seg>This text is present you to the statement.</seg>
<seg>Now it concerns to give an necessary impetus for an future accession.</seg>
<seg>I became nevertheless - I white not, as the vote goes out - which urgently asks Turkey to take also this question seriously.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes the European Parliament for the admission and care of relations with the political parties, the NRO and the press to begin actively and strives for an improvement of their difficult and strained relationship for large national assembly.</seg>
<seg>Colleague Morillon, your report is in my opinion expressed realistic and responsible.</seg>
<seg>On the occasion of your visit in Turkey in March you called the problem of the Kurdish population, just as today, at least still with names.</seg>
<seg>It witnesses at the same time from large naivety and large presumption to assume that the Europeans could induce the Turks to one - I quote - “radical changes in their habits and its mentality”.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, rates colleagues and colleagues! The present report fulfills me with major concern.</seg>
<seg>Recommendation (A5-0325/2000) of Mr. Duff and Mr. Voggenhuber in the behalf of the Committee for constitutional questions regarding the approval of the draft Charter of the fundamental rights of the European Union (4487/1/00 - C5-0570/2000 - 2000/2233 (AVC))</seg>
<seg>In any case we must at the next opportunities, at which we discuss the power of the data processing, make ourselves conscious that a closer is necessary and thus the citizen more legal security offering control.</seg>
<seg>Recommendation Duff/Voggenhuber (A5-0325/2000)</seg>
<seg>We would like to put the following points out:</seg>
<seg>The rights contained in the Charter are already embodied in the national constitutions and by the national parliaments are defended, which stand for the peoples and their cultures close.</seg>
<seg>1, which plans: “Collective classifications are fixed illegally”, that this prohibition in times of war or in cases of serious cases of disorder can be exposed to the public order. In article 52 exp.</seg>
<seg>We will give an brief explanation in the following to these three reasons in this order.</seg>
<seg>The right of a government to the arbitrary repeal of its own condition is characteristic for a tyranny.</seg>
<seg>But today we have every reason, as I to repeat would like, to be proud on it as we mastered this important stage for Europe.</seg>
<seg>A society, which knows only rights, not however obligations, becomes an egoistic society.</seg>
<seg>Whereupon our fight is with priority arranged, so that the announced fundamental rights are made concrete over the political decisions.</seg>
<seg>The Convention method is very interesting and efficient for the development of a basis text, which requires a broad consensus, but justifies in no way to withdraw from the European Parliament as agency of European people the possibility for the change and addition of the text.</seg>
<seg>This Charter must be improved, and our parliament must suggest a strategy to its actualization and enrichment.</seg>
<seg>Therefore it should not be decided and proclaimed on the council meeting in Nice, but of the summit the impact for an European debate should be given over the Charter.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately the tendency seems to predominate to follow the path of reason to accept i.e. a Charter with a purely political and not obligatory range of application at the national governments.</seg>
<seg>Designation by the summit of Cologne as a “committee”, this proclaimed itself to the “convention”, a term, which reminds in fatal way of 1793 and the excrescences of the French revolution in form of the terror, which can be answered for from another convention to.</seg>
<seg>The applied procedure, made exclusions and the ambiguity regarding the character of this text throw however a clear light on the new totalitarian beginnings, which are present already in the core of the European process of integration.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately the European Parliament within this range up to the full application of the Amsterdamer of contract has only a konsultative function, but it finds means and ways to use these in such a way that right decisions are retarded.</seg>
<seg>The views over the way however go apart.</seg>
<seg>That was one century ago like that, and after it had been pushed something into the background, it moved now again completely into the foreground.</seg>
<seg>Which we want in no case, those are possibilities, which permit it offenders to arrive by the back door at the domestic market.</seg>
<seg>We affirm likewise the establishment of a future cooperation office for the support of the fight of the organized crime and the money laundering as well as the different suggested measures for the reaching of these goals.</seg>
<seg>That is, an provisional unit of the justitiellen co-operation is furnished, which consists of one representative each of the public prosecutor's office, judge and/or police officer with staatsanwaltschaftlichen powers of our 15 member states.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! As a member of the mixed parliamentary committee European Union Turkey I am concerned intensively with the entry perspective of Turkey.</seg>
<seg>Also the behavior of Turkey on Cyprus is unacceptable.</seg>
<seg>We support however the critical objection of the correspondent over the absence of an effective evaluation of the granting of credit by the EIB and the lack of transparency and appropriate public control of the activities of the bank.</seg>
<seg>Despite its variability and is Turkey was integral part of European reality.</seg>
<seg>The admission of Turkey into the European Union became a question, which today more up-to-date ever is.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Morillon says, Turkey is to give itself trouble not to regard the European Union as exclusive Christian club that her, which wants to exclude Turkey.</seg>
<seg>Turkey will then genuine democratic state to become, if it with their past to live learned to have will, just as it created the democratic Germany, of which we required the same, to live with its past.</seg>
<seg>As soon as the government in Ankara understood that the status is not acceptable quo for Europe and the rest of the world, major steps will be possible. The island could be reunited and a comprehensive, a fair, a permanent and international law appropriate solution be found.</seg>
<seg>Why all aren't these questions in the report of the European Commission mentioned?</seg>
<seg>In this balanced framework we must continue our working decided to the promotion of the approach between the union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg>If you treat the Armenian question in connection with the EU accession - consider please, what I say: the Armenian question in connection with the EU accession -, then will not start the project, about which we spoke today, is so simply that.</seg>
<seg>For this reason we exerted ourselves also so much for it that after the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process a result is drawn, so that we are in Marseille in the situation, to specify necessary orientations.</seg>
<seg>But we succeeded in maintaining the dialogue and also sensitive issues such as stability, terrorism, emigration, to address human rights.</seg>
<seg>Independently of it the advice was endeavored to make in particular since 1995 for the Mediterranean area more extensive means available which are appropriate for the objectives of the partnership.</seg>
<seg>This is indeed one extraordinary key issue, and I would like to say also as someone, which comes from Central Europe.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, as you know, gives it in English a phrase, to that-according to a show without star like a Hamlet performance without the first Totengräber is.</seg>
<seg>We are thereby around the connection from Politiken to domestic market questions and a consent to the introduction of the origin cumulation at the time of simultaneous conclusion of subregionalen free trade agreements between all partners and the assumption of harmonized minutes over the origin cumulation.</seg>
<seg>We have likewise the intention of the Commission lend to the Barcelona process fresh impetus with satisfaction to the knowledge taken.</seg>
<seg>I emphasized these aspects, because the key for the revival of the process is to be searched here and in addition the political agenda must be supplemented of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg>Therefore our major task must be the guarantee of the peace and the security of the European Union in the Mediterranean area, and we must do all standing in our forces, with it this co-operation are interspersed and the assured means on the basis to say we - to egoistic generosity of the European Union to be efficiently used.</seg>
<seg>These are important and concrete questions, which I would like to place, and I thank Mr. Brok, who made directly this debate before the appropriate consultation for the presidency and the commission possible over these topics.</seg>
<seg>Die Welt approaches to a in the meantime inexorable globalization, and in such a scenario an organization is necessary in large blocks acting on the enormous field of international competition as main participants.</seg>
<seg>It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries of the 4.7 billion euro in the MEDA I-program, which ran out 1999 called only scarcely a quarter up.</seg>
<seg>Therefore the Commission proposal to an fresh impetus is positive, and we agree completely the priorities, which Mr. Patten in its speech contributions called and affirmed this afternoon here.</seg>
<seg>This is an alert for the European Union to play a by far more active role in the Mediterranean area which enriched and strengthened our European continent historically and culturally.</seg>
<seg>But more badly still it is that at the same time, since we exchange most different points of view in this house occasionally essentially ever more Palestinian is killed.</seg>
<seg>Aid for reconstruction</seg>
<seg>If we should not contribute the means for the conversion of this regulation in December however, then we thresh today empty straw.</seg>
<seg>We however may want and our eyes not before the role, which they played thereby, do not lock, and the member states do not do that hopefully also.</seg>
<seg>The mass media in that region were often responsible for the there tragedy; media are used, which act completely freely according to the rules valid in our democracies.</seg>
<seg>A happy man am I also, because the parliament, as I mean, succeeded with persistent pressure, a condition, which could not be originally called straight favorable to turn to the better one.</seg>
<seg>Again: Useless expenditure for unnecessary meetings must be really avoided.</seg>
<seg>We may not however only direct our view toward Kosovo.</seg>
<seg>Also circumstance that some programs of the performance so called reserve, to which “power-related reserve”, was assigned is unfortunaty.</seg>
<seg>In Feira it awarded at the stabilization and association process the participating countries the status as potenzielle applicants for the entry.</seg>
<seg>I refer again to the hauptsächlichsten objectives of the CARDS program: institutional stabilization in the sense of the democracy and the constitutional state, economic development and reconstruction as well as regional co-operation.</seg>
<seg>It was correct that the European Union positively reacted to the seizure of power by president Kostunica.</seg>
<seg>A first consultation took place on 6 November.</seg>
<seg>Which initiative in the sense of the demand of the European parliament in its resolution of 16. March 2000 intends to seize the advice presidency, in order to play a more active role, so that the full and complete conversion of the discord plan is ensured?</seg>
<seg>How can this revival without the regulation of this conflict take place?</seg>
<seg>I can to the fact would only drive out that France and Germany - and I speak no more than Council President here - addressed these questions on a bilateral summit last week in Vittel and decided the formation of a working group for the solution of this problem.</seg>
<seg>At the same time the union grants further extensive assistance to these two countries over its different programs, in particular TACIS.</seg>
<seg>The presidency would like to take the question of the Mr. Abgeordneten to the cause to eliminate some ambiguity.</seg>
<seg>Let me for the sake of the accuracy still add: The request of both texts is it to strengthen the criminal framework for the fight of the organized tractor gangs.</seg>
<seg>In the report, which the Turkish Council of Ministers adopted on 21 September this yearly as reform program, the law changes are contained the section concerned several projects in: Admission from measures to the reinforcement of the effective equalization of men and women within the socialeducational range into the civil code; stronger fight against violence in the family; improves condemnation of these acts of violence by installation of special family judges as well as prohibition of the possibility of a punishing deduction with crimes for reasons of the honour injury.</seg>
<seg>The presidency has to give thus for this no answer.</seg>
<seg>Next week will take place in France on my invitation a conference of the European conference, i.e. with the entry countries.</seg>
<seg>Do you that the model Austria, i.e. bilateral majority resolutions will be to past seize in the future an instrument, believe in order at the European institutions resolutions and to create a new institution and/or a new group here, in order to be able to go around the unanimity in the advice?</seg>
<seg>The advice was not concerned with this letter, but the presidency answered naturally Mr. Cem. The wording of this answer was conveyed to all member states.</seg>
<seg>And which it holds in all other respects from the statement of Mr. Cem - whereupon the acting council chairperson, did not answer Mr. Moscovici, -, according to its opinion cannot the Cyprus question with the further treatment of the entry partnership between Turkey and the European Union not be considered?</seg>
<seg>One must know that the fishery agreement with Morocco is far more than a simple agreement over fishing and that, should the present agreement not come, as he knows a degradation of the relations between the European Union and Morocco could be forthcoming.</seg>
<seg>Therefore must I mean skepticism to express, what concerns the result.</seg>
<seg>Regarding the implementation of the principle of the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal actions in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council by Tampere it is to be marked that thereby the stabilization is co-operation between the member states, in addition, the protection of the individual rights to be made possible.</seg>
<seg>The auxiliary questions must be placed by other delegates.</seg>
<seg>In all other respects the commission in on 4 October the adopted report announces 2000 over the oil supply of the European Union the fact that it will submit a plan for energy conservation and the diversification of the sources of energy to the European Council of Göteborg, which to it is to contribute the energy efficiency, particularly in buildings and in the traffic to strengthen.</seg>
<seg>In this spirit we addressed an appeal on the occasion of the vote over the resolution to the embargo in the context of the third committee of the general assembly of the United Nations on 9 November to the Cuban authorities to co-operate without reservation with the international human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg>It is thus thing of NATO to take the precautions which necessary it considers, so that such incidents do not repeat themselves.</seg>
<seg>(The meeting is interrupted around 18.55 and taken up at 21.00 o'clock again.)</seg>
<seg>If one gives money, it is now once the privilege of that, which gives the money to define the political objectives completely clearly and the commissioner did that again and again.</seg>
<seg>Its visit can an indication set and to the overall policy, which we pursue, a perspective lend.</seg>
<seg>If we see in it a region, in which political arguments are quite possible, are we mistaken.</seg>
<seg>And the second demand, which is raised from the two correspondents and by us all be supported must, concerns the regular consultation and the information of the European parliament.</seg>
<seg>The heads of government underlined besides the determination of the union to reduction this process by technical and economical assistance.</seg>
<seg>It was the parliament, which supported the Commission proposal to the creation of an European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg>As the house knows, we do not consider an appropriate explicit reference in the regulation necessary.</seg>
<seg>The vote takes place tomorrow at 11.30 o'clock.</seg>
<seg>For co-operation the participants an extended and updated framework, which forms the work programme for the coming decade, agreed upon Asia Europe 2000.</seg>
<seg>I think that in Europe of it reminds us, which meaning we for Asia have, not only regarding economics and trade. Although here to the fact it should be referred that Asia has to owe among other things the reorganization of its economic situation to the fact that we held word and our markets stood for Asian exports also in the last two years openly.</seg>
<seg>I believe that was a very good political commitment, but we have there still some problems.</seg>
<seg>As well known the commission takes ASEM extremely seriously, and we support the commission in this connection also completely.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to improve the existing mechanisms for the conversion to the Community law in order to increase the legal security and to overcome the present sluggish speed.</seg>
<seg>Therefore it should the creation of new regional organisations promote and begin, where there is already a presence of the community, as in the western and southern Pacific.</seg>
<seg>That is the condition for a truthfully lasting fishery economy.</seg>
<seg>I believe that the future of fishing in international waters depends on these organizations and all efforts of the Commission, Mr. Kommissar, are still too small. In order to defend the attitude of the UN, both in the convention of 1982 and in mentioned the here from New York, we must have active presence in these organizations one much to favour of a responsible fishery.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I mean also that a particularly important role comes to the commission here. She should request Fischer to co-operation and suggest solutions, which we all can agree.</seg>
<seg>Beyond that the commission has to take over also each quantity of tasks in connection with negotiations, which must be led in the context of the regional fishery organizations.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I has the same problem as Mr. Nicholson, only many more acutely.</seg>
<seg>So far thus the proposals for solution of the agriculture committee.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes we even already asked ourselves, to what extent perhaps the cyclic sales crisis is released by the speculation of the firm's structures mentioned, which secure themselves control of the sector in this way depending upon their interests.</seg>
<seg>The additional European Union aid, which is suggested in the report Garot, is in my opinion senseless in a time, in which with the agenda 2000 and the forthcoming enlargement with central and Eastern Europe the agricultural policy reform stands on the agenda.</seg>
<seg>I almost regard it as a gloss achievement, which the correspondent put down here, which shows, what one with administration make can, if one pursues a certain objective, and those is here clearly given.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand the largest producers and/or those, which are integrated with stored enterprises, would keep themselves far by this instrument and the systems the preference/advantage would give, which they already have: individual saving, bankers' loan, balance cash.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Mr. Kommissar, my very much honoured ladies and gentlemen! Let me directly in front say that I welcome in principle the Commission proposal furnish an equalization fund also in the sense of the Austrian agriculture.</seg>
<seg>I would like to thank the correspondent for its report.</seg>
<seg>After hearing one wants market regulations for intensive animal husbandry and a dismantling of the agricultural policy, if it is dependent on the ground, production dependent on the ground.</seg>
<seg>The pig market regulations give it, and we should not make the error to place the existing pig market regulations, which function in principle, in question.</seg>
<seg>After Commission belief it the farmers, who join the equalization fund to subject also to a discipline, is justified, only because these get as return a certain income warranty, while others, which do not join, do not get this income warranty.</seg>
<seg>(The meeting is closed at 23.10 o'clock.)</seg>
<seg>The incomes which are based on the value added tax constitute 36% and traditional own resources 15% of the total amount.</seg>
<seg>A further element of the reform, which corresponds to a prioritären range pointed out by the yard to a large extent, concerns the increased value of the result and success measurement within a system of the resources assignment in accordance with condition of given priorities and clearly defined, measurable goals.</seg>
<seg>That is well like that, and I would like me with you, Mr. Karlsson, whom members of the Court of Auditors very cordially and also the services of the Court of Auditors it thanks you that you support the reform of the Commission in such a way with your report.</seg>
<seg>I hope now much that this proposal on the diplomatic conference is put in Nice not simply ad acta or turned under the carpet, but that one argues seriously with it.</seg>
<seg>The reality, as it in the annual report is described, is rather sobering up.</seg>
<seg>The number of the arisen errors is too high, that such a guarantee could be taken over.</seg>
<seg>The amount for high and foundation engineering works was too low set around 240 millions.</seg>
<seg>I could imagine the report by the Court of Auditors also somewhat more user-friendly, supplemental by clear recommendations, e.g. or two per chapter.</seg>
<seg>1995 were decided a Convention on the Protection of the financial interests of the Communities.</seg>
<seg>The commission and the member states should regard it in this light and use the results of the report as instrument to the improving administration of the financial means of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>It is conscious to me that this report and the work of the parliament will contribute in the context of the lining up discharge procedure for larger watchfulness regarding the expenditures for community.</seg>
<seg>And now, Mrs. Präsidentin, I would be silent gladly and for it would wait that someone comes from the advice to us.</seg>
<seg>The Court of Auditors did not give exact data concerning just like in the past years where now the descriptive errors arose.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin! The extension of the European Union is approaching, and in the report by the Court of Auditors it is clarified that also in the applicant countries still another quantity is to be done.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, loves colleagues and colleagues! We met recently a convention with the Court of Auditors, with which it concerned whether we can already before completely receive advance informations from the yard report for the secret Kämmerchen, and us also united on the fact that we actually retain over it silence.</seg>
<seg>Also I would like to contact the advice and ask the question, why the decision over article 24 of the budgetary regulation is still pending.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps somewhat healthy human understanding from the European Union can contribute its rightful place in history to the solution to the problem and George Bush provide, i.e. in the garbage basket!</seg>
<seg>It is not our task to make scapegoats neither in our institutions, nor in our states.</seg>
<seg>. (EN) I am pleased about the fact that the members of the parliament of the view are that the situation was more satisfying regarding the procedure for the presentation of the Annual in the parliament and in the committee for household control as in the previous years.</seg>
<seg>We will have however opportunity to speak about all points.</seg>
<seg>If it is relevant from the point of view of the examiner, we call all facts, which must be called.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and Gentlemen delegates! As you might have noticed, the last part of the speech contribution of the Mr. President of the Court of Auditors was impaired by a fatal virus, which in-crept in its contribution and this high house.</seg>
<seg>Some requests for modification such as No. 1 and 18 stand with questions in connection, which concern above all Great Britain, and it must be noticed that all representative of Great Britain, from the Socialist Groups, who became people's party and the Greens, her with large Vehemenz to have defended, and her in the environmental committee accepted.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! We accepted this yearly the guideline over aerial ropeways for the passenger traffic in March.</seg>
<seg>We are the opinion that in these cases the trade may not be loaded with the manufacturer obligations of the product safety law.</seg>
<seg>We heard the reasons for these requests and for the resumption of the arguments of the industry, which were stated in the committee.</seg>
<seg>It should be sufficient, if the salesman can give and these to the buyer general informations over the products to the lacks of information and documents refers.</seg>
<seg>Finally a still small request to the European Commission to article 4 concerning the European standards and the question whether these must be published.</seg>
<seg>The exceptions valid for sales mechanisms of charity organizations and non-profit mechanisms as well as the special arrangements for on markets or from the trunk sold secondhand merchandises are welcomed by me.</seg>
<seg>Reliability of product security and the customer service increase the value of the European label into special difficult and moment pointing the way.</seg>
<seg>If we request the commission in other place to submit in the near future a proposal to the security of services then it is not to be seen why we are to regulate and want the aspects of the services here now with, instead of waiting for the Commission proposal. Because it appears already that demarcation difficulties between the individual rules will arise and that juridical insecurity in the course of the time will increase.</seg>
<seg>I would like to describe the emphasis of this proposal briefly.</seg>
<seg>We make now also the opening possible of the system for third countries, in particular for the candidate countries: We simplified the procedures for the execution of immediate measures on community level, so that we after the recommendation of a regulation committee to become immediately active to be able.</seg>
<seg>No substantial additional responsibility is imposed upon by this new regulation to these shops.</seg>
<seg>The proposal in request for modification 11 replace the word “manufacturer” by “Dienstleistungserbringer” would create no clarity, but would donate rather confusion, since the guideline does not contain a definition for the term “Dienstleistungserbringer”.</seg>
<seg>The commission endorsed the rapid establishment of such a net, but must be co-ordinated this still between the member states.</seg>
<seg>Such a certification can be consulted as proof, it offers however no hundred percent security.</seg>
<seg>I described in detail now, why the commission rejects the requests for modification 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 to 30, 32, 33, 36 to 34 and a part of the request for modification 7, as well as the second part of the request for modification 21 and the first part of the request for modification 27 and 34. The commission approves of however the requests for modification 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31 and 35 as well as a part of the request for modification 7, the first part of request for modification 21 and the second part of the requests for modification 27 and 34, since the present proposal of the commission is improved by these requests for modification and more clarity receives.</seg>
<seg>Obviously one may not belong to the parliamentary group of the social-democratic party of Europe in opinion of Mr. Crespo as an Italian socialist.</seg>
<seg>In my view no contradiction exists between request for modification 12 and request for modification 37.</seg>
<seg>Regarding the order I leave the decision to the president, whereby I remind however of the fact that I am in each case against all three requests for modification.</seg>
<seg>Those the European Union of not belonging Mediterranean countries have to certainly fight regarding the economic development with particularly serious problems. Due to regional disparities tensions there constantly prevail.</seg>
<seg>Which concerns the respect for the dignity of the legal immigrants, then also instruments must be created to the financial support all that young person in the sense of a harmonized European Zuwanderungspolitik beside suitable right instruments for the Sicherstellung of a fair treatment of these immigrants, who wants to return to completing a technical or a higher education in the European countries to its country of origin, in order to take up a professional activity there.</seg>
<seg>I would like to emphasize a factor, which really determining I in this question considered: the missing equality on the job market.</seg>
<seg>. (PT) Late, but nevertheless still the commission submitted now the program for the support of the framework strategy of the community for the equalization of women and men (20012005), which differs from previous programmes and particularly from the end of this yearly running out 4th master programs remarkably.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand some improvement suggestions of my parliamentary group were considered. On the other hand studies were demanded, which with the situation of women in the national labors and the insufficient entrance to the insurance systems deal, for which we need statistics with expressive, sex-referred data.</seg>
<seg>. (EN) My party has grave reservations in relation to the application of the Community law to the sale of consumer goods in place of the application of the concept of the mutual recognition of standards.</seg>
<seg>Now one understands it, and the changes brought in by labour offer the warranty that the loading remains untouched by charity organizations and is exceptional from the guideline.</seg>
<seg>Request for modification 15 finally leaves to the commission free hand during the language regulation in the agency, which represents our judgement one much worrying development.</seg>
<seg>The simplification of the adoption of resolutions procedure, the mechanism of decentralized employment centers (not only in Pristina, which would equal its separation of Yugoslavia) and the solution to the problem of the double structure with board of directors and administrative committee could as positive actions toward the recovery of the substantial administrative lack within the European Agency for Reconstruction prove.</seg>
<seg>We are correct from there against the Commission proposal and the report of the parliament.</seg>
<seg>An adjustment of the existing Community legislation within this range can be regarded therefore as justified.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore the funds the possibility offers that in form of the Kofinanzierung by the member states more or less covered subventions are granted.</seg>
<seg>. (EL) Despite its serious shortcomings the report Morillon continues clearly as the Commission proposal to the entry partnership between the European Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg>We however were correct against it.</seg>
<seg>We must recognize just like the correspondents that Turkey within some ranges made progress and that positive signals are to be registered.</seg>
<seg>Our parliament already used itself since 1987 for this acknowledgment, and the adoption of this request for modification is a proof for the coherency of the parliament in this question.</seg>
<seg>The union must submit more concrete proposals and conceive the extension around Turkey than an essential geopolitical strategy.</seg>
<seg>Such ulterior motives are Europe not with dignity and Turkey.</seg>
<seg>For several years I know the function of one of these regional organisations, the NAFO (Fisheries Organization in the northwest Atlantic) as a member of the delegation for the relations with Canada, observe, to that the states of this region, under it also Canada, belong, as well as all those, which use traditional fishery zones in this region, as for instance France, Spain and some other European countries.</seg>
<seg>It is only then content if its own gunboat fleet under the star circle banner implements their fishery politics.</seg>
<seg>The most important does not consist thus of satisfying hegemony props of the commission by weakening the European position, which would contradict an proper implementation of the Subsidiaritätsprinzips perfectly.</seg>
<seg>Finally after tough negotiations a final result was obtained, which earns to be defended.</seg>
<seg>With this proposal, which aims at the replacement from three guidelines to the refuse incineration, air quality, the water is thus aimed at, improving the grounds and the public health by reducing the emissions of dirt particles in connection with the burn and the Mitverbrennung and in particular the emission of dioxins, Furanen and heavy metals.</seg>
<seg>It seems important to me in addition to refer to the innovation that now no longer only from emissions into air, but also in the water and into the ground the speech is.</seg>
<seg>During the treatment the draft was improved.</seg>
<seg>Also the introduction of by far stricter nitrogen oxide limit values with new Mitverbrennungsanlagen, as for example Zementöfen, is a step forward, which will offer an incentive to the reducing emission, even if the suggested standards do not reflect the straight most modern state of the art.</seg>
<seg>Admired delegate! Particularly excuse you, Mr. Blokland that I was late around some minutes.</seg>
<seg>Finally I would like to say that this guideline is a major contribution for the reduction of the negative effects on the environment and the risks for the human health.</seg>
<seg>It would be to be taken into account to the European Parliament highly, if it makes the practical implementation of the substantial solidarity principle for the rejection possible of any discrimination, to which fight of exclusion would lend and considering the responsibility of the particular the introduction of a system new lift, in the name.</seg>
<seg>However major differences are to be determined from country to country, and it is missing on detailed and comparable statistical data, which give information on it reliably, which system where in which way the best results furnishes, wherein its weaknesses lie etc. from evenly this reason become in mine in the behalf of the Committee for economics and currency wrote statement the necessity underlined that the commission before the definition of jedweder generally accepted rules for the auxiliary health insurance publishes a green book, in which all these scattered data and the appropriate information are arranged and are evaluated.</seg>
<seg>So far this was to a certain extent a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg>The danger that not completely healthy citizens and citizen and elderly people because of their high risk only conditionally privately can let themselves be insured, is not portable for the society development.</seg>
<seg>The second concept, which the correspondent in its introduction described and which is supported by many colleagues, contains the promotion of the necessary rules and codes of conduct for the introduction of forms of the mutual assumption of the costs between the insurers, who guarantee all the supply of qualitatively high-quality supply achievements and which work against the dangers of the development of discriminating practices and a risk and a customer selection.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion it cannot be correct that is dependent on the money, who stands above on the waiting list.</seg>
<seg>The fresh proposal of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is correct to make and then only decide first a stocktaking in form of a Green whether we need a guideline or a recommendation.</seg>
<seg>In the Netherlands structural changes of the system one discusses at present.</seg>
<seg>On this basis the commission should seize an initiative and articulate concrete corner points as guidelines for the health systems of the member states.</seg>
<seg>An absolute unit solution cannot give it from there for the insurance probably.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I, we mean should Mr. Rocard to its report, in which he requests the commission to a service, a green book, which congratulate us a view of the current state of the insurance in the member states and at the same time the setting the course for the future permitted, and it contentwise agree.</seg>
<seg>Both develop on a three-column model: the national, the operational and the private.</seg>
<seg>Regarding the supplementary allowances the European Union compiled already certain regulations. In addition it submitted a green book, from which then the draft directive came out.</seg>
<seg>. (EN) Mr. Präsident! I would like to thank Mr. Rocard and to congratulate him to his report, and also I congratulate to Mr. Marinos to the statement of its committee.</seg>
<seg>This study can be then the basis for a Commission communication to the advice and the European Parliament, in which initiatives or measures are suggested.</seg>
<seg>Regarding the requests for modification submitted by the budget committee I can communicate pleased that they were all taken over.</seg>
<seg>We agreed the basic data of the program, to which the multi-dimensional putting into operation of the phenomenon, which measures within the ranges health, education and dwelling, which coherency and Komplementarität rank among other one, adjacent politics policies as well as the participation of the government-independent carriers, likewise in addition, humans concerned by social exclusion.</seg>
<seg>That is, that we must use the cyclic growth phases, in order to create an equilibrium or a surplus.</seg>
<seg>Here I remind only of the fact that the last ECOFIN advice asked the commission to take up starting from the coming year straight this term aspect of public finances regarding the aging of the population to the evaluation.</seg>
<seg>One of the positive characteristics of the program of the Netherlands is the special consideration - as I said initially - the effects of aging the population on the national budget of the coming years.</seg>
<seg>Therefore the household calculation results in a surplus of one and a half points of the gross domestic product for the year 2000 in the case of Germany.</seg>
<seg>If we add still the rate of exchange development of the euro to the dollar, we have a clear negative effect regarding the inflation.</seg>
<seg>Further is aimed at bringing a public distribution system with private capital education systems in agreement and they are compatible obviously also with supports for the creation of specific unit trust fund, which can receive long-term tax preferences and with the solution to the problem of the aging of the population is helpful perhaps.</seg>
<seg>From it third, us results leading principle, i.e. the precaution principle.</seg>
<seg>Of it that several proposals for legislation are discussed at present, all this must be reminded the efficiency and the appropriateness of the joint regulations and therefore, as I hope, which consumer confidence will strengthen.</seg>
<seg>But this relatively small Inzidenzrate is not a reason to the self satisfaction.</seg>
<seg>Honestly said, I was disappointed that in the explanation of yesterday by prime minister Jospin the tremendously positive Community role was not appreciated in the last years.</seg>
<seg>Of course the intensified occurrence of BSE, not only in France, requires but also in other member states, for explanations.</seg>
<seg>The veterinary centre of the commission already now dedicates, which concerns the preventive measures against BSE, highest priority to controls in the member states.</seg>
<seg>Which concerns its security, then I would like to repeat that there is already a whole set of controls, which ensure that meat and bone flour do not represent a danger during the transmission of BSE.</seg>
<seg>Yes, one may it hardly believe, it four years took, in order to agree a measure, which I judge the protection of the public health as fundamental.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Ratspräsident, I reminds expressly on that the advice announces finally its opinion for TSE regulation.</seg>
<seg>In the current situation the only possibility exists of breaking through the cycle of the BSE infection of forbidding the employment of animal flour in feeding completely.</seg>
<seg>In this connection I would like to mention that we submitted a request for modification, which is hopefully accepted from the parliamentary group of the liberals.</seg>
<seg>The policy must cause changes here, so that really for this crisis the responsible persons are taken into the obligation and with concrete decisions a first step toward the completion of this tragic crisis are done.</seg>
<seg>They must be considered thus.</seg>
<seg>The decided marking for beef, with which it does not concern a minimum labeling, which is only for two and a half months into force, makes possible a normal backtracing of the origin of animals, and that specified risk material has we much too late forbidden.</seg>
<seg>The citizens must be informed comprehensively about the characteristics of the test mentioned by me.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Ratspräsident, at that time you undertook nothing or nearly nothing, just as your colleagues remained dormant in view of the effects of Tschernobyl, the AIDS epidemic or the contaminated blood products. As reason always one indicated, one did not want to shift the public in panic.</seg>
<seg>The French ban will cause a substantial need increase, but the offer at this raw material is limited.</seg>
<seg>The consumers lost their confidence, and in order to this phenomenon stop to order, mandatory BSE tests for cattle and sheep must be introduced.</seg>
<seg>More important it is now rather to work in the sense of the commission proposal on the fact that animal flours correspond to the highest safety standards.</seg>
<seg>Otherwise am I - once does not agree no times completely with what the colleagues, Mrs. Ainardi, Mrs. Auroi and Mrs. Grossetête said.</seg>
<seg>Because times loosely, advice and commission, you have a sufficient financial basis and can now an energetic policy would drive through.</seg>
<seg>We must tackle this problem.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, Mr. Ratspräsident, Mr. Kommissar! I am very much pleased to hear here in this hall that GAP at any price is to be revised.</seg>
<seg>We have the grounds, the suitable climate and the necessary know-how, in order to replace animal flour immediately by genetically not changed plant proteins, and nevertheless we did without the right to cultivate on our own grounds the plant proteins necessary for feeding our animals and the nutrition of the population during we at the same time fallow lands financiers. For this reason our parliamentary group has to increase a request for modification submitted, in which the advice and the commission are requested to look for possibilities in order in Europe the cultivation of these plant proteins again, which represent a suitable replacement for prionenhaltiges animal flour and American genetically changed soy.</seg>
<seg>The food must ensure the safe nutrition of humans.</seg>
<seg>I find it modelful that France struggled through itself to dare this step.</seg>
<seg>But the gentlemen do not help them!</seg>
<seg>Therefore I am surprised that under these circumstances Kadaver may be still processed and/or used.</seg>
<seg>Recently in Great Britain the Phillips investigation was published to BSE.</seg>
<seg>I would like to suggest to the European Commission to likewise use the precaution principle with beef from France.</seg>
<seg>We had still no certainty and from there know how the scientific fact situation is and is necessary which measures.</seg>
<seg>Beyond that I naturally took all proposals to the knowledge, to which I am quite sensitive.</seg>
<seg>If citizens come from the member states and report to me, the legislation was not converted duly or not completely, then we would have to think perhaps again about it, but not, because the scientists say us, it was necessary, but because it lacks in the European Union the adherence to the law.</seg>
<seg>If one does not want to hear us, then one loads us best not even in.</seg>
<seg>The commission is the opinion that the back assumption agreements for clarifying and coordination of these measures play an important role, and momentarily runs the negotiations to the first back assumption agreements of the community with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco.</seg>
<seg>Which relevant proposals does the commission on the basis of Article 31 of the Treaty of Union have?</seg>
<seg>(The president interrupts the speaker.)</seg>
<seg>The goal in this period was reduction of the public deficit for the reaching of a more satisfying monetary policy, a lower interest and a higher growth.</seg>
<seg>I say always that the euro is not introduced on 1 January 2002, we to have it already in our bag; we have it in different coin, but we carry it in our bag.</seg>
<seg>The valid limit values for nitrogen dioxide and lead were not crossed, also not the ozone threshold value in the Athener city center in accordance with guideline 92/72/EG. It is however marked that the measurements were made in the high summer.</seg>
<seg>Concerns: A representative of the central management competition of the European Commission the view represented state aids for the audiovisual sector on a seminar of of the French presidency about cultural economy that those would represent imposed legal investment obligations to the transmitters alone by it that they were compellingly required by law, subventions.</seg>
<seg>It is to be respected and protected. “</seg>
<seg>But does not happen automatically, because this new growth is expressed inegalitär and can to be observed, as we in the USA for approximately one decade, by continuous features of the uncertainty, the exclusion, which poverty and the urban Ghettobildung are accompanied.</seg>
<seg>The governments of the Member did not accept this definition, which is somewhat too simple and too insignificant.</seg>
<seg>In the rauen climate developing thereby it gives ever more humans, who can not keep up, the offside advisable and are excluded.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, in this high house we hear those very often, similarly be praised a Litanei, as the European social model and/or the social Mark economy, then mean many, a contrast to the chaotic model of the United States of America would form.</seg>
<seg>(Technical disturbance)</seg>
<seg>That is an enormous sum.</seg>
<seg>Beyond that all political levels must be involved.</seg>
<seg>I agree that it is necessary to know the causes of the poverty better. I endorse preventive measures by means of innovative and practical responses including the social partners, the local and national administrations and the joint action of the citizens against exclusion as consequence of unions, conversions and misalignments of enterprise, migration from the land and to strong settlement of the urban area.</seg>
<seg>We had one very much interesting debate over the role of employment with the fight of social exclusion and the role of the social and structural reforms.</seg>
<seg>That is legal problems, since in the text of the Treaty only on social exclusion and not to poverty is referred.</seg>
<seg>These proposals are, think I, a pragmatic answer to your request.</seg>
<seg>But, agreement to the strategy is not called necessarily agreement to the detail.</seg>
<seg>If we define a clear, binding framework for the member states, the different systems, which must meet these requirements, should have a longer time of the probation.</seg>
<seg>The renewable energies will be no universal remedy for the solution of this problem. But nobody doubts that they can contribute in considerable measure to its moderating and also to the diversification of the energy sources as well as to the decrease of our dependence on the oil and natural gas, which would get us on the other hand also well.</seg>
<seg>I want to repeat three of our demands.</seg>
<seg>The definition of realistic goal appoximate values can increase only public confidence into those energy policy which can be pursued.</seg>
<seg>In my eyes a consistent policy within the range of renewable energies has a symbol effect for future Europe.</seg>
<seg>With these agreements finally the member states of the European Union must prove that they will make a contribution for reaching the Kyoto goals.</seg>
<seg>It would be, if a category were excluded, those altogether to gaining of energy from waste to unfortunaty contribute can is it for small projects or as part of the total bill.</seg>
<seg>The formation of peat mass during the assimilation and forest faithful emergence resembles the other vegetable biomasses.</seg>
<seg>I would like to inform Mr. Chichester about the fact that before my homeland coast on lake already completely modern wind-power plants were installed. This concerns a project, which is certainly taken very soon in enterprise.</seg>
<seg>The dispute over the renouncement of nuclear power, which in Sweden and Germany it is led among other things showed that without visible pollution free and at a competitive price energy alternatives which can be realized the debate runs inevitably in the sand.</seg>
<seg>Therefore the member states must set up binding targets.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I am optimistic, which concerns the future potential of renewable energy sources, if the right incentives are created.</seg>
<seg>I believe, it belonged to very much courage to position the renewable energy also again and again in such a way as she earned it.</seg>
<seg>A very strong rise of the petroleum price leads certainly us with larger hardness the problems before eyes, which with our dependence on the fossil energy sources in connection.</seg>
<seg>Therefore we cannot accept request for modification 28.</seg>
<seg>It makes sure however much that the used terms do not represent an interference into their Initiativrecht and that they with the electricity domestic market may not be incompatible.</seg>
<seg>In the commission for the reconstruction Tadschikistans, where 25,000 widows live, was among 26 participants only a woman.</seg>
<seg>Although the woman portion was so far relatively small, studies proved that the presence of women in the peace-keeping troops of the UN leads to an improving relation with the population locally and the general moral.</seg>
<seg>The report Theorin goes in this range much into details and also into repetitions, which we ask as a parliamentary group of European People and the European democrats to take out in the sense of an official document.</seg>
<seg>Politically spoken I can interpret the available request for modification 19 rather as tactical defeat and/or tactical retreat as contentwise compromise to rate, and that should be actually unworthy the woman thing.</seg>
<seg>They were kept imprisoned.</seg>
<seg>Also Portugal, where the women received entrance to the diplomacy only after the April revolution from 1974, proved Ana Gomes, recently with Osttimor and our ambassador in Indonesia, how the role of a woman and its sensitivity for the problems and suffering a people, who stood 25 years long in its freedom fight alone, which can be noticed whole world and in particular here in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>So far this only completely few from them did, two or three, how I hear.</seg>
<seg>Therefore in the future also this dimension must be considered with conceiving the policy of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately the terms are not defined, and no distinctions are met.</seg>
<seg>Convey please to the advice our protest.</seg>
<seg>They are humans with other experiences experiences, which are indispensable for the politics policy and in particular for the settlement of conflicts.</seg>
<seg>The discussion is closed.</seg>
<seg>Secondly: If the sector is to be legally regulated, naturally some points must be examined.</seg>
<seg>In the past weeks I stated that both on sides of international trade union circles and at certain national trade unions considerable interest exists.</seg>
<seg>Second objection: Are you then also for the fact that housewives receive a payment?</seg>
<seg>All those, which work momentarily black, received then a work under decent social conditions.</seg>
<seg>Further also resulting from this project more frequently already two to three families united and a domestic help together employed.</seg>
<seg>We were straight in a plenary session during the first October conference, when we experienced in our debate on the state in Yugoslavia of the courageous reaction of Serbian people, whereupon we remember immediately, you, dear colleagues and colleagues, which demanded abolition of the international sanctions.</seg>
<seg>Thus Europe proved the vitality of its civilization in world history and its political creator strength with the organization of the future development way.</seg>
<seg>There may not be any doubts about the fact that the question of the status Kosovo a democratic question is.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand we would have gladly a chance to prove Europe that we are from own Kraft and under acknowledgment of the true principles of democracy able to develop the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg>I must say the fact that I - when I spoke at that time with you - of it was expressed impressive, how you mastered these extremely difficult situation and how decided you was.</seg>
<seg>That is brought in next minutes in order, Mr. Watson.</seg>
<seg>The entrance to documents and information about the activity of the institutions makes the citizens possible to pull the decision-making bodies for responsibility and stimulates to more effectiveness.</seg>
<seg>The fifth important request for modification is in my opinion that for annual reporting particularly over the documents, which must remain secret or which are still secret at least.</seg>
<seg>This question is unsettled, and there is the possibility that also regulations, which limit transparency more strongly remain into force, and among other things to this point we brought in requests for modification.</seg>
<seg>The committee for Foreign Affairs, human rights, Common Security and defense policy resists the proposal exclude documents, which affect with regard to foreign policy or security questions, automatically and as a whole from the public principle.</seg>
<seg>If we want that the citizens can really notice their rights, we need trained coworkers, who take and as scouts by the complicated labyrinth of the institutions lead the information looking for citizen to a certain extent at hand in these approach places particularly.</seg>
<seg>Registers are indispensable, if we do not want that from the public a Insider public becomes.</seg>
<seg>It is very pleasing that the parliament succeeded to create a broad majority for more transparency.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! I would like to begin with it, the correspondents mean thanks for their very good work to express.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! Openness and transparency in the European Union are located in no good light.</seg>
<seg>Should be like that, then is a miscalculation, because it concerns the reliability and reliability of the European Union here in the eyes of the public.</seg>
<seg>By document one understands nowadays the most different things and we would like as comprehensive an entrance to many document types in different forms as possible to guarantee.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, which is attitude of the commission to the file inspection evidently from the internal handbook, which was distributed on 11 October to the employees of the Commission and in that it is informed how they are to treat requests for file inspection by members of parliament.</seg>
<seg>This regulation must be painted or be supplemented at least around the obligation of a weighing of interests.</seg>
<seg>The usual kind of the international cooperation with the diplomatic habits and rules - that e.g. everything runs off behind closed doors - is not up-to-date for modern co-operation forms, how they were developed by the European Union.</seg>
<seg>We should not confound it with the role of the European parliament or with future inter+institutional agreements.</seg>
<seg>A step was done forward for the recourse to of the right of the citizen to information and knowledge.</seg>
<seg>However it is not the only one, who I would like to express my thanks, large thanks been entitled also Hanja Maij Weggen of the PPE DE parliamentary group, which is due to the consolidated Hughes procedure co-author of the report.</seg>
<seg>Transparency must become a Grundpfeiler of the activity of the entire European Union, but is not sufficient the right to be able to take insight into the documents for the implementation of transparency alone.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament demands from there that the European safety and defense policy are merged in the future into the structures of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg>When president Prodi turned on 3 October to the parliament, it spoke of the institutional triangle and pointed out that in an European system which is based on controls and equilibrium the smooth functioning of each institution contributes to the common interest.</seg>
<seg>I must admit that the large challenge is in this regulation the exact definition of the documents.</seg>
<seg>I would like to emphasize that the commission could accept the whole of the requests for modification at the given time practically, like No.</seg>
<seg>In some cases I would be correct gladly for the Commission proposals, and but the delegates must have the list with the proposed amendments, which the commission can support, and with the proposed amendments, which them do not want to support, in the hand.</seg>
<seg>Own resources of credit institutes</seg>
<seg>Finally, and that was the most disputed point, demanded the committee vehemently an accelerated procedure for the conversion of this legislation.</seg>
<seg>These changes step to the place of several other proposals in the report, which are probably rejected during the vote and replaced now by the new changes, which are the result of this consent.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! In view of the excellent voting result for this report and the answer from the Commission this morning it is completely obvious - if you all parts regard, on which we co-ordinated - that we should shift the vote on the draft of the legislative resolution in accordance with article 69 paragraph 2, around with the commission and the advice successful negotiations to enter to be able.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! I regret to have said that also the parliamentary group of European People and the European democrats (PPE-DE) endorses the postponement of the vote, but I must point out that your co-ordinator to me came, to communicate in order to co-ordinate me that also you wanted to postpone the vote up to the parliamentary session November II, instead of this evening.</seg>
<seg>I would suggest a postponement of the vote for another reason - Mr. Goebbels already said it - that am one much key issue.</seg>
<seg>I do not know, what costs a roll call vote, but there is reliably some thousand francs or Belgian francs from our household.</seg>
<seg>I white that in France whole herds were slaughtered, to be and does not seem the best solution.</seg>
<seg>Distance of the animal flour from the animal feeds, not only for cattle and sheep, but also for pigs, poultry and fish,</seg>
<seg>That is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg>Such regulations would be suitable to repair and the farmers the solidarity message give consumer confidence, which we want to convey to them.</seg>
<seg>It is urgently necessary to go still further - and a change of common agriculture into the eye to seize.</seg>
<seg>The prohibition of the employment of animal flour as animal fodder is only the first step this way.</seg>
<seg>We regret however much that the proposed amendments brought in by our parliamentary group did not meet agreement.</seg>
<seg>My judgement would be logical it to lower the work time of the persons employed in the environmentalharmful enterprises.</seg>
<seg>Let me finally again underline that the general spreading of the utilization of hazardous waste may not bring us to compensate us with the production of such wastes.</seg>
<seg>If for example the pensions were not so low the fact that they are not sufficient for living costs would give it less arm.</seg>
<seg>The report plans means at a value of 100 million euros for one period of five years to poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg>The proposal introduce a second Luxembourg process within the range of the social exclusion which includes guidelines and national action plans, finds my unrestricted support.</seg>
<seg>The report demands the list more qualitatively and quantitative indicators for social exclusion.</seg>
<seg>With the collecting main of its proposal for a program for the fight of social exclusion the commission of the request of the advice follows to provide “to June 2000” a “initiative for co-operation in this area”.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I contained for a very concrete reason of the voice: With this report in my view in environmental term the progress is not obtained, which I had expected and had wished.</seg>
<seg>I hope that this system in all cities of Europe spreading may find.</seg>
<seg>Some proposals of the European parliament are unrealistic and do not meet not my agreement.</seg>
<seg>Also must succeed in the future better to make existing Bestpractice publicly more well-known.</seg>
<seg>Environmentally conscious large breadwinners receive the possibility of contributing in a liberalized market voluntarily to a cleaner energy while for other all this with the old person remains.</seg>
<seg>After the agenda the joint debate follows over the following resolution requests:</seg>
<seg>It concerns thereby the following three reasons: First of all this request corresponds to the process of the consolidation of the democracy and the intensified demand after respect for human, in particular regarding the indigenen subpopulations.</seg>
<seg>In this debate we, as my previous speakers said appropriate, would like to express the solidarity and support to our institution in relation to the centralAmerican parliament. This happens at a time, since we support that the external relations of the European Union with the countries Iberoamerikas enjoys further priority.</seg>
<seg>I do not have the reservations concerning the human rights, those our colleague and honourable friend, Mr. Seguro, Präsident of the delegation responsibly for the relations with Central American countries and Mexico, authorized was to be expressed.</seg>
<seg>Finally the commission points also in the dialogue with the centralAmerican authorities repetitive to the meaning, which one must attach to the regional process of integration as instrument for the consolidation of the democratization and the development of this area.</seg>
<seg>In order to clasp itself to power, he did not hesitate to seize the unreasonable debate over the “Ivorität” which released a wave of the stranger hostileness: Hate on the others, which strangers, which Burkinabé or the Malinesen, on which a great many live and work for many years on ivorischem ground.</seg>
<seg>A condition for the production of a real democracy in Côte d' Ivoire are the installation of an independent commission of inquiry over the committed crimes and the official obligation for adherence to of the human rights and internal peace.</seg>
<seg>Some mean, the democracy is of relative importance, if it concerns Africa, this is complex procedures and one is the time for itself work to let. I am however the view that there cannot be a compromise regarding the democracy and that in Côte d' Ivoire places itself today the same question as for example in Guinea, where one knows that people are not arrested and it a democratic system give.</seg>
<seg>Let me finally still one say: Dictatorships are only possible, because there are peoples, who live in the misery, who do not have an entrance to knowledge and realizations.</seg>
<seg>It would not illogically be, if the European Union demanded today new presidential elections, in which this mark all candidates participate could.</seg>
<seg>In a great many parts of Africa we have to do it with very different ethnic and religious mixtures.</seg>
<seg>With these elections the country-wide agency of the political parties must be made possible, which were excluded from the Präsidentenwahl, all the, even if only partly, the inadequacies for this first choice to adjust.</seg>
<seg>to the situation in Burma</seg>
<seg>A large-scale offensive is led against the Shan and the Karen and, as the UN-correspondent implemented, gives it no signs for a dialogue between SDPC and NLD.</seg>
<seg>Therefore we affirm again the meaning of this resolution and the firm commitment of the commission and the advice in this direction.</seg>
<seg>I hope that the European Parliament gives a clear signal to Burmese people by the treatment of this question in the urgency debate that its desperate situation is not forgotten that we recognize that the situation in Burma becomes rather more badly than better, and that we are decided to do somewhat against it.</seg>
<seg>That lasted for a long time.</seg>
<seg>Straight one in Asia exists the danger that economical and political reforms are decoupled that there can be economic progress and economic liberalisation without liberalisation in the policy area and without reinforcement of the right state, although I the opinion am that without functioning constitutional state also trade, subsidies and investments in the long term are lost.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! I can agree my previous speakers in many essential points, because much of what happens today in Viet Nam, is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg>The human rights organization Human Rights Watch, which also Mr. Swoboda mentioned, explains in the meantime that Viet Nam undertook straight in the question of human lately some, in order to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg>These strictly secret documents grant us a rare view behind the scenes of the policy of the Vietnamese government.</seg>
<seg>The commission is however further convinced of the fact that a lasting solution of the current situation only over a dialogue between the military regime, which can be achieved democratically elected opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg>It exists also a clear pressure on the part of the Vietnamese authorities in the direction of a self-censorship of the own press.</seg>
<seg>After the agenda the discussion follows over the following resolution requests:</seg>
<seg>We need also the assistance and support of the European Union, not only in the southwest of England, but in all areas concerned.</seg>
<seg>I ask you all to support our resolution.</seg>
<seg>It is urgently required that the European Union is not limited to unusual remedial measures after the entrance of disasters.</seg>
<seg>The commission seized two initiatives in this connection.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! Purely an linguistic error arose with the insertion one of the requests for modification into the common resolution.</seg>
<seg>The vote to shift, is called, to shift the order to the commission.</seg>
<seg>(The parliament accepts the resolution request.)</seg>
<seg>The report proceeds from the statement that a rising portion of the attendance of patients in Europe is covered by auxiliary health insurances.</seg>
<seg>I find it somewhat strange that one wants to bind now the hands for a guideline proposal for the commission, but a green book on the current state of the voluntary insurance and patient additional insurances of the commission requires at the same time.</seg>
<seg>Light of the fact that the portion of elderly people of the population increases strongly, it is important it to seize the improvement of the health service for humans in all of Europe in the eye.</seg>
<seg>We cannot naturally take part in that.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! Much speaks for an accelerated procedure during the conversion of the results of the Basler revised version of the Kapitaladäquanz Regelungsrahmens.</seg>
<seg>Which concerns the sense of urgency, which draufgesetzt Mrs. Villiers still on the feeling of the necessity obtained by the commission, by demanding the acceptance of the measures in an accelerated procedure, then it is to say that the Berichterstatterin admits that this regulation will not have any influence on the competition-adverse practices, which are common in the United States unfortunately.</seg>
<seg>We must naturally also watch out that Basel does not lead additionally to the fact that by higher own capital funds requirements still another second disadvantage arises for the banks.</seg>
<seg>After these prefaces I would like to refer to that the participants in the economy regard in my opinion also the beginning as satisfying, these regulations to the capital, which support the topics in connection with the risk, am the basis.</seg>
<seg>These are some first thoughts over it as we could achieve a brisk legislation process, which would be controllable and efficient within the current regimes of the contract.</seg>
<seg>So now the moment is to be recognized come that the institution of the “European citizen-assigned” arise for enough is and already sufficient proofs for it gave that it possesses now the ripe one for its own household.</seg>
<seg>The PPE DE parliamentary group supports the view of the committee for constitutional questions that the authority of the citizen-assigned should be extended, the faster, so much the better, in particular regarding the investigation powers of the citizen-assigned specified in article 3 of the resolution of 1994.</seg>
<seg>A citizen representative is subject naturally to secrecy regulations, but importantly the citizens and citizen is to be known for that he or she can receive entrance to documents, which remain locked for the remaining citizen as a citizen representative.</seg>
<seg>Starting point of the present report was afterwards to it the recommendation addressed by the Ombudsmann to the commission to make with the selective procedures organized by it the entrance possible that applicant inside and applicants to its own corrected test work.</seg>
<seg>We mean to exclude that the attitude adjustments of the mechanisms of the community, and indeed all attitude procedures should take place, with maximum openness and transparency, in order each suspicion from partyness, unfairness or incompetence of the administration.</seg>
<seg>I refer for example to a proposed amendment concerning the demand after the incontestable proof of a verbal examination.</seg>
<seg>Colleague Bösch dealt here already briefly with the requests for modification to the report.</seg>
<seg>After I had addressed two inquiries to the commission for the execution and organization of the last internal advertisement, I had precisely and detailed replies on it get.</seg>
<seg>Thus administrative processes are arranged openly and transparency.</seg>
<seg>First of all, with the examinations accomplished by the commission the corrections take place always anonymous.</seg>
<seg>Meant July 2000 was clear.</seg>
<seg>Votes</seg>
<seg>(The parliament rejects the request for postponement of the vote.)</seg>
<seg>With the assessment of the directive over own resources of credit institutes carefully several interests standing in conflict must be weighed out to each other.</seg>
<seg>Thus the idea of a European police academy for the member states of the European Union and for the candidate countries developed.</seg>
<seg>Also the correspondent represents this point of view, and European People divide him likewise.</seg>
<seg>The social situation in most member states of the European Union requires now once actually absolutely transnational co-operation between the different police services.</seg>
<seg>Most of my previous speakers obviously hold it for indispensable that the academy has a only one permanent seat.</seg>
<seg>The soundsovielte provisional, however not revocable resolution, with which the advice a small gift makes for usually our parliament.</seg>
<seg>The correspondent would like to know also crime kriminalitätsvorbeugung, contribution of services, innovation and border surveillance included and to see the protection of the internal security amended in the sense of the maintenance of the public order.</seg>
<seg>That were the ideals, which suggested it to us, and so looked the state, for which they worked.</seg>
<seg>I would welcome a leveling of standards in some member states of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Since has itself the commission opposite the member states committed to the first considerations in this affair, which were employed on initiative of the European parliament on European level, to bring an action with the goal on the way to construct something, which we could regard as European police culture, which bases on the highest level of the professional ethics, the respect for the rights and freedoms of the citizens and the effectiveness of the fight against the crime.</seg>
<seg>This plans a development of the police academy primarily on government level.</seg>
<seg>For the reasons mentioned the European delegates of the Communist Party of Greece are correct against the report.</seg>
<seg>- (Sports association) I was correct against the provisional mechanism of the European police academy.</seg>
<seg>There is not a doubt that many of our courts work very slowly and bedächtig, and it is very difficult to induce them in these questions to fast acting.</seg>
<seg>Of course the suggested regulation is not perfect, since it relies on the Brussels ii-regulation, which is not valid for children of separated living as well as unmarried parents.</seg>
<seg>My mother took part in such a divorce and kidnapping before 85 years, and her speaks this very day of it.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I would like to say to the parliament the fact that the commission in the scheme over the mutual recognition of civil decisions - which is decided hopefully to end of the year - suggests attaching to the extension of the area of application of the Brussels ii-regulation and concomitantly this regulation over the visit right highest and highest priority so that they are valid alike for children of married couples likewise as for children from partnerships.</seg>
<seg>We come now to the vote.</seg>
<seg>In the meantime the sport - that must be said - is closely connected with other industries, for example with enterprises of the audiovisual sector or the advertising industry and the sports article sale.</seg>
<seg>Which we need, an intelligent is, flexible interpretation of the current regimes.</seg>
<seg>Strictly speaking it concerns an attack on the democracy, so much we also resists to see the things out this control room.</seg>
<seg>The commission expects shortly from there an answer to its request for detailed informations over the measures planned by the British Government.</seg>
<seg>The proposal was spoken by the Minister of Finance in connection with a household scheme a half year before the explanation to the total budget in the spring 2001.</seg>
<seg>Also I think, what Mr. Simpson said has in extraordinary way contributed to confirm us regarding the probable intentions of the United Kingdom Government.</seg>
<seg>By back-up lose we not only much time, do not only develop high cost, but that is whole straight for the environment major problems, and therefore I, if the British Government uses actually the money to solve the problems believe then have all something of it, in particular all citizen of Europe.</seg>
<seg>We are more or less the only oil producers in the European Union and have nevertheless the highest gasoline and Diesel prices of all countries of Europe - we pay 1.20 Pound in the United Kingdom for a litre of Diesel.</seg>
<seg>Thus this item on the agenda is final.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament is guilty it itself to insure them that it stands at its side. I ask you again to rise to one being silent minute in order to express our solidarity and our confusion.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, I would like to support this proposal completely, since I belonged to those, which requested to take up this point.</seg>
<seg>We advanced a long way.</seg>
<seg>The European Union will develop in addition as fast as possible with the incoming government in the USA into contact will step its relations with the major groups and.</seg>
<seg>In view of the what I cannot understand a surprise of enthusiastic report of Mr. Prescott over the deal, whom he negotiated, why it is not only of Mrs. Voynet, but, as I mean, and this my final question to the commissioners, was rejected also by nearly all other European secretaries of the environment.</seg>
<seg>Now the danger exists the fact that we lost the momentum which American official contact changes their point of view, and we in May completely from the front to begin to have.</seg>
<seg>The large point at issue were this time the forests.</seg>
<seg>A constant heating up of the earth would have for some European Union countries as a consequence that parts of its territory are inundated or quilted.</seg>
<seg>They have a high prosperity level and low prices for products of oil.</seg>
<seg>I congratulate to Mrs. Wallström to its efforts into the Hague and wish it more success.</seg>
<seg>Certainly it was better, to no agreement to come than to a bad, because the American proposal was completely insufficient and for Europe under no circumstances acceptable.</seg>
<seg>Climatic changes have consequences which are enough far in the developing countries.</seg>
<seg>I would like to repeat it in English: Forest turn from being carbon sinks ton carbon SOURCEs.</seg>
<seg>Only if the European Union remains reliable, it can transfer in the discussions and the actual measures on the COP6 “B” to Bonn the initiative.</seg>
<seg>We must make our own estimate of the events and prepare documents, in order to naturally step with the different parties and the “Umbrella group” into contact.</seg>
<seg>Naturally the step consists following the next COP6 or the continuation of the COP6 of the fact that the agreement is then ratified in the union also.</seg>
<seg>Before the European Council we become, i.e. Pierre Moscovici and I, on coming Sunday still another closed meeting on Minister level would drive through, to which I had invited Mr. Brok and Mr. Tsatsos, and on Monday, on the occasion of the Council meeting “General Affairs” still another meeting of the diplomatic conference will take place.</seg>
<seg>The minimum number of participating states might be specified on eight, while the possibility was to be replaced of requiring an unanimous decision of the advice which represents at present in fact a right of veto, by a calling right.</seg>
<seg>One can regret that, but I must record this fact.</seg>
<seg>The European Council will therefore be concerned also with the conditions of the negotiations of accession and with the extension.</seg>
<seg>The European Council of Lisbon had accepted guidelines for the promotion of innovative and competitive Europe.</seg>
<seg>The consumer protection represents a concern of Europeans ever more meaning for obvious reasons, with which I do not have to deal further.</seg>
<seg>We must prepare for this unprecedented enlargement.</seg>
<seg>This is indeed the criterion, on the basis whose we must evaluate final analysis the summit of Nice.</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>First of all the candidate countries must the joint possession conditions take over and convert. This is also our task.</seg>
<seg>It is to us very much because of the fundamental right Charter and we do not want that them are only greatly publicised.</seg>
<seg>The text could be however better formulated; in addition, it can be improved and specified after Nice.</seg>
<seg>I find it simple indiskutabel that several governments swept the question of the admission of a reference to the Charter simple into the article 6 of the contract by the table.</seg>
<seg>They do not even want to take up it to the contracts, which a proof for it is that this text, is to be put this Elaborat, aside.</seg>
<seg>In the World Trade Organization we are to arise with a common unpleasant voice.</seg>
<seg>I think that in view of the nevertheless rather dark chances of success the load of the diplomatic conference with a further complex and controversial issue would not be an intelligent chess move.</seg>
<seg>I appeal seriously to the French Presidency to undertake maximum efforts so that this gap is closed, because it works extremely destructively.</seg>
<seg>To the commercial policy the commission compiled a proposal, which must be examined carefully.</seg>
<seg>Although with the previous contract certain progress could be obtained concerning the expansion of the formula, thereby also the moved formula of the joint decision including the unanimity was brought with questions of the nationality, the social security, the admission and practice of independent gainfully employednesses and the cultural policy into being.</seg>
<seg>The fact that this question arises, is actually already a clear proof for the failure of a policy for the stabilization of the connections of mutual trust between the countries of the Union.</seg>
<seg>That is nevertheless the situation, in which we are in this diplomatic conference for months, because no its toy gives up.</seg>
<seg>The experiences of this yearly to arrange us to the statement that we may trust with the progress, which must be obtained after Nice with view of the future of Europe in the Konstitutionalisierungsprozess of the union not in the method exclusively between the government representatives led of the negotiations exhausted in the meantime.</seg>
<seg>If the qualified majority does not become the rule, then thereby, that determined Mr. Prodi, those adoption of resolutions a while ago completely correctly definitely blocked.</seg>
<seg>This aspect of the Subsidiarität was not mentioned in our present debate, is however of great importance.</seg>
<seg>We made it, the extension of 1995 took place, it came of Carlo Westendorp so prudently led group of reflections, it came for Amsterdam in such a way, and now we will have and will stand Nice practically at the same point, Mr. Präsident: We circle to us around the institutional topics, without finding solutions, the possibility for the fulfillment of an extremely fastidious task, which extension on 27, give.</seg>
<seg>Do not leave to us the disappointment, which will anyway cause the conference of Nice, if it ends without result, also still the serious disappointment of the peoples over our parliament to add.</seg>
<seg>In the past we proved the fact that this goal is possible, and as a citizen of a Member State, to who from a regular transition to the membership profited, I expect to extended and peaceful Europe with high expectations.</seg>
<seg>But if one has a right of veto, it must be clear that this has to be valid also for all different.</seg>
<seg>However a first change in the 2004 parliament which can be selected will be necessary, because at least some member states before the choice or during the electoral period will come 2004-2009 to it.</seg>
<seg>The Mr. Ratspräsident addressed and explained the question of intensified co-operation, one moves in this affair towards a consent.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! At first sight it concerns into Nice left overs and the adjustments necessary in view of the extension.</seg>
<seg>Even if we would possess only one spark of that mentality in as much as we put less stress on negative developments in our part of the world and positively more strongly into the foreground could place running processes, then we would be happier, than it is at present the case.</seg>
<seg>We should not only the being, but also the services due to it, the investments, which intellectual property and the competition include into the majority decision of the Council of Ministers and which articles 133 paragraph 1 of the contract change accordingly.</seg>
<seg>A Initiativrecht of the European parliament would open in addition, in this high-sensitive question party-political arbitrariness door and gate.</seg>
<seg>One must be also able thus, how it said to one of you, when it dealt with the American optimism and the kind, in which the Americans of itself speaks, to put out, what runs, which advances.</seg>
<seg>I would like to likewise say to you that there is to my view after no problem the large and the tiny countries.</seg>
<seg>We did much, but we always push this old problem, and I do not believe myself that a development would enter here, only because a single country moved, because we have it here, as I to be repeated would like to do with very strong national, political, democratic realities in twelve from fifteen countries to.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident Védrine, it stated you that perhaps to tension-loaded climate prevails here spoke, and you also of a certain pessimism.</seg>
<seg>Besides I would like to ask you to undertake everything in order to intensify the safety requirements in appropriate way, so that such an incident cannot repeat itself.</seg>
<seg>I believe that we have to take precautions for it, which we did not take by far yet that the guests of this parliament in this house as guests to feel to have been able themselves and fear before threat not have had.</seg>
<seg>Hospitality here, hospitality and attention also there.</seg>
<seg>Thank you for her remarks, Mr. Tajani.</seg>
<seg>The best honour, which we can render to Ernest Lluch and its life, is it, to obey its message - on Catalan it is called dìaleg. Can we give all to the dialogue in the Basque country a chance?</seg>
<seg>On the other hand everyone can naturally express its opinion.</seg>
<seg>(B5-0549/2000) of Mr. Brok in the behalf of the Committee for Foreign Affairs, human rights, Common Security and defense policy at the advice to the political situation and humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan;</seg>
<seg>If I speak of organization, then I mean also that the European Union, which undertakes such major efforts should get also for it the responsibility.</seg>
<seg>Secondly you will determine the completely clear will of the parliament in the resolution to create the safety and defense policy on two balanced columns: the civilian crisis management and in case of a failure on the military crisis management, whereby these two columns complement each other mutually.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, in view of which I will try delay already entered and the obligations, which I have today still, the contribution, which I had prepared to shorten something.</seg>
<seg>These relations is manufactured in particular over meetings between the NATO advice and the COPSI as well as meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European applicant countries and/or the allied ones.</seg>
<seg>As example it is referred to the events on the Balkans of which one can say that everyone noticed its role fully.</seg>
<seg>In this period we held the USA also comprehensively over the developments in the context of the European safety and defense policy up to date, which an indispensable condition for it is that it develops harmoniously, as this is for the moment the case.</seg>
<seg>Thus the second annual report of the European Union on the human rights was submitted to the European Parliament, and a human right forum will take place on 13 December in Paris.</seg>
<seg>, Then you determine, do not aim at this politics not becoming the competitor of the Atlantic Alliance which is today the basis of the collective defence of their members to set up or a constant European army.</seg>
<seg>If I called the number of 100,000 men, then this means not the fact that we want to over-bid the goal specified in Helsinki but that we have a reserve of different qualifications and specializations, so that is secured that the goal of the advice appropriate 60,000 men under all operating conditions can be achieved.</seg>
<seg>Let me now in completely short words with the actual political sense of this new task accepted by a majority of our public deal, with which Europe attains an instrument of the political influence which is missing so far.</seg>
<seg>To have however stand we now also before problem, for it to provide that we, if of strengthening the liberal democracy in Europe the speech is, which means entire continent, because therefore goes it with the extension and the extension process.</seg>
<seg>We must connect three ranges to a coherent whole one, the Community policies, the GASP including the ESVP and national measures of the member states.</seg>
<seg>Despite the complex procedures within the commission we do not need 60,000 soldiers strong troop, in order to realise our goals.</seg>
<seg>Thus urgently a possibility of the grant of humanitarian assistance must be found.</seg>
<seg>I do not agree the cynics, which state, Europe get a toy which is to be used to nothing. However it applies that the rapid deployment force will not immediately be applicable in numerous situations.</seg>
<seg>The European Union should not form own defense with firm troops.</seg>
<seg>To the conclusion I would like to bring the uneasiness to my parliamentary group over the worsening situation in Afghanistan to the expression and to request the commission as well as the advice to it, as far as it is possible them to strengthen their efforts for a peaceful solution and an assistance for the civilian population particularly now before the beginning of winter.</seg>
<seg>In order to express it with completely simple words: Where, when and how the European strike force should is in the future used?</seg>
<seg>The interview makes, like the appalling records of these two months Intifada came oneself, on 270 dead ones, mostly Palestinians clear, and nearly 10,000 often on lifetime obstructed wounded amounts.</seg>
<seg>Therefore it is also incessantly endeavored to put on itself an arsenal at weapon of mass destruction of most terrible kind.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand and contrary to what said my Vorrednerin, I know not whether it would be possible or desirable that the European Union undertakes in view of the conflict and the escalation of violence in the Middle East more than so far, above all now, during the period of transition, in which the USA are.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, in my speech contribution I would like to deal with the report of Mrs. Lalumière, who is my judgement very good and clearly formulated.</seg>
<seg>But there is no political approach, and it exists material still no common outside and security policy.</seg>
<seg>The European Union has only one problem, i.e. the fact that it did not win the interest of public in such actions so far although this substantially lasting and substantially more effective is.</seg>
<seg>A further point concerns naturally the question of the allocation of the budgetary appropriations.</seg>
<seg>This outside I despite the multiplicity of obvious insurance to this topic, which was to be heard in the past days like coincidentally again and again.</seg>
<seg>Our potential is at present still very much limited. The member states should consider finally their defense expenditure, which differs from country to country substantially.</seg>
<seg>Even those, which analyze the use of the resolution for example for the creation of the euro army so called, must recognize the important political content of this resolution and its influence on the co-operation of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The first appearance of a Secretary of Defense in our parliament is so historical that we reserved the night session for it, so that the impression for our delegates is not too strong.</seg>
<seg>For all these conflicts a civilian crisis prevention is better than an military action.</seg>
<seg>Does Russia, want to be long-term political union partner of an undemocratic regime?</seg>
<seg>Europe will thus represent no new military alliance, how this some - as I believe - probably due to incomplete informations suggested.</seg>
<seg>I received a resolution request in accordance with article 42 paragraph 5 of the agenda to the wind up the debate.</seg>
<seg>In view of the range of the task four committees were concerned, why a new procedure with the production was used by four simultaneous reports.</seg>
<seg>The measures suggested in the White Paper must in their whole serve modernizing and arranging the entire function mode more efficient the commission.</seg>
<seg>It would be thus appropriate to use the reform as an opportunity in order to limit their intervention to the ranges, which do not contain expenditures.</seg>
<seg>The arisen evaluation differences are not only political nature, but a mirror image above all the cultural differences between the fifteen.</seg>
<seg>The major task of the new internal audit service, that you, Mr. Kinnock, when is subordinate to the vice-president responsible for the reform directly, is the analysis of the internal control functions and - systems within the commission.</seg>
<seg>Co-operation made large fun, and I think, which has process, to submit the commission of a major reform which is so crucial for the future of the European Union, at depth and wealth won, since we participated four in it.</seg>
<seg>They should be counted on it, be shifted into other European mechanisms and/or be turned off to the governments of the individual nations or be worked however in the private sector.</seg>
<seg>Therefore our committee refers again to which meaning it attaches commission to a strong, an independent, an efficient, a transparent and politically a responsible person.</seg>
<seg>As a budget committee are we the opinion that the list of the budget prepares us after activities due to the small visibility of the expenditures and because of our desire to the stabilization of the powers of the European parliament as budgetary authority of problems.</seg>
<seg>That is to clarify the firm desire of the parliament implement this reform together with the commission.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, first I would like to thank all four correspondents for the performed work.</seg>
<seg>That is shameful in view of the fact that the European Union is Vorkämpfer of the modernization of the economic life.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, despite the efforts of the correspondents around support of the activity of the Commission remains it a fact that on the recommendations of the Committee of independent experts still no comprehensive and consistent answer in the sense of striving for a real government policy is given and not only after a better administration of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>The changed attitude is to find their expression in a transparent administrative practice.</seg>
<seg>In my view there is tomorrow already no structure with a greater and more substantial importance than the 15 in the whole world, 20 or more countries - a whole continent. The most strongly industrialized part of the globe pulsates in the union and by it in the commission over their structures.</seg>
<seg>Changes are never simple.</seg>
<seg>Was the socialist parliamentary group however the view that the Community administration functions at present quite effectively.</seg>
<seg>One knows the result, and therefore the numbers of Members of the commission and its administration concerned themselves in detail and adeptly with this problem.</seg>
<seg>Thousands of project requests await already over one year to an evaluation.</seg>
<seg>How we could determine, it goes in the debate not so much around principles, goals or chances of the reform, but rather around procedures, speed, schedule, possible disturbances or undesirable consequences during its conversion.</seg>
<seg>First would like I high house to communicate that, as gentleman already noticed van Hulten, on which today's meeting of the Kollegiums a proposal for an inter+institutional agreement was accepted within their framework an Consultative Group of “rules for the behavior in the public service” is furnished, as in measure 1 of the scheme to the White Paper planned.</seg>
<seg>Mr. van Hulten as far as I know again took up this point in the course of this debate.</seg>
<seg>Principal purpose of the revised version is a simplification, increase transparency, the stabilization of the household principles, i.e. then improving efficiency and effectiveness in the budgetary procedure are called concretely fewer special arrangements, less incomprehensible special arrangement, and.</seg>
<seg>It is directly also very uneconomic for the commission, if contracts in such a way run off that for costs X 20% are replaced, for costs Y 30% are replaced and then the proofs by small sums are often collected and examined.</seg>
<seg>After the agenda the debate on the report (A5-0337/2000) of Mrs. Sauquillo Pérez del Arco in the behalf of the Committee on Development and co-operation follows over the relations of the European Union with the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the commission after these relations (2000/2051 (INI)).</seg>
<seg>Latter aspects completely particularly concern the NRO.</seg>
<seg>Naturally this is not sufficient, but might protect us in any case against exaggerated representations of the weakness of our development assistance.</seg>
<seg>Whereupon we still return, because this is actually a reasonable framework.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I returned today from Mozambique, where the European Union rendered protruding humanitarian help after the flood disaster, but is again once reconstruction projects, for which we already provided the money ready, retarded, since yet all signatures together are not in Brussels.</seg>
<seg>In view of this reality a larger commitment and an increased efficiency are inevitable in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment.</seg>
<seg>We have now a harmonized system for the production of land strategy papers and direction programs for co-operation in all developing countries.</seg>
<seg>Besides the mechanism of SEM did not offer a solution for that far existing disproportion of eight blown up administrative bodies.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, Ladies and Gentlemen delegate, Mrs. Kommissarin! I put completely particular importance to be today with this discussion over the first package to the maritime traffic in the European Parliament thereby because you will be concerned with three meaning texts, which represent a first essential step within this range, which unfortunately moved by the recent events so much into the focus of the public.</seg>
<seg>That would offer the possibility from view of the advice presidency of discussing with the member states in order to obtain on the basis of your proposals an agreement in the advice and the text in first reading to assume if necessary with qualified majority.</seg>
<seg>This rapid and purposeful procedure, whose result two Erika packages and six proposals are, released enormous dynamics.</seg>
<seg>The teachings, which must draw this parliament this morning, should lead to the realization that the maritime law is in the whole world in an shameful condition and is it at the time that we bring it in order.</seg>
<seg>To ships, which do not correspond to the standards, a clear signal must go that we do not bear it in European waters or in European ports.</seg>
<seg>With the tankers of low tonnage we were received a compromise between the 5,000 tons of load-carrying capacity, the limit value of the IMO, and the 600 tons of load-carrying capacity, the maximum limit suggested by the commission.</seg>
<seg>These data must be made available the European, national and port authorities as well as the interested public.</seg>
<seg>The border-spreading nature of the Meeresumwelt that the contamination of an area can spread on a larger region, requires for a community-far framework for co-operation within the range of sea pollution caused by an accident.</seg>
<seg>Into co-operation on local level also nature protection federations are included.</seg>
<seg>The amendment to the directive in the sense of a stricter application, a harmonization of the legislation, particularly regarding the selection of the ships which can be examined and the range of application of the different examination forms, is to be naturally positively rated.</seg>
<seg>I would like to again point out that the urgency, which you notify now is not given.</seg>
<seg>I think that with the limit of liability for the Klassifikationsgesellschaften between advice and parliament surely again must be thought, independently of which is today decided.</seg>
<seg>A trip writer, a black list, with all these things we agree completely. Nevertheless I would like to make you attentive on a few points.</seg>
<seg>In view of this catastrophic and anarchischen situation in the maritime traffic Europe of the challenge placed itself, and eleven months after the accident of the Erika the European Union will be able to show a procedure which was so rapidly processed, like none ever before.</seg>
<seg>To it can be estimated in which measures liberal logic stands in the contradiction to a high safety level in the maritime traffic.</seg>
<seg>Whatever technical measures are always met, one of the main sources for the uncertainty will remain existing, as long as one did not stop the exponential increasing of traffic in the zone English Channel and North Atlantic due to the Hypertrophie of the North Sea ports.</seg>
<seg>It would stand for the acting Council President well to face, even if it would create order in its country.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! Since the breakup of the tanker Erika apart under political pressure a package of measures was tied, in order to improve safety of ships on lake.</seg>
<seg>Greek ships went down simply in such a way, without in the area storm prevailed, Mr. Gayssot.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly it should be clear then, if we speak about such dossiers, that between our oil provision with stocks on the one hand and the fact that we still use fossil fuel, on the other hand no connection exists.</seg>
<seg>We should apply finally political courage to also implement our ecological ambitions.</seg>
<seg>That is, within this range we carry one major responsibility and must, as seems to me, each institutional self-love aside particularly leave.</seg>
<seg>For Finland it is for example from fundamental importance that Russia is included into the present agreements.</seg>
<seg>That concerns both the stricter requirements to the construction the regulations for the Klassifikationsgesellschaften, intensified by oil tank ships, better rules for port state control and, which will likewise be a result.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! Today we speak about ship security on lake on the basis of three reports, to which I may congratulate the correspondents.</seg>
<seg>Which concerns the three fresh proposals to security on lake, then it is me an urgent need to congratulate the three correspondents: They have new measures in very much short time the proof for it furnished that our parliament is firmly decided, for the increase of maritime safety to discharge for strengthening control and aggravation of the construction requirements and that in the future types of disaster cannot be accepted any longer.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin! A series of high-grade ship disasters, particularly with oiling anchors, met our continent in recent past heavily.</seg>
<seg>More than 80% of the accidents are to be due to human error, but for the human error there are reasons, which social kind are.</seg>
<seg>Someone spoke of “traceability”.</seg>
<seg>With the guideline to port state control the adherence to international standards to be controlled and no new regulations are to be introduced.</seg>
<seg>In request for modification 18 port state control is set to the rest periods of the sailors in relationship. The implementation of the provisions over the work time of sailors is however already taken off by the existing directive 99/95 completely.</seg>
<seg>I see with pleasure that the correspondent built a reference to the system to the evaluation of the conditions into request for modification 21, and we agree with the suggested main axis of effort, but must be worked some more on the formulations, in order to make the whole clearer.</seg>
<seg>Request for modification 4 and the part in request 18, taking on point “K” purchase, are not acceptable.</seg>
<seg>I can insure you that a shipowner intends, that at such flag states register to let a ship, these its intention, as soon as our proposal into force is, to consider should.</seg>
<seg>The commissioners 18 minutes long spoke and in this time dozens and dozens and dozens of articles quoted and the position of the Commission showed.</seg>
<seg>Proposal for a Council Decision of of the European parliament and the advice over a package of measures concerning the transeuropäische net for the collection, production and spreading of the statistics inside and except-joint goods traffic (Edicom) (KOM (00) 0458 - C5-0401/00 - 2000/0201 (COD)) (Economic Committee and currency)</seg>
<seg>By withdrawing thus the resolution request, I would like to express however the conviction that our parliament of its voice could have provided better, if it had placed a special and resolution request separate regarding the European Council meeting by Nice to the so important and difficult questions of the diplomatic conference instead of her for hearing in the context of only one, also all other items on the agenda of the summit comprehensive resolution to treat.</seg>
<seg>(There more than twelve delegates rose from their places, the oral amendment are not considered.) (the parliament accepts the resolution request.</seg>
<seg>Report (A5-0337/2000) of Mrs. Sauquillo Pérez del Arco in the behalf of the Committee on Development and co-operation over the relations of the European Union with the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the commission on these relations (2000/2051 (INI))</seg>
<seg>I did as indication of the protest, because the European Union is not able to intervene in this range yet in such a way, as it would have this actually.</seg>
<seg>Although neither the proposal to the change of the valid guideline to the port state State of still the report of Watt the actual requirements become fair, they contain some aspects pointing into the right direction. Therefore we, tuned the European delegate of the Communist Party of Greece for the report.</seg>
<seg>From there it is unfortunate that in the Commission proposal the idea was not taken up furnish a real European coastal supervising authority according to the model in the United States of the existing “coast guards”.</seg>
<seg>Essential condition for safety of ships, the Protecting life on lake and the environment are the fight of the Zügellosigkeit of the shipowners, stringent measures as a check of the condition of the ships, the hard punishment of ship companies, which offend against the safety regulations, the improvement of the conditions of work of the sailors, their purposeful training as well as a composition of the crew such that them are able to become fair to the ships the increased requirements.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately the correspondent Hatzidakis makes the exact opposite.</seg>
<seg>The accident of the “Erika” in December 1999 brought the question of security on lake on the political agenda to the community, and the commission suggested these texts, on which we co-ordinated today, nearly one year after the devastating accident, on urge of the European parliament.</seg>
<seg>The present compensation funds are equipped in insufficient measure; that became only too clearly with the disaster the Braer, with which the fishery industry of the Shetland islands was not sufficiently compensated for their losses.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, I had already mentioned that I drove in former times to sea.</seg>
<seg>The proposals of the correspondent, which aim at a harmonization on European level, can be only positive.</seg>
<seg>The range concerned is very important, since it concerns the ship classification companies.</seg>
<seg>This would be rather a major success, because on eve of enlargement we do not need rigid supranational Europe, which hierarchical and is, but a flexible, the peoples close Europe, which relies on the attention of the national democracies.</seg>
<seg>The struggle for power between numbers of Member, delivered ever more strongly in the public, adjusts the view of possible compromises.</seg>
<seg>In Nice the main task consists to guarantee in the fact that the institutions of the European Union work efficiently.</seg>
<seg>I personally expect in one week to the taking place summit hopeful!</seg>
<seg>I am also not for an automatic linkage of vote with qualified majority and joint decision and believe also here that each resolution must be met to extend the joint decision power for each individual case.</seg>
<seg>With the amendment to Article 133 of the contract of Amsterdam Europe would expand the votes with qualified majority, which are valid at present in the advice for the trade, since other ranges like in common-economical services, intellectual property, health or education.</seg>
<seg>Thus the parliament deprives itself the right to influencing control, keeps still and is silent in Ehrerbietung in relation to the partynesses, the national obligation feeling and the governments and forgets thereby its obligations opposite the citizens.</seg>
<seg>Beyond that I was correct against a text, which demands incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental into the future Treaty, which in Nice am accepted.</seg>
<seg>It is an error to divide the union in two classes. Therefore I cannot endorse that a third of the member states progresses faster.</seg>
<seg>Its new role rang the end of the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.</seg>
<seg>In this report there is much, to which the British conservative ones can give their support. That applies particularly to the reproduction, which is put on the enlargement of the Union.</seg>
<seg>The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament support the report over the implementation of a common European safety and defense policy.</seg>
<seg>In addition, against peoples European Union, which the new defence expenditure, to which the report refers, in any case financiers to have and those the guarantee not even have that these armed forces are not used a daily in the name of the “maintenance of the order” against it.</seg>
<seg>The proposal is just as serious that a state, which would not like itself to take part in a task is obligated, to make a financial contribution which is divided under at this war the participating States.</seg>
<seg>With military means there is no solution from the outside, because they repair neither the cause of conflict nor cause them a reversal in the public opinion.</seg>
<seg>That military operations should to be supposed to be financed from a household line of the community and the member states a financial contribution for such tasks carry out, even if they do not wish to take part (sales 49 and 50).</seg>
<seg>On the other hand it would stand for the European Union well to face, if it would concentrate the priorities of the Peter uphill gifts to turn around and more on civilian and humanitarian solution models.</seg>
<seg>I support this report of my colleague Maj Britt Theorin.</seg>
<seg>But the needs of this group are only put forward, in order after demand the “fiscal to state (n) removability of household services” and the “adjustment of the prices and costs to the financial resources of the private people”.</seg>
<seg>It is actually incredible that we in 21. Century still to recommend it should that the member states for domestics should ensure requirement on social security and appropriate old-age pension.</seg>
<seg>For many young people moonlighting threatens to become the first contact with the job market.</seg>
<seg>It is worst, if it still concerns in addition women from far countries, which accepted this work perforce and no other possibility to see of denying their living costs.</seg>
<seg>The reform of the Commission will be judged by its results, from there the necessity for regular progress reports of the commission during the entire program duration and the meaning for December 2002 of the expected complete balance.</seg>
<seg>Before not too long time it due to different scandals and management weaknesses came in March 1999 to the resignation of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg>Finally consider I it absolutely necessary to remind of the fact that we expect at the same time larger consequence and larger transparency of the commission with their daily administrative activity, in addition, a larger sense of responsibility for its part from this for the future of necessary reform under strict restriction on it transferred the competencies.</seg>
<seg>The conservative ones endorse also the statement in paragraph 7 of the report that democratic control is to ensure and to be made the system of the three columns functional.</seg>
<seg>(The meeting is closed at 13.15 o'clock.)</seg>
<seg>We received the information - and I want to add directly, I can her at all believe - that advice and French president the only 30 minutes here will tomorrow be, in order to talk.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I exclude one I detailed and reasoned opinion.</seg>
<seg>We should co-ordinate in any case, and I am personal for a resolution, as this Mr. Poettering, Mr. Lannoye and other one to have suggested.</seg>
<seg>On these texts into the night inside one worked, which is valid likewise for the numerical allocation of voice in the advice and the allocation of seats in the parliament.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, I would like to plead with reproduction not to paint this report de Roo from the agenda to because he was very well prepared. On the last environment summit during the French council presidency on coming Monday and Tuesday for this a common position is compiled.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, Mr. Parish.</seg>
<seg>In the committee for Foreign Affairs, human rights, Common Security and defense policy, whose chairman is he, it smokes also frequently.</seg>
<seg>The political basis is clear: Harmonization of the market with consideration of a high health and consumer protection level, constructing on existing legal regulations and new scientific realizations.</seg>
<seg>Their living conditions and view of life goes around, in which the health protection attains ever greater importance.</seg>
<seg>This rule knows exactly the same on all in the spare time consumed, however not harmless drugs to be used, if no other except the person consuming these drugs one impairs.</seg>
<seg>Straight ones went yesterday in the United States processes against multinational tobacco companies with a condemnation because of poisoning and false informations over the innocuity of the products to end.</seg>
<seg>Concerning the cigarettes, which are forbidden in the European Union for health reasons, but from the European Union to be exported, we represent the view that the completion of these exports is the only correct and consistent one.</seg>
<seg>Instead of drawing the teachings from the defeat from 9 October this yearly in Luxembourg, we remain with an attitude, which is legally not durable.</seg>
<seg>I belonged myself completely exactly, which said the committee member to Mr. Hume: “No substantial losses of one's job in this sector.</seg>
<seg>There is the parliament and the advice, which have to approve of this guideline proposal and among other things to examine the legal basis suitable for it.</seg>
<seg>I do not believe that one may follow a as narrow way, because independently of contents - which are substantial as Mr. leading seamen and others pointed exist the danger out that this parliament, for which advice and the institutions for community in their whole, if this parliament and the advice accept by the leader of the parliamentary group of European People and restrictive interpretation suggested by Mrs. Palacio Vallelersundi, in the legislative work of the institutions for community, which is so important for the development of the Community law, hands and feet will be bound.</seg>
<seg>Its weakness lies in the fact that the emphasis is on the promotion of free competition.</seg>
<seg>To the conclusion the following: Since the Amsterdamer contract is the European Parliament authorized to coordinate questions of the environmental and consumer protection and it will co-operate naturally closely in this regard with advice and commission.</seg>
<seg>Indeed that has to actually do nothing with tobacco, but the decision of the EuGH could have been issued just as well for instance to an advertising prohibition for alcohol or to an advertising prohibition for chocolate, since as well known also sugar can be injurious to health.</seg>
<seg>I do not understand simply that more generous export regulations would bring a majority in of this parliament want, than one of the own governments of the Member intended actual those governments, that represent nevertheless also the many industries, to which refers.</seg>
<seg>Proven that 80% the smoker want to stop to offer but have the tobacco industry only few strategies in order these people are to be supported thereby.</seg>
<seg>If we persist to prescribe for other countries which health standards should set it, by expanding our sensible proposals for the domestic market since exports, then place we the whole excellent work of Mr. leading seamen in question.</seg>
<seg>We endorse the execution of this test by a test laboratory accredited in a country according to a uniform method recognized European Union far.</seg>
<seg>The effects of tobacco on the health are now far away appreciative, and legislators and public are to be issued as it were come at the conclusion that it is at the time, strict rules and rules to this product.</seg>
<seg>The community regulations will insert themselves for this reason very well into the future international rules and the risk away of developing from trade barriers will thus turn, at the same time the consumer protection will strengthen and a high health level will guarantee.</seg>
<seg>Rather should be waiting, until the overall question of the additives in the first Commission report is treated.</seg>
<seg>Regarding laboratory tests the request for modification is redundant over the permission of tests, since in another article it is fixed that only such goods may be brought in circulation, which correspond to the provisions of the directive.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, this report is completely clear: At present the period of validity from guidelines is years limited only in each case, following to the summer time to five must it the parliament for extension be submitted again.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, loves colleagues and colleagues! The proposal for a directive to the regulation of the summer time, which we examine today, hold I for an excellent proposal.</seg>
<seg>I mean from there that we should be in this house with this topic not too for a long time, nevertheless the member states and also the population the regulation of the summer time already to a large extent accepted, and she was recognized as part of our yearly rhythm.</seg>
<seg>I am for the fact that the questions concerning the time belts and the harmonization of the summer time regulations, as suggested, in the power of decision of the member states remains.</seg>
<seg>It would suggest more the summer time at the end of of Septembers, about six months after its beginning to terminate.</seg>
<seg>We endorse appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the 2007 report which can be provided, as mentions in article 5.</seg>
<seg>It is gotten straight that interferences cannot be accepted into the human germ course.</seg>
<seg>We will have, if we agree this compromise, still a regulation, which ensures the therapeutic progress and which protection of patients in Europe leaves not only in such a way, as it is, but improved, and therefore I plead for this compromise.</seg>
<seg>These groups must fall also further into the range of application of the guideline.</seg>
<seg>I am pleased in addition, that we succeeded here to put for the germ course therapy forward a bolt.</seg>
<seg>I would like to congratulate the correspondent, Mr. Liese, to its report and thank him for his efforts around a compromise in view of the contrasts.</seg>
<seg>These programs concern the Krebsbekämpfung, the prevention of AIDS, craze prevention and the health promotion. Their abort would mean the end of the appropriate plans and the work of the creative networks.</seg>
<seg>It is extraordinarily favorable, the ground before to be prepared, in order as rapidly as possible advanced and, even if a second reading is necessary to approach as far as possible the point at which a decision be met can.</seg>
<seg>The moreover we must consider that both the prevention and promotion and the monitoring to become ever more important, and therefore must them greater importance be measured out and a higher budget for it be planned.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin! On the occasion of the report Trakatellis for the extension of the present European schemes within the range of the public health would like I mean concern over the direction to express, in which the European policy within the range of the public health moves.</seg>
<seg>I experienced that also the advice signaled its fundamental agreement.</seg>
<seg>In the European Union now the paradoxical situation prevails that the internal borders were abolished for the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, which are maintained 15 borders however further in the ranges police and law in criminal actions. Their removal is made more difficult by the member states.</seg>
<seg>It remains concluding noting that the initiative represents a genuine and a significant progress with the creation of a European criminal law area. Even if it covers only subranges and their effect is limited, it deals nevertheless with the actual needs of very many European citizens, who stood to date practically helplessly there, if they became outside of the territory of their country of residence victims of a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg>What did we demand for these humans?</seg>
<seg>Simultaneous is to be ensured that the specialists, who notice the direct contacts to the victims receive a special training.</seg>
<seg>Victims may become not twice victim, only victim of the crime and then still the system.</seg>
<seg>In this connection it is also important that the members, who are informed family of the victim, discretely and professionally about circumstances and, if desired, also on the necessary support to count to be able, and that they do not have to experience everything from the press.</seg>
<seg>That is valid independently of the kind of the crime.</seg>
<seg>We may go off neither on national nor on European Union level ever the basic principle that an individual must always carry the responsibility for its own actions.</seg>
<seg>In other cases it could be necessary to procure the necessary information in a language of the Union which is not their own.</seg>
<seg>I are pleased me over well-meaning reaction parliament on this first text to such important topic, so that the area of freedom, which offers security and the right, which we establish straight, our fellow citizens protection in situations, with which one often only with trouble gets along.</seg>
<seg>Vote over the urgency</seg>
<seg>(The parliament rejects the urgency.)</seg>
<seg>Thus we agreed at the night of 23. to 24 November with the advice on the corner points of a household, which is surely not glossful, but quite reasonably.</seg>
<seg>The commission had suggested therefore also a revision around 300 millions euro. The advice resisted with hands and feet.</seg>
<seg>But I white also from discussions that it is more difficult around a multiple, to formulate a negotiatable advice position a mandate to get and the pure national egoism into a to some extent reasonable and justifiable totalEuropean decision flow to let.</seg>
<seg>I hope that the work for a common recruitment office, as it means on new German thus a European attitude authority, also really advance, thus we the problems, which in the next years to all institutions come - on the advice exactly the same as on the commission, who parliament and also the other institutions -, i.e. the personnel requirements of the coming years, together master.</seg>
<seg>The advice refuses this revision - now we should have actually the data - and I would like to warn it as a precaution: The flexibility instrument in two sequential years - actually in less as fifteen months and the first time less than six months after acceptance of the financial perspective - to take up, weakens the flexibility instrument financially, because it prevents its re-establishment and possible cumulation, which are intended up to a height of 600 million.</seg>
<seg>This considerable amount, which is owed the high need in the year 2001, can be financed in particular by the recourse to of the flexibility instrument at a value of 200 million euros.</seg>
<seg>With consideration of this new circumstances the advice in second reading accepted a household, which exhibits an increase around 2,5%.</seg>
<seg>Before you discharge this household finally, I would like to still emphasize, the advice attaches which importance to the adherence to some fundamental household rules regarding the attitude of means into the reserve, the legal basis and the organization of the expenditures.</seg>
<seg>And contrary to Nice are, believe I, all three institutions - European Parliament, advice and commission - with the result under the line quite contently.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and Gentlemen! Renewed finding of cattle BSE gotten sick made also necessarily for the household range immediate acting, i.e. with the health protection, with the consumer protection, in addition, with the assistance for the farmers concerned by this situation.</seg>
<seg>In all other respects the advice determined a multi-annual amount, which represents only one appoximate value for the master program to the support for the reconstruction in the west Balkans, but stands with the financial perspective in agreement.</seg>
<seg>With tendencies and choking we drove out still another few millions euro more.</seg>
<seg>Mean sincere thanks at Mrs. Haug.</seg>
<seg>Remember from there that this 1% of the household of the European Union are very well used.</seg>
<seg>If I understood you correctly, then you said the fact that we may not use the reserve because against the rules offends.</seg>
<seg>I think thus, we beside much different one, which I cannot mention now because of short time, very good things saw.</seg>
<seg>While the agricultural spending, which almost constitutes half of the entire household, grows with consideration of the correction letter also in the coming year still over over 5%, the growth of the entire household amounts to only 3.5%.</seg>
<seg>We see the large danger now already that in the next years the argument between MEDA, Mediterranean neighboring state projects and the Balkans will increase, although we know all nevertheless that straight urgently funds are used there.</seg>
<seg>Contently over the difficulties to have overcome to act itself on the way to the objective the up-piled up to fulfill the obligations entered in Helsinki opposite the applicant countries to shift without blowing up the union, and future Europe into the conditions further efficiently.</seg>
<seg>But progress was obtained, real progresses, even if these do not go so far, like the presidency - those, as I would like to mark, proved national seen a large openness - would have wished.</seg>
<seg>For the statute of the European parties a new legal basis is intended, and the parliament receives the right of the complaint collection in accordance with article 230 of the contract.</seg>
<seg>In the last months three significant steps were done forward.</seg>
<seg>This is the goal of the explanation in this connection accepted in Nice and the introductory considerations, in order to coordinate the fight against doping on European level.</seg>
<seg>To the ecological hazards belongs - as all-side actual admits climate warming.</seg>
<seg>In Nice the European Union used further the constant committees necessary for the determination and guidance of a common outside and security policy: a political and Sicherheitspoli committee, a military committee as well as a European military staff.</seg>
<seg>For this co-operation, for your support and also for us granted the admission Ladies and Gentlemen delegate, thanks you, Mrs. Präsidentin, the French presidency.</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>Now we must examine the text in the parliament carefully.</seg>
<seg>I refer besides to it, Mr. President of the European Council that the cost are borne by the taxpayers.</seg>
<seg>I regard it as failure not only regarding of the European Union announced the ambitious objective changing the institutions and improving the efficiency of the European Union, in order to be able to accept the new members duly, but also regarding a further major objective, which was emphasized perhaps too few, i.e. regarding the approach of the European Union and the citizens.</seg>
<seg>The right questions are in our opinion those, which the impressing crowd moved, which had together-flowed out completely on eve of the summit Europe into Nice.</seg>
<seg>First the fifteen signed the Grundrechtecharte overhastyly in a tränengasgeschwängerten atmosphere.</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>My parliamentary group is disappointed of the present Treaty and over the future, which it brings us, concerned. Therefore we will fight with all forces against it.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Sie have the word.</seg>
<seg>Finally I would like to answer Mr. Hager that the instrument of intensified co-operation is in my opinion useful, in order to arrange Europe more dynamic and sound out the way, as it formulated a while ago - I believe - Romano Prodi. I meinerseits endorse this completely.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I would like to know gladly whether the competence of the European parliament for the summer time is a new achievement after Nice.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps so far the pharmaceutical enterprises deterrent by the complexity of the clinical trials by the states like also by our parliament to the expression will brought are clearly encouraged to develop the market for pädiatrische medicines even if these enough is not large, in order to secure the return on the investment!</seg>
<seg>. (FR) Is the summer time regulation, which was introduced at the time of the oil crisis for reasons of the energy conservation and extended until 2001, to be resumed?</seg>
<seg>Always the position of crime victim is not effectively protected in criminal procedures.</seg>
<seg>This European initiative will benefit from there numerous travelers and holiday-makers.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, initially I would like to greet the commission president Prodi, which stays among us, as well as the advice presidency, which enters the straight hall, and to underline that in this house probably still never such a concord showed itself in the evaluation of the results of a summit.</seg>
<seg>Europe, which is in motion, is that one, which carried its work out in six crucial areas under the French presidency in six months, as seems to me, despite everything.</seg>
<seg>Above all however I fear that Great Britain, France and Germany now able will be, in run of decades between states of different size and between the organs obtained delicate balance to disturb.</seg>
<seg>It is difficult to recognize, to what extent the resolutions of Nice actually facilitate the extension of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, loves colleagues and colleagues! I can make it very short today.</seg>
<seg>From all this I can draw only the conclusions the fact that I, if on the present Treaty by Nice should be co-ordinated will be correct with no.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! The main result from Nice was that despite everything a contract came and now place for the candidate countries be created can.</seg>
<seg>The real winners of this conference are the Mr. Blair and Aznar, the gentlemen, “no” say to Europe.</seg>
<seg>Thus we forget Nice and arrange we our views of post office Nice. Permit me to set my hope for the project of a large convention announced by Belgium for its presidency because proved: We must go new ways, we need a new method, we must history accelerate, because 2004 are too late, lie in to far distance, bring too many dangers with itself.</seg>
<seg>Instead the spirit of Nice existed to ask oneself obviously how one can block, how can one intergouvernementalisieren, as can one thus at home as defenders of the national interests to be celebrated be able to really make progress with instead of providing for it, the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Of which we stand to Amsterdam and Nice, are Europe of the realm princes, Europe of the national administrations and not Europe of the political agreement.</seg>
<seg>With the fundamental issues we cannot do longer without votes with qualified majority.</seg>
<seg>It is correct that - I lean to the words of Mr. Bayrou on I since this morning sit here here, first at the side of the President of the Republic, now in own thing, and from all sides it hails criticisms, moderate, friendly criticisms, as seems to me, but in any case criticisms.</seg>
<seg>One may not forget that it is actually the first time since 1957 that this pattern was really reformed or transformed.</seg>
<seg>We have to do it with constitutional systems, and from there the authority cannot be mixed.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, Mr. Minister.</seg>
<seg>But it was taken up neither to the contracts, nor there is a mention of the Charter in the article 6 paragraph 2 of the Treaty on European Union.</seg>
<seg>In the end still some positive aspects are mentioned, for example the revised version of article 7 of the contract, the article over political parties and their statute, the right of the parliament to sue the other organs with the Court of Justice - a major factor of political control -, the new formula for the European Commission, the admission of the “Lex so called Prodi” in the contract, the stabilization of the president and the new composition of the commission. All represents a reasonable compromise, which I accept and which will work surely.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! We already made an uncompromising evaluation its that happened in Nice.</seg>
<seg>We regard the things: The Charter was taken up not to treaty system, not even a reference.</seg>
<seg>We want to prove to the heads of government that we can do it better.</seg>
<seg>Regardless of the self-praise this morning the diplomatic conference was evenly not brought to the French presidency to a successful conclusion.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, it is not so simple to criticize now the French advice presidency since it is not present.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, the summit of Nice showed that the model of the diplomatic conference has retired.</seg>
<seg>Budget 2001 (continuation)</seg>
<seg>That does not mean however, one could not have made still more and some not also better.</seg>
<seg>The commission is forced by such upper limits to set in the context of a limited budget emphasis as this must do each authority.</seg>
<seg>With the vote following on this discussion longer and complex process of the adoption of resolutions goes over the household of the European Union for the year 2001 to end.</seg>
<seg>Therefore we proceeded as follows: Resorting to article 272 we avoided a household crisis. The financial perspective was maintained despite employment of the flexibility instrument.</seg>
<seg>Addressed to the advice, I would like to say that us with this play so fast the balls will not go out and that we will so for a long time play, until we obtained the desired result.</seg>
<seg>We do not want that the resolution Colom already contains a revision proposal for the coming year, because we want to wait for the estimate of the World Bank, but we divide its criticism that a solution distorts the multiyear character of the major objectives of the external politics policies of the union and also the definition of the financial perspective in this way regarding the financial Unterausstattung of the column 4.</seg>
<seg>In order to reach all this, in order to be able to fulfill our term commitments, also in the future emphasis must be set.</seg>
<seg>Only like that the money, which is to us for ours fellow citizen inside and fellow citizens at the disposal, is meaningfully and correctly put on.</seg>
<seg>If we already take the supplementary budget into account which can be expected, then them will lie with nearly 8%, during we in all other ranges - it is the educational policy, is it the whole range of the internal policy, including research, the foreign policy, the administration, which Vorbeitrittshilfe - altogether only a growth rate of 1,1% have.</seg>
<seg>Since co-operation is so good, we will then have the opportunity with the supplementary budget already in January to continue it.</seg>
<seg>Equally we welcome it, if at the yet not regulated relations between Russia and the Baltic states criticism is geübt.</seg>
<seg>With considerable interest we pursue the social and domestic development of Russia.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, loves colleagues and colleagues! The common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Even if president Putin guarantees opposite us the democratic development of his country, it is thereby not automatically guarantor for a sturdy and democratic Russia. Still the democratic order is not lived reality in Russia.</seg>
<seg>We should not do however secretly, it are valid rather to develop Europe of economic co-operation.</seg>
<seg>Which concerns the Caucasus, then Mr. Van Orden is right completely.</seg>
<seg>Who regards Russia from the outside and gets then punctually also direct impressions of the country and of Russian interlocutors, is fast in danger to explain selectively as the reality of the country what straight into its Russia picture fits.</seg>
<seg>On political field the common strategy suggests Russia entering a permanent dialogue over politics and security and creating but a permanent mechanism.</seg>
<seg>I would like to underline hereby that we must make really clear, Russia actually in a political union with Belarus am.</seg>
<seg>Are you, Mr. Patten, ready to support such a project?</seg>
<seg>As the delegates know, on the recent summit between the European Union and Russia by Romano Prodi a ranging dialogue was set to questions of the energy on.</seg>
<seg>I hope much that I will have at the beginning of the next yearly opportunity to visit even Kaliningrad not only, because Immanuel Kant spent its whole life there.</seg>
<seg>I again congratulate the Mr. Abgeordneten to an excellent report over an extremely important topic, to which we will turn in the coming years here in the parliament surely repetitive.</seg>
<seg>They bring me into one much difficult situation.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! I would like to say that this debate is already very necessary, because the BSE crisis has huge implications on animal feeds, on cultivation and import of animal feeds.</seg>
<seg>The advice brought on the occasion of its numerous meetings with Russia on all levels its concern to the expression to move in particular in order the Russian Government to avoid excessive use of force as well as a possible expansion of the conflict independent and effective investigations of the violations of human rights to accomplish, to the group of supports of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Euro with the fulfillment of her mission assistance to carry out and finally also for the transport of the humanitarian assistance ensure.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! To the agenda: It is actually also usual in the house that questions, which can be verbally not sufficiently answered are supplied later in writing.</seg>
<seg>(Interruption by Mr. Posselt)</seg>
<seg>This guideline originates from the year 1992.</seg>
<seg>And in this sense we must work.</seg>
<seg>These groups were taken up however obviously not to the fresh proposal with.</seg>
<seg>The presidency and some member states already received several letters to the Commission proposal, which will consider it with their consultation from the federation of the European sugar industry.</seg>
<seg>Inquires No. 6 of (H-0886/00):</seg>
<seg>As the first I must say that the acting Council President did not answer in my opinion the inquiry of Mr. Korakas yet.</seg>
<seg>Now it is valid to furnish this authority and I believe that the European authorities of the problem are very probably conscious and that we must advance.</seg>
<seg>In order to bring it on the point, the Presidency representative, in this case thus Ambassador Frankreichs in Algeria, met with Mr. M. Ahmed Taleb?</seg>
<seg>We welcome and of the general assembly the decided definitions for the accreditation, suggested in this connection of the preparation committee, of the non-governmental organizations to the preparation process and for special meeting in September 2001.</seg>
<seg>The text over the entry partnership contains several references to European Convention for the protection of the human rights and basic freedoms.</seg>
<seg>As the advice already stated opposite the delegate in its preceding answer, the process will permit a better protection of the rights of persons to the mutual recognition of criminal decisions.</seg>
<seg>I would like to after-hook however.</seg>
<seg>He takes over in particular political control and the strategic line of an military operation for crisis management.</seg>
<seg>I would like to remind only of the fact that the system of the contract makes a difference between the treatment of indirect taxations, for their harmonization for the establishment and single market work is located necessarily to actual in such a way it in article 93 - and the adjustment - in accordance with article 94 - those legislation, which affects the establishment and operation of the single market directly, and to it belongs to direct taxes.</seg>
<seg>I would like to say some few words to these three key ranges.</seg>
<seg>If the behavior pattern that in the doubt everyone fights against everyone, remains, could blow up this the stability pact for South-east Europe, which develops on regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg>We need finally also co-operation with Yugoslavia, a mutual co-operation.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! Our parliamentary group supports the work of Mr. Baltas in connection with the report on the possibility of the Aushandlung of a stabilization and an association agreement with the Republic of Croatia.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! In the years, in which I was a president of the parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I had to accompany opportunity, many Croats in their efforts around freedom and prosperity, her, as other peoples of our continent equated, with its integration into the European institutions.</seg>
<seg>On the basis of the development of Croatia in this year, I am convinced of the fact that we should succeed to submit a taut speed because exactly that did Croatia in the past months.</seg>
<seg>That is anyhow the beginning, and the speed, pursued by us, with which we adjusted ourselves in the last months to the development in Croatia, confirms this.</seg>
<seg>We are guilty it to humans in Croatia that we support them and their government in the coming years generally, and we are very grateful to the Mr. Abgeordneten for the fact that it recommends us to continue the hit way.</seg>
<seg>In this connection it is incomprehensible that in the spring thousands of supporters of the Laskar Dschihad could pull this yearly on the Molukken, in order to heat the conflicts up also there.</seg>
<seg>On Timor militias refuse to the refugees the return and to aides are threatened.</seg>
<seg>The behalf of the Committee on Industry, foreign trade, research and energy I would like to only enter on three points.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Mr. Kommissar, admired colleagues and colleagues! First I would like to congratulate the colleague MaijWeggen to its excellent work.</seg>
<seg>To that extent it does not represent an exception.</seg>
<seg>Continuous acts of violence on the Molukken, in Aceh and in Irian Jaya bring large suffering over the population.</seg>
<seg>Tomorrow the solemn award of the Sakharov price will take place here.</seg>
<seg>Due to recent messages from the Indonesian archipelago upon nevertheless the question forces itself, whether the situation is not even still more precarious still more seriously, for president Wahid and its fellow combatant, as of the Berichterstatterin described.</seg>
<seg>If we want to help Indonesia, then we must do that now with money and acts. Words alone are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion the present report in this point carries important clearing-up work out.</seg>
<seg>It is obvious that the difficulties of the country can be overcome not today on tomorrow.</seg>
<seg>Protection of the financial interests of the Communities</seg>
<seg>The obstacles for its independent activity, particularly also in the personnel recruitment and in its structured structure, must be finally eliminated.</seg>
<seg>The commission must true-make therefore by an internal reform process finally their announcement that frauds are not tolerated and each fraud are consistently pursued.</seg>
<seg>I think, exactly that must actually the consequence be, also by Nice.</seg>
<seg>We welcome negotiations between the member states over the adjustment of the legal rules within the range crime, but we would not like to subordinate our countries of a federal European Union accusation authority.</seg>
<seg>In addition I would know gladly, why the publication of the Commission document was retarded to this topic until one day after the Danish popular vote over the euros.</seg>
<seg>I requested to specify these countries in particular because it is in my opinion at the time, it to the pillory to place.</seg>
<seg>I am actually sure that straight also OLAF is interested to arrange the selection of higher high-level personnel transparency.</seg>
<seg>We must watch out however that we do not survey our own with all concentration on the problems with the Commission, nevertheless nevertheless quite major problems. We have likewise problems.</seg>
<seg>We try to delete the fire and suffocate thereby the smoke.</seg>
<seg>Nobody can understand that, also I not.</seg>
<seg>So that this goal is in every respect achieved, I would like to deal with four questions, which played in my opinion a leading role with the work of the household board of control.</seg>
<seg>For the parliament lies the problem with the contract.</seg>
<seg>It is correct already precariously, if the commission, Mrs. Kommissarin, when guardian of the Treaties to the adherence to the right of Members explicitly must be referred.</seg>
<seg>It has the possibility of approving for a certain period concerning no central transfers the questionable household lines in particular such, which aim at the heightening of the means inserted into the budget, until further internal investigations are final. It can request even the commission president to require the resignation from committee members to in their surrounding field serious problems was determined - a kind European Union Caesarian.</seg>
<seg>The report demands detailed stocktakings of the operational activities, thorough examinations of household lines and irregularities as well as commission intern performance assessment.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Kommissarin, Ausgangspunkt of the transmission of information to the European Parliament is the EEC contract and not the inter+institutional agreement.</seg>
<seg>The result of this common position would be it however, if it were not changed that we do not only have no weapon equality at the end in relation to North America, but not even within Europe.</seg>
<seg>I would not know at all, why should not succeed here, as succeeded with all other guidelines, at the end a compromise to bring.</seg>
<seg>It is a proposal, which is afraid a long and, I, stormy way put back, in order to overcome some the existing difficulties.</seg>
<seg>The first amendment concerns article 4, in which the question of the responsible supervisory authority for the offer is regulated.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand that would donate now us present proposal confusion and would release a search for the most favorable in each case area of jurisdiction as well as potential law cases to one during the assumption of an enterprise quite to delicate moment.</seg>
<seg>In the United Kingdom with assumptions the voluntary code of conduct ordered by the assumption committee worked in the best way. It is a good example of it, as with one extremely complex issue, for which a statutory regulation is suitable less well, pragmatically to be gone around can.</seg>
<seg>Far more importantly it is however that we should succeed to make progress with the task of the creation of a competitive dynamic European economy formulated in Lisbon.</seg>
<seg>The large areas of conflict go to executive committee in the assumption right, for example versus shareholders, large shareholders versus small shareholders, enterprises versus capital market to regulate in a minimum form European for us here in the European Parliament in the long run around it.</seg>
<seg>The text of the common position of the advice is improved by some requests for modification submitted by the parliament, as to points, which could lead to interpretation difficulties, refers and is demanded a brisker implementation of the directive.</seg>
<seg>It is not certain by any means that the suggested definition of a reasonable price is better than another, because the different at present definitions valid in the member states are all together quite meaningful.</seg>
<seg>The discussion is closed.</seg>
<seg>Beyond that the artist a right to information is awarded to get to know its requirements within one period of up to three years with a professional art dealer which is meaningful, since they must keep account of on and sales.</seg>
<seg>Therefore here the Austrian legislator is not to be attacked in demand and European legislator, which creates only the basic conditions positive for artists and auctioneers.</seg>
<seg>Beyond that the necessity for a common point of view is all the larger with the topic, with which we are concerned, since only such makes possible it for the European Union to use itself on international level seriously for the fact that the interests of artists are world-wide protected.</seg>
<seg>I trust in the wisdom and the long-sightedness of this house.</seg>
<seg>Thus 1998 in Germany only 274 profited from 7,000 artists, who had retired their rights, of follower genuine, whereby 40% of the amount were allotted to collection and administratives expense.</seg>
<seg>Briefly said, there is not any harmonization need in this range.</seg>
<seg>A similar request for modification had been already rejected in first reading.</seg>
<seg>One assumed the translations could be supplied later despite this quite pushed and difficult time schedule.</seg>
<seg>Only are we now so far that we cannot unfortunately shift this no more.</seg>
<seg>We suggested in the committee doing this one year in former times.</seg>
<seg>Naturally this parliament supports the values mentioned and it will also continue to defend.</seg>
<seg>Due to technological developments as well as the changed markets inevitably a change will take place.</seg>
<seg>There we cannot find an argument, in order to exclude the competition.</seg>
<seg>The reduction of the principal item of the post office sector, thus the universal service, on which transport from correspondences to a weight limit of 50 g would cause for the national post office operators seriously the danger to be able to ensure no universal service to a reasonable price for the total population in all regions to more.</seg>
<seg>I may remind my colleagues of the conservative ones in this parliament of the mess, which they arranged in the United Kingdom, when they wanted to privatize the British post office.</seg>
<seg>From the safety net for the post office customers we made a hammock for these large-scale enterprises of the post office, which can rest therein and do further that, what them are still permitted.</seg>
<seg>With this result I am very content, because one wanted to exclude the new technologies with the term of the special services from the range of the universal service.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin, Mr. Bolkestein, we know and that will not tolerate.</seg>
<seg>The European Commission does not suggest therefore for the second stage also the complete liberalisation of the post office.</seg>
<seg>I would see such a future gladly also for other countries of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Bolkestein accused the Frenchman a unliberale attitude recently in the Netherlands press, then at least a newspaper article was called.</seg>
<seg>For this Spain could say somewhat, which furnished and took such funds up, i.e. it could itself to the uncertain legal bases of the fund, to which virtual criteria of its composition and to the discretionary decisions with its application express.</seg>
<seg>We are correct tomorrow, then I, for the request for modification of Mr. Atkins and/or of Mr. Sterckx, hope because otherwise I would see myself compelled to vote against the present report.</seg>
<seg>Royal Mail is involved in this competition and distributes my letters in Malmö, Sweden.</seg>
<seg>What do we have from the debate or rather from the controversy learned, the commissioner Bolkestein with its further pursuit of a liberalisation of the postal services with absence of any balance of the first phase and under injury of the rules planned in this guideline released? We learned that itself under the cover of progressive and revaluing terms - as for instance modernization, liberalisation or support of the technological upswing - which can hide dismantling of the social quality of a country.</seg>
<seg>The intended protection of the universal service by the mechanism of an equalization fund, over which private operators make contributions for the financing of the universal duties of the post office offerers in remote areas, could probably not be from existence.</seg>
<seg>These inadequacies and this delay contributed also to the fact that in the debate purpose and means are confounded often with one another.</seg>
<seg>We speak Mrs. Präsidentin, with the treatment of this affair of the economical and social cohesion.</seg>
<seg>Mrs. Präsidentin! Permit me as the first, the correspondent, Mr. Ferber, to congratulate because he naturally a complicated, hard work accomplished, with which he had to try, reconciliation between completely different proposals find attitudes as well as output and goals.</seg>
<seg>I fear, the consequence become its that the today's monopolists its position is more highly set at the expense of the taxpayers still further to strengthen to be able and the slat for new offerer some more.</seg>
<seg>I am pleased that our liberals of fellow party members from the other European countries support the position that British Liberals.</seg>
<seg>I actually consider the liberalisation desirable and welcome the benefits to consumers, which will result from it.</seg>
<seg>Entitled, because it inserts itself into the logic of the articles of association of the European Union, which place completion of the market by the free being and services in a competition-certain surrounding field into the foreground.</seg>
<seg>The supply of such a service forms the cornerstone of the Community policy within this range, and all our activities are aligned to the improvement of this service.</seg>
<seg>The special services are a wider key area, in which innovations must be promoted and the modernization be advanced.</seg>
<seg>He continued to say, he held the opening practically the entire post office market up to the end of this decade for inevitable.</seg>
<seg>I enter for the fact that the obligation is irrefutably fixed for the supply of a universal service and guaranteed also in the future.</seg>
<seg>For this reason and do not want I can watch not idle, if the future of this sector stands on the play, because we fulfill the tasks, which became to transfer us all into Lisbon, incorrectly.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, Mr. Simpson.</seg>
<seg>I remind you however of the fact that the priority objective of this common market organization consists of securing for its products an entrance warranty for the joint market.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately we could obtain unanimity in the agrarian committee in the long run. But thanks I mean colleagues as well as Mr. Fernández Martín, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee for development and co-operation, for their support.</seg>
<seg>For example we must also further our concern because of banana production in certain AKP countries, into which and in some countries of west Africa, express to small producer countries of the Antilles, which are traditional suppliers on the banana market and which in relation to we have obligations, which we may not forget.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I ask for the fact that this report in its whole, exactly the same as in the agriculture committee, by which members of this parliament is supported.</seg>
<seg>From the USA the historical reference periods originally, in the meantime however a solution with own historical reference periods had been rejected are endorsed.</seg>
<seg>Strong interests, in particular those the American, which are even no Bananenanbauer, which put however American capital into the trading ventures, play a role.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes it seems, as if the commission is with the proposals to the deregulation in the trade and in agricultural production in the international level even further from us as the Cairns group.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately commission and advice persist in a solution, which can endanger this production seriously, in particular after 2006.</seg>
<seg>In the different World Trade Organization decisions it does not mean that we may not grant preferential systems to our traditional suppliers.</seg>
<seg>The transition period area should amount to therefore about fifteen years, at least however ten years. In addition the balance aids must include an income warranty for the community producers and the paragraph of the production of the areas in ultra peripheral, what contains therefore also an assistance for the mechanisms, which marked bananas out produced there.</seg>
<seg>I hope, her sound myself our arguments now, because the system of the preference, even if it is determined at 300 euros, suggested by the commission, could prove in reality as rather ineffective, since the AKP producers are expenditure-braked by the wind dog procedure so called.</seg>
<seg>Votes</seg>
<seg>(The parliament approves of the Commission proposal.)</seg>
<seg>The commission rejects the remaining amendments.</seg>
<seg>Before the vote:</seg>
<seg>(The parliament accepts the verbal request for modification.)</seg>
<seg>Report (A5-0383/2000) of Mrs. Morgan in the behalf of the Committee for household control of the reform of the household inspection procedures and - instances (2000/2008 (INI))</seg>
<seg>Most smokers are itself neither over the full risk nor over the consequences of their doing in the clear one.</seg>
<seg>To it I adhered in my long parliamentary life from now 35 years always.</seg>
<seg>I am afraid however that this hope is futile.</seg>
<seg>This is our final attempt to clarify by labels and photographies on the cigarette packings the actual consequences of smoking.</seg>
<seg>Report seat-back (A5-0368/2000)</seg>
<seg>This is an estimate, which I relevant and correct consider still. Therefore I was correct against the report in its whole.</seg>
<seg>The Legal Affairs Committee and domestic market are completely right, if it persists in the refusal of the maximum limit and in a minimum amount, which may not be below 7%.</seg>
<seg>With its vote against this guideline my parliamentary group would like to that extent to set also a political respect character, when we may not be in the European Union thereby, redundant regulations to issue.</seg>
<seg>Of course does the former stalinistische dictatorship have to be condemned, but as one can give also only the smallest confidence to Mr. Putin, this executioner of the Chechnian people, this godfather of different Mafiaorganisationen, this head of state, who would like to eliminate any opposition and the civil society (trade unions, political parties), in order to strengthen its own power?</seg>
<seg>Actually Indonesia such an intensification of the relations was not characterised particularly to earn, because in the last years not to have the governments of this country straight by an high level to democracy or going by main merits, but we must have also the Indonesian citizens in the eye, why we welcome this intensification of the relations and this assistance.</seg>
<seg>This unit may be concerned only with criminal acts, which were committed by European Union persons employed.</seg>
<seg>. (FR) The report Theato over the fraud fight makes the statement for us possible that the European Central Bank, surely to the better proof their much quoted independence, judged an entry to the agreement over the office for fraud fight (OLAF) not meaningful.</seg>
<seg>Thus the vote is terminated.</seg>
<seg>We must see that there are only two possibilities: Either we belong to, or we do not belong to.</seg>
<seg>Colleagues and colleague loves, do not give us a cause for a change of name.</seg>
<seg>The pure tariff system is however an essential element, which provides for the balance of the commission proposal and which an important basis for it represents, so that one can get ahead at all in the advice.</seg>
<seg>Measures for the marketing of these bananas are in addition in the national and regional programmes to the promoting development of the rural area.</seg>
<seg>Europe and the United States co-operate with the defense of our common values closely.</seg>
<seg>We will speak presumably also about a new World Trade Organization round as well as about the effects of the numerous new bilateral commercial initiatives on this World Trade Organization round, which at present in the American hemisphere one discusses.</seg>
<seg>It pointed out that the transatlantic relations was substantially expanded in the last ten years and this is to be owed Clinton to the efforts of president on American side above all. I think however that in the stories books of a daily it will be also noted that to these new relations also Europe with the transatlantic explanation of 1990 and with the transatlantic agenda under the Spanish council presidency made a major contribution, which had relevant portion of the success of these relations in December 1995.</seg>
<seg>Thus, importantly will its to make here a reversal and to actually write a transatlantic agenda for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg>I would like to quote the statement of representatives of the Dominican Republic to the conclusion still: “the World Trade Organization should be originally an impartial board of arbitration, which ensures that the common rules are kept and that the countries with the free trade trusts itself to make to be able.</seg>
<seg>Secondly we can be pleased about the fall of the communist Hochstapelei, but after collapse of the Soviet only one superpower remained remaining, i.e. the USA.</seg>
<seg>I know that he maintains a successful and much a constructive dialogue with the parliament and the committees, which are involved into these topics.</seg>
<seg>After the agenda the joint debate follows over the following reports:</seg>
<seg>These goals, which become principal purpose and the secondary goals, Prüfstein to be, at which the concrete proposals submitted by the commission must be judged.</seg>
<seg>As well known such a solution - mechanism in only one country with possibility of the contribution of services in the European Union - could release an avalanche in those countries with a lower taxation.</seg>
<seg>The standard rate was allowed not to fall below 15%, but received the member states the right to use one or more minimum rates from not less than 5% whereby there are meanwhile intended special arrangements in this case.</seg>
<seg>We requested the European Commission for monitoring, in order to ensure that no market distortion is present and that the advice and the parliament are informed.</seg>
<seg>Briefly said, the request of this proposal is correct, but the method was wrongly conceived, and if we want to really support the electronic economy of Europe, then a valve added tax exemption of our own e-enterprises and not the attempt, our problems would be too transferred to others, the right signal for it.</seg>
<seg>In order to be able to fulfill the demands after a decrease of the greenhouse gas missions, we must seize all possible measures to their delimitation.</seg>
<seg>The only case, where so far still no tax is levied, is that, if from a third country to the European Community is supplied.</seg>
<seg>The positive discrimination of the air traffic must be terminated.</seg>
<seg>Enterprises from third countries however are not taxed.</seg>
<seg>CD are not very ancient, are to be taxed however nevertheless, while over the Internet available programs are to be released from the tax!</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless the suggested solution might technically not prove as convertible and as obstacle for the development of the Internet transactions in the European Union, although all here-long nevertheless their expansion.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Ladies and Gentlemen! The control systems of the union will lose toothless and at productivity.</seg>
<seg>We should invent possibilities, as we the electronic course of business to promote to be able and us no new methods break in let, how we can tax it.</seg>
<seg>The liberals represent the principle “as little state as possible”, whereby the USA are stated as example.</seg>
<seg>The Primarolo group prepared simple rules, which must be converted.</seg>
<seg>As objection is the group belief represented of me in this parliament that the fact should be corrected that the newspapers normally come into the benefit of reduced VAT rates, while the reduction is not applicable to the digital newspapers.</seg>
<seg>A tax on kerosene can give it from there only in the international consensus, in order to guarantee competition equality.</seg>
<seg>In particular I welcome the fact that the report supported one of the most important expressions met from me in my report for the Committee for traffic and tourism, this parliament some months ago endorsed, to obtain that we, as long as it is certainly politically difficult to come to an international agreement over the taxation from aviation fuel to should examine at least at short notice alternative instruments, in order the same effect, among them also a Emissionsabgabe.</seg>
<seg>The industry is actually responsible to 100% by air traffic control deliveries and airport taxes for its infrastructure costs, which amounted 1998 to 4 billion US Dollar - contrary to other Verkehrsträgern like e.g. Course and traffic, which are still strongly subsidized.</seg>
<seg>The current situation is unfavorable.</seg>
<seg>In the connection one must unfortunately state that there is a problem nevertheless with the emissions of air traffic, even if that is proportionally not so large, but it grows very strongly, and therefore one should not smalltalk it.</seg>
<seg>This plan will be for the development of the KMU within as outside of the union harmful, in particular in view of the suggested lowering of the threshold value for a freeing from the tax on an intolerably low level of the annual turnover of 40,000.</seg>
<seg>If we are to be beflissen in the question which can be treated now, we actually endanger the future of the electronic course of business important for Europe.</seg>
<seg>The starting point, according to which a Erbringer of services with seat in a third country, which supplies to a customer in the community, in only one place needs to be able to be registered, may not lead to a misalignment of tax revenues between the member states.</seg>
<seg>There the discussion in the advice still under way is and among other things in view of the tendency of the commission to bring the topic value added tax and electronic course of business at short notice to a successful conclusion to try appears it me at present most meaningfully to accept the proposed amendments of the parliament not yet formally but it with the consultation in the advice as far as possible to through-bring.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I cannot take over the suggested changes.</seg>
<seg>I thank you very much for the fact that you took care of this week all these different topics.</seg>
<seg>The commission noticed only three months for its part after the misfortune their responsibility and discharged a first package of measures, which was confirmed without reservation by the European Parliament on 30 November.</seg>
<seg>Indeed it is urgently necessary with more than fifteen valid guidelines or regulations to standardize the practices and to accomplish an increased monitoring of the application of the community standards, in order to prevent the occurrence of considerable and unacceptable differences if necessary in the field of security in the maritime traffic in the union.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! I thank the Mrs. De Palacio for its ongoing commitment in the area of ship security.</seg>
<seg>I would like to remind the ladies and gentlemen of the fact that with security in air traffic within the European range and within the range of the USA applied compensations do not agree with the amounts used in other countries.</seg>
<seg>Secondly I would like to say to you that it is the French court, which would have the possibility of konfiszieren or of freezing the means of a concrete society, in order compensations for damage or other one to pay, which an adhesion could specify, which goes beyond the amount, which is intended after the objective criteria of the present international rule over contamination due to mineral oils.</seg>
<seg>The commission is the opinion that these steps go into the right direction and to the creation of fairer delivery systems to lead, which offer also incentives for a more reasonable and more efficient use of the road system.</seg>
<seg>In view of the criticism, in particular from Ireland and France, it came then to this change, and now the affair receives a completely new idiom from the British Minister of Finance: It is represented now as consumer delivery for all, thus also for British truck drivers.</seg>
<seg>I am obligated to be secured that the consumers the available the food, whether they come now from the European Union or from outside, correspond to highest standards.</seg>
<seg>I understand naturally the concern of the Mr. Abgeordneten.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Kommissar, I must unfortunately say to you that me your answer is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg>The point addressed by the Mr. Abgeordneten is very important.</seg>
<seg>In Nigeria Chevron of the ethnic group of the Ijaw to have accused of, the force against this people have caused and even Nigerian soldiers pay to fire at demonstrators at the fleet base Warri.</seg>
<seg>In its on 15 November accepted report the commission came at the conclusion that by the operating aid in accordance with regulation 1540/98 no solution to the problem of the South Korean price practices could be found.</seg>
<seg>I believe, the intentions in its whole am extremely reassuring, the reality look however in such a way that our shipyards close in the meantime.</seg>
<seg>Inquires No. 38 of (H-0868/00):</seg>
<seg>Mr. Kommissar, I can understand that you would not like to change their decision, although ten member states reject such a tariff.</seg>
<seg>This initiative is based on a Council regulation to the amendment to the regulation, which specifies the current APS.</seg>
<seg>I represent some Zuckerrübenanbauer and am thus indeed very anxious.</seg>
<seg>This work takes place in the committee, whereby it had to fail this week, since Poul Nielson on a Balkans journey is.</seg>
<seg>We work straight on the protective clause, and if Mr. Clegg needs arguments for the discussions with his Zuckerrübenanbauern, then he can contact me at any time.</seg>
<seg>I would like to thank Mr. Liikanen for an answer good very positive in each regard and.</seg>
<seg>I will discuss this question with my agencies, as soon as the question of the budgetary appropriations is clarified for the next year.</seg>
<seg>My agencies and I are at present endeavored to limit the consequences resulting from the geographical distance between the process parties and the future court.</seg>
<seg>Exactly the same, like the courts in Duesseldorf, Munich and elsewhere in Germany in the patent law specialized - and there is likewise such a specialized court in London -, would have also a court of the community, which meets and decides cases, which concern joint patents, very much specialized its.</seg>
<seg>So that such a provisional situation does not verstetigt itself, the commission in a letter from 13 July reminded previous yearly the Member States of its obligation to designate national community mark courts.</seg>
<seg>As the Mr. Abgeordnete knows, submitting a complaint has actually no influence on the continuation of the project.</seg>
<seg>Inquires No. 47 of (H-0877/00):</seg>
<seg>The commission will thus make from it to requirement standing the redresses only in the sense planned in the regulation use.</seg>
<seg>The question reads however, to whom the studying must turn, in order to be able to make sure that completing this course of studies and its conclusion in Great Britain lend the right to acknowledgment of their study results to them.</seg>
<seg>To the limited king for example one of the earnings-fullest Finnish members of the parliament could be selected.</seg>
<seg>The whole can be regarded also as a competition question, since in the southern Baltic Sea, on the distance Stockholm - Helsinki, which is further permitted Tax Free sale, while he is forbidden between Umeå and Vaasa.</seg>
<seg>We must absolutely correct this situation by the promotion and support of multilingual contents, because this is absolutely crucial for the success of the European contents industry.</seg>
<seg>It concerns to me thereby particularly the problem that small enterprises investors cannot submit and to a solid enterprise development refer always sufficient endorsements.</seg>
<seg>In order to bring the ambitious project of this European eContent program for a successful conclusion, the planned procedures must be simplified and secured.</seg>
<seg>Therefore it must be a goal of the public supporting measures for the joint contents industry of reaching also a high education level and a cultural diversity.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand there are the communications networks, which are dependent on contents, in order to fill their virtual area inexorably. They again consider it natural, these contents submit, them buy up and without special consideration for the production rules to use to be able.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I welcomes this program eContent much and would like on two criteria to make attentive.</seg>
<seg>Therefore I support the requests for modification, in which the execution of special measures within the range of the new technologies is demanded.</seg>
<seg>First of all to the social and cultural function of the digital contents: Here it welcomes the commission that the parliament stresses the social and cultural aspect of the digital contents.</seg>
<seg>Evaluation and fight against environment noise</seg>
<seg>Indeed I am grateful for the fact that the Christian democrats as well as by the way also a part of the Liberal Group supported these a concrete request for modification to already limit the noise caused by airplanes.</seg>
<seg>Only now, the commission their proposal for European harmonized noise indices submitted 6 years later and on constant urge of the French Government.</seg>
<seg>That is a modest proposal. In the Scandinavian countries today already stricter standards than it are valid to be suggested for the year 2012.</seg>
<seg>Orly, Shiphol, Barcelona and other airports are sufficient already standards.</seg>
<seg>Another key point, which was brought in by us and which will be substantial straight in connection with the problem of aircraft noise, is that there is to be still additional noise indices apart from the noise indices specified by the correspondent.</seg>
<seg>Since there are no common standards in the European Union, it came here to an obvious competitive distortion between airports and to the unequal treating of citizens of different member states.</seg>
<seg>Therefore the submitted requests for modification of my judgement long of my colleague Bernd are so important.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, first I must say that I welcome this report.</seg>
<seg>That was in the principle the idea of the request for modification No. 36, although I believed that this idea is not yet finally invented.</seg>
<seg>That we should very carefully examine and then for both levels combined approach, limit values for the individual sources of emission and on the other page quality standard for the emissions create.</seg>
<seg>We needed more time, and I regret that we did not have these, even if I support the framework guideline generally.</seg>
<seg>As soon as the member states submitted comparable informations, the commission becomes over the question of the community limit values and in an advisory manner, in order to reduce the noise exposition, and on it report will then refund other measures to the advice and the parliament.</seg>
<seg>Other food additives than coloring materials and sweet means</seg>
<seg>These are the three criteria.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, Mr. Kollege. I am similarly: They have a dry mouth, and I have a frog in the neck, as we say with us, but go around here little the flu.</seg>
<seg>Chronic nourishing problems increase besides the cancer risk.</seg>
<seg>At that time it showed up also that the commission did not have the correct equipment, in order to introduce suitable measures.</seg>
<seg>Tomorrow the next stage already stands on the plan. Then Mrs. Kollegin Marit Paulsen of the ELDR parliamentary group sits in the saddle and has the possibility of improving the present directive still further.</seg>
<seg>Now a better instrument is to the member states and the commission at the disposal, in order to ensure that the community regulations for the animal nutrition are duly implemented and when entering emergencies third countries a rapid reaction are possible.</seg>
<seg>We know that the vast majority of the Europeans in cities lives, and so far in particular these questions were stiefmütterlich treated.</seg>
<seg>The planning process must be converted honestly and innovatively.</seg>
<seg>The multi-yearly program 2000-2004 for the lasting town development is an suitable instrument for it, and the implementation of Agenda 21 represents a outstanding means to the coordination and implementation of measures.</seg>
<seg>Less transport and the exit from fossil fuel on local level are inevitable, if we want to reach a change during the present climatic threat.</seg>
<seg>Many meant that the financial framework is too small.</seg>
<seg>Main partners within this framework should be however the commission and the nets of the local regional administrative bodies, which are legally responsible for the development and penetration of the measures in the area of the lasting town development.</seg>
<seg>The Court of Justice of the communities and even the controversy settlement committees the World Trade Organization are the opinion that the precaution principle can quite be used in the environmental range or in the range of the public health, isolated even against the Europeans, as the pending procedure for the raw milk cheese shows.</seg>
<seg>Not damage control or payment of damages the goal must be, the primary objective must it be, damage to the health or on has and property of humans to prevent.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless already 1996 endorsed the European Parliament in agreement with the precaution principle a prohibition of the use of meat and bone flour in the entire European Union - one would have nevertheless only…</seg>
<seg>Absolute scientific security over new materials or products does not give it and it will never give.</seg>
<seg>If the precaution principle is to be used efficiently and reliably, it is finally importantly, all maintaken part, also representatives of the civil society, into the political decisions, which are made in the context of the application of the principle, include.</seg>
<seg>And finally the public health and the environment before other considerations, above all economical, must have the priority.</seg>
<seg>The basic condition for the resort to the precaution principle consists of the fact that the fear, could enter it harmful effects, is scientifically justified.</seg>
<seg>Professor George Carlo, an American, whom the Food and Drugs administration assigned in the last seven years an investigation over the effect of radiations on the human health, communicated only yesterday in Lisbon, there would be the risk that the use of mobile phones the occurrence of brain tumors, which Alzheimer illness increases and from Hautschäden.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Umwelt and public health are like a complicated machine with many functions, which we supervise and control, in order to be able to intervene, so that no mischief happens.</seg>
<seg>With the application of this principle it must be prevented in any case that the innovation and the economic activity are restrained that to restraint and stop in the industry comes and that with it the competition is gone around.</seg>
<seg>It might not have escaped the parliament that the commission agrees with most questions raised in your resolution request.</seg>
<seg>The vote takes place tomorrow at 10.00 o'clock.</seg>
<seg>In their article 2 the right to lives is affirmed. And always then, if the terrorism in Spain demands human lives, the entire European Union in one of its most substantial principles feels injured.</seg>
<seg>We want not to replace the rightfully created institutions, but them to urge to protect our rights and our freedoms without giving way to the terror.</seg>
<seg>Votes</seg>
<seg>It reminded thereby of the notes of the advice for the classification of the household lines concerning the early retirement project at the commission and the administrative costs in connection with the fishery agreements.</seg>
<seg>(The parliament accepts the legislative resolution.)</seg>
<seg>I mean, that am no longer up-to-date!</seg>
<seg>These will regard 23,428 permission as too few, which welcome them required growth possibilities however.</seg>
<seg>This extinction, which became effective starting from center of the past yearly, led - as foreseen of us - to a dramatic slowing down of the permission of projects and the execution of payments. In the result its lay the annual execution of commitments of funds of this fund at the end of of June 2000 with under a per cent point.</seg>
<seg>This text is an ideal charter for a practical locking of the Secretariat-General of the European parliament in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg>Before my departure they said to me: “Christmas stands before the door, and we in Bergamo celebrate Christmas and the celebration of the holy Lucia.</seg>
<seg>Our vehement criticism is directed in addition against the overproduction of agricultural products as well as against it that the European Union information means begins, in order to sell this surplus.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I was correct more intended for the report García Margallo y Marfil over the increase in value-fiscal treatment electronically furnished services.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, I will try to create still 2004 ago with some explanations to Malta remedy.</seg>
<seg>I want to say however with a certain ceremony that this was the maximum its, which I can accept in Europe, which is too liberal from my point of view!</seg>
<seg>A period setting would motivate the post office to develop further and modernize their services as well as planning and investments to facilitate.</seg>
<seg>They will exert further pressure. With the money, which they make with the feed above the 150-Gramm-Grenze, they strengthen their position.</seg>
<seg>The liberalisation of the postal services in the form suggested by the commission is neither appropriate nor uniform. Therefore I was correct for the report and all stated changes, which went into this direction.</seg>
<seg>Report de Roo (A5-0378/2000)</seg>
<seg>Also we have 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31 our reservations against the requests for modification No., because we are not convinced of the fact that they are compatible with the rules the World Trade Organization.</seg>
<seg>Against a globalization, which steps the most elementary human rights with feet.</seg>
<seg>That would contradict the attention of the national identity (article 6 paragraph 3 of the Treaty of Union).</seg>
<seg>It is to be emphasized that the linguistic minorities were not crushed by the globalization Internet, but therein fresh opportunities of a cultural and economical opening to have found.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, in the absence of other results revealed Gefeil in Nice at least the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The common resolution request at the basis lying tenor is much too one-sided in this regard.</seg>
<seg>The delay in the publication of the written conclusions - which are officially available still after four days not yet - makes, how difficult it is, resolutions, which were seized in a general disorder clear, to bring clearly paper.</seg>
<seg>The only way, in order to avoid dangerous conflicts for the future, is, to remain with the traditional conception according to which Europe is based on the mutual respect of the national communities.</seg>
<seg>The summit from Nice went on Sunday with an agreement to end, which is to flow into a draft agreement.</seg>
<seg>The resolution request to Nice, placed today to the vote, does not reflect this.</seg>
<seg>Finally still another remark on the social politics, which wanted to tackle France with the conception of its presidency. In the long run it remained now apart from the declarations of intent and probably-sounding, for contentwise vague documents, which are completely insufficient in view of the existing problems and the large discontent, as them were impressively expressed also by the employees in Nice, with a handful little things.</seg>
<seg>With that really major issues - like taxes, deliveries, social politics, asylum and immigration - obvious everything remained with the old person.</seg>
<seg>At the discussion to Nice the conception is impressing that the contract has in the long run neither mother nor father - it is not anybody child. The French council presidency was issued itself in Ausflüchten, instead of carrying clearly the results of the diplomatic conference and the reasons for it.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies decreases, because the right of veto is continued to limit and the European Parliament receives more power.</seg>
<seg>If one would have in the year, in which I was born, thus 1944, at the time of the conclusion of the Agreement of Chicago these effects foreseen, then at that time, aviation fuel and other airplane need would probably not have been agreed upon from the taxation to exclude.</seg>
<seg>Since there is not a zero-risk, the scientists must or at least the politicians the criterion of the proportionateness to use, uncertain risks weigh and their responsibility become fair.</seg>
<seg>In addition, this parliament fought for it that this reduction of the means for the innovative measures the available was compensated by utilization of the making flexible framework, held in an explanation to the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg>On this important area must everything role to take over, since there is true on this global market, on which we move now, those fresh ideas - correctly financed, soundly and realistically supported -, which will secure that we can maintain our place at the point of technical development in the new branches of industry in Europe and in particular in the communication technology.</seg>
<seg>To the question of the budgetary appropriations in the preceding speech contribution already serious words were said here: 400 millions euros are indeed only one minimum for the financing, and in which second half must the possibilities of additional financing ordered by the flexibility instrument to be used be able, as was represented in the report.</seg>
<seg>Thus my judgement also, not like the report concludes, automatically the loss at European value must to accompany.</seg>
<seg>As we know all, unemployment is most highly into that economical and technologically fewer developed regions, in particular in the European Union into the Ziel-1-Gebieten. The innovative measures may not only be carried by the express will technological kind, but must also to promote economics and occupation.</seg>
<seg>If I go and state now back into my own region, thus to east England, that only one regional administrative body in the last period did not use these funds, then I doubt whether we were so effective, as we must be in the future, so that we can be called new municipalities welcome.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, first I would like to thank Mr. Helmuth Markov for its constructional and extremely competent statements to the draft communication over the innovative measures of the EFRE in the period 2000-2006 and express him my acknowledgment.</seg>
<seg>The energy efficiency and environmentalpolitical aspects have its place in these guidelines. They can be cause for innovative measures for the third topic, which concerns regional development and sustainable development.</seg>
<seg>We would like however that these projects are selected on regional level, as Mr. Nous Berend in its contribution very probably understood.</seg>
<seg>The discussion is closed.</seg>
<seg>Therefore we demand in this report and in the three requests, which were additionally submitted that the commission strengthens its efforts to intersperse an international arbitration of arguments procedure before the World Trade Organization.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me that the responsible committee member must show in relation to the industry that it undertakes everything, in order to meet this outside danger for our industry.</seg>
<seg>Finally we expect that the shipbuilding convention on the conference of the group 6 of the OECD is discussed on 18 December.</seg>
<seg>It looks however like it, as if the final spurt always few one postpone, so that we never reach the target line.</seg>
<seg>As you know all, alone the introduction of the procedure will take up over six months.</seg>
<seg>For the large companies as for its political lawyers after demand less state means only that the state and its finances are to be exclusively to them at the disposal.</seg>
<seg>But for this purpose, evenly with it the shipbuilding industry and the jobs to be consolidated and to the families security dependent on the sector be given know, are over 31 December 2000 necessary outside aids, because the market situation is coined/shaped not by equal chances, but by unfair competition and dumping.</seg>
<seg>The improvement of the competitive ability of the European Union shipyards is promoted by the commission, but in view of the substantial price undercutting by the Korean shipyards the attainable productivity progress is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg>The advice stressed that this support mechanism may not distort the competition within the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The presence of the sea-damaged nuclear-powered submarine in waters of the bay of Algeciras unfortunately expanded to a diplomatic conflict between military atomic and colonial power and a member state now a second category, as the last classification of Nice reads, which its does not call rights in and bends itself infantilen explanations.</seg>
<seg>When by the medical report, which was spread in the country of the owner - that is, by the British press -, which admits weight of the illness became, no transfer took place in another hospital, but a change of the classification of the hospital.</seg>
<seg>We expect naturally with interest the answer from the Commission, in order to determine whether the goal was achieved.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! Also I would like to mean my sympathy at the beginning of the family of the murdered local council and the colleague of the people's party and abhorrence over this fascist Barbarei of the ETA and their accomplices to the expression to bring.</seg>
<seg>I consider it also advisable, the submarine Tireless fastest possible, as soon as the appropriate climatic conditions are given to transfer to the repair to Great Britain.</seg>
<seg>The delegates asked whether the Commission belief is that the guideline 89/618/Euratom over the instruction of the population with a radiological state of emergency situation and the guideline 96/29/Euratom are applicable for the definition of the fundamental safety standards regarding this submarine and were therefore introduced which steps.</seg>
<seg>We are not entitled in the context of the usual complaint procedure to make this answer publicly although we can generally say, what it mentioned.</seg>
<seg>There is an aspect of the Euratom contract, that is the transport of contaminated wastes between the member states of the European Union. Gibraltar belonged now however to the United Kingdom, and contaminated wastes were transported by a part of the United Kingdom into another part of the country, without passing thereby another member state of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Spain needs to win in addition only the confidence of humans on rock.</seg>
<seg>Here we have now a member state, which deals in such a way with the public of another member state, as it would do with every other country in the world, as if there would be fifty years after the beginning of the European agreement work none affectio societatis, as if the European solidarity would not have made the smallest progress.</seg>
<seg>Actually operated in British waters to one given time as an only German submarine.</seg>
<seg>There one debates, but the citizens direct their attention consciously or intuitively toward the European institutions.</seg>
<seg>Due to the shortening, which were made by the labour government in the defense budget, stand fewer means for the acquisition of new military equipment for order, so that in the future strengthened on cases is to be counted, in which defective technology for absolutely necessary repairs except service be placed must.</seg>
<seg>Community competence like much this perhaps also some completely differently wishes itself extends however neither to the classification from ports to execution of repair work at submarines still on the questions of technical safety of nuclear reactors or on demands that a submarine must be brought to the repair elsewhere.</seg>
<seg>In order to be able to help them still better, one would have to request the institutions for community, the financial, to supplement personnel and material resources of the UNHCR.</seg>
<seg>I request the commission to supplement as well as always prove in all their agreements with the NRO the UNHCR as coordination organ the financial assistance for the UNHCR again.</seg>
<seg>It must have thus entrance to the civilian victims, and its teams locally must be able themselves to move surely and the necessary resources for the fulfillment of their mission have.</seg>
<seg>On 22 November the commission took a report over common asylum and the union far valid uniform statuses of the appreciative asylum seekers on that is the final goal of the common European asylum system specified in Tampere.</seg>
<seg>Would like I mean respect for all the work bezeigen, which was carried out for property in its new office by Mrs. Ogata for the UNHCR and Mr. Ruud Lubbers all wishes concluding.</seg>
<seg>It appears important to us for this re-establishment, on a political amnesty in Yugoslavia to urge, but just as substantially it is in our opinion that we condemn the renewed occurrence of the encroachments and terrorist activities at the borders between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo in all clarity, because this reminds in causing concern form of the incidents during the Kosovo conflict, with which also Western powers responsibility carried.</seg>
<seg>The numbers of 1, 2 and 3 our compromise resolution request contain clear demands.</seg>
<seg>I appeal also to the Mr. Präsidenten Kostunica to clear up which happened with humans such as Mr. Ukshin Hoti, with whose fate we was repetitive concerned here, and from whose fate nothing at all admits us is.</seg>
<seg>Likewise I can agree the appeal to the KFOR to prevent further assaults in the Presevo valley.</seg>
<seg>I welcome now from the KFOR introduced step to the management of the problem and request further all sides seriously to practice restraint.</seg>
<seg>B5-0916/2000 of Mr. Barón Crespo and other delegate in the name of the PSE parliamentary group;</seg>
<seg>This clause was decided in March 1990 in the Moneda palace. I white so exactly, because I had the privilege, there with the taking office of president the Aylwin after the Plebiszit, which for the regime of general Pinochet an end set, to be present.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, rates colleagues and colleagues! I would like to say something to the resolution, for which we will be correct naturally.</seg>
<seg>Here the international community must exercise their right to democratic control, not as interference into the Home Affairs of an independent country, but as political, prudent and preventive procedure.</seg>
<seg>The situation in the prisons and on the police stations, where among other things abusing and torture at the agenda are, is unacceptable in each regard.</seg>
<seg>This treatment would correspond exactly in Western Europe, and due to the protests the Minister Hikmet Sami Turk postponed the transfer, so that in entire Turkey more socially and political consensus can be compiled over a prison reform.</seg>
<seg>The question is urgent, and therefore we decided to set this point on the agenda.</seg>
<seg>Next yearly the process is to be made for it on 8 January. One accuses to him in a meeting of Tunisian oppositionals in France to have participated which it denies however.</seg>
<seg>If the members and functionaries of these combinations want to hold a meeting for the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human, its houses of the police become surrounded, and who on the road dares itself, by men in civilian clothes one attacks.</seg>
<seg>The second case is actually only one part of a network of chicaneries.</seg>
<seg>My parliamentary group, like also this parliament, pursues the human right situation in Tunesien and the rest of the world with special attention.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident, Ladies and Gentlemen! Moderate one we nevertheless ask yourself a little.</seg>
<seg>The negotiations ran extraordinarily well, and it makes me happy much the fact that we advance here and hopefully to the result leads the discussions, which the Mr. Abgeordnete addressed.</seg>
<seg>Several delegates addressed the situation of the convicts in Turkey.</seg>
<seg>B5-0912/2000 of Mr. Johan van Hecke in the name of the PPE DE parliamentary group;</seg>
<seg>We should not be inferior to them, as I mean, in this attitude.</seg>
<seg>In this framework took place the seizure of power that of military, which contributed as in each case to intensify the situation.</seg>
<seg>This attitude is part of the continuity of the policy of the French imperialism.</seg>
<seg>The commission is very anxious also over the recent force.</seg>
<seg>The debate over current, urgent and major issues is closed.</seg>
<seg>Mean competition can destroy, to the loss of know-how and jobs lead a good shipbuilding climate and in the long term cause a monopoly situation, which is detrimental to the world trade.</seg>
<seg>Approval of the Minutes of the preceding meeting</seg>
<seg>Therefore I thank all colleagues and colleagues for its co-operation, also at the requests for modification, as well as the specialists of the committee, which contributed substantially to bring the resolution request under roof and subject.</seg>
<seg>Over the adoption we are high-pleased of the sociopolitical agenda by the European Council of Nice, and we hope that the member states will use this chance, in order to develop and better co-ordinate the social security and health welfare service systems further for elderly people, in order to introduce at the same time in addition, other measures, which guarantee their reintegration into the active life, as for example lifelong learning.</seg>
<seg>The promotion of lifelong learning a topic, which was already mentioned in the discussion is a thing, which also I support.</seg>
<seg>Humans over 60 or 70 years can do naturally still many useful things, but it is not correct to couple their income at this age to the performed work.</seg>
<seg>The European Central Bank already urgently warned in its monthly report from July 2000.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion the member states can turn on the problem with the help of their legislative instruments better.</seg>
<seg>Owing to its proposals for an active life at the age the society gains a whole generation.</seg>
<seg>The promises must be kept, but the pensions are to be guaranteed with the means of these countries, without the payment at the expense of the common financial of the European Union must be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg>We experienced the largest social revolution in the last 100 to 150 years, as the age was doubled by us humans.</seg>
<seg>Only it gives a sense to the computational extension of the life, which was made possible by medical progress.</seg>
<seg>They let themselves pay - which was total company thus involved in it -, elderly workers were ruled out, but younger employees were not adjusted, and many positions were painted.</seg>
<seg>The family and the tax policy should cause rather that women and men, who have family obligations can decide freely, whether they want to be employed or not.</seg>
<seg>My brother and I accompanied him.</seg>
<seg>Future initiatives within the range of the public health are directed rather on health and care questions at the age and toward the promotion of healthy aging.</seg>
<seg>2 and No. 3, with which he endorses a change of the text and demands the use of the term “demographic development” in place of the formulation “ageing of the population”, taken over.</seg>
<seg>The advertising and sales promotion measures of the branch federations and the authorities do not come to overlaps with. The emphasis is to be put thereby on European Union topics, so z.</seg>
<seg>Mr. Präsident! Also the budget committee meant to be able to in principle positively face the Commission proposal.</seg>
<seg>Therefore it is very important to create here a reconciliation and which can by the sales promotion and advertising measures is very well developed.</seg>
<seg>I believe that in marketing, with the sale, into which training programmes life-accompanying learning would have to be moved far more into the center, because the straight new technologies, the handling of the sales promotion of a modern logistics completely new chances to give.</seg>
<seg>Only once I would like to congratulate to Mr. Dary to its excellent report.</seg>
<seg>The next point is, if we talk about export and intervention.</seg>
<seg>No special payments for not inquired products may be carried out and no advertising campaigns for these be accomplished.</seg>
<seg>Everyone has sufficient food, and if we for a product recruit, is directed naturally against the consumption of another product.</seg>
<seg>Requests for modification 18 and 24 first part, by which the time intervals, in which the proposalable topics and products are examined, are shortened from three years to two years, in order to improve the efficiency of the promotion instrument.</seg>
<seg>In the Greek version Mrs. Jutta Haug is specified as correspondents, thus as man, and a Mr. Markus Ferber as Berichterstatterin, thus as a woman.</seg>
<seg>Here one sees, how with minor amendments in practice large effects can be obtained.</seg>
<seg>It is provisionally last Friday in Strasbourg, i.e. Strasbourg loses 12 days presence of the parliament.</seg>
<seg>In the end I would like everything, above all the few, which found it worth to the trouble, on this Friday to be present with the recent meeting in Strasbourg in the year 2000, glad holidays to wish and a good, but above all wise new year.</seg>
