<seg id=1> Our Charter of Fundamental Rights is the first that path this millennium.</seg>
<seg id=2> We must organise ourselves in fifteen Member States, to be able to welcome in good conditions for the countries which are knocking on our door.</seg>
<seg id=3> The field of services of general interest, social, cultural and charitable must be included in Article 87, so that these important institutions can enjoy a sustainable protection.</seg>
<seg id=4> Some are of the opinion that we can create an internal market in Europe without agreeing on common values and fundamental principles.</seg>
<seg id=5> I would like to welcome, in turn, substantial and strong intervention of President Prodi.</seg>
<seg id=6> You know that this is a deliberate choice that was made in Amsterdam, to make a clear distinction between the two functions. The High Representative, unlike the Commission, is not independent, but it has to coordinate the common foreign and security policies which fall within the competence of the Member States and perhaps we should leave room at intergovernmental level.</seg>
<seg id=7> It is hoped that the presidency outlines in Nice the way for the future.</seg>
<seg id=8> We can, in fact, want more and better, but I believe that it is a good start.</seg>
<seg id=9> I therefore hope that the Nice European Council will adopt it this project and will decide to start specifically as a project and not as a fait accompli, after having clearly adopted the necessary reforms.</seg>
<seg id=10> However, I have also made it clear that in the current situation, we could achieve very important objectives for the Community approach, such as, for example, more effective action in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg id=11> It is only by linking Russia to the West and to the European Union that we can have an influence on its policy and maintain contact and dialogue with it.</seg>
<seg id=12> Motion for a resolution (B5-0767 / 2000) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=13> At the moment, it is pursuing this genocide and is trying to destroy the freedom of the press and the rule of law which exist only in that country.</seg>
<seg id=14> To try to meet the expectations of the pensioner, who is Giuseppe Italia, lives in Cremona and would sail on the river Po, I voted in favour of the Piecyk report on the development of sea ports, inland ports and intermodal problem-solver.</seg>
<seg id=15> The outcome of the vote in this House forbidden to achieve the objective of the directive, yet accepted and approved by all the speakers and the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=16> Mr President, I voted in favour of the Skinner report, as I said during the debate, before the vote, because I believe that venture capital is important.</seg>
<seg id=17> My party colleague Armonie Bordes has emphasised yesterday in sharp terms that only a minority is taking advantage of the commitment of Community funds and of contributions to the pension fund for the entrepreneurial risk.</seg>
<seg id=18> As a result, the Charter will serve more to use the current practices, including backward-looking, of the national states that represent progress.</seg>
<seg id=19> Mr President, we finally have a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European citizens a whole article, Article 25, is dedicated to the elderly.</seg>
<seg id=20> This text may appear painless as a first step, since it covers all the existing rights. But if it was incorporated in the Treaty with binding force, as the European Parliament demands, it would, in time, to the harmonization of national laws in Europe; it would be disproportionate to the Court of Justice; it would promote centralisation around the European institutions; it would limit the margin of independent decision-making of each nation.</seg>
<seg id=21> Â· The must not overload the Charter with detailed rules and leave them at secondary law.</seg>
<seg id=22> I shall vote for another charter in Biarritz, taking part in the demonstrations on 13 and 14 October, and in Nice on 7 December 2000.</seg>
<seg id=23> Progress of the 12 candidate countries</seg>
<seg id=24> I believe that a number of Member States have not yet grasped the existence of this link to date and have not understood that a slow progress of the Intergovernmental Conference could pose enormous difficulties in order to impose enlargement within the time limits necessary.</seg>
<seg id=25> We cannot impose, in the long term, everything I have mentioned so far that if the political world and the elite of the candidate countries and the European Union - and, in this respect, I agree with you, Commissioner â are finally realize that enlargement of the European Union will benefit to it.</seg>
<seg id=26> That is the formula adopted.</seg>
<seg id=27> Let me turn to the second direction that the presidency wishes to move during this term of the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=28> What I would therefore propose is to work in this direction with the idea that we will have to examine, in the context of 2003, what are the candidates who are ready to join us on that date.</seg>
<seg id=29> I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his clear and comprehensive report.</seg>
<seg id=30> The purpose of the negotiations is not "whether": it is a question of 'how' and 'when'.</seg>
<seg id=31> But they have also done since the prospect of accession to the European Union they expect the solidarity of the European peoples and it offers them a solid political and economic base.</seg>
<seg id=32> A number of countries have so far advanced in relation to the second economic criterion â competitiveness on the internal market - they are looming.</seg>
<seg id=33> We are therefore seeking closer coordination with the programmes of national governments, Parliament and the other institutions.</seg>
<seg id=34> Every year, and we will soon again - on 8 November - all the candidate countries are waiting impatiently for the judgment that passes the Commission on their progress.</seg>
<seg id=35> We have opted with reason the principle of differentiation, according to which each candidate country is assessed on its own merits.</seg>
<seg id=36> This debate is a further opportunity for my group to confirm that the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe - but also Cyprus and Malta â is the best guarantee of the future for all of us in Europe, in the East and in the West.</seg>
<seg id=37> The task, which is essential, has not yet been a keen interest on the part of the public.</seg>
<seg id=38> People plaisantent about enlargement which, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, still has to intervene in five years' time.</seg>
<seg id=39> The next opportunity all natural, it will be the European elections in 2009, but we want to make an effort to ensure that a maximum of countries can join in 2004.</seg>
<seg id=40> In addition, six other fundamental issues which concern us because of the methodology.</seg>
<seg id=41> In fact, it is the very model of European construction in which we have engouffrÃ©s, I would like to say the simultaneous integration of all sectors of activity whatever the traditions and the specific characteristics of each other, which has become a trap again.</seg>
<seg id=42> The expression of this feeling virtually widespread in Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the 1980s we are all bound up till now.</seg>
<seg id=43> But let us be clear: there cannot be membership of the rebate.</seg>
<seg id=44> It is a powerful idea which is also a good idea: that we do not make the enlargements against the opinions and that the best way to make the enlargements with the opinions passes through their participation in the elections, since the elections are an expression of democracy and the method of accession of citizens to the political system.</seg>
<seg id=45> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like briefly to speak about the conditions which makes it possible for the scenario that several speakers have wished.</seg>
<seg id=46> You should not forget that these people are of interests.</seg>
<seg id=47> However, I have already pointed out that all countries approchaient relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id=48> This means that we have already decided on the liberalisation of trade in the field of agricultural products without the Poles fear that they result in the collapse of their agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=49> There is tension, but overall, peace and trade have established between citizens closer relations, which are further reinforced by monetary union.</seg>
<seg id=50> This must be the outcome of the negotiations that are important.</seg>
<seg id=51> The only amendment which has been tabled for the moment is already covered by this report, but I am delighted that the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance wishes to stress the need for equal treatment of all citizens.</seg>
<seg id=52> This does not mean only a law in the area of public service but also to open up the possibility of appropriate remuneration for young officials.</seg>
<seg id=53> The same applies to Latvia as the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=54> The return of litas to the euro is expected during the second half of 2001.</seg>
<seg id=55> Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am rapporteur, is the largest and most important but, as we know, also the most problematic countries that are preparing to join the European Union. To tell the truth, there are so many problems that it intends to raise the voices calling for the exclusion of the first group of countries which will be joining us first.</seg>
<seg id=56> We have too many broken promises to Poland, to the east, formerly Communist countries.</seg>
<seg id=57> There is just one point which is regularly when it comes to the Czech Republic, which is the problem of the Roma.</seg>
<seg id=58> Slovakia is not condemned to remain in the second group and it is logical that it wants to join the Union at the same time as the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id=59> Finally, I would like to allow me a final comment on internal policy.</seg>
<seg id=60> Thirdly, with regard to agriculture, whose level of productivity is lower than that of the European Union, we must open up completely the agricultural market to capital necessary for the privatisation of land, the modernisation of farms and structures for the approval and an improvement in return.</seg>
<seg id=61> Bulgaria is pressured to join the European Union and NATO.</seg>
<seg id=62> On the extreme poverty - a problem which affects the 11th-hour since 1990 - we finally note real signs of economic progress under the present government.</seg>
<seg id=63> I hope that these issues will become a priority for the new Parliament which will come into operation until 15 days and the new government.</seg>
<seg id=64> But we also have to point out that the final solution, fair and sustainable must fully respect both the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, which is nothing more than the current international law, and the principles governing the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=65> Malta also has stable democratic institutions and functional.</seg>
<seg id=66> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we want to make our contribution to this debate.</seg>
<seg id=67> We must implement them. The European Community law is not just a collection of laws: it must also be a law applied in the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=68> This progression raises difficult challenges to the citizens of the candidate countries but also maintains, at the same time, their future and that of their children.</seg>
<seg id=69> I agree with the previous speaker: we must pay particular attention to the border regions.</seg>
<seg id=70> In this respect, the Commission must not be left to account!</seg>
<seg id=71> The candidate countries want to start quickly on the path of economic growth, even though it must be at the expense of the protection of nature defined previously.</seg>
<seg id=72> On the one hand, we have in bad habits, most linked to health.</seg>
<seg id=73> - (ES) Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and unified European continent.</seg>
<seg id=74> The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, also competent in the field of transport and trans-European networks, are aware that it is necessary to coordinate the various sectorial Community policies in favour of an overall regional planning policy.</seg>
<seg id=75> I would, however, once again on the fact that the transport infrastructure are of vital importance for the success of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=76> Mr President, I agree with you, when you say that the forthcoming enlargement is the main task of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=77> The traditional social values the former planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe have been severely shaken.</seg>
<seg id=78> The PPE Group does not wish to absolve the applicant countries the responsibility of the pace of progress of the accession process: we cannot say no date.</seg>
<seg id=79> The second point is the designation of dates.</seg>
<seg id=80> There is another reason.</seg>
<seg id=81> Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the various countries and for the whole of the EU depend - the example of Denmark is here to show this - largely to the elimination of social and democratic deficits of European policy.</seg>
<seg id=82> Populism is the term shameful that the technocrats give to the popular will when she speaks in a way that does not suit them.</seg>
<seg id=83> Ladies and gentlemen, this is now the time and the dinner break. We resume at 9 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=84> We will, even if this happens in the longer term, a single currency for the whole of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=85> These issues cause internal battles in each country.</seg>
<seg id=86> We call them to fight for a different Europe, that of all peoples, free from all of these inhumane characteristics, where the people are to be masters of their own fate, develop them of relations of peace, freedom and fraternity, mutually beneficial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=87> I am publicly praised for their work and, in particular, the work carried out by Romanian Challenge Appeal, the headquarters of which lies in Birmingham, as well as the work of other organisations in Ireland supported by a number of people whose Daniel O Donnel Irish, the artist, which has promised GBP 1 million that it has collected in Ireland and other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id=88> The Nizza Summit must establish whether and how the EU can, for its part, be ready in time for enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=89> The Poles are wondering whether they will benefit even when they are joined or whether they will become a country with a second category.</seg>
<seg id=90> However, I am convinced that with the good will and with the help of the European Union, will be found a solution that will enable the two communities to live harmoniously and prosper, as they have done over the centuries.</seg>
<seg id=91> We are also concerned about the problem of minorities, because the issue of the integration of these minorities, including their linguistic integration, is also important in these countries.</seg>
<seg id=92> The condition for membership of the Union is basically to fulfil the basic criteria, the so-called Copenhagen criteria.</seg>
<seg id=93> The benefits of enlargement have been mentioned, and this is one of the issues on which Lithuania can teach us something.</seg>
<seg id=94> Imagine that they are all like this.</seg>
<seg id=95> Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs, but I would particularly like to limit my remarks to Slovakia, and especially to the policy towards minorities.</seg>
<seg id=96> I therefore invite you at the forthcoming summit in Nizza to set a target date to which you plan to conclude the negotiations with the most successful candidate countries on the path to membership, without mentioning names.</seg>
<seg id=97> The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its efforts to join the Union and, of course, ensure that the planning of this aid to be even more decentralised.</seg>
<seg id=98> The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of civil society, the government and Parliament plays an important part of this and - as we can see - positive.</seg>
<seg id=99> We are currently bringing an end to the division of Europe into two blocs and not to create a new division.</seg>
<seg id=100> All these elements contained in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne whom I warmly thank on behalf of our group.</seg>
<seg id=101> In this sense, I believe that the Cyprus question is par excellence, that on which will be judged on the ability of Europe to do its political face.</seg>
<seg id=102> I myself live near the Baltic Sea, a sea which is an ecological problem for us all.</seg>
<seg id=103> The political vision remains.</seg>
<seg id=104> For example, it was very good to hear that Mr HÃ€nsch, who spoke on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, hoped that the Commission should undertake a real evaluation of the consequences of enlargement, as well as an economic impact in the event that enlargement would never happen.</seg>
<seg id=105> However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, according to which the establishment of transitional periods is essential in the interests of both parties. Moreover, as a Member for a border region and, as Mrs Schierhuber, the owner of a firm located near the Czech border, I particularly want to ensure that the creation of common economic areas close to be controlled without major problems and offers positive results on both sides.</seg>
<seg id=106> As a Social Democrat, I should like to emphasise three points.</seg>
<seg id=107> The EEA which includes issues of the first pillar gives businesses the candidate countries access to the internal market and to the young scientists and the right to participate in exchange programmes, but on the other hand, does not oblige the EU to extend its system of agricultural aid to these countries.</seg>
<seg id=108> Secondly, we must say 'no' to the concept being recognised that the big bang, but at the same time, a large group of countries, because this would be in contradiction with the principle of the admission of each country on its merits.</seg>
<seg id=109> Thirdly, we must do everything we can to ensure, by 2003, to prepare the European Union for the enlargement process in the direction of the magnificent speech by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.</seg>
<seg id=110> In this respect, I would like to mention the relationship between Parliament and the Council by highlighting the fact that there are huge delays in relation to the answers to written questions.</seg>
<seg id=111> It is worrying that occurs in a country which is going to join the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=112> I therefore request that the matter be referred back to the Committee on Legal Affairs so that it can prepare for this.</seg>
<seg id=113> Mr President, we are going to debate today and perhaps vote on three reports in total dealing with this subject, two of my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=114> All the players in the food production chain should in fact be gained.</seg>
<seg id=115> Safety will cost money to all those involved in the food chain.</seg>
<seg id=116> We must therefore follow Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and adopt the principle of non dilution in order to secure animal feed and genuinely protect European consumers.</seg>
<seg id=117> The 1999 directive has been well thought and it can already boast a success because taxes have been reduced in a sensitive manner.</seg>
<seg id=118> However, allow purely and simply the dilution is not a solution.</seg>
<seg id=119> Very quickly, we must insist on Amendment No 37 on dioxin.</seg>
<seg id=120> On this point we are in agreement.</seg>
<seg id=121> Thus, it would mean that we, European consumers, we shall continue to buy on the world markets, meat and milk and derivatives of these products from animal feed which has no link with the minimum and maximum limits set by the European Union and by a system of production of feedingstuffs who buy raw materials on the international markets, free to mix up any principle and composed, before introducing their products on the territory of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=122> We must be able to have, for the second reading, the Commission 's views on how to carry out risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id=123> On the other hand, it would be inappropriate, for example, to adopt Amendments Nos 39 and 40, because this would remove the possibility for Member States to act quickly against the dangers that would come to light.</seg>
<seg id=124> Consumer protection starts from animal feed, the components of feedingstuffs, Declaration and, finally, official controls.</seg>
<seg id=125> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our colleague Mrs Paulsen on undesirable substances in animal nutrition is an important issue and, as all the important issues, it is highly controversial.</seg>
<seg id=126> Mr President, the discussion on this excellent report by Mrs Paulsen has been, on certain points, emotionally very busy, and now that this discussion is closed, I believe that we must assume that the requirements in the animal feed sector are certainly strict, but we can then ensure that quality is changing by mixtures.</seg>
<seg id=127> Taken in isolation, together, these three proposals are designed to fill the considerable gaps that have been highlighted by the dioxin crisis.</seg>
<seg id=128> Amendment No 33 removes the possibility of re-exporting the consignments which do not conform to the country of origin.</seg>
<seg id=129> Nor can I accept Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which seek to reinstate the possibility of extending, under certain conditions, raw materials intended for the manufacture of feedingstuffs which are contaminated.</seg>
<seg id=130> They should be sufficient, given the commitment we have made to establish, within the framework of the new proposal on the food authority, a rapid alert system covering the whole of the food chain and of the products.</seg>
<seg id=131> Commissioner Byrne, behind this directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs, is basically a problem we have for a long time, namely the question of the open declaration.</seg>
<seg id=132> And for this reason alone, I have already learned something.</seg>
<seg id=133> Because if we put quickly this measure in place and if we were quickly the codecision procedure, it would certainly be an appreciable gain, and I am convinced that, with the Council, we shall be strong and united.</seg>
<seg id=134> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it may be that, in the future, of contaminated raw materials can also play a part in the composition of feedingstuffs, in any case, it is not ruled out.</seg>
<seg id=135> The BSE scandal is the worst example known.</seg>
<seg id=136> The common sense - our rapporteur says - and this is, of course, to have a label to open declaration, which gives a list of ingredients.</seg>
<seg id=137> I believe that the technical skills, as well as the judgment of the members of the Committee on Agriculture there is no doubt in the area of agriculture and food for animals, in order to find a solution geared towards the practical and enforceable which must be enforced and understood by farmers and consumers.</seg>
<seg id=138> So much for the good points.</seg>
<seg id=139> It is, in my view, a legitimate right to information that we need to fulfil.</seg>
<seg id=140> Madam President, I would ask you, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, to send a message of condolence from Parliament to the families of the victims and the local authorities of both Brittany and MarÃ­n, city of Galicia, which most of the victims.</seg>
<seg id=141> (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=142> Are any Members opposed the tabling of this oral amendment?</seg>
<seg id=143> It is good that the rapporteur has explained the situation.</seg>
<seg id=144> Most of the technical proposals deserve to be supported with vehemence, for example on food safety, the dismantling of nuclear power stations in the first generation, the protection of the environment, the fight against social dumping, the necessary code of conduct for companies in the West when they work towards the east, etc. It is a huge task, and also an absolute priority.</seg>
<seg id=145> At the same time, the still considerable difficulties to be overcome, particularly in budgetary terms.</seg>
<seg id=146> The enlargement to 13 countries changes not only the geopolitical framework of the European Union, but it is also changing the structure, since at the time the total population will increase (+ 28%), but also the number of less-favoured 'regions'.</seg>
<seg id=147> In this respect, it must take account of the fact that in the candidate countries, a competitive agricultural and food sector, will be of decisive importance for the success of the process of transformation and restructuring, because of its high social and economic weight.</seg>
<seg id=148> In this respect, I would like to see the outermost regions, including 6 on 7 still remain amongst the 10 the poorest in the EU, have the Structural Funds, either on the sole criterion of GDP, but also on the geographical, demographic and mainly social indicators.</seg>
<seg id=149> Because we reject in the interests of French people, we cannot in all conscience approve its enlargement to the countries and peoples of Eastern Europe, barely freed from communist dictatorship and who cannot know yet how they want to get a technocratic and totalitarian trap.</seg>
<seg id=150> We would have had to limit ourselves at most a short but intense resolution with regard to the reports on the country.</seg>
<seg id=151> The present system, consisting of aid, subsidies and quotas should be replaced by free trade and the adaptation of the market.</seg>
<seg id=152> The importance and scale of the problems that enlargement raises are not compatible with the double language of them within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=153> To speak of enlargement does not mean penalising membership or otherwise of certain countries in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=154> Our neighbours have tried determinedly during the past decade to fulfil the criteria of accession.</seg>
<seg id=155> Latvia has its place in this House, not only because, overall, give it the right to 'pledge of confidence' needed to carry out such negotiations, but above all, and above all, because it is at home in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=156> I believe that, in those countries that have applied for membership, Poland is the State that deserves our support, our commitment, because, without the very important initiatives for Poland, the fall of communism would not have taken place and we would not be here today discussing this problem.</seg>
<seg id=157> It may not be too obvious to the Polish people who is still largely euro-sceptique.</seg>
<seg id=158> I would urge Prague to seize this sign, this invitation, this request for dialogue, to follow them up, and to ensure that, together with this House, these relics of a nationalist era can be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=159> I welcome the Wiersma report on Slovakia's application for membership of the European Union, and I agree with most of the conclusions of the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=160> On this occasion, I have great pleasure to address a special greeting for the elderly and pensioners of the Republic of Bulgaria.</seg>
<seg id=161> I therefore see no reason why Romania should not be admitted to the European Union, if it continues to make progress at the same pace and again that the Union will have to carry out the necessary adjustments to its institutional structure and its policies to cope with enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=162> Whatever solution regarding the settlers, and God knows that the problem is difficult, such as the return of land on both sides, what the report says is too hard not to warrant a reserve.</seg>
<seg id=163> Unfortunately, some of the comments of the draft report on the application for accession of Cyprus to the European Union, drawn up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, are not helpful in this regard.</seg>
<seg id=164> This will not be an easy task, given the lack of goodwill on the part of the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=165> Stenzel report (A5-0243 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=166> It is, I was indeed a victim of food poisoning, even though it was slight, in the European Parliament, unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id=167> For all these reasons, I voted in favour of the ban on dilution which is proposed by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=168> We must, in this resolution, urge the ASEM countries to put pressure on the Burmese military regime to restore democracy in the country.</seg>
<seg id=169> We are doing bias in our approach and our way of doing things.</seg>
<seg id=170> This is not the time to be hesitant.</seg>
<seg id=171> I would like to mention a number of important points of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=172> The equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=173> That is why we need legislation against discrimination.</seg>
<seg id=174> We are thus now with a large number of legal technical amendments designed to ensure a degree of equal protection against discrimination based on racial and discrimination based on religion, disability, age and sexual orientation on the other.</seg>
<seg id=175> It was necessary to make an effort to balance, moderation and good legal practice and his report reflects - in my opinion - all these qualities.</seg>
<seg id=176> In addition, they are of the opinion that the cases of discrimination are not enough of them to justify a directive.</seg>
<seg id=177> The action programme before us does not provide sufficient resources to replace the relevant work of the fifth framework programme - work which I hope the continuation will be guaranteed in the other framework programmes - and we must therefore ensure their complementarity.</seg>
<seg id=178> Everyone agrees that we must fight against discrimination, but there is a difference of opinion when it comes to knowing how, to what extent and with what means.</seg>
<seg id=179> I have had the opportunity, in committee, to protest at the fact that the experts can also be out of the NGOs and, however, have something to say.</seg>
<seg id=180> We are also very satisfied with the provisions of the directive specifying that equal treatment for people with disabilities also means that companies are supposed to make adjustments in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=181> Only in this way can we succeed in effectively combat discrimination in all areas of social life in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=182> After all, as we teach the major democracies anglo-saxonnes, racism and discrimination are fighting for liberal democracy, and not by the restriction and the gradual erosion of economic freedoms, freedom of opinion, expression and association.</seg>
<seg id=183> For example, we have a proposal which homosexuality sacrement the status of marriage.</seg>
<seg id=184> We are thus strengthening the positions of the European Union on specific situations experienced by its citizens in relation to discrimination and equal treatment.</seg>
<seg id=185> I should also like to come back to the question of the religious exception.</seg>
<seg id=186> My attention has been drawn to the interpretation of the explanatory statement in relation to Article 1, which again may seem a little obscure, except that it makes the distinction between sexual orientation and behaviour.</seg>
<seg id=187> As what discrimination is hiÃ©rarchisent.</seg>
<seg id=188> In Nouvelle-CalÃ©donie we give a preference on the basis of skin chromatique.</seg>
<seg id=189> These guidelines of the directive, added to the fact that recently adopted Directive 2000, demonstrate the obvious desire of the European Union to guarantee an open society, free from categories predetermined and, above all, the scourge of racism which has deep roots in the history of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=190> Those who come here and say that Europe must not adopt a directive laying down the values that we all want to defend is mistaken.</seg>
<seg id=191> Do not touch the hard-won acquis.</seg>
<seg id=192> Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the media must also play an important role in this task.</seg>
<seg id=193> Experience has shown that the promotion of legislative measures to fight against discrimination is essential, but it is not enough.</seg>
<seg id=194> We must avoid confusion paperassiÃšres, which will only reduce Europe to a purely entity materialistic, politically correct, but useless.</seg>
<seg id=195> I believe that this Parliament has given too much legislation, after all, that the Commission "reluctant" European had wanted to propose.</seg>
<seg id=196> I wish to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, for their reports quite remarkable.</seg>
<seg id=197> I also accept the amendments you have tabled in order to highlight the importance of the prevention of discrimination and to combat them.</seg>
<seg id=198> The second category is designed to clarify the text of the Commission proposal and the third is a large number of amendments whose aim is to try to bring this proposal into line with the directive on discrimination based on race adopted last June.</seg>
<seg id=199> In particular, Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 propose to delete the reference to discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id=200> I cannot accept the references that you made in Amendments Nos 21 and 45, persons and companies and the unofficial groupings, because this proposal employment applies only to individuals.</seg>
<seg id=201> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.</seg>
<seg id=202> You cannot expect the public support for peacekeeping operations if your troops are threatened with death by weapons which we ourselves have provided.</seg>
<seg id=203> For example, in my country, I should like a licence to own a shotgun, but not to settle as broker at the back of my garden.</seg>
<seg id=204> Another important point: the export ban, promote and marketing of equipment and knowledge used for the practice of torture.</seg>
<seg id=205> Having said that, I would naturally like to congratulate the rapporteur, my colleague, Mr Titley, for his excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=206> We must extend our considerations, on the one hand, to the questions of constraint, but also the means other than those intended for the use of military itself: disarmament and conversion, the strengthening of the action of the customs authorities and the police, and, secondly, to the candidate countries, as Mr Wiersma has just mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=207> The control of money circuit makes it more and more difficult the circumvention of the rules governing arms trade.</seg>
<seg id=208> The annual report aims to identify such potential improvements.</seg>
<seg id=209> The European Union is currently considering to complete the project beyond its expiry date, which will take place in November of this year.</seg>
<seg id=210> A methodology and indicators have been defined and will be presented at the forthcoming Research Council.</seg>
<seg id=211> Thank you, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=212> With regard to the problems of SMEs, of course, we have ensured that, in the Framework Programme, SMEs have their part, as envisaged in the budget decision.</seg>
<seg id=213> That is what the discussion of the budget in Greece, and we must also note that those who put forward the views of the European Union are numerous. Is that true?</seg>
<seg id=214> As regards multidisciplinarity, I share your view.</seg>
<seg id=215> The first is the EU's participation in the national programmes that he mentioned specifically in his statement.</seg>
<seg id=216> We can therefore talk of a European Research Area, if we are, we, responsible for 5% of this research.</seg>
<seg id=217> Thank you very much, Mr Busquin.</seg>
<seg id=218> On the one hand, as a result of the efforts made to fully commit appropriations at the end of 1999, the applications pending at the beginning of this year for the financing of new projects were necessarily very low.</seg>
<seg id=219> But I would repeat that things have been well made by Portugal for the previous period.</seg>
<seg id=220> Question No 2 by (H-0730 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=221> Finally, fixing the excise duties on mineral oils at a high level does not lead to a breach of Community regulations in the field of competition.</seg>
<seg id=222> Secondly, as Mr MacCormick knows, when the Member States favour an industrial sector given by means of fiscal measures, break the rules on state aid, tax state aid equivalent to subsidies.</seg>
<seg id=223> Nuclear energy, for example, is a very clear example.</seg>
<seg id=224> Subject: Specific 'minority languages' budget of the European Union budget appropriations for minority languages which exist since 1983, has gradually increased up to 1995, the year in which they have been the highest (4 million).</seg>
<seg id=225> Mr President, Members of Parliament will know that very important resources are available in the Structural Funds - and this is new - for cultural activities, because with my colleague Michel Barnier, we have attached importance to the fact that the structural funds do not only invest in roads or airports but also in human beings.</seg>
<seg id=226> The Commission will therefore not new financial commitments next year.</seg>
<seg id=227> As regards the concrete proposals for financing, it is impossible for me to comment, because we must respect the normal procedure.</seg>
<seg id=228> I have in mind a number of possibilities.</seg>
<seg id=229> It is therefore necessary that something should be done in this area, because there is millions of small and medium-sized enterprises in the whole of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=230> Its regulation couvre-t-elle hunting requirements, for example the impetus, as well as the processing of meat destined for personal consumption?</seg>
<seg id=231> If we were to apply this regulation to the meat that consumes oneself, it would be a disaster for the elk hunters of bureaucratic.</seg>
<seg id=232> I intend, after the conclusion of this report, to bring forward proposals to improve the transport of animals and to address the problem of the unsatisfactory application of the restrictions of travel times.</seg>
<seg id=233> We have already discussed this matter at my meeting with the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance.</seg>
<seg id=234> Our question is clear: what are the measures taken by the Commission?</seg>
<seg id=235> The general product safety also obliges producers to inform consumers of the risks.</seg>
<seg id=236> The case of Maryam Ayubi is extremely worrying.</seg>
<seg id=237> Question No 14 by (H-0745 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=238> The attitude of the EU with regard to this ministerial meeting in Vientiane, and even the question of its presence or of the level at which the EU should be represented, will depend on the evolution of the situation in Burma by December.</seg>
<seg id=239> One last point.</seg>
<seg id=240> The elections are an important step in the participation of the Kosovars to the management of their own communities.</seg>
<seg id=241> I can even tell you that the outcome of these elections was more democratic, more organised than some of our countries, which I found myself, as a participant, either as an observer.</seg>
<seg id=242> But we regard it as a beginning and not in any way the culmination of the process.</seg>
<seg id=243> It calls for a more effective control of the arms trade and for greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id=244> I now see that the number of contracts on arms and their components is increasing every year.</seg>
<seg id=245> We cannot take concrete decisions on the basis of information fictitious, of fictitious reality.</seg>
<seg id=246> The arrangement, which was to keep them together within the same DG should be reconsidered.</seg>
<seg id=247> If these institutions must be able to appoint an internal auditor, it will perhaps be enough to impose minimum requirements in terms of auditing the financial controller.</seg>
<seg id=248> The Commissioner is aware, this proposal is not unanimous in this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=249> We therefore have no objection to an independent internal audit service, to which we are currently giving the green light through the report by our colleague, Mr van Hulten.</seg>
<seg id=250> Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by expressing my congratulations to the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=251> We are of the opinion that modernising the administration is necessary and urgent.</seg>
<seg id=252> An independent contre-vÃ©rification is essential in order to avoid the mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=253> Money must be spent in a more focused and more effective in the future, of course, we must be better able to ensure that the funds are actually spent for the purposes for which they have been affected by the competent authorities in budgetary matters.</seg>
<seg id=254> With regard to the amendments, I would like to briefly make the following comment: the Commission agrees with this additional recital.</seg>
<seg id=255> I therefore thank you for your proposals and your deliberations.</seg>
<seg id=256> I would like to summarise the proposals in this report which seem to me to be the most important and operational specifically: firstly, the creation of a group of experts, composed of individuals appointed by the Member States, which should help to define minimum standards of protection of minors in the media; secondly, the creation of a code of self-regulation by all operators in the sector; thirdly, the possibility of encouraging and making filter devices available both by television via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id=257> I cannot, unfortunately, support the demands of the Liberals.</seg>
<seg id=258> This falls essentially within the legislative competence of the Member States and must remain such, which does not, however, exclude a conciliation procedure for the search for consensus on some reference values by way of dialogue with all interested parties at European level.</seg>
<seg id=259> The fact remains that it is, in my view, parents to ensure that their children do not watch this kind of programme.</seg>
<seg id=260> Parents are in particular need that we provide assistance in this area, which must include: the specific parameters for the protection of minors in the field of media that can be applied in the area of the European Union as a whole, the establishment and availability at an affordable price of filters, legal provisions relating to the protection of minors and the commitment of the responsibility of the media, i.e. broadcasting companies and companies producing programmes, be they public or private.</seg>
<seg id=261> So when I hear, in the debates in committee, some people say that there is no evidence of the detrimental effects of violence in all its forms, TV, on children, I am surprised and I use a euphemism.</seg>
<seg id=262> With regard to the introduction of a code of self-regulation, it is noted, particularly in technical terms, that in some Member States broadcasters have already introduced codes of regulation for the television, which must enable parents to switch off the lights.</seg>
<seg id=263> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=264> In particular, my report replaces the international norm valid giving the decisions to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=265> It would be a minimum for us to make this area of freedom which is a fundamental right of every European citizen.</seg>
<seg id=266> Some payments due in 1996, Mr President, have still not been made.</seg>
<seg id=267> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani for their work.</seg>
<seg id=268> I commend this report to the House as well as the amendments tabled by Mr Evans.</seg>
<seg id=269> Our human resources are our only future in a world where knowledge is the most valuable.</seg>
<seg id=270> It is not with the Green Papers, red or white, black it solves problems, but with concrete action.</seg>
<seg id=271> But the European Parliament, and it is in its role, Parliament has exerted pressure to ensure that researchers are still included in the text.</seg>
<seg id=272> Today, you are paying a visit to a crucial moment for the future of European integration.</seg>
<seg id=273> But we know that the process is incomplete and that this incomplÃ©tude threatens its vitality.</seg>
<seg id=274> The debate, in which each country helps with its own sensitivity, its traditions, its culture, is an instrument which enables us to reveal, to define and of the state.</seg>
<seg id=275> Long live the European Parliament, long live the European Union!</seg>
<seg id=276> We must ensure that women enjoy jobs generated, while avoiding a repetition of the same inequalities in the more traditional sectors: the less skilled jobs, part-time sometimes not chosen, on fixed-term contracts and the difficulties of access to decision-making posts.</seg>
<seg id=277> The Council will discuss a proposal for indicators to measure the progress in this area.</seg>
<seg id=278> Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar dedicated to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach of equality by gender mainstreaming and specific guidelines.</seg>
<seg id=279> I am thinking especially of the violence suffered by them, one of the priorities of my government action, and I know that this issue is also particularly you.</seg>
<seg id=280> We know that the measures of the reconciliation of professional and family life are particularly women, although we still need to carry out studies on the current situation of the family and the role that women plays, who is no longer the traditional role as society has changed significantly, just as the family structure.</seg>
<seg id=281> Some people, including Members of this Parliament, sometimes seem convinced that the opposite is true, but it is a mistake.</seg>
<seg id=282> I would like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that equality begins at home.</seg>
<seg id=283> I find this embarrassing position and ambiguous, and it deserves, I believe, reflection on the projects that you are proposing to us, because it is not sure that we will have to practice through all this.</seg>
<seg id=284> In this area, there is no equality.</seg>
<seg id=285> The image of the European Women, as we discovered over the pages of our report, our problems with framework directives, Danish women in their majority, not to the euro.</seg>
<seg id=286> I think it is significant that the report is the creation of a digital balance between men and women in all sectors of society, on the labour market, for example.</seg>
<seg id=287> It is precisely for this reason that the report has missed a major opportunity disguising completely marriage and the family.</seg>
<seg id=288> That is something which the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id=289> We have heard that the previous presidency was first restructured then dismantled the Ministry of equal opportunities.</seg>
<seg id=290> The average salaries of women continue to be lower on average 28%, compared with those of men, which contributes to the fact that women form the majority of the poor population and which makes it difficult to participate in social and political life.</seg>
<seg id=291> That is something quite remarkable.</seg>
<seg id=292> We are witnessing a impoverishment of female women everywhere in Europe, in France, where 15% of them live when even with less 3.650 per month.</seg>
<seg id=293> All countries did not follow this example, I hope that the example of France will be followed by other countries.</seg>
<seg id=294> The history of women is obviously very long.</seg>
<seg id=295> We must help the candidate countries to reach the level of the acquis communautaire.</seg>
<seg id=296> However, on this point, I would like your support.</seg>
<seg id=297> This is not the case, even if it is a good text; after having reflection, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has chosen, after a long debate, not to table any amendments.</seg>
<seg id=298> The Committee on Legal Affairs, after a long debate, felt that it was not reasonable that legal insecurity lasts six years and that three years ago, the deadline, was a more appropriate in that it should be possible to determine, with adequate resources and an average speed, whether or not there have been irregularities in a statement.</seg>
<seg id=299> This is Amendment No 15, which relates to fraud.</seg>
<seg id=300> The aim of achieving a simplified communication, as well as qualitative but sufficient flexibility of the basic regulation by improving the recovery procedure and adapting the provisions for presentation to the customs duties, responds to one of the many requirements of the single market, and this objective has been achieved here since many countries have advised to participate rapidly to international trade.</seg>
<seg id=301> It would like to thank Parliament and especially the committee chaired by Mrs de Palacio for the efforts and the interest made - by Parliament and the committee - in the context of this dossier.</seg>
<seg id=302> Welcome</seg>
<seg id=303> I hope that this does not change the meaning of the vote which will be expressed, but we really must check the translation of the French version.</seg>
<seg id=304> Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report.</seg>
<seg id=305> It is recognised that the knowledge of foreign languages is a prerequisite for mobility.</seg>
<seg id=306> We also feel that the Member States must be able to decide for themselves, to a large extent, taxes that they wish to impose.</seg>
<seg id=307> I am a little sorry that we have no chance of obtaining a majority in relation to the need to make an expiry date for the storage of documents.</seg>
<seg id=308> During the negotiations, the Treaty of Amsterdam, we were pleased with the inclusion of Article 13 concerning discrimination based on sex, race or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, not sectarian age and sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id=309> My final point concerns the budget for this programme, or 98,4 million, which is obviously insufficient in view of the actions envisaged.</seg>
<seg id=310> It is explicitly for reasons of the amendment that the directive provides to intervene in the field of regulations relating to the age applied in the Member States, regulations, which are quite justified for reasons of genetic psychology and have no impact on the working life.</seg>
<seg id=311> I also think that we could dispense with everything that has been written in the new Article 12 has).</seg>
<seg id=312> As regards religion / of personal convictions, the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection proposed in this area.</seg>
<seg id=313> The Christian Democrats believe, on the whole, I welcome the proposal for a directive on the establishment of a general framework on non-discrimination in working life.</seg>
<seg id=314> This is, however, revealing that occupation in staff of an internal audit service and not of the importance of financial and, consequently, the usefulness of such a service.</seg>
<seg id=315> The EU has decided to develop joint military powers in order to achieve the objectives of the so-called Petersberg tasks (fight against crises and search for solutions to conflicts outside of the territory of the EU), but it has no common defence policy.</seg>
<seg id=316> - (NL) Without weapons, the world would be safer.</seg>
<seg id=317> The resolution does not radically reduced arms sales to promote a policy of disarmament, but only to regulate them in order to guarantee the profits of industrial groups.</seg>
<seg id=318> The communication from the Commission recognises the problem but does not propose concrete measures, because it is locked in the logic of the liberalisation of the market and competition, and the proposals that it can do not affect the substance of a harsh reality - especially for children - that of the unaccountability enjoyed by the multinationals, which, in their quest for profit, do not concern themselves with the effects of their programmes and their products and transfer full responsibility for the parents, inviting them to apply to new products to protect their children.</seg>
<seg id=319> Like the rapporteur, I believe that the measures to protect young people against the violent and harmful programmes should not be limited to traditional television, but apply to the whole of the media.</seg>
<seg id=320> With an average of three hours per day, it is the most important human activity after the sleep and, for adults, the work.</seg>
<seg id=321> Furthermore, women are often 'flexible' posts, temporary contracts or low wages are typical of the sectors in mainly women.</seg>
<seg id=322> To be the first victims of the reduction in public spending, privatisations in the health sector, for the right of access to health care and treatment, not to mention the right to programmes of prevention and information.</seg>
<seg id=323> B5-0792 / 2000, by Mr Marset Campos and Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, on the crisis situation in Peru.</seg>
<seg id=324> Mr President, I would have liked to have a debate on Latin America is not only on the basis of one or other topical problem, but rather in the context of a well-prepared debate in the committees.</seg>
<seg id=325> We must make sure that Peru reach the objective it has set itself with candidates which are equal to the challenge and which are able to fulfil the view of the Peruvian people, namely a political renewal and a substantial democracy.</seg>
<seg id=326> The joint debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=327> However, we know that Afghanistan is not far away, that Afghanistan is the largest producer of opiacÃ©es, and therefore we know and we can imagine the role that these mafias policies, not only political, play in the expansion of the drugs trade.</seg>
<seg id=328> It calls on the Commission to take stock of humanitarian aid to the Afghan people, so that no one is forgotten in the territory.</seg>
<seg id=329> The suffering caused in this conflict is terrible.</seg>
<seg id=330> A budget line has programmes for mine clearance and prevention for years.</seg>
<seg id=331> Let me respond to the warnings of Mrs Paciotti by saying that I shall of course ask the Commission today for what has happened and what should be done with resources into mine-clearance.</seg>
<seg id=332> (B5-0794 / 2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the abduction by Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerrilla movement.</seg>
<seg id=333> We all wish not to talk about Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=334> The Commission has already proposed to coordinate the measures of such a package. The Commission envisages, in the next few days to find considerable resources to this end.</seg>
<seg id=335> So, once again, two weights, two measures, and I believe that we must deplore.</seg>
<seg id=336> This attitude of the Albanian opposition party, deliberately rejecting a solution needed to resolve an Albanian problem in Macedonia is totally incomprehensible to me.</seg>
<seg id=337> I think the Macedonians have done an extraordinary performance in managing to resolve them the internal questions.</seg>
<seg id=338> That is why I also believe that this reconciliation can take; however, the government, which has very courageously found a solution to the issue of universities and many other problems, needs visible signs of success and a strong support, otherwise the peace threatened in the region as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=339> The PHARE funds available for the year 2000 within the framework of the national programme can also be used to support at university during the next academic year 2001-2002.</seg>
<seg id=340> I would like to point out that all of us today, Greek MEPs, we have now reacted to this situation.</seg>
<seg id=341> And all this, which concerns Greece, which has been occupying the forefront in the European Union for the sector of the Merchant Navy, actually concerns the safety of shipping in all its aspects in the Union.</seg>
<seg id=342> In recent years, many other people have died at sea, not just as a result of the sinking of ferries, but so far too frequently within our fishing communities.</seg>
<seg id=343> On the contrary, the innocent victims are being used to promote broader objectives of shipowners.</seg>
<seg id=344> We must realise that this is also about the credibility of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=345> To conclude, I would like to stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the issue of European legislation on the safety of ships transporting passengers must be given the highest priority within the European Union and that the important thing is to ensure that these provisions are applied throughout the Community of a strict and uniform manner.</seg>
<seg id=346> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have arrived a little late for reasons which you are familiar, in order to make a brief statement on the two issues which are on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade and in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=347> Commissioner Verheugen is going to speak, as did Mr Solana, on the two issues that we meet this afternoon, namely the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg id=348> We must be prepared to keep this promise, as soon as the will of the people has been respected.</seg>
<seg id=349> Madam President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, is that I am taking part in this debate, because I do not wish that our Parliament is just as a judge authorised to apportion blame on this or that, at a time when, after the hopes so strong raised here a month ago, we are faced with the tragic consequences of this new outburst of violence in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=350> Madam President, my speech today is based not only on various analyses of developments, but also on the experience that I have experienced personally last week, as I was incidentally in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip when the unrest broke out.</seg>
<seg id=351> Even if we are opposed to any violence, it is not possible to equate Israeli violence and Palestinian violence.</seg>
<seg id=352> I would ask Parliament, at this critical juncture, to make a statement of support for the courageous people who have, today, defended freedom in the streets of Belgrade, reiterating the support we have given, we, as Europeans, not so long ago, to those who were fighting for their freedom in other cities.</seg>
<seg id=353> The Europeans, Madam President, would no doubt be well advised to seize the ball which has been made here by the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council.</seg>
<seg id=354> The status of Jerusalem is a difficult point in the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=355> For years, thanks to his propaganda machine and the pressure that he was exercising on the media, it has managed to mislead the inhabitants of his country, but unfortunately also a large number of people in the West, to present a false picture of the reality.</seg>
<seg id=356> While this tragedy is coming to an end, this Parliament has a duty, as a symbol of a free and united Europe, to support the crowd outside the Yugoslav parliament and to help Mr Kosturica to fulfil its mandate.</seg>
<seg id=357> It is precisely this attitude harsh as the stone which leads us to fear the worst - and current events illustrates the words that I have set out a few hours ago.</seg>
<seg id=358> I wonder whether the Commissioner already provides for steps to show that we regard Kostunica as the legally elected representative of the Serbian people and as a partner with which the European Union must now address.</seg>
<seg id=359> The European Parliament wishes to express its full solidarity at this historic moment when the tyranny is falter and where triumph over democracy.</seg>
<seg id=360> The next item is the report (A5-0237 / 2000) by Mr SeppÃ€nen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2000 / 24 / EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to cover loans for projects in Croatia (COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000 / 0122 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=361> We must welcome the new political path which was opened to this country after the presidential and legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id=362> Between the Union and Croatia, there is an advisory working party whose objective is to make available to Croatia his expertise and technical assistance in the negotiation of the agreements governing the mutual relationship.</seg>
<seg id=363> Let us not forget that Croatia symbolised recently the failure of a privatisation programme whose only a few have benefited.</seg>
<seg id=364> The contribution that we are debating, in the form of a loan of EUR 250 Millions of the EIB for the period 2000 to 2007 cannot therefore be a milestone, but must be a help boost.</seg>
<seg id=365> It is not entirely true to talk of democratisation in this report.</seg>
<seg id=366> When, fifty years ago, Croatia and Slovakia have become independent for the first time, they were satellites of the Hitler regime.</seg>
<seg id=367> We cannot, of course, separate the question of guarantees and that of Croatia, nor of the discussion yesterday evening, nor the developments that have taken place in Belgrade.</seg>
<seg id=368> At a time when it appears that Milosevic has fled and that the will of the Serbian people has prevailed, we hope that the establishment of normal relations and partnership between Serbia and our Union of democracies will be shortly.</seg>
<seg id=369> I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 6 October 2000.</seg>
<seg id=370> (The House rose and observed a minute's silence)</seg>
<seg id=371> My question is as follows: speaking on behalf of the European Parliament on this Statute?</seg>
<seg id=372> I would ask you, Madam President, to do everything in your power to speed up the process underway in the Committee on Petitions, on a document presented by more than thirty social and collective NGOs to protest against this flagrant violation of Community legislation on radiation protection.</seg>
<seg id=373> A post-mortem examination carried out in Georgia has shown that it is clearly a murder after probable torture.</seg>
<seg id=374> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the opportunity to take a big step towards your dream - which is not, moreover, mine.</seg>
<seg id=375> This is the basic regulation, on the basis of all the other regulations on GM crops.</seg>
<seg id=376> It is obvious, in the main one after the other.</seg>
<seg id=377> (The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.50 p.m. and)</seg>
<seg id=378> The next item is the report (A5-0291 / 2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council [COM (2000) 379 - C5-0508 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 (COS)], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the new social agenda.</seg>
<seg id=379> The right to underline the importance of this open coordination method does not mean that this method should replace social legislation, because we need to establish, in Europe too, social rights, we must have the courage to define the minimum social and social legislation which is necessary in the context of a European internal market.</seg>
<seg id=380> In our opinion, we also support the dialogue and cooperation with civil society, and especially with women's organisations in the countries who are preparing their integration into the European family, because we need to achieve a uniform development which will follow the stages and the motives of the rest of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=381> The areas of action listed in the Commission communication were also subject to a general agreement.</seg>
<seg id=382> I would remind you, at this stage of my speech, the holding of a European seminar in Biarritz on this subject on 4 and 5 December, seminar which I will chair.</seg>
<seg id=383> With regard to the fight against exclusion, we have made great progress in defining, on 17 October, the Council 'Employment and Social Policy, appropriate objectives for combating poverty and social exclusion, which will serve as the basis for national action plans.</seg>
<seg id=384> I have heard some people who have read the report say that they agree with the diagnosis but not with the measures proposed.</seg>
<seg id=385> Technological development and new methods of organisation also to legitimize a flexible, putting more emphasis on the objectives and achieving results, and attaching less importance to the rigid regulations.</seg>
<seg id=386> This is where we must seek, in our opinion, the obsoleteness reproached for those who do not wait for the best of all possible worlds of a market without hindrance.</seg>
<seg id=387> This has certainly helped to reduce social unrest in our countries and to encourage investment programmes of foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id=388> However, the method used seems more questionable.</seg>
<seg id=389> If we are talking about a charter of rights and if we are in favour of the creation of a European constitution, we cannot be achieved one-sided view, and we must say that we must take all the necessary steps in this direction, even if it calls for more detailed legislation.</seg>
<seg id=390> I would like to point out critically the lack of initiatives on the new requirements relating to the protection of labour, consultation of workers and the working relationship.</seg>
<seg id=391> Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Minister, Mrs PÃ©ry, for the presentation of the social agenda.</seg>
<seg id=392> These points, as we know, are combated by the conservatives in Europe. We are, with our group, especially attached.</seg>
<seg id=393> The third issue of content is enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=394> The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=395> We should complement the measures of the Commission for a review of the individual possibilities of access to health care, social security and pension system, the shortcomings of the organisation of work, and perhaps also by a general reduction in working time.</seg>
<seg id=396> Thus, women will feel Europe close to them, and Europe will benefit the interesting and innovative ideas which will take shape through the report with this programme.</seg>
<seg id=397> We are therefore waiting for an annual report of the President of the Commission in the context of an annual report to the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=398> I am very glad that we envisage a better organisation of childminders in order to facilitate the balance between work and family life.</seg>
<seg id=399> My group will take this into account in the final vote.</seg>
<seg id=400> (The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=401> I think the new approach of the Commission very positive, and the proposal for a decision on the programme for the period 2001-2005, very carefully.</seg>
<seg id=402> I believe that the large number of amendments which are accepted testifies to the community of spirit which exists between the Commission and the Committee on Women.</seg>
<seg id=403> Firstly, because I have received, during the past year, many requests on the part of companies, who feel rather powerless in relation to the decisions of mergers that they should take, particularly in cases where they have had to appeal against the decision of the Commission before the Court of First Instance.</seg>
<seg id=404> I should also like to ask Commissioner Monti when we can expect the publication of a public register, effective and valid on state aid as well as the picture, as expected results.</seg>
<seg id=405> I would also like to point out to Commissioner Monti that it is important that, in the next report, a greater section devoted to the financial services sector.</seg>
<seg id=406> What I have just said does not apply only to the energy sector, but for other areas in general.</seg>
<seg id=407> Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the good work done in the two reports, which have a judgement flattering on your work and that of the Directorate-General for Competition.</seg>
<seg id=408> I stress this because the market cannot regulate everything and that, in this sense, there cannot be any competition without limits.</seg>
<seg id=409> Mr President, today, nobody is questioning, and I am not going to do so, the fact that state aid to distort competition and are a harmful element which companies to be more efficient.</seg>
<seg id=410> The hearing and deny the fact that the state aids have fallen during the period 1994-1998, while the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction, was already very strange.</seg>
<seg id=411> Today, we must not, of course, Mr President, to ignore the past, although in my opinion refers to the XXIXe Commission report on competition policy, and we must learn the lessons for the future.</seg>
<seg id=412> During the speaking time available to me, I would like to mention, Mr President, the following three points: the modernisation of Community competition law, the activities carried out in 1999 in the application of the rules of competition and the issue of state aid.</seg>
<seg id=413> The Commission has continued to intervene decisively in particular with the cartels and the abuse of a dominant position, as in the field of conciliations.</seg>
<seg id=414> Mr Rapkay, it has been extremely important for the Commission to have the support of the European Parliament for the continuation of its policy of competition, and I do not have the impression that this support would be watered down.</seg>
<seg id=415> This mechanism can be activated at the request of a Member State or under Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, provision which remains in force during the third phase of economic and monetary union for the states which are the subject of a derogation, currently Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.</seg>
<seg id=416> The use of the capital market should remain the only option in the future.</seg>
<seg id=417> I am therefore expressing the hope that this report will receive the approval of this House in its present version, and the internal market and also applies from the vine to the sector.</seg>
<seg id=418> Today, its review is necessary in view of the developments of the plant regulation and the scientific and technical progress, spoken in particular in the increase in vitro.</seg>
<seg id=419> I also believe that the reference to the precautionary principle, the possibility of genetic modification means, for example, the reduction of the intensive use of plant protection treatments.</seg>
<seg id=420> To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, to observe the precautionary principle, in its spirit as in his letter, though unfortunately the articles and amendments that I have just mentioned are not withdrawn, it should be, as demanded in the wine growers, that we follow the opinion of Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, of the Committee on the Environment, and vote their abolition.</seg>
<seg id=421> Mr President, if you will allow me, Commissioner, can you give your opinion on the amendment of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is Amendment No 1.</seg>
<seg id=422> The only point on which we could discuss, is whether or not I have taken note, that the French Government has sent me the decree ending the mandate of Mr Le Pen.</seg>
<seg id=423> I would remind you that the vote took place at 12 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=424> In the field of justice and home affairs, I am optimistic about a solution for the civil judicial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=425> The preparatory group will play its full role until 19 November, the date of the next ministerial meeting.</seg>
<seg id=426> We need this climate tonique, as has been said by Mr Moscovici, and I too have felt, at the level of Heads of State and Government, a very serious sense of collective responsibility and historical at an historic moment for European integration.</seg>
<seg id=427> We must simply, ladies and gentlemen, that from now on, in these matters of a qualified majority, not to be below the spirit or the climate in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg id=428> Smaller countries of the European Union are not the subject of the greatest!</seg>
<seg id=429> I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify this point.</seg>
<seg id=430> On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica is an historic event.</seg>
<seg id=431> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, if progress has been made on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting, the disagreements remain on the composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, as you have pointed out.</seg>
<seg id=432> It seems to me that we are going in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id=433> Those who refuse closer cooperation to enjoy the same freedom of movement that passengers in the back seat of a car.</seg>
<seg id=434> I am not here, more than you, to interfere in the internal affairs of Germany, but I believe that this position is profoundly consistent and is also in line with the wishes of the Commission, if I am not mistaken.</seg>
<seg id=435> We have started to have discussions on this issue, making it clear that all the Member States wish to maintain this ceiling after enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=436> I believe that this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id=437> The first is that we have sometimes had the impression that in Biarritz, there was an obsession of the debate between small and large states.</seg>
<seg id=438> From this point of view, I believe that it is not enough to say that the Community method must be safeguarded.</seg>
<seg id=439> Even when the applicant countries accede to the Union, each Member State must retain a Commissioner 'junior' or 'Senior'.</seg>
<seg id=440> The wording of Article 93 is all the more tragic that once the first wave of enlargement, we will be even more successful in the impossibility of moving towards a qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=441> It is, in fact, to convince the citizens of these countries of the obvious merits of any new European Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=442> That would have been ignoring the importance of such a crisis as to imagine that the fears maintained for generations could take place without new uprisings in the run-up to the final peace, reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id=443> I am also concerned about the response weakened to Parliament's request for democratization.</seg>
<seg id=444> However, the problem lies rather to those who wish to take far-reaching reforms before enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=445> On the one hand, the Head of the Israeli Government's decision to freeze the peace negotiations as a result of the violence which prevails in the region and to focus its efforts on the creation of a government of concentration with the opposition leader, Mr Sharon.</seg>
<seg id=446> It is with great satisfaction that we have learned the victory by the people of Yugoslavia and the election of its president, Mr KostunÃ­ca.</seg>
<seg id=447> I would like to ask Mr BarÃ³n Crespo to ask his Italian colleagues to explain why they are in government in Italy with a party that is Communist states quite openly and are preparing to face the parliamentary elections with another party, the Communist openly partito per the rifondazione Comunista.</seg>
<seg id=448> Progress is necessary in this field within the codecision procedure.</seg>
<seg id=449> The Commission is better able to provide the necessary impetus in the future by the possibility that it has to vote by simple majority.</seg>
<seg id=450> The European Union has no need today to visionaries who watch until 2030, but people can identify the problems that will make enlargement in the three to eight years to come, and which can find solutions to these problems.</seg>
<seg id=451> It is therefore an open work which has not fallen from above and which has not been imposed.</seg>
<seg id=452> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=453> Without this fundamental reference is, at best, the worst we are entre-tue.</seg>
<seg id=454> Democracy is better in Europe, but the European democracy, it is ill.</seg>
<seg id=455> Today, 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, the European Parliament says something very simple and said: the European Constitution, yes, you can, yes, we want.</seg>
<seg id=456> This is also the idea that the island is in itself a sufficient criterion.</seg>
<seg id=457> I will go to the point in concentrating on the salient points of the report by Mr Gil-Robles, I will simply say that I find it very good.</seg>
<seg id=458> First of all, the simplification and clarification of the Treaties.</seg>
<seg id=459> I do not want to go further, because we are not here - in any case I am not here â to discuss the report by the Institute of Florence.</seg>
<seg id=460> According to the information - I shall be technical, pardonnez-le-moi â which has been communicated to the Presidency, it seems that a clear majority of the language versions, unlike the Italian version, is referring, for the implementation of cohesion policy, the least favoured islands and not the islands in general.</seg>
<seg id=461> Mr Duhamel, you will probably agree with me that if there is no success in Nice, there will be no place, at least no credibility, for a debate on the future of European integration, at least in the current framework.</seg>
<seg id=462> It is also essential that this European constitution should be clearly defined in the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union. The dynamics of European integration should be included to cover the areas in which it must act jointly, as for example in the field of foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=463> They could also be needed to overcome the persistent blockages.</seg>
<seg id=464> We need more transparency in the distribution of competences and the affirmation of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=465> Everyone knows that there are extremely different views on this subject in the various Member States and within the various social groups.</seg>
<seg id=466> Unfortunately the ultimate goal of a European Constitution would be exactly the opposite and, of course, we cannot approve it.</seg>
<seg id=467> In the European house strengthened, in fact, there are people sitting at the table of military, monetary, fiscal and then perhaps the other people who are in hand.</seg>
<seg id=468> It is clear that the second version is not the correct and that, firstly, because the regions are economically delayed in any case covered by the Structural Funds and, secondly, that if this interpretation was valid, there would have been no reason to adopt the Declaration No. 30</seg>
<seg id=469> Mr President, I shall focus my poor small sixty seconds on the report of Olivier Duhamel, who is a good report, because it would clearly say things, and the compliments of our rapporteur we have definitely convinced earlier.</seg>
<seg id=470> In my opinion, the unity of Europe cannot be that policy.</seg>
<seg id=471> It seems to us that the new Constitution should already be ready to enter into force for the next European elections.</seg>
<seg id=472> Consequently, the word 'least developed' applies both to the island regions and to other regions and, if we follow the proposal by Mr Barnier, it is here to amend the Italian version of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention.</seg>
<seg id=473> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=474> As the honourable Member has said that it would vote against, the amendment is therefore rejected.</seg>
<seg id=475> Mr President, the amendment which is now requested would lead us straight to chaos.</seg>
<seg id=476> I welcome the adoption of the Trakatellis report in this House, because it provides for the establishment of high quality and safety standards for blood and blood derivatives.</seg>
<seg id=477> If European parliamentary immunity is autonomous, the French authorities should take hold of the waiver of Mr Le Pen.</seg>
<seg id=478> . I am particularly disappointed by the EP's vote on the report on the proliferation of vine plants.</seg>
<seg id=479> Some consider that alcohol and tobacco and drugs, is a product that can cause great harm to those who consume and others; on the contrary, above all others regard as an important source of employment and of enrichment.</seg>
<seg id=480> The rapporteur reserve in all welcome the proposals of the Commission White Paper on this subject, but nevertheless it has fears about the possible implications of the reform, whose main aim and to decentralise the application of competition rules.</seg>
<seg id=481> In the debate yesterday evening, if I have been able to welcome Mr Jonathan Evans for his work, I have had to say from the outset my disagreement with the ultra-liberal imprÃ©gnation too liberal, otherwise, of his report.</seg>
<seg id=482> Ireland has AID realigned its activity in order to draw in the Objective 1 region half of all the jobs of Projects Greenfield over the next three years.</seg>
<seg id=483> Faced with the outcry that cause the consequences of this policy, intervention, funding and other economic and fiscal incentives of the State are offset partly the situation.</seg>
<seg id=484> (The sitting was suspended at 14h06 and resumed at 3 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=485> And we are therefore, in October 2000, on the eve of taking a decision on the numbers of the 2001 budget.</seg>
<seg id=486> However, this has not prevented the Council to reduce agricultural expenditure of a total of EUR 555 million.</seg>
<seg id=487> Furthermore, we believe, of course, that it is not enough simply, quite simply, to create 400 additional posts.</seg>
<seg id=488> I can only invite the Council to follow us.</seg>
<seg id=489> That is why the administration of this House is for Members and not the opposite.</seg>
<seg id=490> At the moment, it is the Court of Auditors which we cause less concern.</seg>
<seg id=491> Finally, we must deal with the budget of the Ombudsman.</seg>
<seg id=492> On the contrary, we are of the opinion that this area should be strengthened with regard to the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=493> We also propose that Parliament continues to be regularly informed.</seg>
<seg id=494> When we organise a legislative consultation on Social Affairs, cultural or environmental - the Commissioner will agree that I am right - we meet with the Commissioner for budgets, the Finance Ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets in order to ask for that no financial error must be committed.</seg>
<seg id=495> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your warm welcome.</seg>
<seg id=496> The Council has voted at first reading the appropriations it seem justified for 2001, without taking account of the concerns of tactical serving the objective of good allocation of appropriations that the Community institutions must continue.</seg>
<seg id=497> Before you declared your opinion on the draft budget for 2001, I would like to stress a number of objectives that the Council and Parliament have in common and which can result in an agreement between the two branches of the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=498> We find ourselves in a similar situation in terms of structural policy.</seg>
<seg id=499> Mr Colom i Naval has indicated, that the consultation of this summer has also led to a good result: in future, Parliament will have better information on legal bases which have an impact on the expenditure side.</seg>
<seg id=500> I would like to remind you that the financial perspective provided for last year for the Balkans 1.85 billion only envisaged for the whole period until 2006.</seg>
<seg id=501> I would ask you once again to examine without prejudice this proposal that the Commission maintains and bear in mind this possibility.</seg>
<seg id=502> That material has of course been useful for both the preparation of the 2001 budget and for the 1999 discharge.</seg>
<seg id=503> Although I very much appreciate the work of this body as a member of the Committee on Budgets, even though I believe just as much to the work of the rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgets, I do not want to fail, as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to point out two amendments that this committee is submitting once again to the House and whose importance is not insignificant, in spite of the modesty of the amounts involved.</seg>
<seg id=504> For these measures, we want to make the legal control once again fully operational and restore confidence in the legal security within the EU and consolidate the rule of law that is the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=505> Looking towards the abolition of this initiative without providing any replacement measure, the Commission clearly made a mockery of the political will expressed in Lisbon and the priority given by this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=506> This decision was quite astonishing and it gave the impression to many of us that the whole of this programme, very important, was simply become a bubble that will leave the Committee on Budgets and the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=507> The third point concerns the common agricultural policy, as defined in the draft budget.</seg>
<seg id=508> If employment is the political priority of the Union, fisheries, as an economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.</seg>
<seg id=509> I welcome in particular that the funding of Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000, whose pursuit was agreed at the end of last year, has been able to be assured.</seg>
<seg id=510> As regards the aid to the Mediterranean countries, for example, the backlog relates to the budgets for several years.</seg>
<seg id=511> Mr President, during the debates of previous years, I used to travel on the floor on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, for which we have heard this afternoon Mrs Iivari.</seg>
<seg id=512> But I would like to say to the House this afternoon that we must not lose sight of the fact that the European Union spends only 1% of the GDP of the Member States and that the bulk of this money is administered in the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=513> I now turn to the overall strategy.</seg>
<seg id=514> This brings me to the strategy of my group, because on the basis of our conviction is the desire to give the European citizen for their money.</seg>
<seg id=515> On the contrary, we must do everything possible to ensure that this House is an example of transparency, efficiency, and good democratic control of the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=516> We need to reflect on how to solve this problem.</seg>
<seg id=517> We want to promote the process of democratisation and we want to achieve a balance between the traditional areas of foreign policy that we have to deal with.</seg>
<seg id=518> The most difficult problems in the new budget relate to external actions.</seg>
<seg id=519> It goes without saying that a rigorous management is necessary, it has our support, and we should not deceive ourselves on this point.</seg>
<seg id=520> This is an exceptional initiative, particularly at first reading, and this is a thankless initiative, because it cannot, in the current context, winning a majority of votes in favour.</seg>
<seg id=521> Having said that, the importance of funding for Kosovo is not without its problems.</seg>
<seg id=522> Budgetary policy should inspire confidence among the citizens in European politics.</seg>
<seg id=523> We must therefore support all measures aimed at strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id=524> the level of budgetary implementation;</seg>
<seg id=525> With this strategic line in the approach of the budgets of this year and the years to come, the European Parliament occupies a full place in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg id=526> Indeed, with the transfer of 175 million, we have made an estimate of 25 million more than what was expected.</seg>
<seg id=527> As regards the MEDA programme, the Council has stated that the commitments pose no problem since the eight years of late payments.</seg>
<seg id=528> I believe that Mr Duff was here this morning, when we discussed the European Council in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg id=529> My reply will be very simple.</seg>
<seg id=530> Ramiro Zapata was the last of the 25 defenders of human rights to be murdered and the Colombian press recently has denounced the 'Plan 100' of the paramilitary groups to assassinate a hundred human rights defenders.</seg>
<seg id=531> The attitude of the Council gives me a little more today than in July because, as often in crisis situations, the European Union seems to be the last to manifest itself on the international stage and to make its voice heard.</seg>
<seg id=532> The question, Mr President, and I will end here, is whether there is not a means of exerting pressure, stronger than that proposed by the President in his information and if the aid that we are going to grant will be completely different from that of the United States, in other words, directed not to the fumigation of crops, but to their replacement, and also to the social aspects rather than military.</seg>
<seg id=533> The questions that several Members and I have raised relate specifically to the situation in Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=534> As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.</seg>
<seg id=535> Subject: Tax on financial transactions The demand for a tax on speculative capital is increasingly gaining ground in recent months with the multiplication of committees ATTAC (Association for the Taxation on the Financial Transactions and for the Aid to Citizens) in France and in Europe, and the amendments tabled to the French National Assembly and the Senate.</seg>
<seg id=536> I would also like an answer to the question of its influence on the volatility of the currency markets and, in particular, to the effect of a tax of 0.1 per thousand on the speculators who are waiting for devaluations of the order of 20 to 50%.</seg>
<seg id=537> It would, moreover, in paragraph 26 the establishment of an international organisation of arbitration to write off the debts of the countries of the South.</seg>
<seg id=538> That is what has happened to the euro on the scale of a year, either for regret or wish.</seg>
<seg id=539> I wish to add to what Danielle Auroi, said earlier, in relation to the countries of the South, that some estimates, made by experts, give some interesting figures: for example, a band from 50 to 250 billion dollars, which could be recovered from a Tobin-type tax, while at the same time, the UNDP, figure to a sum of USD 40 billion per year, the amount that could be enough to give a minimum living conditions to the hundreds of millions of people who lack any in the third world.</seg>
<seg id=540> In recent months, cases have been discovered, in particular, in different parts of France.</seg>
<seg id=541> I therefore ask the question, as a representative of the French Presidency is here, whether the slaughter of these cows will be paid on the Community budget, or whether you will pay on the national budget and if you feel that it would be a good thing that it pays on the Community budget.</seg>
<seg id=542> May I ask for your indulgence and ask you to hear the answer?</seg>
<seg id=543> So the action of the two governments concerned is limited by this international law.</seg>
<seg id=544> I do not understand how the Commission can already say in February that it needs, and the Council in July.</seg>
<seg id=545> By acting in this way in the name of subsidiarity, the Union is, in fact, one of its duties, as has happened in recent weeks, both in northern Italy and Spain.</seg>
<seg id=546> As a Member of this majority, how can I endorse the disbursement of GBP 11.5 billion paid by British taxpayers - it is our current annual contribution - if we do not enjoy a broad approval of the public?</seg>
<seg id=547> A flexible attitude of the Council would make it possible to reach an agreement at second reading in order to complete the budget.</seg>
<seg id=548> If anyone needs to be convinced that this is simply proof.</seg>
<seg id=549> This strategy has already been introduced by Joan Colom i Naval, the Vice-President in charge of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id=550> The political messages in the budget of this exercise â and Commissioner Schreyer mentioned â are many: the adaptation of the agricultural policy, new structural programmes, better implementation of structural policies, the follow-up of the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit in the creation of a European Union stronger and more competitive and the fight against social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=551> The war waged by NATO has too destroyed and left too much suffering.</seg>
<seg id=552> Despite what has been agreed, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to achieve this objective within the existing budget without prejudicing the agricultural budget for a sustainable rural sector in the current Member States.</seg>
<seg id=553> And I would say to you very clearly: it must be given a chance to Kostunica, and I therefore hope that it will provide an amnesty over the coming weeks or months; but in the meantime, I hope, however, that, in political terms and in budgetary terms, the political conditions are linked to the introduction of these two new budget lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=554> The elections in Yugoslavia have shown two things: people have finally had enough of the dictator Milosevic and they have placed their trust in Professor Kostunica.</seg>
<seg id=555> I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners will also be released shortly.</seg>
<seg id=556> Otherwise, we would be in the 'inevitably', in the financial engineering redistribution and cuts, both in social expenditure and environmental in cooperation, without being sure, provided that the sums allocated to the Balkans are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id=557> In this context, it is time to solve major problems of society such as unemployment, for example.</seg>
<seg id=558> There is, of course, a very important point is the fact that we have begun category four, with his approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to solve the problem, not least because the Council does not wish to participate in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id=559> The priorities are an important element of all budget work.</seg>
<seg id=560> This is not to result in the run-up to the expiry of the Treaty, but it would be worrying if the post-ECSC legal framework allowed to maintain such practices.</seg>
<seg id=561> This brings me to a third remark on the task which is now before us.</seg>
<seg id=562> The mistrust of the political leaders of the EU continues to grow, as I have experienced.</seg>
<seg id=563> I pay tribute to them for that.</seg>
<seg id=564> The provision in the discussion of all the institutions concerned has been exemplary cooperation with which we can - I very much hope - to reach an agreement at first reading.</seg>
<seg id=565> We who are in favour of European values in a Eurosceptic country, we have now a further argument for the EU, namely a more effective protection of individuals, which is important for people within modern society.</seg>
<seg id=566> I have noted that my own country was preparing to make an amendment of the law on personal data, which, in the current state, deprives the elected representatives of any influence on the decisions of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=567> There are many other points also cause problems and deserve the judgment of the practice to be assured.</seg>
<seg id=568> The Commission would first like to remind you of the commitment that we have all taken towards the citizens to guarantee the protection of personal data processed by the institutions.</seg>
<seg id=569> With this statement, the Commission will accept that the scope of the regulation should be limited to the activities of the first pillar exclusively.</seg>
<seg id=570> In order to honour the political agreement it has concluded with the Council and the rapporteur to be approved at first reading, the Commission rejects any other amendment that would not part of the Paciotti report approved by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, with the exception of Amendment No 69, which corrects Amendment No 41.</seg>
<seg id=571> Thus, it is urgent that the staff of the interservice group are very quickly strengthened at the heart of the Secretary-General of the Commission, so that all the proposed act of general scope can be accompanied, during their examination by the college on the basis of Article 299 (2) of a fiche d'impact detailed.</seg>
<seg id=572> The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market considers that it is important to stress that we cannot compare that what is comparable.</seg>
<seg id=573> Given the importance of fisheries for the outermost regions, I can only be saddened by this.</seg>
<seg id=574> Since the creation of an inter-service group for the outermost regions under the chairmanship of Mr Delors, a long and fruitful progress has been made so far and I would like to express the heartfelt thanks of Europeans of remoteness to those who chaired this group.</seg>
<seg id=575> Indeed, if the Treaty of Rome, reference was made to the French overseas departments, we had to wait until 1989 and the specific programmes of options relating to remoteness and insularity, the famous POSEI programmes, so that the European Union has finally conceded that the permanence and combination of the structural disadvantages of outermost regions justify special treatment in relation to other regions of the Community.</seg>
<seg id=576> I have no doubt that the proposals that the Commission will, the Council will bear the name of these qualities.</seg>
<seg id=577> This question is all the more relevant that we are approaching an eastward enlargement of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=578> This right to difference is nothing more, what is more, a product of the principle of equality, which requires also to deal with in a different way which is different.</seg>
<seg id=579> It is a document that we see, my team and myself, as rich in ideas, proposals, which goes to the heart of the problems and which does ducks any issues of concern to the outermost regions of the Community.</seg>
<seg id=580> Your report, Mrs Sudre, emphasizes, rightly, on the need to act in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=581> With regard to the relaunch of the diversification of the economy, we have made progress in several key areas.</seg>
<seg id=582> It is now important that a large number of projects to be presented within the framework of the DOCUPs, but, in parallel with this action on the ground, we need to think more deeply about the needs, to access, specific to each of these outermost regions to this information society.</seg>
<seg id=583> Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg id=584> Of course I will communicate your speech to the President.</seg>
<seg id=585> I am also concerned about the risk of a general breakdown of a large number of machines and rules which would then into question the decisions of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=586> This food authority and the legislative proposals that have been presented to us, which aims to guarantee food safety, will have the support of this Parliament, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=587> The main task of this Authority will be a task of scientific consultation, because the debate on food safety must be 'pure' too.</seg>
<seg id=588> Mr President, I would like once again to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and for his openness to the opinions of the other committees.</seg>
<seg id=589> When we are confronted with a potential risk, it is important to implement the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg id=590> On the issue always controversial: to what extent we need to enable it to concentrate on nutrition, really to give advice and to be consulted by those who concern themselves mainly from risk management, we have also said that, when it comes to safety, these issues should at least be included in the mission of consultation of this Food Safety Authority.</seg>
<seg id=591> A central element of this last point is to ensure that the rich heritage of our traditions can continue.</seg>
<seg id=592> The elements which will enable this respectability to see the light of day does not require laws or legislation, but rather integrity, academic quality, independence, accountability, transparency and comprehensibility.</seg>
<seg id=593> A good scientific knowledge is certainly necessary to assess the risks associated with the food chain, from farm to fork.</seg>
<seg id=594> Mr President, the enthusiasm for the establishment of a European Food Safety Agency, as our rapporteur would prefer to call it, is obviously considerable.</seg>
<seg id=595> As long as the WHO programme is properly funded and supported, it does not seem to be necessary to create a body of more, especially not an agency whose scope is limited to the 15 Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=596> Food safety is an essential condition for the consumer; indeed, they want to eat healthily and it is up to us to do that.</seg>
<seg id=597> If we do not create any new framework directive, we can only smile about many things in the field of food safety.</seg>
<seg id=598> We therefore need to amend the Treaty on European Union so that the Commission has the possibility of applying sanctions in the field of food, just as it can do so today in the field of competition.</seg>
<seg id=599> I support all the actors involved, whether political, administrative or other, who work within the framework of the Lisbon strategy 'Nourriture for all'.</seg>
<seg id=600> I do not agree with these words, because we can discover that a man is more than a body.</seg>
<seg id=601> It must be the true brain coordination of the network of national agencies, which, in turn, must activate and coordinate a network of centres of excellence of food safety at regional level.</seg>
<seg id=602> Therefore, I am of the opinion that your Amendment No 11 and my Amendment No 17 are perfectly compatible.</seg>
<seg id=603> The reform of the food law of the European Union must be at the level of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=604> His report does not propose both changes that it focuses on a number of elements.</seg>
<seg id=605> We have clearly stated in the report, and I welcome it unreservedly.</seg>
<seg id=606> However, the creation of a European agency on food safety is very positive.</seg>
<seg id=607> It is to be hoped that, in the interests of European consumers, they will be respected.</seg>
<seg id=608> It is necessary, I believe, to define precise deadlines in which we shall notify the Commission of all cases justified concern.</seg>
<seg id=609> The EU must have the highest standards of food safety for its citizens.</seg>
<seg id=610> The Commission is now proposing the creation of a European Food Safety Authority.</seg>
<seg id=611> I am afraid that Europe will stand once again at the risk of creating a huge administrative apparatus, unable to act.</seg>
<seg id=612> Indeed, the efficiency is inversely proportional to the levels of bureaucracy and the level of expenditure incurred.</seg>
<seg id=613> Prevent any overlapping and parallel work in several institutions.</seg>
<seg id=614> However, we must avoid that, in the shadow of the debate on the White Paper, strengthens the public in the fear of a bureaucratic Europe which has an effect on the quality of products without deal effectively to fraud which threaten the health of consumers.</seg>
<seg id=615> As you know, the Commission attaches the greatest importance to its strategy in the field of food safety.</seg>
<seg id=616> The Commission intends to adopt a proposal for a regulation establishing the principles and objectives which will form the cornerstone of food legislation and will form the framework of future health protection measures on nutrition.</seg>
<seg id=617> Thank you very much, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=618> Turning to my report, I think it is positive that the Commission proposal and I must add that the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Development have done much to improve, in particular on certain points.</seg>
<seg id=619> As Mrs Bonino has clearly said, it is a step forward by the Commission's proposal for a regulation.</seg>
<seg id=620> The Commission proposal for a regulation we consider to be extremely vague.</seg>
<seg id=621> It is necessary to organise properly funding for de-mining operations and fund research into the work of detection and mines, and for the instruments which can be used simply in order to help the developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=622> During the last eight years, the European Union has spent more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget to the fight against anti-personnel mines.</seg>
<seg id=623> But we must not penalise the people whose government is committing of violence.</seg>
<seg id=624> Firstly, I have already mentioned, I think it would be a mistake, hence a good feeling, admittedly, but even counterproductive, to make the accession to the Ottawa Convention an absolute condition for the granting of Community assistance for the fight against anti-personnel landmines.</seg>
<seg id=625> I cannot accept Amendment No 19.</seg>
<seg id=626> Secondly, the international community suffers from a lack of coordination of its efforts at world level and particularly in the countries affected.</seg>
<seg id=627> Mr President, the Socialist Group shares the pride that has just been expressed by Mr Van Orden on the subject of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=628> Remember the Soviet bombes-jouets in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=629> Thank you for the quality of your report.</seg>
<seg id=630> Mr President, the Cambodians call sentinelles mines for ever.</seg>
<seg id=631> The population has justified suspicion towards uniformed forces, whatever they may be, which is explained by many years of war.</seg>
<seg id=632> Mr President, I welcome the fact that there are finally European legislation, in the form of a regulation on anti-personnel mines and that we now have a good report by Mrs Bonino on this subject.</seg>
<seg id=633> - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are today discussing an issue which is very sad.</seg>
<seg id=634> It is no coincidence that the mines are, in the first place, in crisis areas, i.e. in regions which could take initiatives of a different nature to overcome these crises.</seg>
<seg id=635> In two kilometres of a hamlet in Bosnia, in 1999, a sign indicating the presence of mines in an area, which does not prevent the presence on the scene of a small boy.</seg>
<seg id=636> It is tragic that the civilian population which is suffering from the failure of its leaders.</seg>
<seg id=637> On the eve of the Fourth Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference, which will take place on 15 and 16 November in Marseilles, I am convinced that your work with our delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries, chaired by Mr Obiols, will enable us to advance our project of dialogue and peace.</seg>
<seg id=638> All the mines are stored in storage.</seg>
<seg id=639> - (DE) Mr President, since I agree with almost everything that my colleagues have said, it seems to me necessary to repeat it, and I will therefore use my speaking time.</seg>
<seg id=640> Your vision of the open cooperation that is to fall back into the institutional structure dominated by the officials of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=641> We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are taken at the closest possible level of those concerned.</seg>
<seg id=642> Since, however, the main amendments tabled by the PPE Group have to find a large majority, I have voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg id=643> Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the resolution on the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz, for two reasons: firstly because I voted separately, by roll-call, for paragraphs 2 and 5, which has given me the opportunity to express my opposition frank in relation to these two paragraphs.</seg>
<seg id=644> In other words, around the table of the common European house, some mangeraient and others on the menu minimum.</seg>
<seg id=645> Of course, we can always do better, and democratic control must not be watered down. But in our view, the enumeration of these rights and their inclusion in the Treaties were not the absolute priority of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=646> There have been discussions on the subject of referendums and amendments that have been tabled on this matter.</seg>
<seg id=647> In the 1999 elections to the European Parliament, turnout has reached that 40%, if we exclude the countries in which the vote is compulsory, and those in which the European elections was combined with national elections.</seg>
<seg id=648> In order to achieve the objective of a European constitution - what we want - we must avoid imposing standards and rigid methodologies, which would lead to the failure of the desired objective.</seg>
<seg id=649> A genuine social constitution should bring with the best in the world of work, women, immigrants and the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=650> Without denying the laudable intention to strengthen, clarify and deepen the European Union, as well as to simplify the texts in order to bring them closer to the citizens, I did not vote for this resolution.</seg>
<seg id=651> the allocation of powers and responsibilities</seg>
<seg id=652> I consider it absolutely crucial that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights leads to a Union to the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=653> However, the report by Mr Gil-Robles has to help me, because it proposes that in some areas, sectors and areas, in certain Member States of the European Union to agree on a joint action.</seg>
<seg id=654> The desire to allow an ever-increasing number of decisions on important areas are taken by qualified majority is contrary to basic democratic standards.</seg>
<seg id=655> Today, it is trying to prevent the facilitation of closer cooperation, and it will ultimately lose part here too.</seg>
<seg id=656> The report before us seeks to make the position taken in this direction of our Parliament (resolution of 13 April 2000).</seg>
<seg id=657> - (SV) Our view of the so-called flexible integration is broadly positive.</seg>
<seg id=658> . The British Labour Members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcomes the support given to the contribution they have made to the work of the IGC on closer cooperation, without adhering fully to all the details of it.</seg>
<seg id=659> These islands must feel an integral part of the European Union which, I hope, will make a haven for tourists and for their people themselves.</seg>
<seg id=660> In the Middle Ages, these regions and peoples did not belong to Europe and, even today, they are not really regarded as European.</seg>
<seg id=661> Indeed, the special features of these regions, which are based in general insularity and remoteness from the continent of Europe, but also of their chronic dependence on a limited number of products or even a single production, require specific measures adapted to overcoming these constraints.</seg>
<seg id=662> Mr President, I apologize if I still forces the presidency and the interpreters to listen to my last explanation of vote and would like in particular to express my solidarity with the translators of our explanations of vote, as far as I am concerned the Italian Ornella Buson.</seg>
<seg id=663> It is in fact clear that the agency is intended to capture the powers of national defence, or paralysed for the purposes of the objectives of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=664> This does not mean that the Commission and Parliament to christen this agency 'European authority', which is totally contrary to the philosophy which is supposed to be the same.</seg>
<seg id=665> It is not quite what we proposed in the Bowis report, where one has the feeling that food safety is mainly seen as an excuse for the well-known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission to the detriment of national bodies and the security of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=666> Therefore, I think that, by this statement, condemn these indescribable actions on behalf of the European Parliament, which has always advocated respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all communities.</seg>
<seg id=667> Madam President, I understand the criticisms of the rapporteur. However, by voting in favour of the amendments of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we will not vote only of appropriations but also for or against a certain direction of policy.</seg>
<seg id=668> I would ask you to support the amendment of the line A-206, 'purchase property', according to the amendments which will be adopted, so that we do not exceed our own ceiling limited to 20% of all administrative expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=669> Before the vote on the amendment 929</seg>
<seg id=670> Section VI, Economic and Social Committee</seg>
<seg id=671> Report (A5-0276 / 2000) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of the stock of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES Division VIIa) (COM (2000) 0190 - C5-0219 / 2000 - 2000 / 0071 (CNS))</seg>
<seg id=672> (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=673> The export subsidies have to sell at low prices on the world market, the surpluses of food products, which creates a serious disadvantage in terms of competition for the agri-food industries of many countries, for example of developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=674> To obtain the necessary financial resources to an increase of aid for the Balkans, the Member States must carry out a redistribution of appropriations available in the budget.</seg>
<seg id=675> However, Parliament has managed to adopt a number of important priorities - including a greater effort in the fight against unemployment and poverty, on a number of important issues relating to the environment and equal opportunities, etc., and we have voted against the attack by the Right in the Life programme and the European Women's Lobby.</seg>
<seg id=676> - (SV) We maintain our views on the travel allowances for Members of the European Parliament, namely that only the actual travel costs incurred during the journeys which fall within the scope of their mission must be reimbursed.</seg>
<seg id=677> I assume â and I hope that the Commission will seek constructive solutions to this effect - that we are going to have to cover the period between 2002 and 2005 by means of a transitional arrangement.</seg>
<seg id=678> - (DE) In its obsessive desire to regulate and liberalise, but above all in order to muzzle the national parliaments, the European Commission has submitted a proposal for a regulation for a mandatory and immediate application, instead of a proposal for a directive, which has to be dealt with in the cravache to Parliament and the Council to enter into force on 31 December of this year.</seg>
<seg id=679> We therefore support the efforts made by the Commission to reform this sector and we shall oppose all new measures to encourage it.</seg>
<seg id=680> A development which has made heavily dependent on capital loans.</seg>
<seg id=681> Nicholson report (A-0276 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=682> It is important to ensure that the sums allocated to the title of aid are not used for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id=683> Our firm opinion is that the reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will mainly be achieved at the cost that will have to pay the real polluter (i.e. the major industries), to the detriment of their excessive profits.</seg>
<seg id=684> Report Moreira da Silva (A5-0271 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=685> We should spend this money in harmonising and coordinating expenditure on research policy in all fifteen Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=686> Only by the precautionary principle, we need to learn more about these substances.</seg>
<seg id=687> Voting time is over.</seg>
<seg id=688> This European format replacing the national format which is already being used everywhere at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=689> The loss of data used to the statistics on the balance of payments which would result from this amendment would be minimal.</seg>
<seg id=690> We must be aware that this is mainly the small and medium-sized enterprises that are affected by this problem.</seg>
<seg id=691> For years now, we are pleading with a harmonisation of effort in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=692> I believe that this report is of crucial importance for a genuine integration of citizens, of small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro zone and to increase the acceptance of economic and monetary union.</seg>
<seg id=693> The free movement of capital in the single currency cannot be reconciled with obstacles or disparities.</seg>
<seg id=694> However, the European Parliament and the Commission really attach great importance.</seg>
<seg id=695> I support the two-track policy that wants to follow the rapporteur too incapable to encourage banks to act.</seg>
<seg id=696> We cannot compel banks to exercise an activity unprofitable, but as politicians, what we can do is support the amendment tabled on behalf of the PPE-DE Group by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs calling for measures to be taken before the end of the year and preferably that these standards are become reality when we start to use euro notes and coins.</seg>
<seg id=697> Hence the proposal that I submitted along with Mrs Peijs: to get the banks around a table, not to impose constraints, but because we can no longer strengthen political pressure.</seg>
<seg id=698> It goes without saying that if the cross-border payment systems remain as expensive that today, the credibility of these new coins and notes will be of these new directly called into question.</seg>
<seg id=699> We are of the opinion that this accumulation of statistical data on domestic payments of the Union are a relic of the past which no longer makes sense in an integrated area, unified, and it is an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the market.</seg>
<seg id=700> To listen to the speeches of some of my colleagues in the committee, those attending this House for longer than me, I had the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, which this Parliament is submitting for the fourth time, belonged to this category.</seg>
<seg id=701> Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you in advance for supporting my report.</seg>
<seg id=702> If we are back at European level, we must strengthen the opportunities for the regions.</seg>
<seg id=703> Principale source of job creation, both in terms of quality and quantity, SMEs play a crucial role for social cohesion and land-use planning.</seg>
<seg id=704> The care she has given to the study of the proposals and the consultation she has been careful to conduct with many interested parties have been an asset to better define and finalise the implementation of this programme.</seg>
<seg id=705> Thirdly, we need to look at the European added value.</seg>
<seg id=706> It follows that small and medium-sized enterprises can only live if unemployment is low, and if public budgets are free of debt and sufficiently supplied to provide for such investments.</seg>
<seg id=707> Businesses need clarity.</seg>
<seg id=708> Above all, when a company unipersonnelle or a company with fewer than 250 employees is a project, it must be possible to receive financing not only with a guarantee to 120%, but also on the basis of a good idea.</seg>
<seg id=709> The Member States and even the regional or local authorities are already huge finance pumps, designed to channelling taxpayers' money, that is to say the amount levied on the majority of the population, including the most disadvantaged, to large companies and consequently to their owners and their shareholders.</seg>
<seg id=710> The breeding ground for small and medium-sized enterprises contains thousands of fragile tests which big business in staff and ideas.</seg>
<seg id=711> What I expect of the Commissioner, particularly among all the measures that we have proposed here is that it facilitates and speeding up access to aid and to information, so that the heads of SMEs to be able to use information effectively.</seg>
<seg id=712> All these occupy an important place in the multiannual programme.</seg>
<seg id=713> Finally, I welcome the idea of giving us an annual meeting in order to make an assessment of the implementation of the programme.</seg>
<seg id=714> The recent incidents against the Greek minority in Himara make it more imperative the need to promote measures for democratisation, strengthening the institutions and respect for human rights in Albania.</seg>
<seg id=715> A large number of Albanians leave their countries because of the insecurity there, social problems, social and family structures prÃ©modernes.</seg>
<seg id=716> We need preventive measures tailored to Albania and helping to build and the reconstruction of the country in order to enable us to live with dignity in this region.</seg>
<seg id=717> That is how the documents are travelling to a body to another and that the European Commission, for example, refuses to publish the report on, among other things, also the Customs Assistance Mission (CAM), drawn up by the Albanians.</seg>
<seg id=718> Let us try to look the truth in the face.</seg>
<seg id=719> Mrs Karamanou, congratulations on the point of view extended embodied in the concept of your report.</seg>
<seg id=720> This is a very important subject, which is shaped by historical factors, social, political and economic.</seg>
<seg id=721> We will never know the exact number of victims.</seg>
<seg id=722> The common economic activities create peaceful links between the people.</seg>
<seg id=723> What I find rather unacceptable in this report, and I say this with frankness, it is because it confuses the effect and the cause, i.e. that the procedure for granting confuses weighted visas, and therefore the possibility of migration, with the question of illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id=724> The large institutional changes that are the consequence of the Treaty of Amsterdam has had an impact on the management of asylum and immigration.</seg>
<seg id=725> Thirdly and finally, the action plan and its method of implementation must be considered at regional level.</seg>
<seg id=726> Of course, this requirement we call upon us to show restraint in the area of European regulations.</seg>
<seg id=727> It is now or never to give special emphasis on the strength of Community action.</seg>
<seg id=728> I would also call for proposals to be introduced in the event of a modification of the codified current European legislation in order to incorporate the amendments in the existing directives or regulations.</seg>
<seg id=729> The principle of subsidiarity, if it is understood correctly, we committed in two directions: decisions are taken at the lowest possible level, but recognise that the lowest level possible can be a very high level, when the general interests are at stake and threatened if they are not protected everywhere in a uniform manner.</seg>
<seg id=730> This report is a model of conciseness and clarity and I hope that my colleagues will take this into account seriously.</seg>
<seg id=731> The report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not aroused the enthusiasm of its members.</seg>
<seg id=732> That is what I referred to in the report on the SLIM project, because Community legislation, and Mr Medina has just prove with the reading of one of the articles of the Treaty, is difficult to understand, even by experts.</seg>
<seg id=733> Therefore, certain aspects of my report, because I enthuse would have preferred a more 'communitarising' with regard to the internal market, and, above all, because the report does not go in this direction on this point.</seg>
<seg id=734> What is important for the institutions of the Union, is that we undertake to improve the quality of legislation, in particular, taking account of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=735> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=736> The persistence of this situation could exert a negative influence on the citizens with regard to the euro.</seg>
<seg id=737> Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Internal Affairs has prepared very carefully the Karamanou report.</seg>
<seg id=738> Having said that, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to take our oral question and this debate to address the two sides - since our motion for a resolution is addressed to both parties, and I would like to make a few observations calmly.</seg>
<seg id=739> The peoples of the Union that we represent here have been demanding.</seg>
<seg id=740> The water has passed under the bridge, the agreement has come to an end and has not been extended.</seg>
<seg id=741> I can understand why the Commissioner but not those of the Director-General.</seg>
<seg id=742> We could say that, eleven least after the withdrawal, we continue to pay for the previous agreement and prior to the past.</seg>
<seg id=743> Mr President, we had a similar debate a year ago and the fact that it took a year for negotiations shows how difficult it is to find fish resources for the extensive fleets of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=744> At the second agreement, things were very clear.</seg>
<seg id=745> But we must also realise that nothing is eternal, not even the fish stocks!</seg>
<seg id=746> That is why I would particularly like to make it clear that if the PPE-DE Group is distinguished from the other, it is not only for having supported, defended and encouraged the fisheries agreements, but also for pushing their extension significantly.</seg>
<seg id=747> Thirdly, since the fisheries agreement is suspended, the exploitation of the place of fishing in the Sahara by non-Community Community fleets and which are not subject neither to the control of the Commission or the Member States continues, especially of a large fleet in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id=748> I well understand, because fishing is a source of income and jobs important for this poor area - in relation to European standards.</seg>
<seg id=749> The other point I would like to stress is that the temporary aid paid to fishermen and shipowners in compensation for this year without work end at the end of the month. It is an untenable situation for them, they all prefer to work instead of receiving aid.</seg>
<seg id=750> A year ago, as a Member from the Partido Andalucista, I am negotiating and I propose initiatives in the corridors, in the offices of the Committee on Fisheries and during the hearings with the Commissioner to take account of the special all uniqueness of the Andalusian fishing fleet which fishes in Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=751> Spain has developed a remarkably positive the difficult neighbourhood which has always existed between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=752> As a Spanish Member and Andalucista, I support the right of thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families to maintain and defend, and that this Parliament also defend their jobs, which are being put at risk for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id=753> We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=754> A history of almost twelve years, made up of good words spoken by the authorities, delaying tactics, hopes, also of personal needs, of placebos for the people concerned, of the persistent defence of old rights to the citizens, who wanted none other than their own common law.</seg>
<seg id=755> As you know, the matter is very complex and concerns approximately seven hundred people working in more than 25 Italian universities.</seg>
<seg id=756> If the Italian legal system is reformed and amended, as has been the case for the university staff, we do not believe that the Commission can intervene, therefore, that every European citizen enjoys equal access to all categories of occupations.</seg>
<seg id=757> The injustice lies in the fact that two people doing the same job and working side-by-side receive a different salary and are subject to different conditions.</seg>
<seg id=758> In my view, there is, however, nothing worse than having to warn people that a ruling for them could only be a series of words pleasing and have no practical effect on their existence.</seg>
<seg id=759> I would remind you, I would remind the Commission that I hope a reaction to the fact that, in the case of AlluÃ©, the ruling by the Court states that it is contrary to Article 48 (2) of the EC Treaty that the legislation of a Member State to limit the duration of the contracts of employment of foreign language assistants to one year with the possibility of renewal, if there is, in principle, no limit of this kind to the other teachers.</seg>
<seg id=760> I believe, however, that these matters go to the heart of the fundamental principles of freedom associated with European law, particularly the freedom of movement, and no exception cannot be tolerated in relation to these principles.</seg>
<seg id=761> As is apparent from the current debate, we still encounter many obstacles, many obstacles in the way of this internal market, and not just in this case.</seg>
<seg id=762> We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=763> (The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=764> On behalf of our Parliament, I immediately sent to the chairman, Mr Thomas Klestil, as well as the Chancellor, Mr Wolfgang SchÃŒssel, the messages of condolence and solidarity in the tragedy that such a tragedy calls for the victims, their families and the whole of the Austrian people.</seg>
<seg id=765> Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg id=766> I support Mr Ceyhun's proposal and I would be very grateful to the Council if he could inform us whether he intends submitting a new proposal on this matter.</seg>
<seg id=767> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group considers this incident of such an important issue that we believe that it would not be treated as it should be in the context of the urgent debate.</seg>
<seg id=768> I have the feeling that you join the motivation, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, if I have understood you correctly.</seg>
<seg id=769> Madam President, some time ago, we discussed in this House on the issue of sanctions against Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=770> It is urgent that we have a debate on this subject before the entry into force of the changes proposed by the British authorities; the Commission must also make it clear that this is the right in this respect.</seg>
<seg id=771> (A5-0314 / 2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the adoption of a Convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, particularly in the field of the fight against organised crime, the laundering of proceeds of crime and crime in financial matters (10213 / 2000 - C5-0394 / 2000 - 2000 / 0815 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=772> The statements must be matched by action to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.</seg>
<seg id=773> The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot remain in the hands of a specialist agency placed under the sole control of national governments.</seg>
<seg id=774> On the other hand, Article 8 of the draft convention restricted solely to essential interests grounds for refusal of mutual assistance that could invoke the requested state.</seg>
<seg id=775> First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Marinho on his work and say that the fight against economic crimes deserves not only our support, but also our vigilance.</seg>
<seg id=776> RepÃ©rer, continue to condemn the money laundering of terrorists and traffickers of arms and drugs: yes, of course!</seg>
<seg id=777> Our task is to detect, trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of organised crime.</seg>
<seg id=778> These elements are in the amendments and, judging by the debates in committee, I hope that they will be approved by Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=779> It seems to me that this set of initiatives is developing in a way which is likely to destroy the protection offered by Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</seg>
<seg id=780> But the reality is not so simple.</seg>
<seg id=781> Finally, Mr President, the PPE Group supports the compromise amendment which we reached with Mrs Roure about the activities of lawyers.</seg>
<seg id=782> The second measure, the second instrument, is harmonisation.</seg>
<seg id=783> Other speakers have already welcomed this Portuguese initiative.</seg>
<seg id=784> That was the aim of the joint meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the ECOFIN Council of 17 October.</seg>
<seg id=785> The best way to strengthen parliamentary control and judicial control over Europol, is to integrate fully the Europol Convention into the legal framework of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=786> The creation of a provisional unit of judicial cooperation is a step in the right direction, not to which the European Parliament has been seeking for a long time already.</seg>
<seg id=787> That is the purpose of guarantees, namely to move this aspect of freedoms.</seg>
<seg id=788> The European Parliament is the supranational body of Community the establishment of this report, and my intervention therefore propose to support the wisdom by supporting our rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=789> Only when the institutional model and the rules which will govern the European area of justice will be specified that the citizens and Parliament can decide on the measures that the Council is proposing.</seg>
<seg id=790> Eurojust is therefore a logical step of this work, which is to give the citizens a high level of safety within an area of justice, security and freedom, strengthening the fight against serious forms of organised crime.</seg>
<seg id=791> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on the excellent report she has presented, in the wake of the decisions taken at the Tampere Council.</seg>
<seg id=792> But as, with Eurojust, we are talking about the coordination of national prosecutors and magistrates to combat all forms of serious crime - and here I agree with the approach of the rapporteur â it widens the concept that we no longer talk only of cooperation for the crimes, we are also talking about purely transnational cooperation for the suppression of criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id=793> We will have the opportunity to engage ourselves in this provisional unit, from 1 January 2001, but the Commission is willing to support the debate on what must be the permanent unit of Eurojust.</seg>
<seg id=794> On the other side, there have been positions frank â it seems to me â who, however, have not led to objections inflexible.</seg>
<seg id=795> The problems at the level of expenditure were not too concerned; other areas were much more worrying.</seg>
<seg id=796> It is unacceptable that we have not clear objectives and that we cannot measure the results; it would in no other institution.</seg>
<seg id=797> A second point, Commissioner: as regards the hierarchy of competence of ordering, really intolerable overlapping have been established.</seg>
<seg id=798> I would like to stress that it has played a positive role in a number of problems.</seg>
<seg id=799> It is clear that this work does not establish a dual consortium in the joint financial responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=800> Therefore, we have really worked on the recovery of EUR 3.4 million, and we can say that we have achieved more than 90%.</seg>
<seg id=801> Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg id=802> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after nine months of work and a long search for compromise, i.e. the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=803> Even if he is happy today to say 'yes' to this Charter, I hope that this House will leave no doubt over the next few weeks, on the fact that it requires the Council that this Charter is legally binding and that the latter should guarantee citizens' access to the European Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id=804> This position is, as you know, the position taken by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Biarritz which have themselves approved, unanimously and without reservation, the Charter and I can therefore only urge you, on behalf of the Council, to follow this position, perhaps in a few reasons for indicating to you.</seg>
<seg id=805> But it is above all by the strength of its content and the Charter, I am sure, will date.</seg>
<seg id=806> For its part, the European Trade Union Confederation has been able to complain about what she believes to be shortcomings, such as the lack of a reference to the right to a minimum income, for example.</seg>
<seg id=807> The fact remains that personalities, and especially the members of the European Parliament, have proposed that an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights be included in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which is already a reference to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=808> Our group has approved the Charter unanimously, with the exception of the British delegation.</seg>
<seg id=809> As the Group of the European People's Party, we are unanimously in favour of the inclusion as soon as possible of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties, so that it has the force of law immediately to the citizens of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=810> They have shown that we could work on European issues in a new way and exemplary, superior to that of the Intergovernmental Conference, because it gives this work an open, democratic nature, by enabling citizens to fully exercise their right of scrutiny and to participate in it.</seg>
<seg id=811> The right to health, social security, housing or the minimum income are non-existent or only in solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=812> Fourthly, and this is particularly significant for me, the Charter is based on the principle of the indivisibility of civil and political rights, on the one hand, and social rights, on the other.</seg>
<seg id=813> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this Charter is simply the umpteenth demonstration of the capacity of the Union and our Member States to increase the number of texts empty, declarations of intent.</seg>
<seg id=814> The representative of the Commission at the Turin Convention has added to the document a legal significance.</seg>
<seg id=815> After the market, the era of the Europe of rights is perhaps finally arrived. The concept of citizenship in the European Union is a fairly new concept.</seg>
<seg id=816> The Charter is in fact drafted as a text that can be legally binding.</seg>
<seg id=817> I also note with pride that a representative of the group to which I belong to the Finnish Parliament, Mr Gunnar Jansson, has played a very important role in the drafting of the Charter.</seg>
<seg id=818> As I said yesterday evening - I repeat today - there are too many shortcomings in this area, throughout the Union, and, sometimes, overwhelmed by our desire to develop judicial and police cooperation, we are overlooking the importance of ensuring that the innocent people do not become the passive victims, of the collateral damage of the war against crime.</seg>
<seg id=819> Madam President, the draft resolution of the European Parliament on the Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the same ambiguity as the work of the House.</seg>
<seg id=820> The Italian Constitution provides, for example, the limit of good practice; the Convention provides for the limit of the rights of others, public order.</seg>
<seg id=821> Mr President, today, in the vote that will take place at 12 noon, we will put an end to a process which began in 1984, when the European Parliament approved the draft Treaty on European Union, which was the request for a declaration of rights, a process that we have pursued in 1989 with the resolution of Mr De Gucht.</seg>
<seg id=822> The Charter will have some effect. It will or not, it appears in the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=823> That is to be welcomed and not to be feared, as Mr Bonde seems to believe.</seg>
<seg id=824> It seems that all the struggles for the emancipation of disadvantaged social classes of the century which ends have been ineffective and we have learned nothing.</seg>
<seg id=825> The Charter fills a gap in the law of the EC, it reinforces the protection of individuals against the attacks which they could be the subject of the part of the European police authorities, the fight against fraud and those responsible for monitoring competition.</seg>
<seg id=826> I do not understand those who oppose the Charter on the grounds that it does not contain everything they would like to see.</seg>
<seg id=827> Mr President, I shall continue in the same vein as Mr Gahrton.</seg>
<seg id=828> I would like to make a third remark about the rights of third-country nationals.</seg>
<seg id=829> Just as the European Court of Human Rights, the Council of Europe has also considerable experience with regard to these forms of control; we can take as a basis.</seg>
<seg id=830> In view of the text of the Charter that we are going to approve - by a large majority, I hope - and today, it is clear that we will have a protection of fundamental rights more important and more up to date, that would have enabled accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=831> That is why it is necessary to take further steps forward.</seg>
<seg id=832> This is vital if we are to win the support of the European population in respect of the Charter.</seg>
<seg id=833> After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be my type of analysis for this report and, as far as my own resources, intellectuals and resources in staff who will be given me allow me, I shall make a right-by-right analysis, country by country of respect for the Charter in the fifteen countries of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=834> Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would first like to join in the words of the President, Mr Moscovici, and welcome the essential contribution that Members of the European Parliament have given to the debate in the Convention, in particular the role that Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo has played in the Praesidium of the Convention for the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=835> I am not going to just some of the main points of this debate.</seg>
<seg id=836> The Convention has chosen to put fundamental rights inspired the various instruments of the Council of Europe, of the Treaties and the constitutions of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=837> The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:</seg>
<seg id=838> As things stand, it is also up to our Parliament to tell the Turkish people that today there are three conditions for its accession.</seg>
<seg id=839> In addition, it would not have been possible to establish conditions only by a decision of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=840> That is why I have taken note of the suggestions made by Mr Morillon on the conditions for the accession of Turkey and they deserve the greatest interest.</seg>
<seg id=841> I am pleased to say that, in the meantime, the Turkish Government has accepted this partnership as a basis for future cooperation, which leaves us hope to achieve our goal, namely to help, by our policy, the forces of reform in Turkey give new impetus to the process of reform and the move towards accession sought to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=842> For me, the most important thing is that Helsinki was unleashed in Turkey, in the Turkish public opinion, a debate on the conditions for the accession of Turkey to the EU and that this debate supports and encourages the reform-minded forces of the country.</seg>
<seg id=843> The text before you for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id=844> What is meant to do now is to provide a necessary impetus in the context of future accession.</seg>
<seg id=845> I do not know how to proceed to the vote, but I would urge Turkey to deal with this issue seriously.</seg>
<seg id=846> The European Parliament will play its role in the promotion of relations with political parties, NGOs and the press, as well as in the development of its complex and sometimes tense relationship with the Grand National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id=847> Mr Morillon, your report is, in my view, quite realistic and responsible.</seg>
<seg id=848> On the occasion of your visit to Turkey in March, as now, you have at least mentioned specifically the problem of the Kurdish population.</seg>
<seg id=849> There are both very naÃ¯ve and great complacency to consider that Europeans will bring the Turks, and I quote: 'to a radical change in their habits and mentality.</seg>
<seg id=850> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us causes me grave concerns.</seg>
<seg id=851> Recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the approval of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487 / 1 / 00 C5-0570 / 2000 - 2000 / 2233 (AVC))</seg>
<seg id=852> In any event, we will, the next time we will be discussing the power technology, we realised that we need a broader control and therefore better placed to respect human dignity.</seg>
<seg id=853> Duff / Voggenhuber recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=854> By way of illustration, such as:</seg>
<seg id=855> The rights contained in the Charter are already enshrined in national constitutions and defended by the national parliaments closer to the peoples and their cultures.</seg>
<seg id=856> For example, Article 19-1, which states that: 'collective expulsions are prohibited', does not specify that this ban can be suspended in the event of war or serious breaches of public order.</seg>
<seg id=857> We will give a brief explanation of these three objections in order.</seg>
<seg id=858> The right to a government to remove arbitrarily its constitution is defining characteristic of a tyranny.</seg>
<seg id=859> But, I repeat today, we have every reason to be proud of the conditions in which we have taken this important step for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=860> A society does not knowing that rights, but no duties, becomes a selfish society.</seg>
<seg id=861> This is our priority struggle for the affirmation of fundamental rights has found expression in political choices.</seg>
<seg id=862> While the Convention method is fruitful and interesting to establish a basic text, seeking a broad compromise, as there is no justification for denying the European Parliament, who could encapsulate the representation of the European peoples, the opportunity to amend, enhance the text.</seg>
<seg id=863> This Charter must be improved, and our Parliament must propose a strategy for its updating and its enrichment.</seg>
<seg id=864> Therefore, it should not be adopted and proclaimed at the Council meeting in Nice: this summit should initiate a European debate on this Charter.</seg>
<seg id=865> Fortunately, the leading tendency of national governments to marked the stamp of common sense, i.e. that of a Charter to the purely political scope and non-binding.</seg>
<seg id=866> Founded as "forum" that the Cologne Summit, it has auto-proclamÃ©e 'Convention', a name which worryingly reminiscent 1793 and terrorist tendencies of the French Revolution, implemented by another Convention.</seg>
<seg id=867> On the other hand, the method which has been used, the exceptions which have been made and the ambiguity surrounding the very nature of this text cast a harsh light enough on the new agents which are at the heart of the process of European integration.</seg>
<seg id=868> Fortunately, the European Parliament still has a consultative role, pending the complete application of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but it is the way to do play in the wrong direction, in slowing down the right decisions.</seg>
<seg id=869> With regard to the way, the opinions.</seg>
<seg id=870> In fact, it was a century ago, here and, after it has been somewhat limited, this law is now a powerful comeback.</seg>
<seg id=871> The last thing we want is that the single market to allow criminals to be introduced by the back door.</seg>
<seg id=872> We also support the creation of a convention facilitating the fight against organised crime and money laundering, as well as the various measures proposed for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id=873> Indeed, it would create a provisional unit consisting of representatives of judges or policemen who carry out an activity of a judge in our fifteen Member States.</seg>
<seg id=874> Mr President, as a member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I am extremely busy with the question of the prospect of accession of Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=875> The attitude to Turkey on the Cyprus issue is also unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=876> We agree with the criticism of the rapporteur, who believes that there is currently an effective evaluation of the results of the EIB â s lending activity, and that there is also the failings from the point of view of the right of scrutiny of the public and democratic control of the activities of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id=877> Turkey, despite all its differences, has always belonged and fully-fledged still belong to the European reality.</seg>
<seg id=878> The accession of Turkey to the European Union has become a matter more than ever on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=879> Mr Morillon says that Turkey should endeavour not to see the European Union as a "exclusive Christian club" which would exclude it, Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=880> Turkey will respect for democracy, when it will learn to live with its past, as democratic Germany has learnt to live with it, and it, too, we have asked him to do so.</seg>
<seg id=881> As soon as the Turkish authorities will have understood that the status quo is unacceptable for Europe and for the rest of the world, significant progress can be made: the island can be reunited and a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement in accordance with international law will be made tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id=882> In fact, why all this is absent from the report of the European Commission?</seg>
<seg id=883> It is within this balanced framework that we must resolutely continuing our action to promote the rapprochement between the Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=884> If you treat the Armenian issue in connection with the accession to the EU â I would ask you to pay attention to what I said: deal with the Armenian issue in connection with the accession to the EU - the project which we have discussed today do not will commence. It is as simple as that.</seg>
<seg id=885> This is also the reason for our insistence that a balance sheet should be drawn up of the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, so that in Marseilles, precisely, we are able to adopt the necessary guidelines.</seg>
<seg id=886> However, we have managed to maintain dialogue and sometimes sensitive issues: stability, terrorism, emigration, human rights, for example.</seg>
<seg id=887> The fact remains that the Council has endeavoured, particularly since 1995, to give the Mediterranean more money, commensurate with the challenges of the partnership.</seg>
<seg id=888> It is, in fact - and I would also like to say this as someone who comes from Central Europe - a very important dossier.</seg>
<seg id=889> Mr President, as you know, there is a saying in English which said that if a high profile does not appear in a spectacle, it resembles a representation of Hamlet without first undertaker.</seg>
<seg id=890> We want to see in place the policies on the issues relating to the single market and to reach an agreement in order to introduce the cumulative origin, in parallel with the sub-regional agreements free trade for all partners choosing this path and adopting the harmonised protocol on rules of origin.</seg>
<seg id=891> We have learned with great satisfaction that the Commission intends to give new impetus to the Barcelona process.</seg>
<seg id=892> I have emphasised these aspects because this is the key to the relaunch of the process and that we must add to this the enrichment of the political agenda of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id=893> Therefore, our priority is to guarantee the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we must make every possible effort on behalf of this cooperation and that funds committed to be effectively implemented, in accordance with the - let us say - selfish generosity of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=894> That is the important and practical questions I wish to raise, and I would like to thank Mr Brok for having enabled this debate, just before the Presidency and the Commission to discuss these issues.</seg>
<seg id=895> The world moves in the direction of a globalisation now inevitable. In this context, it is necessary to organize a major bloc acting as actors in the context of global competition.</seg>
<seg id=896> It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries have requested that a quarter of the appropriations of the programme MEDA-I expired in 1999 and which was 4.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id=897> In this respect, the proposal for a new impetus on the part of the Commission is positive and we fully agree with the two priorities that Mr Patten has outlined in his speeches and repeated in this House this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id=898> This is a warning for the European Union to play a more active role in the Mediterranean region which, historically and culturally, has contributed to the wealth and the grandeur our European continent.</seg>
<seg id=899> But much worse, at a time when in this Chamber calmly our exchange of views sometimes very different, always more Palestinians are being slaughtered.</seg>
<seg id=900> Aid for reconstruction</seg>
<seg id=901> If we do not, however, find the means, in December, to implement this regulation, this means that the debate we are holding today is an empty shell.</seg>
<seg id=902> This is often too bureaucratic and often too complicated procedures, but we must not and do not want to turn a blind eye, and I hope that the Member States do not, on the role that they have played in this respect.</seg>
<seg id=903> The media in this area have often been responsible for the tragedy that she has suffered; they must be free to work in accordance with the rules in force in our democracies.</seg>
<seg id=904> But I am also pleased because I believe that Parliament has managed, through a continuous pressure, to bring about a successful outcome to a situation which was not very good at the outset.</seg>
<seg id=905> I repeat: we must really prevent unnecessarily spending money in unnecessary meetings.</seg>
<seg id=906> We must not just concentrate on Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id=907> I also regret the fact that a number of programmes have been put in the performance reserve, the reserve of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id=908> In Feira, it has recognised the quality of potential candidates for accession to the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process.</seg>
<seg id=909> I would remind you of the main priorities assigned to the CARDS programme: the strengthening of institutions in the sense of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction, regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=910> The European Union was right to respond positively to the accession of President Kostunica to power.</seg>
<seg id=911> An initial examination took place on 6 November.</seg>
<seg id=912> As the European Parliament called for in its resolution of 16 March 2000, that these initiatives is the Presidency of the European Council intend to take to play a more active role in order to ensure the full implementation of the UN Peace Plan?</seg>
<seg id=913> How can we achieve this without settlement of this conflict?</seg>
<seg id=914> I can simply say that France and Germany - I am no longer speaking as President of the Council - have raised these issues during a bilateral summit in Vittel, last week, and it was decided to set up a working group in order to remedy the problem.</seg>
<seg id=915> At the same time, the Union continues to provide substantial material aid to these two countries, through its various programmes, including TACIS.</seg>
<seg id=916> The honourable Member's question gives the Presidency the opportunity to dispel some confusion.</seg>
<seg id=917> And I would add additional clarification: namely, in these two texts, to strengthen the penal framework to combat organised criminal networks of smugglers.</seg>
<seg id=918> In the report that the Council of Ministers has adopted on 21 September Turkish as reform programme, are included in the part of the legislative changes in several projects: the civil code measures to strengthen the equality of men and women in the areas of combating violence over-exerting: better family; better condemn these acts of violence, through the creation of specialised family judges and lastly banning the possibility of a penalty reduction for crimes of honour.</seg>
<seg id=919> Therefore, the Presidency has no answer on this point.</seg>
<seg id=920> Next week, there will be a meeting of the European Conference, to my invitation, in France, in other words with the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=921> Do you think that the Austrian 'model' - the majority decisions to be taken in future bilateral - it will be an instrument to take decisions by ignoring the European institutions and to set up a new institution, or a new group, in order to get round the unanimity rule in the Council?</seg>
<seg id=922> The Council has not received this letter but the Presidency has, of course, replied to Mr Cem. The words of this answer have been communicated to all the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=923> What it does the President-in-Office see the position of Mr Cem - as Mr Moscovici has not responded to this - which claims that it is not possible to take account of the Cyprus question, if we want to promote the partnership between Turkey and the European Union?</seg>
<seg id=924> We must be aware that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than just a fisheries agreement and, as he knows, if we had reached an agreement, and all that this implies, this could conceal a deterioration in relations between the European Union and Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=925> And it is for this reason that I wish to express my scepticism about the outcome.</seg>
<seg id=926> With regard to the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that this principle should enable the strengthening of cooperation between the Member States, but also on the protection of the rights of the people.</seg>
<seg id=927> The supplementary questions should be raised by other Members.</seg>
<seg id=928> Furthermore, the Commission, in the communication that it has adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union's oil supply, indicated that it intends to submit to the European Council in Gothenburg, a plan for energy savings and diversification of energy sources, which should help to strengthen energy efficiency, particularly in buildings and transport.</seg>
<seg id=929> In this spirit, we have launched, during the vote on the resolution on the embargo, within the framework of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on 9 November, an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with the international bodies which defend human rights.</seg>
<seg id=930> It is therefore up to NATO to take the measures it deems necessary to ensure that such incidents cannot happen again.</seg>
<seg id=931> (The sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=932> When we speak of money, those who give this money have the privilege to clearly define the political objectives, and that is what the Commissioner has always done.</seg>
<seg id=933> This presence, in principle, can open a new perspective for the whole of the policy we are pursuing.</seg>
<seg id=934> If we consider the region as a region of political power, we will be on the wrong track.</seg>
<seg id=935> The European Parliament must be consulted and informed on a regular basis; this is the second request of the rapporteurs, request that we should all support.</seg>
<seg id=936> The Heads of Government have also confirmed the determination of the Union to support this process by means of a technical and economic assistance.</seg>
<seg id=937> It is Parliament that has supported the Commission's proposal to create the European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=938> As the House knows, we do not think it is necessary to include an explicit reference to this subject in the Rules of Procedure.</seg>
<seg id=939> The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=940> The leaders have agreed to extend and update the Euro-Asian 2000 framework for cooperation, which is the work programme for the next ten years.</seg>
<seg id=941> I believe that this reminds us, in Europe, the important role that we play in Asia, and not only in the field of the economy and trade, although it has to be said that one of the reasons for the recovery of Asia is the fact that we have kept our promise to keep our markets open to Asian exports over the last two years.</seg>
<seg id=942> I think it was a very good political statement, but we still have a few problems to resolve.</seg>
<seg id=943> We know that the Commission considers the ASEM seriously, and we support sincerely in this attitude.</seg>
<seg id=944> It is necessary to improve the existing mechanisms at the level of the transposition of Community law in order to increase legal certainty and to overcome the current delays.</seg>
<seg id=945> It should, therefore, encourage the creation of new regional organisations, starting where there is already a Community presence, as is the case in the Western Pacific and the Southern Pacific.</seg>
<seg id=946> This will be vital for the sustainability of fisheries.</seg>
<seg id=947> I believe that the future of fishing in international waters depends on these organisations and all the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, may be summed up as little. To defend the position of the United Nations, both in the Convention of 1982 that in New York, which has been mentioned here, our presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing must be very active.</seg>
<seg id=948> That is why I believe that the Commission can play a leading role in going on the ground and encouraging fishermen to cooperate with it and to propose a solution that we can all accept.</seg>
<seg id=949> Furthermore, the Commission must take a series of tasks in the field of negotiations which should be conducted in the context of the RFOs.</seg>
<seg id=950> Mr President, I find the same problem that Mr Nicholson, but in a form still more acute.</seg>
<seg id=951> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the solutions advocated by the Committee on Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=952> Sometimes we come to ask ourselves whether the cyclical crisis in the market is not, to a certain extent, the result of the so-called speculative action of corporate structures, thus ensuring the control of the sector according to their interests.</seg>
<seg id=953> The EU's supplementary aid proposed by Mr Garot in his report is, in my view, contrary to the right direction in these years of Agenda 2000, enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe and reform of agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=954> I think it is quite remarkable that the rapporteur has shown here what can be done with a bit of administration when we carry a project, which is clearly defined in the report.</seg>
<seg id=955> On the one hand, the biggest producers or those who are integrated with the general approval is excluded from this measure, preferring their existing systems: individual savings bank lending, equalisation fund.</seg>
<seg id=956> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying that, in the end, and taking account of Austrian agriculture, I welcome the Commission's proposal to set up a fund regulation.</seg>
<seg id=957> I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.</seg>
<seg id=958> I understood that we want a common organisation of the markets in the sector of intensive farming and a dismantling of agricultural policy insofar as it is part of the territory, where production is part of the territory.</seg>
<seg id=959> There is already a COM in beef and pork, and we must not make the mistake of calling into question while, fundamentally, it works well.</seg>
<seg id=960> According to the Commission, it is right not to submit to a discipline that farmers participating in the regulatory fund, because they receive in return some guarantee of income, while those who are not part of the funds do not receive this guarantee.</seg>
<seg id=961> (The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=962> The resources from the value-added tax represent 36% and the traditional own resources 15%.</seg>
<seg id=963> Another element of the reform is also closely linked to a priority identified by the Court. It is more important to give the assessment of results and performance in the context of a distribution of resources reflecting predetermined priorities and clearly defined targets and measurable.</seg>
<seg id=964> That is a good thing, and I would like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, and the members of the Court of Auditors and the services of the Court of Auditors, to support the reform of the Commission with this report.</seg>
<seg id=965> In this connection, it is also appropriate to inform you that, for the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we have proposed to amend the Treaty so that we can create a European Public Prosecutor to combat fraud affecting the financial interests of the Community, I very much hope that this proposal will not simply be recorded at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice or crept under the carpet, but that we will debate seriously.</seg>
<seg id=966> The reality described in the annual report is rather disappointing.</seg>
<seg id=967> The number of errors is too high for such a guarantee.</seg>
<seg id=968> The amount used for equipment is EUR 240 million too low.</seg>
<seg id=969> I would also have liked to see the report of the Court of Auditors was a little more user-friendly and that he had tabled a number of clear recommendations, for example, one or two recommendations by chapter.</seg>
<seg id=970> A convention on the protection of the financial interests of the EU was adopted in 1995.</seg>
<seg id=971> The Commission and the Member States should look in this direction and exploit its conclusions in order to strengthen the effectiveness of their methods of management of EU finances.</seg>
<seg id=972> I know that this report and the work that Parliament is about to begin in the context of the discharge procedure will contribute to greater vigilance in respect of Community expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=973> At the moment, I would like to silence, Madam President, and expect that a member of the Council to come here.</seg>
<seg id=974> As in the previous years, the Court has not arrived to identify exactly the shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id=975> Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union approach and the report of the Court of Auditors clearly shows that there is still a lot of work to be done, even in the accession countries.</seg>
<seg id=976> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have recently concluded an agreement with the Court of Auditors, which was to be able to obtain in advance information on the report of the Court and to remain silent about this.</seg>
<seg id=977> I would also like to 'harass' the Council and ask him why the situation does not move forward on Article 24 of the Financial Regulation.</seg>
<seg id=978> Perhaps a European common sense will solve the problem and give George Bush the place he deserves in history â the dustbin!</seg>
<seg id=979> We are not looking for scapegoats, nor in our institutions and in our Member States.</seg>
<seg id=980> First of all, with regard to the procedure for the presentation of the annual report to Parliament and to the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am pleased to hear that the Members think that the situation is this year is more satisfactory than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id=981> In any event, we shall have the opportunity to examine.</seg>
<seg id=982> When the audit so, we mention everything that should be done.</seg>
<seg id=983> Ladies and gentlemen, as you have noticed, the last part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors has been the victim of an unfortunate virus, which was a proxy between his speech and this House.</seg>
<seg id=984> Some amendments, such as Amendments Nos 1 and 18, relate to issues of concern to fundamentally the United Kingdom and it must be said that all the groups in the United Kingdom, that they are socialist, popular or green, have defended with great vehemence and they have been approved by the Committee on the Environment.</seg>
<seg id=985> Mr President, in March of this year, we voted in favour of the directive on the funicular railways for passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id=986> We believe that, in this case, the manufacturer's obligations arising from the law on the safety of products must not overstretch trade.</seg>
<seg id=987> We have heard the justification for them and for the resumption of industrial arguments raised in committee.</seg>
<seg id=988> Given that the seller is in a position to inform each time the purchaser of the nature of the goods and reservations about the information that should be enough.</seg>
<seg id=989> Finally, I have one final brief thing to ask the European Commission on Article 4 relating to European standards and to the question of whether these standards should be published.</seg>
<seg id=990> I am satisfied with the exceptions that are made for charity shops and non-profit organisations as well as for second-hand goods sold in markets and in the context of sales of private individuals.</seg>
<seg id=991> The reliability of the safety of products and after-sales assistance represent an added value for the European label at a particularly difficult time and crucial.</seg>
<seg id=992> If we call on the Commission to submit a proposal in the near future on the safety of services, we do not see why we should and would like to regulate here and now the aspects relating to services, rather than wait for the Commission proposal, because we can already foresee that difficulties arise delimitation of different regulations, and that legal insecurity will increase with time.</seg>
<seg id=993> A few words on the main aspects of this proposal.</seg>
<seg id=994> We are now being offered to open the system to third countries, in particular the candidate countries: simplification of procedures for the emergency measures at Community level in order to be able to provide a rapid response on the advice of a regulatory committee.</seg>
<seg id=995> This new demand does not entail any additional important responsibility in the case of this kind of shops.</seg>
<seg id=996> Replacing the word "producer" with the word "supplier ', as proposed in Amendment No 11, provide more confusion than clarity, given that the directive does not provide any definition of the word' supplier '.</seg>
<seg id=997> Although the Commission is in favour of a rapid establishment of the network, the procedures must be discussed between Member States.</seg>
<seg id=998> Such designations can always be used as evidence but cannot be regarded as intrinsically reliable.</seg>
<seg id=999> Having explained why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28, 30, 32, 33, 36, 34 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31, 35 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, since these amendments constitute an improvement and clarification of the Commission's proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1000> Of course, for Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, an Italian Socialists cannot be part of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.</seg>
<seg id=1001> In my opinion, there is no contradiction between Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37.</seg>
<seg id=1002> With regard to the agenda, I leave it to the President to decide, and I would remind you that I am against, in any case, on each of the three amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1003> The Mediterranean countries outside the European Union are facing, it is true, particularly acute problems of economic development. There is a constant tension due to the inequalities between the regions.</seg>
<seg id=1004> With regard to respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, in the spirit of a harmonised European policy on immigration, in addition to the legal instruments designed to guarantee them a fair treatment, we need to create the instruments of financial aid for all those young people who have completed a higher or university degree, in the European countries would like to return to their country of origin to begin a professional activity.</seg>
<seg id=1005> I would like to highlight a factor which I consider frankly crucial to deal with this problem. I refer to the inequality in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=1006> Although belatedly, the Commission has presented a programme on Community strategy in the field of equality between men and women (2001-2005), which differs much of the previous programmes, particularly in the fourth action programme, which ends at the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id=1007> Despite these reservations, I voted for this report, firstly because it has been taken on board several amendments of my group and, secondly, because this report calls for the implementation of studies on the situation of women on the national labour markets and the insufficient access to social security systems, there are two issues where we need the relevant statistics, broken down by gender.</seg>
<seg id=1008> My party has profound reservations about the regulation of the sale of consumer goods by means of Community legislation, as it expresses reservations about the concept of mutual recognition of standards.</seg>
<seg id=1009> The misunderstanding is now cleared, and the Labour amendments can offer a guarantee not to touch of charity shops and to see them excluded from the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1010> Finally, Amendment No 15 gives the Commission a free hand to the language regime of the agency, what we consider to be very worrying.</seg>
<seg id=1011> The simplification of the decision-making procedure, the creation of decentralised operational centres (and not only in Pristina, which is equivalent to the separate Yugoslavia) and the management of the dual structure between the Management Board and the Commission can be of positive action to combat the major bureaucratic shortcomings of the European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=1012> We are therefore voting against the Commission proposal and against Parliament's report.</seg>
<seg id=1013> A adaptation of existing Community regulations in this area can therefore be regarded as justified.</seg>
<seg id=1014> Furthermore, the funds provided by the Member States make it possible to grant state aid more or less concealed.</seg>
<seg id=1015> In spite of its serious shortcomings, the Morillon report is clearly further than the Commission proposal on the partnership between the European Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1016> We have voted against it.</seg>
<seg id=1017> Like the rapporteur, we must admit that Turkey has made progress on certain plans and that there are positive signals.</seg>
<seg id=1018> Since 1987, Parliament itself was committed to the path of recognition, and the adoption of this amendment shows the coherence of Parliament in this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1019> The Union must make further proposals and develop the accession of Turkey as an essential geopolitical strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1020> Such ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1021> For several years, as a member of the delegation for relations with Canada, I have seen the operation of these regional organisations, the Fisheries Organisation (NAFO the North-West Atlantic), which involves the countries of the region, including Canada, and all those who use in this place of traditional fishing areas, including France, Spain and other European countries.</seg>
<seg id=1022> It will only be satisfied when its own fleet gunboats, flying a European flag, to enforce its fishing policy.</seg>
<seg id=1023> The important thing is therefore not to satisfy the desire for hegemony of the Commission in weakening the position of Europe, which would be completely contrary to the correct implementation of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=1024> Finally, after difficult negotiations, we have reached a final result that it is worth defending.</seg>
<seg id=1025> Thus, this proposal, which aims to replace three directives on waste incineration, is designed to improve the quality of the air, water, soil, the health of the people, by reducing the emissions of pollutants linked to the activities of incineration and co-incineration, including dioxins and furanes and of heavy metals.</seg>
<seg id=1026> But I think that it should also be pointed out - and this is something new - that it is not only the emission of these substances in the air; it also concerns the emission in water and soil.</seg>
<seg id=1027> The proposal has been improved during the various tests.</seg>
<seg id=1028> The introduction of more stringent limits of nitrogen oxides in new installations such as co-incineration in cement kilns is both a step and an incentive for reducing emissions, even if the proposed standards do not reflect the best available techniques.</seg>
<seg id=1029> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, forgive me - in particular Mr Blokland - for a few minutes late.</seg>
<seg id=1030> In conclusion, this directive is a major contribution to reducing the negative effects on the environment and the risks they pose to human health.</seg>
<seg id=1031> The European Parliament will honour, on behalf of the refusal of discrimination and the fight against exclusion, and in respect of the responsibilities of all, to give strong impetus to the establishment of a mechanism which will be specifically the fundamental principle of solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=1032> We note, however, major differences from one country to another; we lack detailed statistics and comparable data, which would allow us to draw up a reliable state of the situation, to determine in which countries the systems are more efficient, and how, what are its weaknesses, etc. That is precisely the reason why my opinion, which has been drawn up at the request of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, stresses that it is necessary, before to establish some rules to general value, supplementary sickness insurance, that the Commission should publish a Green Paper scattered, which comprises all these data have been dealt with, as well as the relevant information.</seg>
<seg id=1033> Until now, they were the subject of a certain taboos.</seg>
<seg id=1034> The risk of citizens in less good health and that elderly people do not have full access to private insurance because of the high risk that they represent is unacceptable for the development of our society.</seg>
<seg id=1035> The other point of view, illustrated by the initial aim of the rapporteur and shared by many colleagues, is to promote the regulations and codes of conduct necessary to establish, between insurers, the forms of cost option guaranteeing all the supply of good quality of care and to counter the risks of discriminatory practices and a selection of risks and customers.</seg>
<seg id=1036> It does not seem to me entirely normal that this is the money which determines the round of transition in a queue.</seg>
<seg id=1037> The new proposal from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is to draw up a list in the form of a Green Paper and then to decide whether we need a directive or a recommendation, we believe that it is right and proper.</seg>
<seg id=1038> A discussion is currently underway in the Netherlands concerning structural changes in the system.</seg>
<seg id=1039> On this basis, it is up to the Commission to take an initiative and to articulate the key points concrete as guidelines for the health systems of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1040> It is therefore unacceptable to envisage a 'one size fits all' solution to the problem of health insurance.</seg>
<seg id=1041> That is why I believe that we need to focus on the content of the report by Mr Rocard, whom we congratulate - which calls on the Commission, the provision of a service, the drafting of a Green Paper which will enable us to know what the current state of insurance in the Member States and also look to the future.</seg>
<seg id=1042> The two systems are based on a model comprising three legs, the company and the private sector.</seg>
<seg id=1043> The European Union has already drawn up some regulation in the field of supplementary pensions.</seg>
<seg id=1044> Mr President, I would like to thank and congratulate Mr Rocard for his report and congratulate Mr Marinho on his committee 's opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1045> This study will form the basis of a communication from the Commission to the Council and Parliament containing initiatives or measures.</seg>
<seg id=1046> With regard to the amendments of the Committee on Budgets, I am pleased to say that they have all been accepted.</seg>
<seg id=1047> We have lent our support to the characteristics of the programme, as the multi-faceted approach of the phenomenon, the measures in the field of health, education, housing, cohesion and complementarity with other policies, as well as the participation of non-governmental organisations, but also of the very people who are suffering social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1048> This means that we must take advantage of the bottom-up phases of the round to return to a situation of balance or surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1049> I would remind you that the last Ecofin Council has asked the Commission that the evaluation of the stability programmes next year takes precisely this aspect of the long term of public finances relating to the ageing of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1050> The positive characteristics of the programme of the Netherlands is the special attention paid - as I said earlier - to the impact of the ageing of the population on the public purse in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id=1051> Therefore, in the case of Germany, the budgetary consequence for the year 2000 will lead to a surplus of 1.5% of gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg id=1052> If we add to this the evolution of the exchange rate of the euro in relation to the dollar, we have a strong negative impact in terms of inflation.</seg>
<seg id=1053> On the other hand, they aim to make compatible the public system of distribution systems with private capitalisation and, of course, they are also compatible with support for the creation of specific investment funds which could provide tax benefits in the long term and help to tackle the problem of ageing.</seg>
<seg id=1054> This is the third principle which guides us: the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg id=1055> It should be pointed out that a number of regulatory proposals are currently under discussion, which will help to strengthen the effectiveness and relevance of the Community mechanism and, therefore, I hope, consumer confidence.</seg>
<seg id=1056> However, this relatively low incidence does not justify any complacency.</seg>
<seg id=1057> Frankly, I was disappointed that Prime Minister Jospin makes no mention of the positive role played by the Community, particularly in the last few years in his speech yesterday.</seg>
<seg id=1058> We must clearly define the reasons for the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1059> The Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission is already giving the highest priority to the controls of the Member States in connection with the protection measures against BSE.</seg>
<seg id=1060> With regard to the safety of animal meal, let me remind you that there is already a wide range of controls to ensure that animal meal do not pose a risk of transmission of BSE.</seg>
<seg id=1061> Yes, difficult to believe that it may be, it took four years to get a measure that I regard as fundamental to the protection of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1062> Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I urge the Council to finally its position on the TSE regulation.</seg>
<seg id=1063> In the current situation, the only way to stop the cycle of transmission of BSE is a total ban on the use of animal meal.</seg>
<seg id=1064> In this connection, I should like to point out that the Liberal Group I belong tabled an amendment which I hope will be adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1065> The policies must be changed so that the real culprits of this crisis are penalised and that specific decisions are a first step towards the end of this tragic crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1066> We therefore need to be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id=1067> The labelling of beef which has been decided, which is a minimum labelling and which has only been in force for two and a half months ago, does not properly to trace the origin of animals and we have banned rather belatedly specified risk material.</seg>
<seg id=1068> It must be that the public is fully informed on the characteristics of the test which I am talking about.</seg>
<seg id=1069> At the time, Mr President of the Council, you have done nothing or almost, as your counterparts have done nothing about the fallout from Chernobyl, nothing about the AIDS epidemic, nothing about the contaminated blood, always with the same reason: not to panic public opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1070> The French beef ban will lead to a massive increase in demand, but the supply is not unlimited and prices will be extraordinarily heavy pressure.</seg>
<seg id=1071> Consumers have lost confidence, and to combat this phenomenon, we need to make the BSE tests on cattle and sheep.</seg>
<seg id=1072> It seems to me to be more important to move in the direction of the Commission proposal, namely to ensure that animal meal meet the highest safety standards.</seg>
<seg id=1073> For the rest, I entirely agree - for once - with what my fellow Members, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs GrossetÃªte, have said.</seg>
<seg id=1074> Come on, members of the Council and the Commission, you have a large financial basis for a strong policy.</seg>
<seg id=1075> We have to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id=1076> Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased to hear here in this Chamber, that it is vital to change the CAP.</seg>
<seg id=1077> We have condemned here with Jimmy Goldsmith.</seg>
<seg id=1078> The food must be safe.</seg>
<seg id=1079> I think it is exemplary that France is resolved to take this step.</seg>
<seg id=1080> But we do not help them!</seg>
<seg id=1081> I am therefore surprised that the corpses are still used or processed under these conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1082> The Phillips inquiry into BSE has been published in the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id=1083> I would suggest to the European Commission to apply the precautionary principle to the French beef.</seg>
<seg id=1084> We need to know today, since we are still in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what are the measures to be taken.</seg>
<seg id=1085> Furthermore, I have listened carefully to all these proposals, I am not insensitive.</seg>
<seg id=1086> If the European citizens tell me that the legislation has not been properly or fully applied, then we must perhaps rÃ©envisager the issue, but not for scientific reasons to do so because the legislation has not been respected in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1087> The best way not to hear us, it is not to invite us.</seg>
<seg id=1088> The Commission considers that the first readmission agreements currently being negotiated with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco play an important role in the clarification and coordination of these policies.</seg>
<seg id=1089> What proposals will the Commission making in this area on the basis of Article 31 of the Union?</seg>
<seg id=1090> (The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=1091> During this period, the objective was to reduce the public deficit in order to obtain a more appropriate monetary policy, lower interest rates and greater growth.</seg>
<seg id=1092> I always say that the euro will not be introduced on 1 January 2002, but it is already in our pockets; we have with different fractionnaires currencies, but we already have in our pockets.</seg>
<seg id=1093> The ozone limits laid down in Directive 92 / 72 have not been exceeded in the capital, but it should be noted that no measures have been taken in the middle of the summer.</seg>
<seg id=1094> Subject: State aid in the audiovisual sector At a seminar of the French Presidency devoted to cultural industries, a representative of the Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission has estimated that the legal obligations of investment chains were imposed on state aid from the fact that these investments were made compulsory by the legislator.</seg>
<seg id=1095> It must be respected and protected.</seg>
<seg id=1096> However, this is not automatic, because this new growth is very unequal and can go hand in hand, as we have seen in the United States for a decade, persistent phenomena of insecurity, exclusion, poverty, urban ghettos.</seg>
<seg id=1097> The governments of the Member States refused to accept this definition, which is a little too simple and much too vague.</seg>
<seg id=1098> And in difficult climate as a result, more and more people are no longer, are marginalised and excluded.</seg>
<seg id=1099> Mr President, we are very often in this Chamber, such a tune, the glorification of the European social model, the social market economy that we counter it with pride - as many - the savage model of the United States of America.</seg>
<seg id=1100> (The technical)</seg>
<seg id=1101> This is an enormous sum.</seg>
<seg id=1102> Moreover, it is all political levels which must be involved.</seg>
<seg id=1103> I support the need for a better understanding of the causes of poverty, I support preventive action against exclusion as a result of mergers, relocations, industrial change, rural desertification, urban hyperconcentration, with the help of innovative and practical responses, involving the social partners, local and national administrations, as well as the joint action of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1104> We have witnessed a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and the role of social and structural reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1105> It is a problem formalistic due to the fact that, in the Treaty, it is only refers to social exclusion and poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1106> I believe that these proposals are a pragmatic response to your request.</seg>
<seg id=1107> However, an approval of the overall strategy does not necessarily mean an approval of the proposal in detail.</seg>
<seg id=1108> If we create a clear framework and binding on the Member States, the different systems to meet these requirements should have a longer period of put to the test.</seg>
<seg id=1109> Renewable energy will not become a panacea for solving this problem, but nobody doubts that they can contribute to a large extent, to the remedy, to diversify the sources of energy and to reduce our dependence on oil, which, moreover, do we not dÃ©rangerait at all.</seg>
<seg id=1110> I shall now come back to three of our demands.</seg>
<seg id=1111> To define realistic targets we can only strengthen the confidence of the citizen in energy policy to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id=1112> I believe that a strong policy in the field of renewable energies is a symbol for the Europe of tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id=1113> Finally, the European countries must prove through these agreements that they will contribute to the achievement of the Kyoto objectives.</seg>
<seg id=1114> It seems to me a shame to exclude any category of waste which can contribute to the overall production of energy from waste â whether for smaller-scale projects or within the framework of a more comprehensive calculation.</seg>
<seg id=1115> The formation of the volume of peat by photosynthÃšse and in the production of waste of wood is similar to those other biomassbased energy.</seg>
<seg id=1116> Finally, I should like to inform Mr Chichester that off my region, there is already a windmill project well advanced and that it looks promising, and I therefore call on you to come and see it himself.</seg>
<seg id=1117> The debate on the abandonment of nuclear energy, in Sweden and Germany, for example, has shown that, without a possible alternative energies which are environmentally friendly and competitive, the discussion turns short. That is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=1118> That is why the Member States must impose binding targets.</seg>
<seg id=1119> I am therefore optimistic about the future potential of renewable energy, provided that the appropriate incentives should be put in place.</seg>
<seg id=1120> I believe that we need a lot of courage to give renewable energy the place it deserves.</seg>
<seg id=1121> There is no doubt that a very sharp rise in oil prices presents more brutally with the problems linked to our energy dependency on fossil energy sources.</seg>
<seg id=1122> Consequently, we cannot accept Amendment No 28.</seg>
<seg id=1123> However, in doing so, the Commission does not forget that the terms used does not prejudge its right of initiative and that they should be compatible with the single market of electricity.</seg>
<seg id=1124> On 26 participants, the national commission of reconciliation Tajikistan has only one woman, whereas the country has 25 000 widows.</seg>
<seg id=1125> Studies have shown that the presence of women in the ranks of the peacekeeping forces of the United Nations, albeit in a limited way, improve relations with the local people and the general moral.</seg>
<seg id=1126> The report Theorin deals with this subject in detail and contains many repetitions that we are asking, as the Group of the European People â s Party and European Democrats, to delete in order to draw up an official document.</seg>
<seg id=1127> From a political point of view, I see Amendment No 19 failure or a tactical fallback rather than a compromise in terms of content, which should in any case be unworthy of women.</seg>
<seg id=1128> They have been held prisoner.</seg>
<seg id=1129> Then the example of Portugal, where the doors of diplomacy are open to women that after the 'April 1974 Revolution. "Our ambassador in Indonesia, Mrs Ana Gomes, showed recently in West Timor that the role of a woman and its awareness of the problems and the suffering of a people, who has addressed only a long fight for 25 years for freedom, can be seen by everyone and especially by the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1130> Very few Member States have done to date. I am told that there are two or three.</seg>
<seg id=1131> That is why we must also, in future, take account of this aspect during the preparation of the policies of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1132> Unfortunately, the report does not define this concept, any more than it establishes distinctions.</seg>
<seg id=1133> Please convey our protest to the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1134> They have different experiences, which are vital to the way in which politics is exercised, especially when it comes to crisis management.</seg>
<seg id=1135> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1136> I will now move on to the second point. If it intends to regulate this sector, we must obviously examine a number of points.</seg>
<seg id=1137> In recent weeks, I have discovered a marked interest on the part of both international trade union circles that a number of trade unions.</seg>
<seg id=1138> My second objection. You are therefore in favour of the payment of a salary for women in the home?</seg>
<seg id=1139> All those who are currently working on the black market to obtain an employment in decent social conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1140> Furthermore, this project has also enabled two to three families to get together to create a joint employment of domestic aid.</seg>
<seg id=1141> We were put together in plenary in this first part-session of October, when we learned at the time of our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia, the courageous reaction of the Serbian people and immediately, as you will recall, ladies and gentlemen, we have asked for the lifting of international sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=1142> In so doing, Europe has demonstrated the vitality of its civilisation in the history of the world and a creative forward-looking political capacity.</seg>
<seg id=1143> There can be no doubt that the status of Kosovo is a question of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1144> Furthermore, we would have a chance to demonstrate to Europe that we are in a position to develop the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro, in Yugoslavia, recognising the real democratic principles.</seg>
<seg id=1145> I must say that I was - in listening to you - extremely impressed by your mastery of a very difficult situation - how, at the same time as by your determination.</seg>
<seg id=1146> This will be done in the next Minutes, Mr Watson.</seg>
<seg id=1147> Access to documents and information regarding the activities of the institutions enables citizens to the institutions of the European Union prove to face up to their responsibilities and stimulates greater efficiency.</seg>
<seg id=1148> A fifth amendment, which is important, in my view, is the one concerning the annual report which should also deal with the documents to remain secret, or at least that remain secret.</seg>
<seg id=1149> It is not clear on this point, and it is not impossible that can also remain in force for more restrictive provisions. This is particularly on this point that we have tabled amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1150> The Committee on Foreign Affairs, for its part, is opposed to the idea that the documents relating to foreign and security policy issues should be automatic and comprehensive way, an exception to the rule of law, public scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id=1151> If we want the citizens can truly defend their rights, these information centres require well-trained staff who are in some way by the hand of the citizens in search of information and they serve as guidance within the complex labyrinth of the institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1152> These are essential if we want to avoid that transparency is not simply a transparency for beginners.</seg>
<seg id=1153> It is gratifying that Parliament has managed to gather a large majority in favour of greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id=1154> Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1155> Mr President, openness and transparency in the European Union do not appear in a positive light.</seg>
<seg id=1156> If that is the case, this would be a bad calculation, it is the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the people who are at stake here.</seg>
<seg id=1157> The concept of documents takes many forms these days and we will ensure that access is the widest possible for the greatest possible number of documents and to the various types of documents.</seg>
<seg id=1158> Mr President, we can hear the Commission's position on public access to documents from the internal manual, which was submitted on 11 October, the Commission's officials in order to explain to them how to deal with the requests of Members as regards access to documents.</seg>
<seg id=1159> This point of the regulation must be abolished or at least be supplemented by the obligation to take account of the interests at stake.</seg>
<seg id=1160> The old models of international cooperation with all their old habits and rules of diplomatic game, where everything is happening behind closed doors are no longer valid in the type of modern cooperation that has become the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1161> We must not be confused with this objective and the role of Parliament, nor to future interinstitutional agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1162> I believe that a step forward has been taken towards the possibility for the citizens to exercise their right to information and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1163> It is not the only one, however, that I would like to thank: Mrs Maij-Weggen itself of the PPE-DE Group, and through the enhanced Hughes procedure is the second author of the report, also deserves considerable thanks.</seg>
<seg id=1164> Transparency must become the mainstay of all the activities of the European Union, but the right of access to documents is not enough in itself to make transparency a reality.</seg>
<seg id=1165> The European Parliament therefore asks that the European security and defence policy is the future integrated into the structures of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1166> In his speech to Parliament, on 3 October, President Prodi referred to the institutional triangle and pointed out that, in a European system based on checks and balances, the flexibility of the operation of each institution should contribute to the common interest.</seg>
<seg id=1167> I must admit that the great challenge of this regulation is to provide a precise definition of documents.</seg>
<seg id=1168> I would like to point out that the Commission could, when the time comes, almost all the amendments, such as Amendments Nos 9, 18 and 21 in part, and Amendments Nos 23, 25, 26.1, 28 (f), 35, 38, 42, 40.6 40.1, 41.1, 43.1, 47, 49 and 52.</seg>
<seg id=1169> I would like to vote sometimes in favour of the proposals made by the Commission, and for that reason it is essential that Members have a list of the amendments which the Commission can support and that of the amendments she does not support.</seg>
<seg id=1170> banks' own funds</seg>
<seg id=1171> Finally, and this is something which is most controversial, the committee has called vehemently to use the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1172> These amendments are various proposals in the report, which will probably be rejected in the vote and which will therefore be replaced by the new amendments resulting from this consensus.</seg>
<seg id=1173> Mr President, in the light of the excellent vote of support that this report has received, and given the response of the Commission this morning, it is very clear - recital all the parts on which we voted - on the basis of Article 69 (2), we should postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution, to enable us to start fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1174> Mr President, I am sorry to have said that the PPE-DE Group had also hoped that the vote evening postponed, but it is you, Mr Coordinateur, who came to tell me that you prefer to the matter be postponed until the second part-session in November, rather than voting on this evening.</seg>
<seg id=1175> The reason why I would suggest that we return the vote is - as Mr Goepel said - that this is a very important issue.</seg>
<seg id=1176> I do not know how much it costs the roll-call vote, but it is without doubt hundreds of thousands of francs, or Belgian francs, of our budget.</seg>
<seg id=1177> I know that in France, the principle of slaughter of the entire herd has been implemented and that this does not seem to be the best way to combat this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id=1178> to abolish the animal meal in animal feed, not only of the cattle and sheep, but also of the pigs, poultry, fish;</seg>
<seg id=1179> That is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1180> It is with regulations such as those that consumers are reassured and that farmers will hear the message of solidarity that we want to convey to them.</seg>
<seg id=1181> We must go further, as a matter of urgency, we need to change the common agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=1182> The ban on the use of animal meal in animal feed is only the first step in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1183> We very much regret, however, that the amendments tabled by our group were not adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1184> I believe that it would be logical that the working hours of those who work in enterprises pollutants to be reduced.</seg>
<seg id=1185> I shall conclude by repeating that the generalised use of hazardous waste must not lead to the production of this waste becoming acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1186> In fact, if pensions, for example, were less weak, there would be less poor.</seg>
<seg id=1187> The report takes a financial envelope of EUR 100 million over five years to reduce poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1188> I fully support the proposal to set up a Luxembourg process bis in the field of social exclusion, containing guidelines and national action plans.</seg>
<seg id=1189> Indeed, the report calls for the establishment of qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1190> In submitting its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission is responding to the appeal made by the Council to present 'by June 2000' a 'initiative on cooperation in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1191> Mr President, I abstained for a very specific reason: in my opinion, this report did not, from the environmental point of view, the progress that I hoped and wanted.</seg>
<seg id=1192> I hope that such a system is extended to all European cities.</seg>
<seg id=1193> Some of the proposals of the European Parliament are unrealistic and cannot receive my support.</seg>
<seg id=1194> We must also arrive in the future to see what the best practice.</seg>
<seg id=1195> The high-wage concerned of the environment are being given the opportunity, in a liberalised market, to contribute voluntarily to cleaner energy, while on the other, everything still remains as before.</seg>
<seg id=1196> The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1197> These three reasons are: firstly, because it moves in the direction of the process of consolidating democracy and the strengthening of the requirement of respect for human rights, particularly with regard to indigenous populations.</seg>
<seg id=1198> Mr President, in this debate, we wish to express, as was rightly said the other Members who have spoken before me, solidarity and the support of this House in the parliament of Central America, at a time when we are fighting for keeping the priority in the framework of the European Union's external relations with the countries of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=1199> I am not the reservations that have expressed our colleague and dear friend, the chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of Central America and Mexico, Mr Seguro, with regard to the issue of human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1200> Finally, in its dialogue with the authorities of Central America, the Commission once again stress the importance must be attached to the process of regional integration, as an instrument of consolidation of democracy and development of the region.</seg>
<seg id=1201> For obstinately to power, he did not hesitate to take the continuing debate on â ivoirity â, causing an outbreak of xenophobia, hatred of the other, from abroad, BurkinabÃ© or Malien, and yet there are many to live and work on the soil of CÃŽte d'Ivoire for many years.</seg>
<seg id=1202> The establishment of a genuine democracy in CÃŽte d'Ivoire can now be done without the establishment of an independent committee of inquiry into the crimes committed and without the official commitment to uphold human rights and civil peace.</seg>
<seg id=1203> Some people think that the importance of democracy is on when it comes to Africa, that these are complex procedures, that we must leave the time of the time, and I believe that there is no possible compromise with democracy and the question which arises today to CÃŽte d'Ivoire is the same as that which arises, for example, to Guinea, where today we know that there are people who are imprisoned and that there is no democratic system.</seg>
<seg id=1204> I shall conclude with the following: dictatorships cannot be put in place, Mr President, because there are people who suffer from poverty, who do not have access to information, which do not have access to information.</seg>
<seg id=1205> It would not be logical that the European Union today will require new presidential elections in which all the candidates could once again participate.</seg>
<seg id=1206> In many parts of Africa, we are faced with very different ethnic and religious brassages.</seg>
<seg id=1207> These elections must enable the national political parties have been excluded during the presidential election and offset, and at least partly, the imperfections of this first election.</seg>
<seg id=1208> on the situation in Burma.</seg>
<seg id=1209> The authorities are conducting a major offensive against the Karen and Shan peoples, and as the rapporteur pointed out by the United Nations, there is no sign of dialogue between the SDPC and the NLD.</seg>
<seg id=1210> That is why we reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1211> I hope that giving urgent priority to this issue, Parliament sends a clear message to the Burmese people, meaning that its plight is not forgotten, that are aware of the fact that in Burma, it is getting worse rather than better, and that we are determined to try to change the course of events.</seg>
<seg id=1212> It has taken a long time.</seg>
<seg id=1213> In Asia, the danger that the economic and political reforms are a decoupled, that liberalisation and economic progress being achieved without liberalisation policy and without strengthening the rule of law, although I am of the opinion that, in the long term, the absence of the rule of law is detrimental to the trade, subsidies and investment.</seg>
<seg id=1214> Mr President, I can join the previous speakers on a number of key points, because many things that are happening in Vietnam today are unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1215> Nevertheless, the Human Rights Watch, as Mr Swoboda said, states that Vietnam has recently made some efforts to improve its situation from the point of view of human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1216> These documents give an extremely confidential look strange on the wings of the policy pursued by the Vietnamese authorities.</seg>
<seg id=1217> The Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation can only be achieved through a dialogue between the military regime, the opposition and the democratically elected representatives of the ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg id=1218> The Vietnamese authorities also exert definite pressure on the press of the country to which it adopts a regime of self-censorship.</seg>
<seg id=1219> The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1220> We also call on the EU to give aid and assistance, not only in the south-west of England, but also to all the other affected areas.</seg>
<seg id=1221> I would ask you all to support our resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1222> It is urgent that the Union should not be confined to exceptional interventions when disasters have arrived.</seg>
<seg id=1223> The Commission has taken two initiatives in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1224> Mr President, an error has crept from purely linguistic in one of the amendments to the joint resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1225> A postponement of the vote would mean a postponement of the mission entrusted to the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1226> (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1227> The report is based on the observation that a proportion of health insurance in Europe is covered by the supplementary sickness insurance systems.</seg>
<seg id=1228> I find it a little strange to try now to force the Commission to a motion for a resolution and ask him at the same time to draw up a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and supplementary sickness insurance.</seg>
<seg id=1229> At a time when the ageing of the population is sensitive, it is essential that we seek to improve the health care system in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1230> We obviously cannot give it our backing.</seg>
<seg id=1231> Mr President, there are undeniable arguments in favour of the accelerated procedure for the implementation of the review of Basel on the capital adequacy.</seg>
<seg id=1232> With regard to the sense of urgency that Mrs Villiers has added to the feeling of necessity of the Commission by calling for an accelerated procedure for the adoption of these measures, we are obliged to note that the rapporteur himself acknowledges that this new regulation will have no influence on anti-competition practices which, unfortunately, alas, are prevalent in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1233> We must also ensure that the decisions taken in Basle, do not lead to an increase in own funds requirements, a second drawback to banks.</seg>
<seg id=1234> Having said that, I believe, and I would like to stress, that the economic operators are also satisfied with the approach given to these regulations on capital, which strengthen the issues relating to the risk.</seg>
<seg id=1235> These are a few ideas on how we can achieve a rapid, effective and verifiable legislative process within the framework of the current rules of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1236> Indeed, the time has come to recognise that the institution of 'European Ombudsman' has sufficiently experienced and it has already provided enough proof of its maturity to have its own budget.</seg>
<seg id=1237> The PPE-DE Group supports the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is to assert that the powers of the Ombudsman must be extended, and that the sooner the better, particularly in the area of the Ombudsman's powers of inquiry, set out in Article 3 of the Decision of 1994.</seg>
<seg id=1238> An Ombudsman is, of course, subject to the rules of confidentiality, but for the citizens, it is good to know that the person who fulfils this role may have access to the documents to which them, as citizens do not have access.</seg>
<seg id=1239> The tabled report was therefore devoted to the recommendation by the Ombudsman on the Commission to allow the candidates and candidates in the competitions organised by it to consult their corrected papers.</seg>
<seg id=1240> We believe that the Community institutions should conduct their recruitment procedures of staff, even in the fact that all the recruitment procedures, with maximum publicity and transparency, in order to avoid any suspicion of bias, injustice or administrative incompetence.</seg>
<seg id=1241> I am referring to an amendment concerning the requirement for the testimony of the outcome of an oral test, for example.</seg>
<seg id=1242> Mr BÃ¶sch has already explained briefly the amendments to the report.</seg>
<seg id=1243> I asked two questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal competitions, and I have received from it accurate and detailed answers.</seg>
<seg id=1244> This is the beginning of a process of openness and transparency in the way of government.</seg>
<seg id=1245> Firstly, the correction of examinations organised by the Commission are always anonymously.</seg>
<seg id=1246> It is, of course, of July 2000.</seg>
<seg id=1247> VOTE</seg>
<seg id=1248> (Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)</seg>
<seg id=1249> - (DE) In the assessment of the directive on the capital of credit institutions we must look closely at various interests, which are in conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1250> That is the way that has developed the idea of a European Police College for the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=1251> That is the position advocated by the rapporteur and supported by the European People's Party.</seg>
<seg id=1252> The social situation in most Member States of the European Union is currently in such a way as the need for cross-border cooperation between the different police services is indeed important.</seg>
<seg id=1253> The majority of the speakers who have spoken so far seem to think that it is essential that the College has a permanent seat.</seg>
<seg id=1254> The umpteenth decision, but not precarious, the gift that the Council has used to do in this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1255> The rapporteur would like to see more crime prevention, aid and innovative developments and border surveillance and also wants to change internal security in order to include respect for the law and order.</seg>
<seg id=1256> These were the ideals that they propose and this was the kind of State to which they found.</seg>
<seg id=1257> I would be in favour of a balance of standards in certain Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1258> Since the first thoughts on this issue, which took place at European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission is committed to the Member States to promote action to develop what we might regard as a European police culture, based on the highest standards in the field of ethics, respect for the rights and freedoms of the citizens, and effectiveness in the fight against crime.</seg>
<seg id=1259> It inclines towards the development of a Police College mainly with a view to intergovernmental.</seg>
<seg id=1260> For the reasons outlined above, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report.</seg>
<seg id=1261> - (SV) I have voted against the report on the provisional establishment of the European Police College.</seg>
<seg id=1262> It is clear that many of our courts are very slow and cumbersome and that it is very difficult to act quickly in the face of these problems.</seg>
<seg id=1263> Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, of the fact that it is still linked to the Brussels II Regulation which excludes children whose parents are in, and children designed outside marriage.</seg>
<seg id=1264> My mother has experienced such a divorce and abduction there is 85 years and it is always talking about.</seg>
<seg id=1265> I would therefore like to say to Parliament that, in the action programme on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions in civil matters - which we hope will be adopted before the end of this year, the Commission proposes that the first and the main priority is being given to the extension of the scope of the regulation of key and, consequently, of this regulation on the right to visit, to cover without discrimination the children of married couples and children of unmarried couples.</seg>
<seg id=1266> We shall now proceed to the vote</seg>
<seg id=1267> Nowadays, sport, it must be said, is closely linked to other economic sectors such as the audiovisual industry or the promotion and sale of products.</seg>
<seg id=1268> What we need is an intelligent and flexible way to interpret the existing rules.</seg>
<seg id=1269> In other words, a genuine attack on democracy, even if we do not look at things from this point of view.</seg>
<seg id=1270> The Commission expects to receive shortly a response to its request for detailed information regarding the measures provided for by the British Government.</seg>
<seg id=1271> The proposal has been initiated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a statement made before the debate on the budget, six months before the declaration of full budget of spring 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1272> Again, I thought that what was said by Mr Simpson has really served to reassure us as far as the likely intentions of the British Government.</seg>
<seg id=1273> Traffic jams we are losing not only a lot of time, but they are a problem for the whole of the environment, and I therefore believe that if the British Government committed the necessary funds to solving these problems, it is to the benefit of everyone, and in particular of all European citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1274> We are more or less the only oil producers of the European Union and yet we are facing the price of petrol and diesel the highest in all the countries of Europe - GBP 1,20 per litre of diesel in the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id=1275> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1276> The European Parliament must make it clear that it is on their side, and I ask you, once again, to observe the minute's silence expressing our solidarity and our emotions.</seg>
<seg id=1277> Madam President, it is for the totally support, since I am one of those who have requested the inclusion of this point.</seg>
<seg id=1278> We have made good progress.</seg>
<seg id=1279> The Union will deepen its relations with all the major groups and, as soon as possible, also intends to contact the new American administration.</seg>
<seg id=1280> Given the record surprisingly brilliant by Mr Prescott on the way in which he himself had negotiated, how is it that not only Mrs Voynet but also, I believe, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, most of the other European Ministers of the Environment have rejected this?</seg>
<seg id=1281> What we can fear is that the momentum will be lost, that the US negotiators do not change and that everything is to start in May.</seg>
<seg id=1282> This time, it is the forests which have proved to be the main stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id=1283> If this global warming continues, part of the territory of the countries of the European Union are turned into sea or desert.</seg>
<seg id=1284> The standard of living is high and the low prices of oil products.</seg>
<seg id=1285> I congratulate Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m for the efforts she has made to The Hague and wish him to have more luck.</seg>
<seg id=1286> Without doubt, just better to have no agreement than having an agreement that is wrong and, in this case, the US proposal was a watered-down proposal, which is totally unacceptable for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1287> Climate change has major consequences in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=1288> I repeat this idea in the English text: Forest turns from being carbon sinks to carbon sources.</seg>
<seg id=1289> Only this credibility will enable the European Union to guide the speech and action of the COP 6 "B" in Bonn.</seg>
<seg id=1290> We must make our own assessment of what has happened and to prepare the documents in order to establish contacts with various parties and, of course, with the 'umbrella group'.</seg>
<seg id=1291> Of course, the result of the forthcoming COP 6 or the continuation of the COP 6 will be the ratification of an agreement in the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1292> Before the European Council, we will again next Sunday, Pierre Moscovici and myself, a ministerial conclave, in which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, as well as a meeting of the IGC, on Monday on the occasion of the General Affairs Council.</seg>
<seg id=1293> The minimum number of participating Member States should be set at eight while the clause to appeal to the European Council, which is currently a genuine right of veto, would be replaced by a right of call-back.</seg>
<seg id=1294> This may be regrettable, but I am obliged to make this observation.</seg>
<seg id=1295> The European Council will also be discussing the state of progress of accession negotiations, and therefore of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1296> The Lisbon European Council approved guidelines aimed at promoting an innovative and competitive European economy.</seg>
<seg id=1297> The protection of the consumer is a growing concern of Europeans, for obvious reasons that I do not need to develop.</seg>
<seg id=1298> We must be ready for this enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1299> That is, in the final analysis, the yardstick by which we will judge the Nice Summit.</seg>
<seg id=1300> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1301> The first is that the candidate countries must adopt and implement the acquis communautaire. It is the task that they share with us.</seg>
<seg id=1302> We are deeply attached to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we do not simply want to preach.</seg>
<seg id=1303> Of course, the text could have been better, and we will be able to improve and clarify after Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1304> I find it simply unacceptable that several governments have purely and simply shrugged off the table the question of the inclusion of a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1305> You do not even want to incorporate into the Treaty, which proves that this text should be put to one side.</seg>
<seg id=1306> We speak with one voice disgracieuse within the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1307> Given the bleak prospects of the success of the Intergovernmental Conference, I believe that it would not be appropriate to add to the agenda this complex issue and controversial.</seg>
<seg id=1308> I urge the French Presidency to do everything in its power to bridge this gap, particularly destructive.</seg>
<seg id=1309> The Commission, in the field of trade policy, has drawn up a proposal which must be carefully examined.</seg>
<seg id=1310> Although the previous Treaty has made some progress in terms of the extension of the formula, it has also introduced this formula of the codecision procedure with unanimity for citizenship, social security, the rights of independent persons and also cultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=1311> The simple fact that this issue has been raised in itself shows clearly the absence of a policy of strengthening the ties of mutual trust between the countries of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1312> It is precisely in this situation that the Intergovernmental Conference drags on for months, because no one wants to relinquish its hands.</seg>
<seg id=1313> The experience of this year has taught us that developments to make â after Nice, looking to the future of Europe - the process of constitutionalisation of the Union must not be entrusted to the method now out of date of the confidential negotiations between representatives of the governments.</seg>
<seg id=1314> If the majority does not become the rule, the decision-making process will get bogged down inevitably, as Mr Prodi so rightly said.</seg>
<seg id=1315> If this aspect of subsidiarity is very important, we have not heard this during the debate today.</seg>
<seg id=1316> That is what we have done, the enlargement of 1995 was adopted, we have moved to the reflection group chaired wisely by Carlos Westerdorp, Amsterdam has happened, we are today on the eve of the Conference of Nice and the situation has hardly changed, Mr President: we are returning to the institutional problems, without finding a solution which will enable us to complete an ambitious task, namely enlargement to 27.</seg>
<seg id=1317> Let us not add to the disappointment that is going to cause Nice, though, of course, the Council has proved unsuccessful, the great disappointment that Parliament would cause among the peoples.</seg>
<seg id=1318> In the past, we have proved that it is possible to achieve this goal and, coming from a Member State which has benefited from a planned transition project towards membership, I very much hope that we shall succeed in an enlarged Europe and peace.</seg>
<seg id=1319> However, we must realise that, if you have the right of veto, all the others have too.</seg>
<seg id=1320> But there will have to be a first transition in view of the elections in 2004 because a number of new Member States will be joining us before or during this legislature, which is to run until 2009.</seg>
<seg id=1321> The President-in-Office of the Council has addressed the issue of closer cooperation and he has said that it proceeds towards a consensus on this issue.</seg>
<seg id=1322> Mr President, at first sight, Nice concerns the necessary reforms and on the leftovers in the context of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1323> If we were to have only a few features of this mentality, if we insist less on the things that are going wrong on our continent and a little more on the things that are going well, we would be a little more happy that at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=1324> We must not only extend qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers in the transport of goods, we must include services, investment, intellectual property and competition associated with it and adapt accordingly Article 133 (1) of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1325> Indeed, the granting of such a right to the European Parliament would also free rein to the arbitrary nature of the policy of the ultra sensitive issue.</seg>
<seg id=1326> So we must also, as one of you, referring to the American optimism and the way in which the Americans speak for themselves, we must also be able to develop what works and what makes.</seg>
<seg id=1327> I would also like to say that I do not believe that there is a problem between large and small countries.</seg>
<seg id=1328> We have worked hard, but we have this old problem, and I do not believe that this development can be triggered by the movement of a single country, because we come up against the realities, once again, national, political, democratic, very strong in 12 of the 15 countries.</seg>
<seg id=1329> Finally, Mr President VÃ©drine, you have raised a tense situation and perhaps too much talk of a certain pessimism.</seg>
<seg id=1330> In general, could you take measures to improve safety in order to ensure that such events cannot happen again?</seg>
<seg id=1331> I believe that we must take measures that we have never before taken until now, so that the guests of this Parliament feel here as guests, and do not have to fear of threats.</seg>
<seg id=1332> HospitalitÃ© here hospitality and respect there.</seg>
<seg id=1333> I would like to thank you for your contribution, Mr Tajani.</seg>
<seg id=1334> The best tribute to Ernest Lluch and his memory is to respect his message - dÃ¬aleg in Catalan. Can all give it its chance in the Basque Country?</seg>
<seg id=1335> Of course, on the other hand, everyone can express its opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1336> B5-0550 / 2000 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Council, on the political situation and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=1337> When I speak of organisation, I am also thinking of the European Union which is making great efforts, and if, in my opinion, should have to take responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=1338> Secondly, you will see in the resolution the very clear desire of Parliament to be based on security and defence policy on two pillars: the balanced civil crisis management and, in the event of failure, military crisis management, the two pillars are complementary.</seg>
<seg id=1339> Mr President, given the delay which has been taken and my duties, after, I shall try to shorten somewhat the speech I had prepared.</seg>
<seg id=1340> These relations will take the form of meetings between the Council and the North Atlantic COPSI, and meetings between the European Union and the fifteen countries of Europe candidates and / or allies.</seg>
<seg id=1341> Take, for example, what has happened in the Balkans, where we can say that everyone has played its full role.</seg>
<seg id=1342> We have also, in this period kept very informed the United States developments are taking place under the European Security and Defence Policy, which is a sine qua non to develop harmoniously, as is the case at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=1343> The second edition of the Annual Report of the European Union on human rights has been presented to the European Parliament. A forum on human rights will be held in Paris on 13 December.</seg>
<seg id=1344> This policy, does not seek to compete with the Atlantic Alliance, which is today the basis of the collective defence of its members, or to set up a permanent European army.</seg>
<seg id=1345> On the other hand, if I have mentioned the figure of 100 000 soldiers, this does not mean that we are trying to overcome the objective set at Helsinki, but that we have a reservation in qualifications and in different specialities which can ensure that the 60 000 men on the objective of the Council would be achieved, whatever the operating conditions of their jobs.</seg>
<seg id=1346> Allow me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to say a few words the profound political importance, approved by a large part of our public opinion, of this new task in which Europe is becoming a tool of political influence is lacking.</seg>
<seg id=1347> The problem we now face is to ensure that, when we talk about consolidating the liberal democracy in Europe, we believe in Europe as a whole, because that is the purpose of enlargement and of the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=1348> We need to integrate into a coherent whole three distinct elements: Community policies, the CFSP (including the ESDP) and the action of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1349> Despite our working procedures, we do not need a force of 60 000 men in order to fulfil our objectives.</seg>
<seg id=1350> We must therefore put in place an urgent solution of humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id=1351> I do not agree with the cynics who say that Europe is a joujou and unusable. Of course, it is true that, in many cases, the rapid reaction force cannot be channelled directly.</seg>
<seg id=1352> The EU must not provide itself with a defence own with permanent staff.</seg>
<seg id=1353> To conclude, I shall express the deep concern that the members of my group and I feel in the face of the constant deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan, and I would urge the Commission and the Council to do everything possible to intensify efforts to achieve a peaceful and help the civilian population, particularly at this time, the approach of winter.</seg>
<seg id=1354> To put it very simply: where, when and under what conditions the European intervention force be required to take action in the future?</seg>
<seg id=1355> It will allow us to understand the appalling record of these two months of intifada: 270 dead, most, and around 10 000 Palestinian often injured, disabled for life.</seg>
<seg id=1356> Hence his relentless efforts to set up an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction cannot be more dismal.</seg>
<seg id=1357> Secondly, contrary to what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it is possible or desirable that the European Union is doing more than it has done already in view of the conflict and the escalation of violence in the Middle East, particularly now, in this transition period that cross the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1358> Mr President, in my speech I shall focus on the report by Mrs LalumiÃšre report, which I think is well thought-out and clearly formulated.</seg>
<seg id=1359> But there is no political concept and there is still no real common foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=1360> The only problem is that so far, it has not managed to obtain public opinion for this type of action, despite the fact that they are considerably more sustainable and more efficient.</seg>
<seg id=1361> Mr President, it remains, of course, the budget and the question of how the divide.</seg>
<seg id=1362> I say this in spite of the mass of apparent guarantees which were miraculously made on the subject in recent days.</seg>
<seg id=1363> At the moment, this is a severe lack of capacity, and we must, at the end of the day, that the Member States relate to their defence spending programmes which differ greatly from one country to another.</seg>
<seg id=1364> Even those who are questioning the usefulness that can result of a decision such as the one aimed at creating the so-called European army must consider the important political aspect of this decision and its influence on the cohesion of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1365> The presence of a Defence Minister for the first time in this House is such a historic event that we have entered the night sitting so that our Members are not too impressed.</seg>
<seg id=1366> For all of these conflicts, a non-military crisis management in terms of prevention is better than a military management.</seg>
<seg id=1367> Russia is, in the long term, remain united in an undemocratic regime?</seg>
<seg id=1368> Therefore, Europe will not be a new alliance, as I have heard mentioned, I believe, by a development incomplÃštement informed.</seg>
<seg id=1369> I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure, to wind up this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1370> Given the scale of the task, four committees were involved and a new procedure has been set up, with four parallel reports.</seg>
<seg id=1371> All the measures proposed in the White Paper should be helping to modernise and to make effective the functioning of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1372> It would be a good thing that the reform is the opportunity to limit their intervention in the only areas which do not involve expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1373> The differences of opinion that have arisen are not only of a political nature, but reflect the cultural differences still further between the Fifteen.</seg>
<seg id=1374> The new internal audit service, under your direct responsibility, Mr Kinnock, Vice-President responsible for reform, will take as a main task of the analysis of the functions and internal control systems that exist within the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1375> Working together has been a pleasure, and I believe that the fact that we were all four involved has deepened and enriched the process of treatment of a crucial reform of the Commission, which is essential for the future of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1376> They can be expected to be transferred to other European institutions, to be seconded from the national governments or to work in the private sector.</seg>
<seg id=1377> Therefore, our Committee on Constitutional Affairs rappelle-t-elle its attachment to a Commission strong, independent, efficient, transparent and politically accountable.</seg>
<seg id=1378> As the Committee on Budgets, we believe that activity-based budgeting is a problem on account of the lack of visibility of expenditure and of our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=1379> This is, quite evident, the goodwill of this Parliament in relation to the implementation of this reform with the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1380> Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1381> This is a disgrace when we think that the European Union is a champion of the modernisation of economic life.</seg>
<seg id=1382> Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteurs to support the work of the Commission, we have not yet made a global and coherent response by the Committee of Independent Experts, which is a policy of management and not only of better administration of the institution.</seg>
<seg id=1383> This change of attitude must be translated into an open administration.</seg>
<seg id=1384> In my opinion, there is no structure whose importance is greatest. It is fifteen nations, tomorrow twenty or more, an entire continent, the most industrialised parts of the world, who live in the Union, and for it, in the Commission and its structures.</seg>
<seg id=1385> The change is never easy.</seg>
<seg id=1386> In so doing, however, the Socialist Group believes that the current functioning of the Community public administration is efficient enough.</seg>
<seg id=1387> The result is known and has to be the dedication and the competence of the majority of members of the Commission and its administration.</seg>
<seg id=1388> Many thousands of applications of projects are awaiting an assessment for more than a year.</seg>
<seg id=1389> The debate, as we have seen, is not so much on the principles, objectives and desirability of the reform of the procedures, the pace, the timetable, possible problems or the unwanted consequences of its implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1390> I would like to begin by communicating to the House - as pointed out by Mr van Hulten earlier - that the meeting of the College this morning adopted the proposal for an interinstitutional agreement establishing an advisory committee on standards governing public life, as set out in the action 1 of the action plan of the White Paper.</seg>
<seg id=1391> I think that Mr van Hulten has once again stressed this point during the debate.</seg>
<seg id=1392> The main aim of this revision is to simplify the procedures, to increase transparency and to strengthen the budgetary rules, which will result in concrete terms by reducing the number of exceptions and special arrangements, incomprehensible and, consequently, for greater efficiency in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg id=1393> It is indeed uneconomic to the Commission that the texts provide for a payment of 20% for the cost X and 30% for the costs Y and, secondly, that there are regrouping and verification of documentation for small amounts.</seg>
<seg id=1394> The next item is the report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations [2000 / 2051 (INI)].</seg>
<seg id=1395> These aspects are of particular interest to the NGOs.</seg>
<seg id=1396> Of course, this is not sufficient, but it must get to the heart of those cartoons on the weakness of our development aid.</seg>
<seg id=1397> We will return to this matter, because it is in itself a framework of quality.</seg>
<seg id=1398> Mr President, I returned today of Mozambique, where the European Union has provided humanitarian aid of high quality following the floods; however, the reconstruction projects for which funds have already been allocated are once again delayed pending a signature in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id=1399> Faced with this situation, the need for greater involvement and greater effectiveness in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is essential.</seg>
<seg id=1400> We now have a harmonised framework for the development of the country strategy papers and the indicative programmes of cooperation in all developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=1401> What is more, the creation of SEM did not put an end to the disparity that existed between eight administrative resources volumineuses.</seg>
<seg id=1402> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, if I would like particularly to be with you today for this debate on the maritime first package in the European Parliament, it is because you are going to examine three important texts, which constitute a first, crucial step on a subject that recent events have unfortunately put on the agenda of the present.</seg>
<seg id=1403> This could allow, moreover, from the point of view of the Presidency of the Council, to discuss with the Member States to obtain an agreement of the Council on the basis of your proposals and to adopt the text at first reading, if necessary by qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=1404> This rapid response and targeted embodied in the two Erika packages of measures and the six proposals, has launched important momentum.</seg>
<seg id=1405> The lesson for us within this House in its debate this morning is that we are forced to conclude that the laws at sea are, in the world, in a state of chaos, and that we must get down to work to bring order.</seg>
<seg id=1406> We must send a clear signal to vessels which do not meet standards of safety and mean that we cannot tolerate them more in European waters or in European ports.</seg>
<seg id=1407> For small form, we adopt a position of compromise between the ceiling of 5 000 tonnes that had set the IMO, and that of 600 tonnes is set by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1408> These data should be made available to the European authorities, the Member States and port, as well as the interested public.</seg>
<seg id=1409> The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can have repercussions on a wider region, requires the creation of a Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution.</seg>
<seg id=1410> The environmental organisations are also involved in cooperation at local level.</seg>
<seg id=1411> Changing the directive in the direction of greater rigour in its application, harmonisation of legislation, particularly as regards the selection of ships under the inspection, and the scope of the various types of inspection, is obviously positive.</seg>
<seg id=1412> I should also like to point out that the urgency that you referred to now has no place.</seg>
<seg id=1413> With regard to the ceiling on liability of classification societies, it is in my view that the Council and Parliament to deepen the reflection, regardless of what is decided today.</seg>
<seg id=1414> A black box, a black list, all the things that we are active. But I would nonetheless highlight a few points.</seg>
<seg id=1415> Faced with this catastrophic situation and uncontrolled use of sea transport, Europe has risen to the challenge and eleven months after the Erika, the European Union will be able to announce that never have been manipulated procedure so quickly.</seg>
<seg id=1416> It recognises how the liberal logic is opposed to a high level of safety at sea.</seg>
<seg id=1417> Whatever, finally, the technical measures to be taken, one of the major sources of insecurity will remain as it will not be rebalanced Nord-Atlantique Channel and in the region, the exponential growth of the traffic in the strangulation of North Sea ports.</seg>
<seg id=1418> It would be the honour of the President-in-Office of the Council to put things right, also in his own country.</seg>
<seg id=1419> Madam President, since the sinking of the oil tanker Erika, a package of measures has been created, under political pressure, in order to improve the safety of ships at sea.</seg>
<seg id=1420> The Greek ships have sunk, without there being the slightest storm in its neck of the woods, Mr Gayssot.</seg>
<seg id=1421> Thirdly, I believe that it is becoming clear in such cases, that there is no relationship between our oil supply, on the one hand, and the fact that we always use of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id=1422> Let us therefore have the political courage to our environmental ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1423> This means that, in this area more than any other, our responsibility is great, and we must, I think, silence all institutional self-esteem.</seg>
<seg id=1424> From the point of view of Finland, for example, it is very important that Russia is an integral part of these agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1425> I believe both the strengthening of the requirements for the construction of oil standards, the improvement of rules on the control of ports, and also, therefore, on tightening of regulations relating to the classification societies of ships.</seg>
<seg id=1426> Madam President, we are now discussing maritime safety on the basis of three reports which I warmly congratulate the rapporteurs.</seg>
<seg id=1427> With regard to these three new proposals on maritime safety, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs, who have, in a relatively short period of time, shown how our Parliament is determined to adopt new measures to improve safety at sea, controls, standards of construction and shown that it is no longer tolerable that similar accidents occur again.</seg>
<seg id=1428> Madam President, our continent has recently been struck by a series of large-scale maritime disasters involving particularly oil tankers.</seg>
<seg id=1429> More than 80% of accidents are caused by human error, but there are grounds for human error, which are of social order.</seg>
<seg id=1430> A parliamentary or used the term 'traceability'.</seg>
<seg id=1431> The directive on port state control is designed to verify compliance with international requirements and not to introduce new regulations.</seg>
<seg id=1432> Amendment No 18 links the port state control to rest periods of seafarers, even if the application of provisions on working hours for seafarers is already fully covered by Directive 99 / 95.</seg>
<seg id=1433> I am pleased to see that the rapporteur has introduced a reference in Amendment No 21, the special system of control, and I gave our agreement with the main thrust of this approach, but is nevertheless that the wording should be refined in order to clarify matters.</seg>
<seg id=1434> Amendment No 4 and part of Amendment No 18 on recital K are not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1435> I can assure you that if a shipowner registering a ship to do under these flags, it would have every interest to think twice in the light of our proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1436> The Commissioner has spoken for 18 minutes, and all the time, it has quoted dozens and dozens of articles, and it has rejected the Commission's position.</seg>
<seg id=1437> Proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on a series of actions relating to the trans-European network of collection, production and dissemination of statistics on the challenges of goods (EDICOM intra- and extra-Community) (COM (2000) 0458 - C5-0401 / 2000 - 2000 / 0201 (COD)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)</seg>
<seg id=1438> By withdrawing our resolution, I am, however, convinced that Parliament would have done better by making its voice heard, in view of the Nice European Council, a separate and specific resolution on the issues which are so important and so difficult for the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than treating them in the context of a single resolution including also all the other items on the agenda of the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1439> (More than twelve Members standing, the oral amendment was not adopted) (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1440> Report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI))</seg>
<seg id=1441> I voted against in protest against the fact that the European Union is not yet to intervene as it should be doing in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1442> Although the proposal to amend the existing directive on the control of ships as well as the Watts report does not meet the real needs, they are a step in the right direction. For these reasons, we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1443> It is therefore regrettable that the Commission proposal did not accept the idea of creating a genuine European supervisory body, along the lines of the coast guards' in the United States'.</seg>
<seg id=1444> The safety of ships, the protection of life at sea and the environment require that we tackle the unaccountability of shipowners, very strict measures for the control of the state of the ship and imposes severe penalties to shipping companies which violate the security rules, which improves the conditions of seafarers, that they are given appropriate training and guarantees of personnel on board that meet the increased needs of vessels.</seg>
<seg id=1445> Unfortunately, the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, quite the opposite.</seg>
<seg id=1446> The sinking of the Erika accident in December 1999 was at the origin of the emergence of the issue of maritime safety in the Community policy agenda and that is under pressure from the European Parliament that the European Commission has proposed the texts we adopted today, almost a year after this sinister shipwreck.</seg>
<seg id=1447> The existing compensation funds have been badly serviced, and it became only too clearly in the case of the Braer disaster, following which the fishing industry in the Shetland Islands has been too little compensated in comparison with the damage caused.</seg>
<seg id=1448> I have already said, Madam President, that in the past I have had the opportunity to navigate.</seg>
<seg id=1449> The rapporteur's proposals on the harmonisation at European level can only be positive.</seg>
<seg id=1450> It is an important aspect, since it relates to the classification societies of ships.</seg>
<seg id=1451> It would be a great success, for Europe we need, on the eve of enlargement, is not a supranational Europe rigid, disciplined, distant, but a Europe that is flexible and close to the people, based on respect for national democracies.</seg>
<seg id=1452> The struggle for power between more and more openly number of Member States cloud the prospect of possible compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1453> The Nice Summit will be primarily the task of guaranteeing the effectiveness of the institutions of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1454> In a week of the summit, I personally hope!</seg>
<seg id=1455> I am not in favour of an automatic link between QMV and codecision, and, here too, I believe that any decision to extend the powers of codecision should be examined on a case-by-case basis.</seg>
<seg id=1456> By amending Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extend QMV, currently in force in the Council for the trade in products, in other areas such as public services, intellectual property, health or education.</seg>
<seg id=1457> Thus Parliament is forbidden to exert an influence, we drop the voice and quiet on behalf of the party allegiance, and national and government, forgetting its obligations to its citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1458> I have also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the future Treaty which will be adopted in Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1459> The fact that share the Union A and B teams is wrong, and I disagree with the idea of allowing a third of the Member States to pre-empt the others.</seg>
<seg id=1460> Its fledgling role has put an end to the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.</seg>
<seg id=1461> There are many elements to which the British Conservative Group can support in this report, in particular the insistence on enlargement of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1462> The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have decided to support the report on the establishment of a common European policy on security and defence.</seg>
<seg id=1463> But also against the peoples of the European Union which will, in any case, to fund new expenditure of arms advocated by the report and which do not even have the guarantee that these military forces are not ever used against them, in the name of "maintaining order".</seg>
<seg id=1464> It is serious also to a state which does not wish to participate in a mission to be obliged to pay a financial contribution which will be distributed between the Member States participating in this war.</seg>
<seg id=1465> The external military means provide no solution, because it does not remove the causes of conflict and does not change the public.</seg>
<seg id=1466> Â· the fact that the military operations would be financed by a Community budget line and that the Member States would have to contribute financially to the operations, even if they do not wish to participate (paragraphs 49 and 50)</seg>
<seg id=1467> The EU should, on the contrary, advantage to alter the priorities set out in the framework of the Petersberg tasks, and it should concentrate its efforts on the implementation of civil and humanitarian tasks.</seg>
<seg id=1468> I support the report by my colleague Mrs Theorin 's.</seg>
<seg id=1469> But we do not mention the needs of this category to move the request for a tax deductibility of domestic services' and a 'adaptation of prices and costs to the financial possibilities individuals'.</seg>
<seg id=1470> It is truly incredible that we still have to recommend to the 21st century that Member States can guarantee domestic employees the right to social security and pensions.</seg>
<seg id=1471> For many young people, the first contact with the labour market could take the form of an undeclared job.</seg>
<seg id=1472> The situation is worsening, when it comes to women distant countries who have accepted this work by necessity and which have no alternative to continue to meet their basic needs.</seg>
<seg id=1473> The reform of the Commission will be judged on coins, hence the need for regular monitoring reports that the European Commission will present throughout the duration of the programme and the importance of the full balance sheet expected in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id=1474> In the recent past, various scandals and mismanagement have resulted, in March 1999, for the resignation of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1475> Finally, I think it is vital to remember that, through this reform, essential for the future, we expect to be the more rigour and transparency of the Commission in its day-to-day management, but also a greater sense of responsibility for its part, within the strict framework of its powers.</seg>
<seg id=1476> The Conservatives should also support the statement in paragraph 7 of the report that we must ensure that the democratic control and functioning of the system by three pillars.</seg>
<seg id=1477> (The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=1478> We have learned, and I would like to add that I cannot believe - that the President of the Council and the French Republic will be here tomorrow for thirty minutes, to take the floor.</seg>
<seg id=1479> Therefore, it seems to me to be ruled out that we have a thorough and comprehensive position.</seg>
<seg id=1480> Be that as it itself, are voting, and I am in favour of a resolution as has been suggested by Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others.</seg>
<seg id=1481> We have worked on these texts, even in the night, as on the figures relating to the weighting of votes in the Council and the distribution of seats in this House.</seg>
<seg id=1482> Madam President, I would very much like to speak in favour of maintaining the report by Mr de Roo on the agenda because it has been very well prepared and must be the subject of a common position at the last Council of Ministers the Environment of the French Presidency, which will be held on Monday and Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id=1483> Thank you, Mr Parish.</seg>
<seg id=1484> In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy - that Mr Brok chair - he smokes in sitting.</seg>
<seg id=1485> The political basis is clear: to harmonise the market, taking account of a high level of protection of public health and consumers, are based on the existing regulations and by promoting the scientific point of view.</seg>
<seg id=1486> It is their conditions and conception of life, in which health protection becomes increasingly important.</seg>
<seg id=1487> This rule can also apply to all drugs rÃ©crÃ©ationnelles but dangerous, provided that the consumer of drugs is the only one to run risks.</seg>
<seg id=1488> Yesterday, in the United States, of the trial have been won against the tobacco multinationals for poisoning and lie on the non-toxicitÃ© of products.</seg>
<seg id=1489> With regard to the export of EU cigarettes banned for health reasons, even within the Union, we believe that the only sensible and logical solution is to put a stop to them.</seg>
<seg id=1490> Rather than draw lessons from the failure made in Luxembourg on 9 October, we are persevering in a legally indefensible.</seg>
<seg id=1491> I have carefully examined the statements by the Commissioner addressed to my colleague, Mr Hume: 'massive loss of jobs in this sector.</seg>
<seg id=1492> It is up to Parliament and the Council to approve this proposal for a directive and to examine, among other things, its proper legal basis.</seg>
<seg id=1493> I do not think that we can follow a path too restricted, i.e. that, regardless of the content, and of the substantive content that have highlighted Mr Maaten and others - there is a danger that, if this Parliament and the Council to accept the restrictive interpretation proposed by the leader of the European People's Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and all the Community institutions are tied to the level of legislative development of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law.</seg>
<seg id=1494> The weak point in the proposal is that it places great emphasis on the promotion of free competition.</seg>
<seg id=1495> I would say in conclusion that, since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has the power of coordination in the field of the environment and consumer protection, and of course it will work in close cooperation with the Council and the Commission on these matters.</seg>
<seg id=1496> In fact, it has nothing to do with tobacco, but the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities would also have been able to lead to a ban on alcohol advertising or for chocolate, since it is known that sugar can also be dangerous to health.</seg>
<seg id=1497> I really do not understand that a majority of Members might wish a relaxation of the export rules in relation to the wishes expressed by the governments of the Member States - the governments which also represent the many industrial circles concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1498> It is a fact that 80% of smokers want to stop, but the tobacco industry does little to help these policies in place to stop smoking.</seg>
<seg id=1499> If we are beginning to dictate to other countries the standards of public health that they should apply in extending our proposals quite sensible for the internal market to exports, we shall endanger the excellent work done by Mr Maaten.</seg>
<seg id=1500> We are in favour of the application of a uniform test method recognised by all the countries of the EU, which must be implemented by a laboratory of authorised tests in a country.</seg>
<seg id=1501> The effects of tobacco consumption on health are now widely recognised, and the legislators and public opinion to share the same feeling that it is now time to adopt stringent rules and regulations for this product.</seg>
<seg id=1502> Consequently, the Community rules would be in harmony with the future international agreements, which we would avoid the danger of trade barriers and would strengthen the protection of consumers, whilst ensuring a high level of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1503> It would be better to wait until the question of all of the additives is being dealt with in the context of the first report of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1504> With regard to laboratory tests, the amendment dealing with the approval of the tests is superfluous, given that another article guarantees the movement of goods which are in accordance with the provisions of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1505> Madam President, this report is all that is more simple: at the present time, directives on summer-time have a period of validity of five years, after which they have to come back to this Parliament to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id=1506> of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on summer-time arrangements, which we are considering today, is a good proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1507> I therefore believe that we should not spend too much time on this issue, given that the Member States and the population have already widely accepted the regulation on summer-time and that it has been recognised as an integral part of our annual cycle.</seg>
<seg id=1508> In my opinion, it is good that the issues of time zones and application of the directive on summertime remain the competence of the Member States, as suggested in the proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1509> It would be more sensible to put an end to the time of summer at the end of September, around six months after its beginning.</seg>
<seg id=1510> It can nevertheless agree with the idea of making appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report by 2007 mentioned in Article 5.</seg>
<seg id=1511> It has been said that no trial leading to changes in the genetic identity of the participating cannot be accepted.</seg>
<seg id=1512> If we approve it, we have a regulation which ensures the therapeutic progress and not leave the protection of patients in the current state, but improves it. That is why I am in favour of this compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1513> These groups should remain within the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1514> I am also pleased that we have been able to provide safeguards against genetic and cell therapy.</seg>
<seg id=1515> I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his work, and thank him for the efforts he has made to reconcile opposing views.</seg>
<seg id=1516> These concern the fight against cancer, the prevention of AIDS, the prevention of drug addiction and health promotion, and their interruption would mean the end of the actions concerned and of the work of the networks that have been put in place.</seg>
<seg id=1517> It is very advantageous to be able to advance the ground, in order to make as much progress as possible, to bring us greatly and, in cases where a second reading would be necessary, to ensure that we are almost at the point to decide.</seg>
<seg id=1518> In addition, we must not lose sight of the fact that both the prevention and promotion that vigilance will always be more important and that it will therefore be necessary to provide them with bigger budgets and give them greater importance.</seg>
<seg id=1519> Madam President, following the Trakatellis report on the extension of certain existing European programmes in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about the direction in which the EU 's public health policy.</seg>
<seg id=1520> According to my information, the Council also gave its agreement in principle.</seg>
<seg id=1521> In the European Union, paradoxically, the abolition of internal borders in order to promote the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is accompanied by the maintenance of 15 borders in the fields of police and criminal justice, which the Member States have difficulty in freeing themselves.</seg>
<seg id=1522> Finally, the initiative represents a considerable step forward towards the creation of a European criminal judicial area, still only partial and limited, but it responds to the real needs of a considerable mass of European citizens who, when they are victims of an offence outside the territory of their State of residence are so far, virtually no use.</seg>
<seg id=1523> What do we have therefore asked for these groups of people?</seg>
<seg id=1524> We must at the same time ensure special training for professionals in direct contact with the victims.</seg>
<seg id=1525> The victims must not become doubly victims, victims of crime suffered and victims of the system.</seg>
<seg id=1526> In this context, it is also important that parents close, the family of the victim, to be informed of the facts so discreet and professional if they have the desire and can also count on the support necessary, avoiding that they learn all the details in the press.</seg>
<seg id=1527> This applies irrespective of the type of crime.</seg>
<seg id=1528> Whether it be at the level of the Member States, or that of the Union, we must never deviate from the fundamental principle that every individual must constantly take responsibility for its actions.</seg>
<seg id=1529> In other cases, it might be possible to obtain the relevant information in a language of the Union, which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id=1530> I am very satisfied with the response of Parliament to this first text on a subject which is so crucial, which allows the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building gradually to offer our citizens assistance in situations which are often difficult to live.</seg>
<seg id=1531> Vote on request for urgent procedure</seg>
<seg id=1532> (Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)</seg>
<seg id=1533> For example, in the night of 23 to 24 November, we have reached an agreement with the Council on the essential points of a budget, which is certainly not brilliant, but which is nevertheless reasonable.</seg>
<seg id=1534> The Commission has also proposed a revision to the tune of EUR 300 million.</seg>
<seg id=1535> But I have also learned of the discussions that it is much more difficult to reach the formulation of a Council position negotiable, to receive a mandate and to be purely national self-interest in a common European decision remotely reasonable and justifiable.</seg>
<seg id=1536> I hope that the work for a common recruitment office, as we say in German expression, i.e. a European authority of recruitment, real progress, so that we can respond to the problems that occur in all the institutions - the Council and the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions - in the coming years, namely the need for staff.</seg>
<seg id=1537> The Council refuses to carry out this review - it seems that we should already have data - and I should like to prevent: to use the flexibility instrument two consecutive years - indeed, in less than 15 months and the first to less than six less of the approval of the financial perspectives â vacuum the flexibility instrument because it prevents it from its possible renewal and accumulation, which is planned up to EUR 600 million.</seg>
<seg id=1538> This very large sum, which responds to the existence of very high needs in 2001, can be financed through the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to the tune of EUR 200 million.</seg>
<seg id=1539> It is taking this into account again that the Council has voted at second reading a budget increase of 2.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1540> Finally, before you proceeded to the final adoption of this budget, I would like to stress the Council 's commitment to respect for certain basic budgetary rules, in the reserve of appropriations, the legal basis and classification of expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1541> And, contrary to Nice, the three institutions - Parliament, Council and Commission - are all, I believe, satisfied with the end result.</seg>
<seg id=1542> Ladies and gentlemen, the reappearance of cattle infected by BSE necessitates immediate action in the budgetary context, precisely for the protection of health, consumer protection, but also for aid to farmers affected by this situation.</seg>
<seg id=1543> Furthermore, the Council has defined, for the framework programme for reconstruction aid in the Western Balkans, a multiannual indicative amount, admittedly, which is compatible with these financial perspectives.</seg>
<seg id=1544> The struggle, we have managed to obtain a few million extra.</seg>
<seg id=1545> I am very grateful to Mrs Haug.</seg>
<seg id=1546> We therefore believe that this per cent of the budget of the European Union is put to good use.</seg>
<seg id=1547> If I understand what you have said, we should not use the reserve because it is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id=1548> I therefore believe that we have seen very good things, in addition to many others, that I cannot mention now because of the short period of time.</seg>
<seg id=1549> Although the agricultural appropriations, which represent almost half of the total budget increase of more than 5%, even taking into account the letter of amendment, the total increase of the budget is only 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1550> We already see now the great danger that the opposition is increasing in the next few years between MEDA, the projects for the countries of the Mediterranean and the Balkans, as we all know that there is an urgent need for funds in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1551> Satisfaits for having overcome the difficulties which made so close the door to the objective sought to fulfil the commitments made in Helsinki with the applicant countries without unravel the Union, to enable the Europe of tomorrow to continue to operate efficiently.</seg>
<seg id=1552> They are real, even if they do not go as far as the Presidency, which has shown, I note, at national level, with great openness, would have liked.</seg>
<seg id=1553> A new legal basis is scheduled for the status of European political parties and Parliament is given the status of institutional applicants provided for in Article 230 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1554> In recent weeks, three important progress has been made.</seg>
<seg id=1555> That is the meaning of the declaration adopted in Nice and the deliberations to coordinate at European level the fight against doping.</seg>
<seg id=1556> Among the threats, there is, as everyone knows, global warming.</seg>
<seg id=1557> In addition, in Nice, the European Union has put in place the necessary permanent bodies in the definition and the conduct of a common foreign and security policy: a Political and Security Committee, a military and a European Staff.</seg>
<seg id=1558> For this cooperation, for your support and also for your warm welcome, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency thank you.</seg>
<seg id=1559> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1560> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1561> We must now look carefully at the text to Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1562> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1563> I see this as a failure, not only in relation to the declared ambition of the European Union to change the institutions in order to be able to welcome the new Member States in improving the efficiency of the European Union and I see this as a failure to another important objective, that we perhaps have too little mentioned, the approximation of the European Union and the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1564> Good questions, which in our view was that the impressive human tide which, throughout Europe, has travelled to Nice on the eve of the summit.</seg>
<seg id=1565> First, the Member States have signed hastily and teargas under the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=1566> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1567> My group is disappointed by this Treaty and concerned for the future that we are preparing, as we would we all our forces.</seg>
<seg id=1568> Mr President, you have the floor.</seg>
<seg id=1569> I have already replied on this point and I entirely agree with what he has said about the need to improve considerably the public debate, and I will not repeat what I said, but it is true that, all too often, citizens feel alienated to decisions that are taken in the bodies that they do not know.</seg>
<seg id=1570> Mr President, I would like to know whether the competence of the European Parliament in time were a new achievement of the Nice Summit.</seg>
<seg id=1571> DÃ©couragÃ©s until then by the complexity of clinical trials, laboratories will find, perhaps, in the desire expressed both by the Member States and by our House, the courage to develop a paediatric medicinal products market, even if it is not large enough to allow a return on investment.</seg>
<seg id=1572> Should we renew the change of summer time, which was established at the time of the oil shocks, with a view to saving energy, and which had been extended until 2001?</seg>
<seg id=1573> The victims are not always protected properly in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id=1574> Many travellers and tourists will benefit this European initiative.</seg>
<seg id=1575> Mr President, the time for me to welcome Mr President of the Commission, which is the Council and the Presidency, and to stress that probably never in this Parliament, has expressed such unanimity on the results of a summit.</seg>
<seg id=1576> In that way, is that, under the leadership of the French Presidency, in six months, has, I believe, done all his work on six main areas.</seg>
<seg id=1577> However, my greatest fear is that the United Kingdom, France and Germany are now in a position to reverse the delicate balance that existed between the States of different sizes and between the institutions for several decades.</seg>
<seg id=1578> In fact, it is hard to see, in this decision of Nice, which is to facilitate enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1579> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be very brief today.</seg>
<seg id=1580> As a result of this, when we come to vote on the Treaty of Nice, my vote can only be negative.</seg>
<seg id=1581> Mr President, the most important outcome of the meeting of Nice lies in the fact that we have reached an agreement, so that we can now prepare them for the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=1582> The real winners of this conference, it is Mr.</seg>
<seg id=1583> So, let us forget Nice, look at the post-Nice situation - and you will permit me to put my hope in the draft great Convention proposed by Belgium for its Presidency, because the proof is made, we must make the nine, we must change method, we must speed up the story: 2004 it is too late, it is too far, it is too dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=1584> Instead the spirit which prevailed in Nice was, instead to ask how making real progress in Europe, to ask how we could block, how we could achieve a decision-making system at intergovernmental level, how we can boast returned home, once again, to have been the defender of national interests.</seg>
<seg id=1585> This before what we are after Amsterdam and Nice, that is a Europe of princes, a Europe of national administrations, and not a Europe of political union.</seg>
<seg id=1586> We cannot continue without a qualified majority decision on the key issues.</seg>
<seg id=1587> It is true that â I paraphraserai Mr Bayrou â I am at this bench since this morning, firstly with the President of the Republic, followed by myself and, I believe, criticism mounts moderate, friendly criticism, but all the same.</seg>
<seg id=1588> We must not forget that this is the first time, in fact, since 1957, that reform and really revise the grid.</seg>
<seg id=1589> We are in the constitutional systems and the powers cannot be confused.</seg>
<seg id=1590> Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office.</seg>
<seg id=1591> But it has not been incorporated into the treaties and has not been mentioned in Article 6 (2) of the Treaty on European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1592> Finally, there are some positive elements: the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty, the article on the political parties and their status, the right of this Parliament to translate the other institution before the Court of Justice - it is also an important element of political control, the new formula for the European Commission, which is what is known as the 'Prodi' law in the Treaty, which strengthens the President and the new composition of the Commission - reasonable compromise that I accept and which will operate, in time, and, as my colleague, Mr Tsatsos, pointed out, the path towards the future.</seg>
<seg id=1593> Mr President, we have already carried out a rigorous evaluation of what happened in Nice, but we should remember that Nice is a very tight agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1594> Let us note those things: the Charter has not been included in the Treaties, it is not even mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=1595> We want to demonstrate to the Heads of Government that we can do better.</seg>
<seg id=1596> Despite laudatory statements made himself this morning by the French Government, the IGC has not ended.</seg>
<seg id=1597> Mr President, the French Presidency is not present in this debate, it is not easy to criticise it.</seg>
<seg id=1598> Mr President, the Nice Summit has demonstrated that the method of the Intergovernmental Conference has done its time.</seg>
<seg id=1599> 2001 budget (continuation)</seg>
<seg id=1600> This does not, however, mean that we could do more and better.</seg>
<seg id=1601> These maximum oblige the Commission to set priorities within the limits of a certain budget as any authority must do so.</seg>
<seg id=1602> The vote which will follow this debate will be a long and complex process of adoption of the budget of the European Union for the financial year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1603> That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by returning to Article 272; the financial perspectives have been maintained, even if we have used the flexibility instrument.</seg>
<seg id=1604> Let me just say to the Council that, on this issue, we still have balloons and that, on this side, we intend to play until we have achieved a good result.</seg>
<seg id=1605> We do not want that a revised proposal for next year is already contained in the resolution Colom, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we share its critical view when she says that this way of solving the financial shortfall in Category 4 distorts the multiannual character of the major external objectives of the Union and the definition itself of the financial perspectives.</seg>
<seg id=1606> For this to be possible, we will have to define, for the future too, of the priorities of major proportions.</seg>
<seg id=1607> Only in this way that the money is made available to our citizens, will be used properly and wisely.</seg>
<seg id=1608> If we add to this the SAB ahead, it almost seems to 8%, whereas in all the other areas - whether training policy, of the entire area of internal actions, including research, foreign policy, the administration and pre-accession aid, we have only a growth rate of 1.1%.</seg>
<seg id=1609> Since this cooperation is so good, we will still be able to continue in January, at the presentation of the supplementary budget.</seg>
<seg id=1610> The criticism of relations between Russia and the Baltic states which have not yet been satisfactorily resolved we must also.</seg>
<seg id=1611> We are following with great interest to the development of society and of domestic politics in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1612> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1613> Even if President Putin can guarantee the democratic development of his country, it is not automatically the guarantee of a stable and democratic Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1614> We must not be insidious, but on the contrary, to build a Europe of economic cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1615> With regard to the Caucasus, Mr Van Orden is absolutely right.</seg>
<seg id=1616> If we look at Russia from outside and that it receives punctually of direct impressions of Russian partners, we run the risk of talking about a possible selectively of a Russian reality which is the image that we have made ourselves of Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1617> In political terms, the common strategy proposes Russia to engage in a permanent dialogue on the political and security and to create a permanent mechanism.</seg>
<seg id=1618> In this paragraph, I wanted to stress how important it is to stress the fact that Russia is really political union with Belarus.</seg>
<seg id=1619> Do you think support such a project, Mr Patten?</seg>
<seg id=1620> In this context, as Parliament knows, during the last summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi has initiated an in-depth dialogue on energy.</seg>
<seg id=1621> I fervently hope that I am personally in Kaliningrad at the beginning of next year, and not just because Immanuel Kant has spent his whole life.</seg>
<seg id=1622> Once again, I congratulate the honourable Member on his excellent report, which is a subject of great importance, on which I am sure we will look again and again in this Parliament over the next few years.</seg>
<seg id=1623> You put me in a very difficult position.</seg>
<seg id=1624> Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is very important, because the mad cow crisis has enormous effects on food products, on the production and import of food products.</seg>
<seg id=1625> The Council has expressed its concern at the many meetings with Russia, at all levels, in particular to prevent the excessive use of force and a possible extension of the conflict, to carry out independent investigations and effective on violations of human rights, to support the OSCE assistance group in fulfilling its mission and, finally, to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id=1626> Mr President, on a point of order: it is customary in this House that when the issues have not been the subject of an oral answer satisfactory, they should be dealt with later by writing.</seg>
<seg id=1627> (Interruption by Mr Posselt)</seg>
<seg id=1628> This directive dates from 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1629> It is in this sense that there is a need to work.</seg>
<seg id=1630> These groups are obviously not exempted in the new proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1631> The presidency and several Member States have already received from the Committee of European sugar manufacturers various letters relating to the Commission proposal which they will take account in their deliberations.</seg>
<seg id=1632> Question No 6 by (H-0886 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1633> I would firstly like to say that, in my view, the President-in-Office of the Council has not yet answered the question of Mr Korokas.</seg>
<seg id=1634> We must now put in place this authority, and I believe that the awareness of the European authorities is strong and that we must move forward.</seg>
<seg id=1635> Specifically, the representative of the Presidency, Ambassador of France in Algeria, he met Mr Ahmed Taleb?</seg>
<seg id=1636> We welcome the proposed provisions in this respect by the preparatory committee and decided by the General Assembly as regards the method of accreditation non-governmental organisations, the preparatory process and the extraordinary session of September 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1637> The partnership includes several references to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=1638> As the Council has made representations to the honourable Member in her earlier reply, the process of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters will allow better protection of the rights of individuals.</seg>
<seg id=1639> I would like to urge it again.</seg>
<seg id=1640> This is particularly the political control and the strategic direction of a military crisis management operation.</seg>
<seg id=1641> I would simply like to remind you that the system of the Treaty makes a difference between the treatment of taxes and indirect taxes that harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and functioning of the internal market - that is Article 93 - and the approximation, provided for in Article 94, the laws that have a direct impact on the establishment and operation of the common market, including those concerning direct taxation.</seg>
<seg id=1642> Just take a brief look at these three major areas.</seg>
<seg id=1643> If the classical approach according to which â in doubt, remain enemies, that could be "still explode the stability pact of southern Europe based on the principle of regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1644> We also need cooperation with Yugoslavia and, more specifically, of a bilateral cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1645> Mr President, our group supports the work done by Mr Baltas on the report on the possibility of negotiating a stabilisation and association agreement with the Republic of Croatia.</seg>
<seg id=1646> Mr President, I have had, over the years that I have exercised the mandate of President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the opportunity to accompany many Croats in their efforts towards freedom and prosperity they identifiaient for their integration into the European institutions, like other peoples of our continent.</seg>
<seg id=1647> In view of the progress made by Croatia this year, I have to say that I do not doubt our ability to make progress at high speed.</seg>
<seg id=1648> That is what we believe, and the speed with which we have adjusted our policy towards Croatia in recent months bears witness to this.</seg>
<seg id=1649> We need to Croatia to bring the government and the people of that country as much help as possible in the coming years and we are very grateful to the honourable Member who has the wisdom to encourage us to continue along this path.</seg>
<seg id=1650> In this connection, it is incomprehensible that thousands of members of Laskar Jihad were able, in the spring, go in the Moluccas to stir up again conflicts.</seg>
<seg id=1651> In the East, the militias are blocking the return of refugees and those who are harassed.</seg>
<seg id=1652> On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I will confine myself to three points.</seg>
<seg id=1653> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen on her excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1654> However, in this respect, the country is no exception.</seg>
<seg id=1655> Continuing violence which are the scene of the Moluccas, Aceh and Irian Jaya are causing great suffering to the population.</seg>
<seg id=1656> Tomorrow, we will be presenting the Sakharov Prize.</seg>
<seg id=1657> The latest news from the Indonesian archipelago compel us, however, to ask ourselves whether the situation of President Wahid and his followers is not even more serious, more critical than suggested by the rapporteur's analysis.</seg>
<seg id=1658> If we want to help Indonesia, we must intervene now with money and actions, and not just with words.</seg>
<seg id=1659> This report is extremely valuable because he can enlighten us on the development of events.</seg>
<seg id=1660> It is clear that the difficulties of Indonesia will not be resolved overnight.</seg>
<seg id=1661> Protecting the Communities' financial interests</seg>
<seg id=1662> The obstacles to its independence, both in terms of the recruitment of staff and in terms of its structure, must be abolished.</seg>
<seg id=1663> It is therefore essential that in a process of internal reform, the Commission must finally achieve its stated desire to no longer tolerate any fraud and pursue them accordingly.</seg>
<seg id=1664> I believe that this is what should be, and which must also result in Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1665> We want the Member States initiate negotiations with a view to the adoption of uniform legislation in the field of crime, but we do not want our countries are dependent on a federal public prosecutor within the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1666> I would also like to know why the publication of the Commission communication on this subject has been postponed to the following day the Danish referendum on the euro.</seg>
<seg id=1667> I have tabled an amendment seeking to designate these countries by name, because it is time to make it clear that they are and that they are covered.</seg>
<seg id=1668> I am sure that OLAF believes that it is in its interest to make transparent the choice of its senior leaders.</seg>
<seg id=1669> However, we must ensure that, in the European Parliament, not to miss the beam in our it in order to concentrate on the mote in a neighbouring country, the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1670> We are trying to put out a fire, but the smoke suffocate us.</seg>
<seg id=1671> Nobody can understand, either.</seg>
<seg id=1672> To understand this point, I would like to highlight four points which I believe are fundamental in the work of the supervisory authority of the budget.</seg>
<seg id=1673> With regard to Parliament itself, its problem is the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1674> It is rather worrying, Commissioner, that the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - should be explicitly mentioned in the agenda as regards respect for the rights of Members.</seg>
<seg id=1675> This last example, we can recommend to the Committee on Budgets to freeze or reduce the amount of appropriations for budget lines in the budget for the coming year, or not to authorise any transfer of appropriations when it comes to increase those budget lines and that, until the end of the internal investigations under way. It can go so far as to demand that the President of the Commission requires the resignation of or the Commissioners concerned by the serious problems which have been identified, European Caesarean sections in some way.</seg>
<seg id=1676> The report calls for detailed inventories of operational activities, in-depth studies of budget lines and irregularities and an internal audit of the parliamentary committee.</seg>
<seg id=1677> Commissioner, the legal basis for the transmission of information to the European Parliament is the EC Treaty and not the interinstitutional agreement.</seg>
<seg id=1678> Without changes, the final outcome of this common position would be an inequality of weapons not only with North America but also in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1679> I really do not see why we would not be here as in all other cases, to reach a compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1680> It is a proposal which has come a long - and I fear - weary path path, to overcome difficulties that exist.</seg>
<seg id=1681> The first amendment relates to Article 4, which establishes what should be the competent authority for the control of the supply.</seg>
<seg id=1682> We are now being confronted with a proposal which would lead to a genuine pagaÃ¯e, a free-for-all as far with its trail of potential disputes at a delicate stage of the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=1683> In the United Kingdom, the regulation of the times, by means of the voluntary code of practice implemented by the Committee on takeover bids are concerned, is a success story: this is a good example of the pragmatic approach of an extremely complex problem, where the legislation would be less appropriate.</seg>
<seg id=1684> But what is even more important is that it enables us to make progress on the Lisbon Agenda aimed at creating a competitive and dynamic European economy.</seg>
<seg id=1685> The important thing for us here in the European Parliament is ultimately that the contradictory interests, for example, the Executive Board versus the shareholders, the major shareholders versus small shareholders, companies versus the financial market, should be regulated in a minimum form at the European level.</seg>
<seg id=1686> Some amendments tabled by Parliament make further improvements to the text of the common position of the Council. They highlighted the points which may give rise to difficulties in interpretation and insist on a more rapid transposition of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1687> Indeed, it is not at all convinced that the definition of fair price which is proposed is better than another, because the different definitions used in the Member States are sufficient all amply.</seg>
<seg id=1688> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1689> In addition, during a period of three years, the artist will have the right to demand of professionals in the art market any information on the amounts which are due, which is sensible because they need to keep a register of purchases and sales.</seg>
<seg id=1690> Therefore, this is the Austrian legislator is taken and not the European legislator, which only generates positive framework conditions for artists and auction houses.</seg>
<seg id=1691> Moreover, in the matter in hand, the need for a common position is all the more important that only a common position will enable the European Union to carry weight at international level to ensure that the interests of artists can be defended at global level.</seg>
<seg id=1692> I have confidence in the wisdom and understanding of this House.</seg>
<seg id=1693> In Germany, for example, in 1998, on 7 000 artists who have transferred their rights, 274 only have finally recovered money, not to mention the fact that 40% of the resale right is cost of recovering sums owed.</seg>
<seg id=1694> In short, there is no need for harmonisation of this kind in the sector in question.</seg>
<seg id=1695> A similar amendment was rejected at first reading.</seg>
<seg id=1696> They have thought that the translations could follow despite the tight timetable and difficult enough.</seg>
<seg id=1697> However, we have reached a point where we can no longer postpone this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1698> We have proposed in the committee to do this a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id=1699> Our Parliament is naturally on the side of these values and we will continue to defend them.</seg>
<seg id=1700> The technological developments and the fluctuations of the market will lead to changes in any way.</seg>
<seg id=1701> Here, we cannot find legal justification for the exclusion of competition.</seg>
<seg id=1702> The restriction of the universal service - the pillar of the postal sector - to 50 grams risk putting national control positions in a difficult situation, in the sense that they can hardly offer a universal service at an affordable price to citizens, irrespective of their place of residence.</seg>
<seg id=1703> I would remind my Conservative colleagues the problems that they have had in the United Kingdom when they tried to privatise the British postal services.</seg>
<seg id=1704> We have neither more nor less turned the safety net of users of the postal service in a hamac in which the major players in the postal sector can continue to vautrer and act freely.</seg>
<seg id=1705> I am very pleased because, nevertheless, this notion of special services to put new technologies outside the scope of the universal service.</seg>
<seg id=1706> Madam President, Commissioner, we cannot and will not tolerate such a situation.</seg>
<seg id=1707> That is why the European Commission has not proposed, as a second phase, complete liberalisation of this sector.</seg>
<seg id=1708> This is of such a development that I hope the other Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1709> Mr Bolkestein has recently condemned the liberal attitude of lack of French in the Dutch press, or at least that is what was the title of the article in question.</seg>
<seg id=1710> In this connection, we could mention Spain, which has been a fund of this type and uses it to talk about the random legal framework on which the funds is based, the virtual criteria relating to its composition, of discretionary avals for its application.</seg>
<seg id=1711> We are voting tomorrow: I hope that the vote will take place before the amendment tabled by Mr Atkins or by Mr Sterckx, otherwise I will have to vote against this report.</seg>
<seg id=1712> Royal Mail to participate in competition, and pass my mail in MalmÃ¶ in Sweden.</seg>
<seg id=1713> Madam President, Commissioner, that we have learned from the debate, or rather the controversy caused by Commissioner Bolkestein in its pursuit of a liberalisation of postal services, in the absence of any assessment of the first stage and in violation of the rules laid down by this directive? What under cover of terms such as progressive and promoting modernisation, liberalisation, technological, accompanying essors switches in a decline in the social quality of a country.</seg>
<seg id=1714> The safeguarding of the universal service to the aid of a compensation fund which would make it possible to engage in private profits for the benefit of the public service will probably long.</seg>
<seg id=1715> These limits and these delays have also contributed to a debate in which we often confuse the end and the means.</seg>
<seg id=1716> We cannot discuss this matter, Madam President, not to mention economic and social cohesion.</seg>
<seg id=1717> Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, because he has actually carried out a complex, difficult and it has tried to strike a balance between the proposals, positions and points of departure and arrival completely different.</seg>
<seg id=1718> I fear that this proposal further strengthens the current position of monopoly at the taxpayers' expense and increases the threshold imposed on newcomers.</seg>
<seg id=1719> I am also pleased to see that our Liberal friends of the continent show an example to the British Liberal.</seg>
<seg id=1720> Of course, I admit that liberalisation in itself is not a problem, and that it may prove beneficial for consumers.</seg>
<seg id=1721> JustifiÃ©e, because it is part of the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union, which put forward the completion of the internal market for the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id=1722> The universal service is the cornerstone of the Community policy in this field and everything we do is to create a climate conducive to improve it.</seg>
<seg id=1723> The special services are also a sector where innovation and modernisation must be encouraged.</seg>
<seg id=1724> According to him, by the end of the decade, opening up to competition almost all of the postal market seems inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=1725> I believe that there is a need for solid guarantees in order to safeguard the universal service and its obligations.</seg>
<seg id=1726> That is why I cannot and do not remain silent when the future of the sector is threatened by a possible decision which would mean not to respond appropriately to the challenges that have been set at all in Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id=1727> Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.</seg>
<seg id=1728> However, I would remind you that this common organisation of the market is mainly the guarantee of access to the Community market of its products.</seg>
<seg id=1729> I am glad that we have been able to reach a unanimous vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like to thank my colleagues and Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n, rapporteur for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, for its support.</seg>
<seg id=1730> We cannot prevent us from expressing our concern for the banana production of certain ACP countries, of small countries producers in the West Indies and some West African countries which are traditional suppliers of the banana market and with which we have made commitments that we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id=1731> Therefore, I hope that this report is supported in its entirety by the Members of this House, as was the case in the Committee on Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=1732> In the meantime, the United States condemn initially historical reference periods and advocate keeping their own historical reference periods.</seg>
<seg id=1733> Powerful interests come into play, especially those of the Americans, who are not themselves of banana producers, but which were concealed in the American capital firms.</seg>
<seg id=1734> It seems sometimes that the Commission, in the proposals for deregulation of trade and agricultural production at international level, goes further than the Cairns Group.</seg>
<seg id=1735> It is a pity that the Commission and the Council persists in a solution that can seriously compromising this production, particularly after 2006.</seg>
<seg id=1736> The successive decisions of the WTO does not say that it is forbidden to give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers.</seg>
<seg id=1737> Thus, the transitional period should be around 15 years and no less than ten years; the compensatory aid must include the guarantee of the incomes of Community producers and the distribution of the production of the outermost regions and it must also include aid to bodies which sell bananas which are produced.</seg>
<seg id=1738> I hope that it will listen to today our arguments, because this system proposed by the Commission, this tariff preference, albeit of EUR 300, may be very useful in practice because the ACP producers will be rolled out by the system known as the 'first come, first served'.</seg>
<seg id=1739> VOTE</seg>
<seg id=1740> (Parliament approved the Commission proposal)</seg>
<seg id=1741> The Commission rejects the other amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1742> Before the vote:</seg>
<seg id=1743> (Parliament accepted the oral amendment)</seg>
<seg id=1744> Report (A5-0376 / 2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the reform of the procedures and institutions of budgetary control (2000 / 2008 (INI))</seg>
<seg id=1745> The majority of smokers do not know all the risks and do not pay the real price of their choice.</seg>
<seg id=1746> I am always adhered to this principle in my long parliamentary career 35 years.</seg>
<seg id=1747> I fear that their hopes will be in vain.</seg>
<seg id=1748> It is our last attempt to put on cigarette packets of labels and images which reflect the real dangers of smoking.</seg>
<seg id=1749> Lehne report (A5-0368 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1750> This seems to me to be both pertinent and justified, even today, and that is why I voted against this report in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id=1751> It is right that the Committee on Legal Affairs persists in refusing a ceiling and a minimum rate which cannot be below 7%.</seg>
<seg id=1752> If this directive is also for my group a means of giving a clear political signal: we must not waste our time to create in Europe with unnecessary rules.</seg>
<seg id=1753> If it is right to denounce the Stalinist dictatorship of the past, how can we give the slightest confidence to Mr Putin, the murderers of the Chechen people, the godfather of the various mafias, which strives to crush all opposition, civil society (unions, political parties), in order to strengthen its power?</seg>
<seg id=1754> Of course, Indonesia does not deserve such a development of relations because we cannot say that, over recent years, its leaders have distinguished themselves in their great democratic spirit and by their great merits, but we must take account of the Indonesian citizens, and therefore agree to the development of relations and aid.</seg>
<seg id=1755> The unit must be that of criminal acts committed by officials of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1756> The Theato report on the fight against fraud makes it possible to discover that the European Central Bank, without doubt, to prove its well-known independence, has not seen fit to accede to the agreement on the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).</seg>
<seg id=1757> That concludes the vote.</seg>
<seg id=1758> Either we are part of the club, or we are not and we must therefore abide by this decision.</seg>
<seg id=1759> It is therefore not at all EEB - Everything but bananas. Do not cause, ladies and gentlemen, a change of name.</seg>
<seg id=1760> The tariff only system, however, is an important element which ensures the balance of the Commission proposal and is an important basis which should enable the Council to make progress.</seg>
<seg id=1761> There are also measures for the labelling of these bananas in the national and regional programmes to promote rural development.</seg>
<seg id=1762> Europe and the United States are working closely with the defence of the values we share.</seg>
<seg id=1763> We believe discuss a new WTO round and implications for this round of the many bilateral trade initiatives which are the subject of discussion in the US hemisphere.</seg>
<seg id=1764> It has quite rightly said that transatlantic relations are very developed in the last ten years â in great part, it is true, the American side thanks to President Clinton, but I believe that history will recall that there has also been a European contribution to these new relations - quite fundamental contribution - with the 1990 transatlantic declaration and the New Transatlantic Agenda adopted during the Spanish Presidency in December 1995.</seg>
<seg id=1765> It will therefore be important to undertake a reversal of the way and, in fact, to set up a transatlantic agenda for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1766> I will conclude with the Dominican Republic who said: 'The WTO was supposed to be an honest broker applying common rules and where the different countries could learn to play the game.</seg>
<seg id=1767> Secondly, even though we welcome the withdrawal of the Hebrew communist, the collapse of the Soviet Union has left a only superpower: the United States of America.</seg>
<seg id=1768> I know that it maintains a constructive dialogue with Parliament and with the committees which deal with these issues.</seg>
<seg id=1769> The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:</seg>
<seg id=1770> These objectives, the primary objective and secondary objectives, will be the yardstick for judging the concrete proposals put forward by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1771> It is clear that such a solution - the registration in one country with the possibility of providing services throughout the Union - can cause an avalanche in countries where the rate of taxation is low.</seg>
<seg id=1772> Thus, an agreement was reached in 1992, considered at the time as minimum harmonisation, which meant that the standard VAT rate could be below 15%, the Member States having the opportunity to apply one or several reduced rates cannot be below 5%; exemptions being provided for in this case.</seg>
<seg id=1773> We have asked the European Commission to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and to submit a report to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1774> In short, the aim of this proposal is laudable, but the method is ill-conceived and if we really want to promote the e-economy of Europe, it would be good to give our e-commerce VAT rather than try to impose our problems to others.</seg>
<seg id=1775> If we are to meet the demand for reduced emissions of greenhouse gases, we must take all possible measures to restrict their production.</seg>
<seg id=1776> The only way for which no tax is not yet seen is that of supply in the European Community from third countries.</seg>
<seg id=1777> The positive discrimination in the area of air transport must be stopped.</seg>
<seg id=1778> Undertakings in third countries who are not members of the European Union are not subject to any taxation.</seg>
<seg id=1779> The CDs are not so archaic and they should be taxed, while the programmes which would move by the Internet would be dÃ©taxÃ©s!</seg>
<seg id=1780> However, the proposed solution can only be technically unworkable and hinder the development of on-line trading in the Union, precisely at a time when everyone wants, on the contrary, their expansion.</seg>
<seg id=1781> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the European Union are being eroded and lost in return.</seg>
<seg id=1782> We should be looking to encourage electronic commerce and not new ways of the tax.</seg>
<seg id=1783> The Liberals we say that we must state the least possible.</seg>
<seg id=1784> The Primarolo group has drawn up simple rules that must be applied.</seg>
<seg id=1785> The group that I represent in this House, an objection and think that we must balance the situation between the newspapers, which enjoys a reduced rate of VAT, and the daily newspapers, which do not.</seg>
<seg id=1786> A tax on kerosene cannot therefore be in the form of an international consensus, in order to ensure balanced competition.</seg>
<seg id=1787> I particularly welcome the fact that the report highlights one of the key points that I raised in my report to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, adopted by this Parliament a few months ago, namely that, given that it is certainly politically difficult to reach an international agreement on the taxation of aviation, at least in the short term, we should use alternative instruments to achieve the same effect, including a tax on emissions.</seg>
<seg id=1788> In fact, the industry is paying 100% of its costs of infrastructure through the air traffic control and airport charges, which cost 4 billion dollars in 1998 - unlike other modes of transport, such as rail transport or by road, which are still greatly subsidised.</seg>
<seg id=1789> The current situation is unfavourable.</seg>
<seg id=1790> In this regard, it is clear that there is a problem about emissions caused by air traffic, even if the percentage is not so high, it increases significantly and we cannot therefore underestimate it.</seg>
<seg id=1791> This system would be detrimental to SMEs within and outside the Union, particularly if we consider the proposed reduction of the exemption threshold at excessively low level of EUR 40 000 to annual turnover.</seg>
<seg id=1792> If we are too greedy as regards the matter under discussion, we are really endangering the future of electronic commerce, important for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1793> The principle that suppliers outside the Community and making the provision of services to customers within the Community must register that in one place should not lead to a shift of tax revenue between the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1794> Given that the discussion is not yet completed within the Council, and given that the Commission wishes to complete the dossier of VAT and electronic commerce relatively quickly, I think that the wisest course of action would not yet formally accept the amendments made by Parliament, but to try to produce the greatest possible number of these proposals in the Council negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=1795> I therefore cannot accept the proposed amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1796> Thank you very much for all the issues that you have dealt with this week.</seg>
<seg id=1797> Three months after the accident, the Commission, for its part, has assumed its responsibilities by adopting a first package of measures, that the European Parliament has fully approved on 30 November.</seg>
<seg id=1798> With more than fifteen directives or regulations in force, it is, in fact, urgent to standardise practices and to exert tighter control on the application of Community rules, in order to avoid possible differences, important and unacceptable, within the European Union in the field of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1799> Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her continuous commitment in the field of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1800> I would like to remind Members that, in terms of air safety, the compensation applied within the European framework and within the framework of North America does not amount to the amounts applied in other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1801> Secondly, I would say that it is the French courts which could deny or freezing the funds from one company to compensate some damage or other; it is the French courts which could establish responsibilities beyond those provided for under the criteria objectives of the current international regulations on pollution with hydrocarbons.</seg>
<seg id=1802> The Commission considers that such adjustments go in the direction of establishing a fairer tax system which also encourages a more rational and efficient use of the road network.</seg>
<seg id=1803> In view of the criticism, especially those in Ireland and France, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has given a new interpretation: it is now a tax for all users, including the British lorry drivers.</seg>
<seg id=1804> I am determined to ensure that the food consumers meets the highest standards, it comes from the inside or outside the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1805> Of course I understand the concern of the honourable Member.</seg>
<seg id=1806> I am sorry to tell you, Commissioner, that your reply does not suit me.</seg>
<seg id=1807> The honourable Member's remarks are important.</seg>
<seg id=1808> In Nigeria, the indigenous people All-Ijaw Chevron have been accused of inciting violence against them and to go so far as to pay Nigerian soldiers to draw on the demonstrators in the Warri naval base.</seg>
<seg id=1809> In its report adopted on 15 November, the Commission concluded that operating aid granted under Regulation 1540 / 98 did not solved the problem of prices by South Korea.</seg>
<seg id=1810> I believe that all the intentions is extremely reassuring, but, in the meantime, the fact is that our shipyards are closing their doors.</seg>
<seg id=1811> Question No 38 by (H-0868 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1812> I understand, Commissioner, that you do not want to change your decision in spite of the fact that ten Member States are opposed to such tariffs.</seg>
<seg id=1813> This initiative is based on a Council Regulation amending Regulation which defines the current GSP.</seg>
<seg id=1814> I represent some growers, and I am therefore very concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1815> We are working in committee, we have not taken this week, Commissioner Nielson is not present because of the shift in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg id=1816> We are currently working on the safeguard clause, and if Mr Clegg needs arguments, to talk with the beet growers, I have at his disposal.</seg>
<seg id=1817> I would like to thank Mr Liikanen for his reply, which is very positive and valuable in all respects.</seg>
<seg id=1818> I will discuss it with my services when the budgetary resources for next year will be defined.</seg>
<seg id=1819> At present, the efforts made by my services and I seek to limit the consequences of the distance between the parties and the future court.</seg>
<seg id=1820> Like specialized courts in patent law DÃŒsseldorf, Munich and other German cities, but also of London, a Community court responsible in the field of Community patents should be very specialised.</seg>
<seg id=1821> In order to prevent this provisional situation is having a definitive nature, the Commission, on 13 July last year, pointed out in a letter to the Member States concerned their obligation to indicate what their competent courts in the field of Community trademarks.</seg>
<seg id=1822> As the honourable Member knows, the tabling of a complaint would in itself has no influence on the progress of the project in question.</seg>
<seg id=1823> Question No 47 by (H-0877 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1824> This means that the Commission makes use of the legal means at its disposal in the course of the regulation.</seg>
<seg id=1825> The question is: who must address these students to understand that, when they are following this round of studies and concluded in the UK, they are entitled to have results.</seg>
<seg id=1826> The King, elected for a limited period, could, for example, be chosen among the most deserving Finnish MEPs.</seg>
<seg id=1827> This can also be seen as a matter of competition, since we can continue to practise duty-free sales in the southern part of the Baltic Sea, on the line between Stockholm and Helsinki, whereas they are banned on the line between UmeÃ¥ and Vasa.</seg>
<seg id=1828> We must rectify the situation in stimulating and encouraging the multilingual content, given that it is absolutely crucial to the success of European content.</seg>
<seg id=1829> The problem which concerns me most is that small businesses do not always have sufficient guarantees, nor of commercial records established to offer to investors.</seg>
<seg id=1830> To achieve the ambitious development of this European programme e-content, we must simplify and secure the procedures envisaged.</seg>
<seg id=1831> It is for this reason that the measures of public subsidies in favour of the content industry of the EU (usefulness has been demonstrated) must also move towards a culture and a high-level education and cultural diversity.</seg>
<seg id=1832> On the other hand, there is the communication networks which need constantly to fulfil their content virtual space and who see it as self-evident to submit the content of the capture and exploited without really production rules.</seg>
<seg id=1833> Mr President, I welcome the launch of this programme -content and would like to draw attention to two aspects.</seg>
<seg id=1834> That is why I support the amendments calling for the adoption of specific actions in the field of new technologies.</seg>
<seg id=1835> Firstly, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament stresses the social and cultural dimension of digital content.</seg>
<seg id=1836> Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise</seg>
<seg id=1837> I am grateful for the support that the Christian Democrats, and, moreover, also a part of the Liberal Group, have contributed to this amendment, to begin to restrict noise nuisance caused by aircraft.</seg>
<seg id=1838> Only this year, six years late, and under the insistent pressure of the French Government, that the Commission presented its proposal for harmonised noise indicators.</seg>
<seg id=1839> It is a moderate proposal. The Scandinavia has already stricter standards than those proposed for 2012.</seg>
<seg id=1840> Barcelona, Schiphol Orly and other already meet strict standards.</seg>
<seg id=1841> Another important point made by us and that will be of great importance in the context of the problem of noise caused by aircraft, relates to the need to provide additional noise indicators in addition to those mentioned by the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=1842> The lack of common standards in the European Union, we have seen situations of distortions of competition between airports and lack of equality between the citizens of the various Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1843> That is why I find the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange so important.</seg>
<seg id=1844> First of all, I must say that I welcome this report.</seg>
<seg id=1845> This was the idea of principle behind Amendment No 36, although I believe that this idea is not yet a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1846> We should investigate this carefully and adopt the combined approach in both areas, i.e. establish limit values for each source of emissions on the one hand and, on the other hand, define quality standards for these emissions.</seg>
<seg id=1847> We need more time, and I regret that we have not prepared, even if, in general, I support the framework directive.</seg>
<seg id=1848> As soon as the Member States have provided comparable data, the Commission will take into account the question of maximum values at Community level, as well as other measures to reduce the number of people affected by noise and to refer the matter to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1849> Food additives other than colours and sweeteners</seg>
<seg id=1850> These are the three criteria.</seg>
<seg id=1851> Thank you, Mr Rehder, I am in favour of your question, because if you have a carrot in my throat, I have a pig in my throat, as has been said here, but the flu is somewhat here.</seg>
<seg id=1852> Furthermore, in the event of chronic dietary problems, the risk of cancer is rising.</seg>
<seg id=1853> It is also clear that the Commission did not have the appropriate instruments to intervene properly.</seg>
<seg id=1854> Tomorrow, a new phase is included in the programme, and our colleague, Mrs Paulsen, of the Liberal Group, will then be on track and will take the opportunity to further improve the present directive.</seg>
<seg id=1855> The Member States and the Commission now have a better instrument for ensuring that Community law on animal feed is properly implemented and to ensure that, in the event of crisis situations arise in third countries, for quicker reactions are possible.</seg>
<seg id=1856> We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities and that up to now, it is mainly the cities that have been "Cinderella" in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1857> The process of planning must be implemented in a fair and innovative.</seg>
<seg id=1858> The multiannual programme 2000-2004 for sustainable development in urban areas is an appropriate instrument to achieve this, as well as the implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent tool for coordination and development actions.</seg>
<seg id=1859> The reduction of transport and the abandonment of fossil fuels at local level are necessary to bring about a change from the point of view of climate threats that we are experiencing today.</seg>
<seg id=1860> Many have suggested that this budget is too small.</seg>
<seg id=1861> It is expected that the main partners in this context are the Commission and the networks of local authorities whose legal responsibility is to develop and implement policies relating to sustainable development in urban areas.</seg>
<seg id=1862> The Court of Justice of the European Communities and even the bodies responsible for resolving disputes of the WTO consider that the precautionary principle is to apply environmental or in terms of public health, and sometimes even against Europeans, as is the case pending cheese from milk believed.</seg>
<seg id=1863> The aim must not be a restriction of prejudice or compensation, the primary aim must be to prevent any adverse effect on health or the assets of persons.</seg>
<seg id=1864> In 1996, the European Parliament decided in favour of a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle, if only we had listened to.</seg>
<seg id=1865> A complete scientific certainty on the new products or substances does not exist and will never be.</seg>
<seg id=1866> Finally, if the precautionary principle must be implemented in a credible and effective way, it is vital to involve all the key players, including the representatives of civil society, in the political choices surrounding its implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1867> Finally, health and the environment must take precedence over other considerations, particularly those of an economic nature.</seg>
<seg id=1868> An essential condition related for the application of the precautionary principle is that the concern about the possible harmful effects are backed up by a scientific basis.</seg>
<seg id=1869> Only yesterday, in Lisbon, an American, Professor George Carlo, who was given a study on the effect of the airwaves for human health by the Food and Drugs Administration, has revealed that the use of mobile phones could lead to the emergence of brain tumours, Alzheimer's disease and injuries skin.</seg>
<seg id=1870> Mr President, the environment and public health are entitled to a machine whose complexity is such that we need to monitor and control its multiple functions, in order to be able to intervene and avoid problems.</seg>
<seg id=1871> The application of this principle must be avoided at all costs to stifle innovation and economic activity, create the timidity and lack of industry, to become a means to divert competition.</seg>
<seg id=1872> The European Parliament has certainly noticed that the Commission agrees with most of the issues raised in the motion for a resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1873> The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=1874> Its Article 2 enshrines the right to life. And whenever in Spain terrorism kills a person, it is the whole of the European Union who are involved in what is one of its most important principles.</seg>
<seg id=1875> Our intention is not to replace the institutions legitimately, but to encourage them to protect our rights and our freedoms without making any concessions to terror.</seg>
<seg id=1876> VOTE</seg>
<seg id=1877> It has also made the observation of the Council on the classification of budget lines on the draft early retirement of the Commission and on the administrative expenditure of the fisheries agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1878> (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1879> I believe that this is no longer present!</seg>
<seg id=1880> These will think that the number of 23 428 is insufficient, but they are nonetheless satisfied with the area of growth which is offered to them.</seg>
<seg id=1881> This omission, which began in the middle of last year, caused as we feared a dramatic fall in the rate of adoption of projects and implementation of payments, so that the annual implementation authorisations for this fund was less than one per cent at the end of June 2000.</seg>
<seg id=1882> This text is a licence to close the General Secretariat of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id=1883> Before I leave, they said to me: 'It is Christmas, and we, in Bergamo, we are celebrating Christmas and St Lucia.</seg>
<seg id=1884> In particular, we are very critical of the overproduction of agricultural products and the use of means of information from the EU to sell this surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1885> Mr President, I voted in favour of the Garcia-Margallo y Marfil report, which deals with the taxation of services provided electronically.</seg>
<seg id=1886> Mr President, I will try, before 2004, to do something in Malta by making a statement in favour of it.</seg>
<seg id=1887> However, I say this with a certain solemnity: it is the best that I can accept a Europe, for me, too liberal!</seg>
<seg id=1888> The deadline would encourage the posts to develop and modernise their services and facilitate the planning and investment on the market.</seg>
<seg id=1889> They will continue to put pressure. The money they earn with the distribution beyond the limit of 150 grammes enables them to strengthen their position.</seg>
<seg id=1890> The liberalisation of postal services proposed by the Commission is neither appropriate nor consistent, and that is why I voted for the report and all the amendments which express the same direction.</seg>
<seg id=1891> Roo Report (A5-0378 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1892> We are not convinced of their compatibility with the WTO, we also have our reservations about Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31.</seg>
<seg id=1893> A globalisation, which disregards the most basic rights of the human person.</seg>
<seg id=1894> It would be contrary to respect for national identity (Article 6 (3) of the Treaty of the Union).</seg>
<seg id=1895> It must be stressed that the linguistic minorities, instead of being crushed by the globalization of the Internet, have found new openings cultural and economic.</seg>
<seg id=1896> Mr President, in the absence of other results, the haggling of Nice will shed light on the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1897> The tone of the joint resolution is, at this point of view, far too unilateral.</seg>
<seg id=1898> The delay in the publication of the written conclusions, which are not yet officially available at the moment, four days later - shows the difficulty of drawing up clear decisions taken in the confusion.</seg>
<seg id=1899> The only way to prevent future dangerous conflicts is to stick to the traditional concept whereby Europe is based on mutual respect for national communities.</seg>
<seg id=1900> The Nice Summit has concluded Sunday with an agreement which would result in a draft treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1901> The resolution on the Nice Summit, which has just been adopted, does not reflect.</seg>
<seg id=1902> Finally, I would like to make a reference to social policy, on which France insist at the presentation of its presidency, but which is ultimately a hand full of very little, despite the declarations of intent and the titles of documents the content very vague and clearly insufficient in relation to the existing problems and to the enormous dissatisfaction, including the demonstration of workers in Nice has been an important expression also.</seg>
<seg id=1903> Clearly, nothing has changed for the really important issues such as taxes, taxes, social policy, asylum and immigration.</seg>
<seg id=1904> The fact is, according to the debate on the Nice Treaty finally without the image of a father or mother, because there is nobody's son. The French Presidency has confused with apologies, rather than to assume clearly the results of the IGC and their reasons; the political groups, which correspond to the governments of the Member States, have increased their criticisms.</seg>
<seg id=1905> On the contrary, the power of national democracies is still more force to limit the right of veto and to give more power for the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1906> If we had been able to foresee these consequences at the conclusion of the Chicago Convention during the year I was born - 1944, no tax exemption for fuel and other equipment for aircraft would probably been agreed.</seg>
<seg id=1907> Zero risk does not exist, scientists or at least the politicians should apply the criterion of proportionality, assess the risks uncertain and assume their responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id=1908> This Parliament has also fought for this reduction in the funds available for innovative actions should be compensated for by the use of the framework of flexibility, defined in a statement on the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1909> Everyone has a role to play. Indeed, we are operating in a global market, it is undeniable, and these are the innovations that will enable Europe to retain its place among the major technological developments in new industries and, in particular, in information technology, assuming, of course, that they receive sufficient financial resources and support realistic and relevant.</seg>
<seg id=1910> During the previous speeches, a few words have been spoken seriously about the budget. EUR 400 million are really only a minimum for the financing and it will, in the second half of the year, take advantage of the opportunities for additional appropriations offered by the flexibility instrument, as the report notes.</seg>
<seg id=1911> In my opinion, it is automatically the loss of the European added value, in contrast to the conclusion of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1912> As we all know, in the European Union, unemployment is concentrated on the least-developed territories of the technological and economic point of view, especially the territories of Objective 1. It is therefore necessary that the innovative actions are not only a technical nature, but they are from an explicit desire to develop the economy and employment.</seg>
<seg id=1913> When I return in my home region, in the east of England, and I see that no local authority has not used the money it has received during the last period, I doubt that we have shown the effectiveness which we need in the future to accommodate the new communities.</seg>
<seg id=1914> Mr President, my first words are to express to Mr Markov of my thanks and my congratulations on the extremely competent and serious constructive presentation of the draft communication on the innovative actions of the ERDF for the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id=1915> Energy efficiency and aspects of environmental policy are not forgotten in these guidelines. They can give rise to innovative measures under the third issue, which relates to regional identity and sustainable development.</seg>
<seg id=1916> We wish, however, that the projects are selected at regional level, as well understood Mr Berend in his speech.</seg>
<seg id=1917> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1918> That is why we are asking for in this report and in the three additional amendments that the Commission multiplies the efforts to impose international procedure for settling disputes in the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1919> It seems to me that the Commissioner should demonstrate to the industry that it is doing everything in its power to respond to this external threat to it.</seg>
<seg id=1920> Finally, of course, we expect that, from the 18 December, in the meeting of the Group of 6 of the OECD, the "seagoing vessels" arrangement should be examined.</seg>
<seg id=1921> But it seems that the finishing line is always postponed, so that we will never reach.</seg>
<seg id=1922> As you all know, this procedure will take more than six months.</seg>
<seg id=1923> For the large corporations and their lawyers, politicians, claim less State only means that the state and its funding must be available to them exclusively.</seg>
<seg id=1924> But for that to happen, so that the process will enable us to consolidate the shipbuilding industry and employment and to reassure the families that depend on aid, we must continue beyond 31 December 2000 because, on the market, we are not on an equal footing, there is unfair competition and dumping practices.</seg>
<seg id=1925> Improving the competitiveness of EU shipyards is encouraged by the Commission, but in the face of mass dumping prices applied by Korea, improving conceivable productivity is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id=1926> It has also pointed out that the existence of this mechanism should not create distortions of competition within the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1927> The presence of nuclear submarine has a problem in the waters of the Bay of Algeciras has unfortunately turned into a diplomatic conflict between a military nuclear power colonial and a second-class Member State and, according to the latest classification of Nice, which does not assert its rights and bow to the childhood explanations.</seg>
<seg id=1928> When, via the medical part in the country of the newspaper owner - in other words, by means of the British press - we dÃ©couvrit that the disease was serious, instead of the change of heart, they changÃšrent the qualification of the centre.</seg>
<seg id=1929> We are of course awaiting with interest the response of the Commission to see whether the objective has been achieved.</seg>
<seg id=1930> Mr President, I too would like to start by expressing my condolences to the family of councillor murdered and the Members of the European People's Party, and reject the fascist barbarity of ETA and groups which protect him.</seg>
<seg id=1931> I also think it would be good if the submarine Tireless is taken in Britain to be repaired, as soon as possible, when appropriate climatic conditions allow.</seg>
<seg id=1932> The honourable Members have asked whether the Commission considers that Directive 89 / 618 / Euratom on informing the public about the health protection measures and on the behaviour in case of emergency radiological and Directive 96 / 29 / Euratom laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation were applied in the event of the submarine and what measures had been taken.</seg>
<seg id=1933> If it is best lawyer our advisers, I look forward to hearing from him, and I therefore come back to Article 37.</seg>
<seg id=1934> One aspect of the Euratom Treaty concerns the transport of radioactive waste from one Member State of the European Union to another, but, as Gibraltar is, of course, part of the United Kingdom, all shipments of waste will be part of the United Kingdom to another without involving another Member State of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1935> That is my opinion; it is simply a matter of winning the trust of the people living on the rock.</seg>
<seg id=1936> However, we see a Member State which treats the public opinion of another Member State as it would do with any State in the world, as if, basically, there were no affectio societatis fifty years after the start of the European company, as if European solidarity has not progressed.</seg>
<seg id=1937> It is a fact that, in a moment, the only submarine operating in British waters was a German submarine.</seg>
<seg id=1938> Here we debate but the citizens based on their knowledge and their sensitivity, moving their attention towards the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1939> It is clear that the reduction of investment in new military equipment linked to the restrictions of the military budget decided by the Labour Government will multiply, in the future, the case of withdrawal of military equipment for repair.</seg>
<seg id=1940> However, it does not, contrary to what some people would wish, the classification of ports that are likely to receive submarines broken down, or to the questions of technical safety of nuclear reactors and the conditions under which a submarine needs to be sent to repair in another place.</seg>
<seg id=1941> We need to help them further, call for the Community institutions to strengthen the human and material resources of the UNHCR.</seg>
<seg id=1942> I would ask the Commission to raise this aid to the UNHCR and also to appoint the latter as coordinating body in all its contracts with NGOs.</seg>
<seg id=1943> We must therefore be able to have access to civilian victims and its staff on the ground should be able to deploy safely and having the necessary resources to fulfil their mission.</seg>
<seg id=1944> On 22 November, the Commission adopted a communication on the establishment of a common asylum procedure and a uniform status on the granting of refugee status valid throughout the Union. It is towards this final objective, which is the aim of the common European asylum system established in Tampere.</seg>
<seg id=1945> I shall conclude by paying tribute to the work that Mrs Ogata has done for the UNHCR and in welcoming Mr Ruud Lubbers in his new post.</seg>
<seg id=1946> It is important to encourage a political amnesty in Yugoslavia for the restoration of democracy, but it also seems important to us to condemn undoubtedly the resumption of incursions and terrorist activities on the borders between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo because they alarmingly reminiscent of what happened during the Kosovo conflict, where the Western powers have had some responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=1947> Our compromise resolution is clear in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.</seg>
<seg id=1948> I would also appeal to President KostunÃ­ca to explain what happened to people like Mr mention Ukshin Hoti, whose fate, that we have no idea, is of great interest to us.</seg>
<seg id=1949> I also agree with the appeal to KFOR troops in order to prevent any further attempt to violence in the Presevo Valley.</seg>
<seg id=1950> I welcome the measures taken now by KFOR to deal with the problem and I continue to call on all parties to moderation.</seg>
<seg id=1951> B5-0916 / 2000 by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1952> This clause has been agreed at the Moneda palace in March 1990, and I know because I have had the privilege to be present when taking possession of President Alwyn, after the referendum which brought an end to the regime of General Pinochet.</seg>
<seg id=1953> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak on the joint resolution that obviously we shall vote.</seg>
<seg id=1954> It is vital that the international community should exercise its right to democratic scrutiny, not as interference in the internal affairs of an independent country, but as a political procedure, cautious and preventive action.</seg>
<seg id=1955> The situation in the prisons and in police stations is totally unacceptable, particularly because of ill-treatment and torture are very widespread.</seg>
<seg id=1956> Such treatment would be exactly similar to that we see in Western Europe and Minister Hikmet Sami Turk, faced with these protests, has postponed the transfer, so that social and political consensus on the reform of the prisons develops throughout Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1957> It is urgent and that is why we have decided to put this item on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1958> It is on trial on 8 January. He is accused of having participated in a meeting of Tunisian opponents in France, which incidentally it excludes.</seg>
<seg id=1959> When activists and leaders of these associations want to meet the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, their homes are surrounded by the police and those who go there are being attacked in the street by men.</seg>
<seg id=1960> The second problem is basically only one example of many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id=1961> My group, like this Parliament, is particularly sensitive to the human rights situation in Tunisia and in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1962> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us keep some measure please.</seg>
<seg id=1963> The negotiations are extremely smoothly, I am delighted that we have made great progress in these negotiations, which I hope will lead to the conclusion to which the honourable Member referred.</seg>
<seg id=1964> Several Members have mentioned the situation of the prisoners in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1965> B5-0912 / 2000 by Mr Van Hecke on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1966> We cannot be, I believe, Mr President, Commissioner, back on this.</seg>
<seg id=1967> The military has seized power in this context, which, as always, has only worsened the situation.</seg>
<seg id=1968> This attitude is in line with the policy of French imperialism.</seg>
<seg id=1969> The Commission is also very concerned about the recent outbreaks of violence.</seg>
<seg id=1970> The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1971> This is unfair competition can contribute to downgrade the quality of the working environment in the shipbuilding sector, to reduce technical knowledge and to create a loss of jobs and lead, in the longer term, a monopoly situation, which would be damaging to world trade.</seg>
<seg id=1972> Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg id=1973> That is why I would like to thank all my colleagues for the contribution they have made, particularly at the stage of the amendments, as well as the technicians of the committee which help to enabled us to finalise this resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1974> The adoption of the Social Agenda by the Nice European Council strongly satisfies us and we hope that the Member States will take this opportunity to promote the development and the coordination of social security systems and care for the elderly and also promote other measures which will ensure the reintegration into working life, such as lifelong learning for life.</seg>
<seg id=1975> The promotion of lifelong learning for life - an issue which has already been addressed by another speaker - is an issue that I also support.</seg>
<seg id=1976> Of course, the people of more than 60 or 70 years can still do many useful things, but it is not normal to depend on their income of the work they provide.</seg>
<seg id=1977> In its monthly report of July 2000, the European Central Bank has already launched several urgent warnings about this.</seg>
<seg id=1978> For my part, I believe that the Member States are better able to solve this problem by means of their legislative instruments.</seg>
<seg id=1979> With its proposals to an active life in the old age, the company wins a whole generation.</seg>
<seg id=1980> The promises relating to pensions must be honoured, pensions, though, must be guaranteed by the funds of these countries without payment at the expense of the common monetary policy of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1981> We have experienced a most important social revolution 100 to during the last 150 years, when our life expectancy has doubled.</seg>
<seg id=1982> It only makes sense to extend the mathematical of life that has enabled medical progress.</seg>
<seg id=1983> They have been subsidised - the whole of society has therefore taken part - of older employees have left their jobs but no young worker has been committed and a lot of jobs have been lost.</seg>
<seg id=1984> The family policy and taxation should instead ensure that women and men who have family obligations to decide freely to have a professional activity or not.</seg>
<seg id=1985> My brother and I have joined there.</seg>
<seg id=1986> The next steps in the field of public health are addressed to questions of health and care for the elderly and the promotion of a healthy old age.</seg>
<seg id=1987> Mr President, I have accepted the amendment tabled by Mr Pronk, on 2 that 3, which requests that the text should be changed and insists on the concept of demographic development, rather than ageing of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1988> It does not duplicate the promotional advertising or operations of operators or with the public authorities.</seg>
<seg id=1989> Mr President, the Committee on Budgets was also of the opinion that it is, in principle, in favour of the Commission's proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1990> That is why it is very important to reach a balance that can be achieved through measures to promote sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id=1991> I think that with regard to marketing and sales, learning as a framework for life should be placed at the centre of educational programmes because precisely the new technologies, the management of research to find a completely new offer opportunities to a modern logistics.</seg>
<seg id=1992> First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Dary on his excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=1993> The next item is the debate on the export and intervention.</seg>
<seg id=1994> There must be no special premiums and advertising for products which are not requested.</seg>
<seg id=1995> Everyone has enough to eat, and therefore if we make the promotion of a product that militera clearly against the consumption of another product.</seg>
<seg id=1996> Proposed Amendments Nos 18 and 24, first part, by which time during which the issues and products to be proposed will be assessed, are reduced from three to two years in order to improve the effectiveness of the instrument for promotion.</seg>
<seg id=1997> In the Greek translation, Mrs Haug is presented as rapporteur Juta male, implying a man, and Mr Marcuse Ferler as rapporteur for the woman, implying a woman.</seg>
<seg id=1998> This is a good example of how small changes in practice can have a considerable effect.</seg>
<seg id=1999> It is time the last Friday in Strasbourg, in other words, Strasbourg loses 12 days of the presence of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=2000> Furthermore, I would like to wish you all, and in particular the few who have taken the trouble to attend this Friday at the last sitting of the year 2000 in Strasbourg, an enjoyable festive season and a new century which is good, but above all wise.</seg>
