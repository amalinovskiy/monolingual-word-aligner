Our declaration of rights is the first way this millennium.
Let us to organise ourselves Fifteen to welcome in good conditions to the countries knocking at our door.
The area of public services of social interest, cultural and charitable must be included in Article 87, so that these important institutions can benefit from a sustainable protection.
Some are of the opinion that it is possible to create an internal market in Europe without agree on values and fundamental principles.
I want, in my turn, to welcome the substantial and strong intervention of President Prodi.
You know that this is a deliberate choice that has been done in Amsterdam, to distinguish two functions. High Representative, unlike the Commission, does not express independently, but it has to coordinate the foreign policies and common security which are the responsibility of the Member States and here we must leave a large place perhaps to the intergovernmental.
It was hoped that the Presidency trace in Nice the way for the future.
We can indeed wish more and better, but I quite honestly believe that it is a good start.
I therefore hope that the Nice European Council will endorsing this project and decide to start specifically as a project and not as a fait accompli, after having clearly adopted the necessary reforms.
I have, however, also clearly stated that in the current situation, we could achieve very important objectives through the Community route, for example as a more effective action in the Balkans.
It is only by linking Russia to the West and to the European Union that we can have an influence on its policy and maintain contact and dialogue with it.
Motion for a resolution (B5-0767/00) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
At the moment, it pursues this genocide and also trying to destroy the freedom of the press and the rule of law which exist barely in that country.
In order to try to meet the expectations of that pensioner, which is called, Mr Giuseppe Italia, live in Cremona and would like sailing in Padania, I voted in favour of the Piecyk report on the development of sea ports, inland ports and intermodal nodes.
The result of the vote in this House forbidden to achieve the objective of the directive, even though it is accepted and approved by all of the speakers and the Commission.
Mr President, I voted for the Skinner report, as I said during the debate, before the vote, because I believe that venture capital is important.
My party colleague Armonie Bordes has emphasised yesterday in harsh terms that only a minority benefits from the commitment of Community funds and contributions to the cash pensions for the entrepreneurial risk.
As a result, the Charter will serve to devote the current practices, including backward-looking, of the national states to represent progress.
Mr President, we have finally a Charter of the rights of European citizens a whole article, Article 25, is dedicated to older people.
This text may seem painless first, since it takes up for the bulk of the existing rights, if it was incorporated into the Treaty with binding force, as the European Parliament demands, it would tend mechanically, with time, the standardisation of national rights in Europe; it devote a disproportionate power to the Court of Justice; it would stimulate increased centralisation around the European institutions; it would limit the scope for independent decisions of each people.
· A situation must be prevented of overloading the Charter with detailed regulations and leave them to the secondary law.
I would go vote for a different charter participating in the demonstrations in Biarritz, 13 and 14 October, and Nice, on 7 December 2000.
Progress of the 12 candidate countries
I think that a number of Member States have not yet grasped the existence of this link to date and have not understood that a hesitant progress of the Intergovernmental Conference could ask enormous difficulties in order to impose enlargement in the necessary deadlines.
We cannot impose, eventually, all I mentioned earlier so far that if the political world and the elites in the candidate countries and the European Union - and, in this respect precise, I agree with you, Commissioner - are finally to know that the enlargement of the European Union benefits it.
That is the formula devoted.
Let me turn to the second direction whereby the Presidency wishes to develop over the last six months the enlargement process.
What I propose, therefore, is to work in this direction with the idea that we will have to examine, within the perspective of 2003, what are the candidates who are ready to join us to this date.
I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, for his clear and comprehensive report.
The purpose of the negotiations is in no case the 'if': it is a question of 'how' and the 'when'.
But they have also made because the prospect of accession to the European Union hope the solidarity of the European peoples, and that it offers them a political and economic anchor binding solid.
A number of countries have so well advanced in relation to the second economic criterion - competitiveness on the internal market - that they are looming to accession.
We are therefore seeking the most close coordination with the programmes of the national governments, Parliament and the other institutions.
Every year, and we will soon be again - on 8 November - all the candidate countries are waiting impatiently for the judgement that the Commission make a statement on their progress.
We have rightly chosen for the principle of differentiation, according to which each candidate country is assessed on the basis of its own merits.
This debate is a further opportunity for my group to confirm that the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe - but also of Cyprus and Malta - is the best guarantee of future for all of us in Europe, in the East as in the West.
The task, which is nevertheless capital, has not yet aroused great interest on the part of the public.
The people plaisantent on enlargement which, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, must always intervene in only five years.
The next opportunity natural, it will be the 2009 European elections, but we want to make efforts to a maximum of countries can join from 2004.
In addition, six other basic issues are of concern to us because of the method followed.
In fact, it is the same model of European construction in which we engouffrés, I would like to say the simultaneous integration of all sectors of activity whatever the traditions or the peculiarities of some, which is turning again trap.
The expression of the almost general sentiment in Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the 1980s commits us all until today.
However, things are clear: there can be no accession on the cheap.
There is a powerful idea, which is also a fine idea: namely that we will not be the enlargements against the opinions and that the best way, indeed, to make the enlargements with the opinions is through their participation in elections, since the elections are an expression of democracy and the method of accession of the citizens in the political system.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like briefly to speak about the conditions making possible the scenario that wanted several speakers.
You should not forget that these people represent interests.
Nevertheless, I have already indicated that all the countries approaching relatively quickly.
This means that there has already decided the liberalisation of trade in the area of agricultural products without fear that the Poles only that the collapse of their agriculture.
Tensions are produced, but on the whole, peace and trade between the citizens have established closer relations, which are still strengthened by monetary union.
This must be the outcome of the negotiations that count.
The only amendment which has been tabled for the moment is already covered by this report, but I am delighted that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wants stress the need for equal treatment for all citizens.
This involves not only a law in the field of public service, but also to open up the possibility of appropriate remuneration for young officials.
This applies just as much to Latvia that the European Union.
The link the litas of the euro is planned in the second half of 2001.
Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am the rapporteur, is the largest and most important, but, as we know, also the most problematic countries which are preparing to join the European Union, and tell the truth, it raises many problems that intends to raise votes requesting exclusion from the first group, that of the countries which will be joining us the first.
We have done too unkept promises to Poland, to the east, the post-Communist countries.
There remains a point which has returned regularly when it is a matter of the Czech Republic, but the problem of the Roma.
Slovakia is not doomed to remain in the second group, and it is logical that it wants to join the Union at the same time as the Czech Republic.
Finally, I would like to allow me a final comment on the domestic policy.
Thirdly, and in the case of agriculture, the level of productivity remains lower than that of the European Union, it must be totally open up the agricultural markets to capital necessary for the privatisation of land, the modernisation of farms and downstream structures, as well as the improvement of yields.
Bulgaria is hurry to join the European Union and NATO.
In the chapter of extreme poverty, a problem that affects Romania since 1990 - we finally note real signs of economic progress under the current government.
I hope that these matters become a priority for the new parliament that will apply in 15 days and the new government.
But we also stress that the definitive solution, fair and lasting must fully respect both the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, which is nothing other than international law in force, and the principles governing the European Union.
Malta has also functional and stable democratic institutions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we want to make our contribution to this debate.
We must apply the European Community law is not just a collection of laws: it must also be a law applied in the candidate countries.
This change poses difficult challenges to the citizens of the candidate countries but also ensures, at the same time, their future and that of their children.
I agree with the previous speaker: we need to pay special attention to the border regions.
In this respect, the Commission must not be left to account!
The candidate countries want to be quickly on the path to economic growth, even if it must be done to the detriment of the policy of protection of nature previously defined.
In both sides, we nurture bad habits, most of them linked to health.
Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a European continent strong and united.
The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, also competent in the field of transport and trans-European networks, are aware that it is necessary to coordinate the different Community sectoral policies in favour of a comprehensive policy of regional development.
However, I must stress the fact that the transport infrastructure are of the utmost importance to the success of enlargement.
Mr President, I associate myself with you, when you say that the forthcoming enlargement is the main task of the EU.
The social values traditional own the former planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe have been severely weakened.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats does not wish to unload the applicant countries of the responsibility of the pace of progress of the accession process: we cannot announce no date.
The second point is the designation of dates.
There is another reason.
Thirdly: the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the various countries and for the EU as a whole depend - the example of Denmark is here to show this - largely to the elimination of social and democratic deficits in European policy.
The populism is the shameful epithet that technocrats give the popular will when it is expressed in a direction which do not think them.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is now the break and dinner! We shall resume at 9 p.m.
We will, even if it is realise longer term, a currency for the whole continent.
These thematic cause internal battles in each of the countries.
We call to fight for a different Europe, that of all the peoples, rid of all these inhuman characteristics, where the peoples will be masters of their fate, develop them relations of peace, freedom, fraternity, mutually beneficial cooperation.
I am publicly the praise for their work and, in particular, the work carried out by Romanian Appeal Challenge, based in Birmingham, as well as the work of other organisations Irish supported by a number of people whose Daniel O Donnel, the Irish artist, which has promised 1 million pounds he has collected in Ireland and other parts of the world.
The Nizza Summit must, above all, clear whether and how the EU, for its part, can be ready in time for this enlargement.
The Poles wonder if they benefit yet when they join or whether they will become a country second category.
Nevertheless, I am convinced that, with the good will and with the help of the European Union, a solution will be found which will enable the two communities to live harmoniously and prosper, as they have done for centuries.
We are also concerned about the problem of minorities because the issue of the integration of these minorities, including their linguistic integration, is also important in these countries.
The condition in order to be able to become a Member State of the Union is basically to fulfil the basic criteria, Copenhagen criteria.
The benefits of enlargement have been mentioned, and that is one of the issues on which Lithuania can teach us something.
Imagine that they are all like this.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs, but I would particularly like to confine me to Slovakia, and especially the policy towards minorities.
I therefore invite you at the forthcoming summit in Nizza to set a cut-off date to which you plan to conclude the negotiations with the most advanced candidate country on the path to accession, without naming names.
The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its efforts to join the European Union and, of course, ensure that the planning of this aid is even more decentralised.
The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of civil society, the government and the Parliament plays an important role in this respect and, as we are seeing - positive.
We are in the process of finish the division of Europe into two blocs and not to create a new division.
All of these elements are included in the report by Mrs Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne that I would like to thank in the name of our group.
In this respect, I believe that the Cyprus question is, by excellence, on which will be judged Europe's ability to see his political physiognomy.
I myself live close to the Baltic Sea, this sea, which is a problem for all of us environmentally friendly.
The political vision remains.
Thus, it has been very nice to hear that Mr Hänsch, who has given its opinion on behalf of the PSE Group, hoped that the Commission should undertake a proper assessment of the impact of enlargement, as well as economic repercussions in cases where enlargement would not be taking place.
Nevertheless, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, according to which the setting of transitional periods is essential in the interests of both parties, and as a MEP from a border region and, as Mrs Schierhuber - owner of a firm situated near the Czech border, I would particularly like to the creation of common economic areas close can be controlled without major problems and brings positive results from both sides.
As a Social Democrat, I would like to emphasise three points.
The EEA which includes matters of the first pillar on the one hand gives businesses in the candidate countries access to the internal market and young people and scientists the right to participate in the exchange programmes, but, on the other hand, does not yet obliges the EU to extend its system of support for agriculture to these countries.
Secondly, we must say 'no' to the concept bang who would like to see the same time admit a large group of countries, because that would be in contradiction with the principle of the admission of each country according to its merits.
Thirdly, we must do everything we can to ensure, by 2003, to prepare the European Union in the enlargement process in the direction of wonderful speech by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.
In this regard, I would like to address the relationship between Parliament and the Council by highlighting the fact that there are enormous delays with regard to the answers to written questions.
It is worrying to see that such facts occur in a country which will enter the European Union.
I therefore request that the matter be referred to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to prepare this.
Mr President, we are going to debate today, and perhaps vote on three reports to the total dealing with this subject, including two of my responsibility.
All players in the food production chain should gain.
The safety will cost money to all the players in the food production chain.
We must therefore follow Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and to adopt the principle of not dilution to secure animal feed and genuinely protect European consumers.
The 1999 directive has been well thought-out and it can already be proud of a success because taxes have been diminished sensitively.
However, purely and simply allow the dilution is not a solution.
Very quickly, we must insist on Amendment No 37 on dioxin.
On this point we are in agreement.
Thus, it will lead that we, European consumers, we shall continue to buy on the world market in meat and milk and derivatives of these products from an animal feed which has no link with the minimum and maximum limits set by the European Union and by a system for the production of feedingstuffs who buy raw materials on the international markets, free to mix any principle and composed, before introducing their products on the territory of the European Union.
We need to be able to have, for the second reading, in the view of the Commission on how to proceed with the assessment of the risk.
On the other hand, it would be inappropriate, for example, to adopt Amendments Nos 39 and 40, because this would be tantamount to remove the possibility for Member States to intervene promptly against the dangers that should come to detect.
The protection of consumers starts from feed, components of feedingstuffs, of the declaration and, finally, official controls.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our colleague Mrs Paulsen relating to undesirable products in animal feed is an important issue and, like all the important issues, it is highly controversial.
Mr President, the debate on this excellent report by Mrs Paulsen has been, on certain points, charged with very emotional on the plan, and now that this debate is closed, I believe that we must assume that the requirements in the animal feed sector are certainly strict, but that we can then ensure that quality is evolving by mixtures.
Taken in isolation and jointly, these three proposals are designed to fill the considerable shortcomings which have been highlighted by the dioxin crisis.
Amendment No 33 removes the possibility of re-exporting the batch not conform to the country of origin.
I cannot accept Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44 which seek to restore the possibility of watering down, under certain conditions, raw materials intended to the manufacture of feedingstuffs which are infected.
They should be sufficient, given the commitment we made to establish, within the framework of the new proposal on the food authority, a rapid alert system covering all foodstuffs and in the chain.
Commissioner Byrne, behind this directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs, hides, basically, a problem that we know for a long time, namely the issue of the open declaration.
And only, I have already learned something.
Because if we put quickly this measure out and if we start quickly the codecision procedure, it certainly would be an appreciable gain and I am convinced that, faced with the Council, we shall strong and united.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there may be in the future, raw materials contaminated too can enter into animal feed - in any case, this is not excluded.
The BSE scandal is the worst example known.
The good sense - our rapporteur said - is obviously a label to open declaration, which gives the list of ingredients.
I believe that the technical skills, as well as the judgement of the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are no doubt in agricultural matters and animal feed, in order to reach a solution geared towards the practical and enforceable, which must be applied and understood by the farmers and consumers.
So much for the positive points.
It is, in my opinion, a legitimate right to information that we need to meet.
Madam President, I would ask you, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and in my own name, to send a message of condolence on the part of Parliament to the families of the victims and the local authorities of Brittany as Marín, city of Galicia, where originating from most of the victims.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Are there any Members opposed to the tabling of this oral amendment?
That is as the rapporteur has explained to us things.
Most of its technical proposals deserve to be supported hard, for example on food safety, the dismantling of nuclear power stations in the first generation, the protection of the environment, the fight against social dumping, the essential code of conduct for companies in the West when they work in the East, etc. is a huge task, and also absolute priority.
At the same time, the difficulties to be overcome are still considerable, especially in budgetary terms.
Enlargement to thirteen countries not only change the geopolitical framework of the European Union, but it is also changing the structure, because both the total population will increase + (28%), but also the number of 'less-favoured regions'.
In this respect, we must take account of the fact that in the candidate countries, an agricultural and food sector competitive will be of decisive importance for the success of the process of transformation and restructuring, because of its economic and social burden high.
In this capacity, I would like to see the outermost regions, including 6 out of seven still feature among the 10 the poorest in the EU, benefit from the Structural Funds, no longer on the sole criterion of GDP, but also on geographic and demographic indicators, mainly social.
Because we reject in the interests of the French, we cannot, in conscience, approve its enlargement to include the countries and peoples of the East, barely freed from communist dictatorship and who cannot know yet how technocratic and totalitarian trap they want to get in.
We should have confined to a short resolution but dense in relation to the reports relating to the countries.
The current system, consisting of aid, subsidies and quotas, must be replaced by free trade and the adaptation to the market.
The importance and the magnitude of the problems that enlargement raises are not compatible with the double language used on them within the European Union.
For me, talk about enlargement does not mean penalising membership or not of some countries to Europe.
Our neighbour endeavoured resolutely during the last decade to fulfil the criteria for membership.
Latvia has its place in this House, not only because, overall, its progress to give it right to the credit 'trust essential to carry out such an negotiation, but above all, and above all, because it is at home in Europe.
I believe that, among the countries which have applied for membership, Poland is the state which deserves our support, our commitment, since, without the very important initiatives of Poland, the fall of communism would not taken place, and we would not be here today talking about this problem.
This may not be so obvious to the Polish people, which remains largely euro-sceptique.
I call on Prague to seize this sign, this invitation, this request for dialogue, to follow them up and to ensure that, together with this House, these relics of a nationalist era can be abandoned.
- I welcome the Wiersma report on Slovakia 's application for membership of the European Union, and I share most of the conclusions which the rapporteur draws.
On this occasion, I have great pleasure to send a special salvation for the elderly and pensioners of the Bulgarian Republic.
I therefore see no reason for Romania will not be recognised in the European Union, if it continues to move forward at the same pace and once the Union will have proceeded the necessary adjustments of its institutional structure and its policies to cope with enlargement.
Whatever solution is on the settlers, and God knows if the problem is difficult, such as the return of land on both sides, what the report says is too harsh in order not to earn a reserve.
Unfortunately, some of the comments of the draft report on the request for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, established by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, are not a great help in this respect.
This task will not be easy, given the lack of good will on the part of the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey.
Stenzel report (A5-0243/2000)
Woe, I was indeed victim of food poisoning, even if it were slight, in the European Parliament, unfortunately.
For all of these reasons, I voted in favour of the prohibition of the dilution proposed by the European Commission.
We must, in this resolution, urge the ASEM countries to pressure on the Burmese military regime in order to restore democracy in the country.
We appear one-sided in our approach and our way of doing.
This is not the time to be hesitant.
I would like to mention a number of important points in the directive.
Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU.
That is why we need legislation against discrimination.
We are here and now with a large number of legal technical amendments designed to guarantee a degree of equal protection against discrimination on the grounds of race, on the one hand, and discrimination on the grounds of religion, disability, age and sexual orientation on the other.
It was necessary to make an effort of balance, moderation and good legal technique and his report reflects - in my opinion - all of these qualities.
In addition, they are of the opinion that the cases of discrimination are not enough of them to justify a directive.
The action programme under discussion does not provide for sufficient resources to replace the relevant work of the Fifth Framework Programme - work which, I hope, the continuation will be guaranteed in the other Framework Programmes - and we must therefore take care to their complementarity.
Everyone agrees that there is a need to combat discrimination, but opinions differ when it is a question of how, how and with what means.
I had the opportunity, in committee, to speak out against the fact that the experts can also be outside the NGOs and nonetheless have something to say.
We are also very satisfied with the provision of the directive specifying that equal treatment for disabled people also means that companies are supposed carry out adjustments in the workplace.
This is the only way that we will manage to fight effectively against discrimination in all areas of corporate social life in Europe.
After all, as we teach the great democracies Saxon, racism and discrimination are fighting by the liberal democracy, and not by the restriction and the gradual erosion of the economic freedoms, opinion, expression and association.
For example, we have a proposal which homosexuality amounts to the rank of sacrement marriage.
We are thus strengthening the European Union's positions on specific situations experienced by its nationals on discrimination and equal treatment.
I should also like to come back to the issue of religious derogation.
My attention has been drawn to the potential interpretation of the explanatory statement with regard to Article 1, which once again may seem a little obscure, if not the distinction between sexual orientation and behaviour.
As what discrimination hiérarchisent.
In New Caledonia we give a preference on the basis of the chromatique skin.
These guidelines of the directive, added to the fact that, recently, has been adopted by the directive 2000, demonstrate the obvious desire of the European Union to secure an open society, rid of predetermined categories and, above all, the scourge of racism which has deep roots in European history.
Those who come here say that Europe must not adopt directive setting out the values which we all want to defend are wrong.
Do not touch these achievements hard won.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the media must also play an important role in this task.
Experience has shown us that the promotion of legislative measures to combat discrimination is essential, but that it is not enough.
We must avoid confusion paperassières, which will reduce Europe to a purely materialistic entity, politically correct but unnecessary.
I think that this Parliament has instructed the legislation too heavily, when all is said and done 'reluctant', that the European Commission had wanted to propose.
I would like to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs, gentlemen Mann and Cashman, for their quite remarkable texts.
I also accept the amendments you have presented in order to highlight the importance of the prevention of discrimination and to fight against them.
The second category aims to clarify the text of the proposal of the Commission and the third is a significant number of the amendments whose aim is to try to put this proposal in tune with the directive on discrimination on the grounds of race adopted in June this year.
In particular, Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 propose to delete the reference to discrimination based on racial and ethnic origin.
I cannot accept that you the references made in Amendments Nos 21 and 45, to natural and legal persons and the unofficial groupings, because this proposal on employment only applies to individuals.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
You cannot expect public support for peacekeeping operations if your troops are threatened with death by weapons that we ourselves provided.
For example, in my country, it would take a licence to possess a gun of hunting, but not to install me as broker at the back of my garden.
Another important point: the export ban, to promote and marketing of equipment and knowledge used for the practice of torture.
Having said that, I would of course like to congratulate the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Titley, for his excellent report.
We must extend our considerations, on the one hand, to issues of coercion, but also to the ways other than those intended for military use itself: the disarmament, the conversion, the strengthening of the action of the customs authorities and the police and, on the other hand, the candidate countries that Mr Wiersma has just mentioned.
The monitoring of the financial circuit always makes it more difficult for the circumvention of regulations on trade in arms.
The annual report aims to identify such potential improvements.
The European Union is currently considering for the project beyond its expiry date, which will take place in November of this year.
A methodology and indicators have been defined and will be presented at the next Research Council.
Thank you, Commissioner.
With regard to the problems of the SMEs, we have of course ensured that, in the framework programme, the SMEs have their part, as provided for in the budget decision.
That, at any rate, is what emerges from the discussion of the budget in Greece and we should point out that those who highlights the points of view of the European Union are many. Is this true?
As regards the multidisciplinarity, I share your feeling.
The first is the participation of the EU to the national programmes, that it has specifically mentioned in his statement.
You cannot therefore speak of European research area, if we are, that of 5% of this research.
Thank you very much, Mr Busquin.
On the one hand, in the wake of the efforts made to fully commit the appropriations to the end of 1999, applications pending at the beginning of this year for the funding of new projects were very reduced.
But I would repeat that things have been made by Portugal for the previous period.
Question No 2 by (H-0730/00):
Finally, setting excise duty on mineral oils at a high level does not non-compliance with the Community regulations on competition.
Secondly, as Mr MacCormick knows, when the Member States promote an industrial sector given by fiscal measures, they break the regulations on state aid, in this case the tax state aid equivalent to subsidies.
Nuclear energy, for example, is a very clear example.
Subject: budgetary Line 'minority languages' of the European Union budget appropriations for minority languages which exist since 1983, have ceased to increase until 1995, the year in which they have been the highest (EUR 4 million).
Mr President, our colleagues in the House will certainly know that very significant resources are affected, in the Structural Funds - and this is new - the cultural activities, because with my colleague, Michel Barnier, we have given the importance to the fact that the Structural Funds invest not only in the roads or airports but also in human beings.
The Commission therefore does not formulate new financial commitments next year.
With regard to the specific proposals for financing, it is impossible for me to take here position, because we must respect the normal procedure.
I thought of several possibilities.
It must therefore something to be done in this area, because it is a question of millions of small and medium-sized enterprises in the whole of Europe.
Its regulation couvre-t-elle requirements in terms of hunting, for example in the impetus, as well as the handling of the meat destined to personal consumption?
If we had to apply this regulation to meat that consumes oneself, it would be for hunters outbursts of a bureaucratic disaster.
I intend after the conclusion of this report, to present proposals to improve the transport of animals and to address the problem of the application of inadequate restrictions on journey times.
We have already discussed this issue in my meeting with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
Our question was clear: what are the measures taken by the Commission?
The general product safety also obliges producers to inform consumers of the risks.
The case of Maryam Ayubi is extremely worrying.
Question No 14 by (H-0745/00):
The attitude of the EU vis-à-vis this ministerial meeting of Vientiane, and even the question of its presence or the level to which the EU should be represented, will depend on the development of the situation in Burma here in December.
One last point.
The elections are an important step in the participation of the Kosovars in the management of their own communities.
I can tell you that the conduct of the elections was more democratic, more organised that some of our own countries which I found myself, either as a participant, either as an observer.
But we considered it was a beginning and in any case of the outcome of the process.
It argues for a more effective control of the arms trade and for greater transparency.
I now see that the number of contracts on arms and their components not increasing each year.
We cannot take concrete decisions on the basis of fictitious information, fictitious realities.
The arrangement which was to maintain together in the same DG should be reconsidered.
If these institutions must have the opportunity to appoint an internal auditor, it will perhaps be enough to impose minimum requirements in terms of the audit in the financial controller.
The Commissioner will not ignores, this proposal is not unanimity in this Parliament.
We have nothing to object to an independent internal audit service, which we are currently giving the green light through the report by our colleague Mr van Hulten.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by expressing my congratulations to the rapporteur.
We are of the opinion that the modernization of the administration is necessary and urgent.
An independent contre-vérification is essential in order to avoid the mistakes.
Money must be spent in a way that is better focused and more effective in the future, we must naturally be better able to ensure that the funds are actually spent for the purposes for which they were affected by the competent authorities in budgetary matters.
As regards the amendments, I would like to briefly make the following point: the Commission approves this additional recital.
I therefore thank you for your proposals and your deliberations.
I would like to summarise the proposals in this report which seem to me to be the most important and specifically operational, so the creation of a group of experts, composed of personalities appointed by the Member States, which must contribute to define the minimum parameters of protection of minors in the media; secondly, the creation of a code of self-regulation by all operators in the sector; thirdly, the possibility of encouraging and making them accessible to filter devices by both the television via the Internet.
Unfortunately, I cannot approve the requirements of the Liberals.
This mainly falls within the legislative competence of the Member States and must remain such as this, which, however, does not preclude a consultation for research of consensus on certain reference values through dialogue with all parties at European level.
It is also true that it is the responsibility, in my view, parents to ensure that their children do not look this kind of programmes.
Parents have a particular need they provides assistance in this area, which must include: the specific parameters for the protection of minors in the field of the media which are applied in the area of the European Union as a whole, the implementation and the willingness to affordable prices of filtering systems, legal provisions relating to the protection of minors and the commitment of the responsibility of the media, that is, broadcasting companies and companies producing programmes that they are public or private.
So when I hear in the debates in committee, some say that nothing demonstrates the harmful influence that can have violence in all its forms, to the TV, on children, I am surprised and I use a euphemism.
As regards the introduction of a code of self-regulation, it is noted, particularly on the technical level, that in some Member States broadcasters have already introduced codes of settling for television, which must enable parents to cut the course.
The debate is closed.
In particular, my report replaces the valid international generalisation by giving the decisions to the Member States.
This would be a minimum for us to make this area of freedom, which is a fundamental right of every European citizen.
Some payments due in 1996, Mr President, have still not been made.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Evans and Mantovani for their work.
I commend this report to the House and the amendments tabled by Mr Evans.
Our human resources represent our unique future in a world where knowledge is the most precious.
It is not with Green Papers, white, black or red solve the problems, but with specific actions.
But Parliament, and it is in its role, the European Parliament has exerted a pressure for researchers to be when even included in the text.
Today, you are creating we visit to a crucial moment for the future of European integration.
But we know that the process is incomplete and that this threat incomplétude its vitality.
The debate, in which each country contributes with its own sensitivity, its traditions, its culture, is the instrument which allows the reveal, to define and to clarify.
Long live the European Parliament! Long live the European Union!
We must ensure that women benefit from induced jobs, while at the same time avoiding repetition of the same inequalities in the traditional sectors: less qualified jobs, part-time sometimes not chosen, insecure contracts and the difficulty of access to decision-making posts.
The Council will be activated by a proposal for indicators for measuring progress in this area.
Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar dedicated to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality by gender mainstreaming and specific guidelines.
I am thinking in particular in the violence suffered by them, one of the priority issues of my government action, and I know that this issue mobilises you in particular.
We know that the measures for the reconciliation of family and professional life promote in particular women, although we still need to carry out studies on the current situation of the family and the role that the woman plays, who is no longer the traditional role, given that society has changed a great deal, as well as family structures.
Some people, including Members of this House, sometimes seem to be convinced of the contrary, but it is a mistake.
I would like to end, Mr President, by saying that equality begins in the home.
I find this troublesome and ambiguous position, and this, it seems to me, deserves thought for the projects that you are proposing to us, because it may be that we do not obtain the practice of across all this.
In this area, there is no equality.
The image of the European woman, that it is discovered over the pages of our report, in our directives, framework badly with these Danish women who say in their majority not to the euro.
I think it is significant that the report seeks the establishment of a digital balance between men and women in all sectors of society, on the labour market, for example.
It is precisely for this reason that the report has missed a major opportunity completely ignoring marriage and the family.
That is something that the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities should also be taken into account!
We have heard that the previous presidency has restructured first and then dismantled the Ministry of equal opportunities.
The wages of women resources continue to be lower average of 28% in comparison with those of men, which contributes to the fact that women represent the majority of the poor population and which makes it difficult their participation in social and political life.
It is a result quite remarkable.
We are now witnessing a impoverishment of women salaried throughout Europe, in France too, where 15% of them live when even with less 3.650 Forest Focus per month.
All countries have not followed this example, I hope that the example of France will be followed by other countries.
The history of women is obviously very long.
We must really help the candidates to the Community acquis.
However, on this point, I should like to your assistance.
This, however, is not the case, even if it is a text satisfactory. After thought about, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has chosen, after a long debate, not to present amendments.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, after a long debate, felt that it was not reasonable that legal insecurity lasts six years and three years, the deadline set, was a deadline as appropriate for it to be possible to determine, with adequate resources and an average speed, whether or not it has been irregularities in a statement.
It is Amendment No 15 on fraud.
The objective set, namely reaching a simplified but qualitative communication and sufficient flexibility in the basic regulation by improving the procedure of recovery and by adjusting the provisions on presentation to customs, responds to one of the many requirements of the single market, and this objective has been achieved here because many countries are inspired to be able to participate quickly to international trade.
It would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, the committee chaired by Mrs de Palacio for the efforts made and the interest - by Parliament and the Committee - within the framework of this issue.
Souhaits welcome
I would hope that this does not change the meaning of the vote which will be expressed, but there is a real need to check the translation of the French version.
Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report.
It is accepted that knowledge of foreign languages is a necessary precondition to mobility.
We also feel that the Member States must be able to decide for themselves, in large measure, tax they wish to take.
I am a little regretted that we have no chance of obtaining a majority in relation to the need to formulate a prescription deadline for the conservation of documents.
At. of the negotiations of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we welcome the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief philosophical not sectarian, disability, age and sexual orientation.
My final point concerns the budget for this programme, or 98,4 amount million, which is of course inadequate in view of the actions envisaged.
It emerges explicitly the grounds of the amendment that the directive provides to intervene in the area of regulations relating to the age applied in the Member States, regulations which are, however, quite justified for reasons of genetic psychology and have no impact on professional life.
I also think that we could move of everything that has been written in the new Article 12).
As far as the religion/personal beliefs, the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection proposed in this area.
The Christian Democrats, on the whole, welcome the proposal for a directive on the establishment of general frameworks on non-discrimination in professional life.
This is, however, revealing that the occupation of staff of an internal audit service and not the importance of financial and, therefore, of the usefulness of such a service.
The EU has decided to provide common military powers in order to achieve the objectives so-called Petersberg (combating crises and search for solutions to the conflicts outside the territory of the EU), but it has no common defence policy.
. (NL) Without weapons, the world would be much more secure.
The resolution does not want to drastically reduce the sale of arms in order to promote a policy of disarmament, but only the regulate in order to ensure ever more the profits of industrial groups.
The Commission's communication recognises the problem but does not propose concrete measures, because it is caught up in the logic of the liberalisation of the market and of competition, and the proposals that it can make do not affect the substance of a harsh reality - especially for children -, that of the unaccountability enjoyed by the multinationals, which, in their hunting to benefit, are concerned not the impacts of their programmes and their products and transferring the full responsibility to the parents, inviting to consume new products in order to protect their children.
Like the rapporteur, I believe that the measures aimed at protecting young people against the violent and harmful programmes should not be limited to traditional television, but apply to the whole of the media.
With an average of three hours per day, it is the human activity, the most important after the sleep and, for adults, the work.
Furthermore, women often to occupy positions' flexible '; the temporary contracts or low wages are typical of the sectors occupying mostly women.
To be the first victims of the reduction in public spending, privatisations in the health sector - for the right of access to care and treatment, not to mention the right to programmes for prevention and information.
B5-0792/2000, by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the situation of crisis in Peru.
Mr President, I would have liked a debate on Latin America does not only on the basis of one or other topical problem, but rather, within the framework of a debate well prepared in the committees.
We must ensure that Peru reach the objective which it has set itself with candidates which are equal to the challenge and which are able to fulfill the light of the Peruvian people, namely a renewal policy and a substantial democracy.
The joint debate is closed.
Well, we know that Afghanistan is not far away, that Afghanistan is the largest producer global opiates, and therefore we know, and we can imagine the role that these political mafias, not just political, moreover, play in the expansion of trade in drugs.
It calls on the Commission to make the point of humanitarian aid programmes towards the Afghan people, so that no one is forgotten in the territory.
The suffering related to this conflict are terrible.
A budget line financing demining and prevention programmes for years.
Let me respond to the warnings from Mrs Paciotti by saying that I will, of course, be questioned by the Commission today to know what has happened and what should happen with the resources dedicated to demining.
(B5-0794/2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Linkohr and Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnapping in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerillas;
We would all prefer not to have to talk about Colombia.
The Commission has already proposed to coordinate the measures for such a package. The Commission is already provided for in the next few days to reach considerable resources to this end.
So, once again, two weights and measures, and I believe that we must deplore.
This attitude of the Albanian opposition party of deliberately reject a solution needed to settle an Albanian problem in Macedonia is totally incomprehensible to me.
I believe that the Macedonians have carried out an extraordinary performance by managing to resolve them the issues of Procedure.
That is why I also believe that this reconciliation can take, and the government, which has very courageously found a solution to the issue of universities and many other problems, needs visible signs of success and a strong support, otherwise the peace threatened in the region as a whole.
The Phare funds made available for the year 2000 in the context of the national programme can also be used to help the university during the next academic year 2001-2002.
I would like to point out that all of us today, Greek MEPs, we have now responded to this situation.
And all this, which concerns Greece, which occupies the first rank in the European Union for the sector of the Merchant Navy, in fact concerns the safety of navigation in all its aspects in the Union.
In recent years, many other people have died at sea, not just in the wake of shipwrecks of the ferries, but so far too regularly, within our fishing communities.
On the contrary, the innocent victims are used to promote wider objectives of shipowners.
We must realise that it is also the credibility of the European Union.
To conclude, I would like to stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the issue of European legislation in the field of safety of vessels intended to passenger transport must be given the highest priority in the European Union and that the important thing is to ensure that these legal provisions are applied in the whole of the Community to a strict and uniform manner.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry for my somewhat late arrival for reasons which you know very well, in order to make a brief statement on the two issues which are the order of the day: the situation in Belgrade and in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East.
Commissioner Verheugen is going to speak, as Mr Solana, on the two issues that bind us this afternoon, that is to say, the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.
We must be ready to keep this promise, as soon as the will of the people will have been respected.
Madam President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, it is with reservations that I am taking part in this debate, because I do not wanted our Parliament to appear solely as a judge allowed to throw the anathema on a given, at the moment when, after the hopes so strong raised here a month ago, we are faced with the tragic consequences of this new explosion of violence in the Middle East.
Madam President, my speech today is based not only on various analyses of situation, but also on the experience that I have personally experienced last week, because I was passing in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip when the unrest broke out.
Even if we are opposed to any violence, it is not possible to put on the same footing Israeli violence and the Palestinian violence.
I would ask Parliament, at this critical moment, to make a statement of support to the courageous people who, today, defended the freedom in the streets of Belgrade, thereby reiterating the support we have given, we, as Europeans, not so long ago, to those who are fighting for their freedom in other capitals.
The Europeans, Madam President, that would be well advised to take the leap the ball which has been launched here by the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
The status of Jerusalem is a difficult issue in the negotiations.
For years, thanks to its apparatus of propaganda and the brutal pressure exercised on the media, it has managed to mislead the people of his country, but unfortunately also a large number of people in the Western fashion, to present their a false picture of the reality.
While this tragedy affects its end, this Parliament has duty, as a symbol of a free and united Europe, to support the crowds outside the Yugoslav parliament and to help Mr Kosturica to fulfil its mandate.
It is precisely this harsh attitude as the stone that we fear the worst, and the topicality illustrates the words I have recorded a few hours ago.
I wonder if the Commissioner already provides the steps that will make it possible to show that we consider Koitunica as the legally elected representative of the Serbian people and as a partner with which the European Union will now address.
The European Parliament wishes to express its full solidarity at this historic moment when the tyranny is wobbling and where triumph for democracy.
The next item is the report (A5-0237/2000) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2000/24/EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to loans for projects in Croatia (COM(2000) 289 - C5-0336/2000 - 2000/0122(CNS)).
We must welcome the new political path which is open in this country after the presidential and legislative elections.
Between the European Union and Croatia, there is a particular advisory working group which aims to put at the disposal of Croatia its competence and its technical assistance in the negotiation of the agreements governing the mutual reports.
Let us not forget that Croatia symbolised recently the failure of a programme of privatisation which only a few have benefited.
The contribution that we are debating, in the form of a loan of 250 to EUR Millions of the EIB for the period 2000-2007 cannot therefore be a milestone, but must be a challenging aid.
It is therefore not entirely true to talk of democratisation in this report.
When, fifty years ago, Croatia and Slovakia have become independent, for the first time, they were satellite countries of the Hitler regime.
We can obviously dissociate the issue of guarantees and the question of Croatia, nor of the debate yesterday evening, or the developments that have taken place in Belgrade.
At a time when it appears that Milosevic fled and that the will of the Serbian people has prevailed, we hope that the establishment of normal relations and partnership between Serbia and our Union of democracies will be shortly.
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 6 October 2000.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
My question is: speaking on behalf of the European Parliament on this Statute?
I would ask you, Madam President, to do everything in your power to accelerate the procedure in the Committee on Petitions regarding a document presented by more than thirty social collective and NGOs in order to protest against this flagrant violation of the Community rules on radiation protection.
The post-mortem carried out in Georgia has shown that it is clearly a murder after probable torture.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the opportunity to make a great step towards your dream - which is not, moreover, mine.
It is the basic regulation, on the basis of all the other regulations on genetically modified plants.
It obviously puts foot in the flat, one after the other.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.50)
The next item is the report (A5-0291/2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Commission communication to the Council [COM(2000) 379 - C5-0508/2000 - 2000/2219(INI (COS)], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the new social agenda.
The stress the importance of this open method of coordination does not mean that this method should replace the social legislation, because we must set, in Europe too, social rights, we must have the courage to define minimum social and develop a social legislation which is essential in the context of a European internal market.
In our opinion, we also support the dialogue and cooperation with civil society, and mainly with women's organisations in the countries preparing their integration into the European family, because we must in time ensuring a uniform development which will follow the stages and the motives of the rest of Europe.
The action areas listed in the communication of the Commission have also the subject of a general agreement.
I would remind you, at this stage of my speech, the holding of a European seminar in Biarritz on 4 and 5 December, seminar that I will chair.
With regard to the fight against exclusion, we have made a great step forward in defining, on 17 October last, the Council of Employment and social policy ', appropriate objectives for the fight against poverty and social exclusion, which will be used to national action plans.
I have heard some people who have read the report say that they are in agreement with the diagnosis but not with the remedy proposed.
Technological development and the new methods of organisation legitimise a flexible cooperation, greater emphasis on the objectives and achieving results, and attaching less importance to rigid regulations.
It is from this side that it would be appropriate to seek, in our opinion, the obsoleteness criticised those who do not expect the best worlds of a market without hindrance.
This has certainly contributed to reduce the social unrest in our country and to promote investment programmes of foreign capital.
On the other hand, the method used seems more questionable.
If we are talking about a charter of rights, and if we see favourably the drafting of a European constitution, we cannot be achieved in vision, and we must say that we must make all the necessary steps in this direction, even if it calls for a more detailed legislation.
I would like to point out that, critically, the lack of initiatives on the new requirements relating to the protection of work, consultation of workers and working reports.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Minister, Mrs Péry, for this presentation of the social agenda.
These points, as we know, are combated by the conservatives in Europe. We, with our group, particularly attached.
The third question of content is enlargement.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
It should supplement the measures of the Commission by a revision of the possibilities of individual access to health care, social security and pension system, the shortcomings of the organisation of work, and perhaps also by a general reduction in working hours.
Thus, the women feel Europe close to them, and Europe will benefit interesting and innovative ideas which will take bodies in the report with this programme.
We therefore expect an annual report by the President of the Commission in the context of an annual statement in the European Parliament.
I also welcome that considering a better planning of childminders in order to facilitate the balance between working and family life.
My group will take this into account in its final vote.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I find the new approach of the Commission very positive, and the proposal for a decision on the 2001-2005 programme, which is very thoughtful.
I believe that the large number of amendments which are accepted testifies to the community of mind that exists between the Commission and the Committee on Women.
Firstly, because I have received, during the past year, many requests from companies, who feel a little powerless in relation to the merger decisions that they must take, particularly in cases where they have had to appeal against the decision of the Commission to the Court of First Instance.
I would also like to ask Commissioner Monti when we can expect the publication of an effective public register and valid on state aid and the picture, as expected, the results.
I should also like to point out to the Commissioner Monti that it is important that, in the next report, a more important section is being devoted to the field of financial services.
What I have just said is not only valid for the area of energy, but for the other areas in general.
Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for the good work done in the two reports, which emit a flattering judgment on your work and that of the Directorate-General for competition.
I insist on this point because the market cannot regulate everything and that, in this perspective, there is neither can be no competition without limits.
Mr President, today, nobody questions, and I shall not do so, the fact that state aid alter the conditions of competition and constitute a harmful element which do not encourages companies to be more efficient.
The hear and deny the fact that state subsidies have decreased over the period 1994-1998, while the Commission itself acknowledges, this reduction was already so curious.
Today, we obviously cannot, Mr President, to ignore the past, although my opinion XXIXe refers to the Commission's report on competition policy, and must learn the lessons for the future.
During the speaking time I have available, I would like to address, Mr President, the following three points: the modernisation of Community competition law, the activity completed in 1999 in the application of the rules of competition and the issue of state aid.
The Commission has continued to intervene firmly in particular in relation to the cartels and abuse of a dominant position, as in the field of mergers.
Mr Rapkay, it has been extremely important for the Commission to have the support of the European Parliament for the continuation of its competition policy, and I do not have the impression that this support can be watered down.
This mechanism can be activated at the request of a Member State or under Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which remains available in force during the third phase of economic and monetary union for the Member States that are the subject of a derogation, currently Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.
The use of capital market should remain the only possible option in the future.
I therefore express the wish that this report receives the approval of this House in its present version, and that the internal market and also applies to the sector from the vine.
Today, its review is necessary in the light of the developments of the plant regulation and scientific and technical progress, especially intervened in the proliferation in vitro.
I also believe that the reference, through this precautionary principle, to the possibility of genetic modification means, for example, the reduction of intensive use of plant protection treatments.
To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, to respect the precautionary principle, in its spirit, as in his letter, if misfortune the articles and amendments that I have just quoted were not withdrawn, we should, as are demanding the wine growers, that we followed the opinion of Marianne Isler Béguin, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and vote their abolition.
Mr President, if you would allow me: Commissioner, can you give your opinion on the amendment from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy? It is Amendment No 1.
The only point on which we could discuss, is that of knowing whether I should or not to take note as soon as the French Government has sent me the decree withdrawing the mandate of Mr Le Pen's mandate.
I would remind you that the vote takes place at 12.30 p.m. earlier.
In the field of Justice and Home Affairs, I am optimistic about a solution for the civil judicial cooperation.
The preparatory group will play its full role until 19 November, the date of the next meeting at ministerial level.
We needed this tonic climate, as Mr Moscovici has said, and I too have felt, at the level of Heads of State and Government, a very serious sense of collective responsibility and historic at a historic moment in the construction of Europe.
We must simply, ladies and gentlemen, ensure from now, in these subjects of the qualified majority, would not find ourselves fall short of the spirit or the climate in Biarritz.
Smaller countries of the European Union are not subordinated of the greatest!
I would be grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify this point.
On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica is an historic event.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, if progress has taken place on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting, profound disagreements remain on the composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, you emphasised.
It seems to me that we are going in the opposite direction.
Those who refuse enhanced cooperation enjoy the same freedom of movement that passengers in the back seat of a car.
I am not here, more than you, to interfere in the German domestic affairs, but I believe that this position is deeply coherent and is also going to in the direction of what the Commission wants, if I am not mistaken.
We have started to have exchanges on this issue, where it emerges that all the Member States want the maintenance of this ceiling after enlargement.
I believe that this will not be the case.
The first: we sometimes had the impression that in Biarritz, there was an obsession of the debate between small and large states.
From this point of view, I believe that it is not enough to say that the Community method must be safeguarded.
Even when the candidate countries will have acceded to the Union, each Member State must be able to retain a 'junior Commissioner' or 'senior'.
The wording of the text of Article 93 is all the more dramatic once the first wave of the successful enlargement, we will be even more unable to move towards a qualified majority.
It is to convince the citizens of these countries clear merits of any new European Treaty.
That would have been ignoring the resources of such a crisis to imagine that the fears maintained for generations could be introduced without new blips in the final appeasement, prelude to reconciliation.
I am also concerned about the weakened response to Parliament's request for democratisation.
However, the fault rather amounts to those who want to bring the comprehensive reforms before enlargement.
On the one hand, the decision of the head of the Israeli Government to freeze the peace negotiations because of the violence that prevails in the region and to focus its efforts on the creation of a government of concentration with the leader of the opposition, Mr Sharon.
It is with a huge satisfaction, of course, that we heard the victory won by the Yugoslav population and the election of its chairman Mr Kostuníca.
I would advise Mr Barón Crespo to ask his Italian colleagues to explain why they are in government in Italy with a party which states quite openly communist and are preparing to tackle the legislative elections with another openly Communist Party, per partito rifondazione Comunista.
Progress needs to be done on this plan in the codecision procedure.
The Commission is better able to provide the necessary impetus in the future by the possibility that it has to vote in simple majority.
The European Union has no need today to visionaries who look until 2030, but people who can identify the problems that will make enlargement in the three to eight years to come, and which can find solutions to these problems.
It is therefore an open work which is not fallen from above and which has not been imposed.
The debate is closed.
Without this fundamental reference, at best no longer includes, at worst entre-tue.
Democracy is better in Europe, but the European democracy, it is ill.
Today, 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, the European Parliament said something simple and strongly said: the European Constitution, yes, you can, yes, we want.
The Commission therefore expresses the idea that insularity is in itself a sufficient criterion.
I would go to the essential concentrating on the salient points of the report by the President Gil-Robles, which I simply say that I find it very good.
Firstly, that of simplification and clarification of the Treaties.
I will not go into any further, because we are not here - in any case, I am not here - to discuss the report of the Institute of Florence.
According to the information - I will be technical and pardonnez-le-moi - which have been forwarded to the Presidency, it seems that a clear majority of language versions, unlike the Italian version, is referring, for the application of the cohesion policy, to the least favoured islands and not the islands in general.
Mr Duhamel, you will probably agree with me that if there is no success in Nice, there will be no place, at least not credibility, for a reflection on the future of European integration, in any case in the current framework.
It is also essential that clearly defined in this European Constitution the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union. The dynamics of European integration should be included to cover the areas in which it is essential that we act jointly, as for example in the field of foreign and security policy.
They could also prove to be necessary in order to overcome persistent blockages.
We need more clarity in the division of competences and the affirmation of the principle of subsidiarity.
Everyone knows that there are extremely different views in the various Member States and within the various social groups.
Unfortunately the final objective of a European Constitution would be exactly the opposite course and we cannot approve it.
In the strengthened European home, in fact, there will be people sitting at the table military, monetary, possibly taxation and then the other peoples who will side.
It is obvious that the second version is not the right and that, firstly, because the economically delayed regions are in any case covered by the structural funds and, secondly, whether this interpretation was valid, there would have been no reason to adopt the Declaration No 30
Mr President, I am going to focus my poor small sixty seconds on the report of Olivier Duhamel, which is a good report, because it dares to say clearly things, and the compliments of our rapporteur has definitively convinced earlier.
In my opinion, the unity of Europe can only be political.
It seems to us that the new Constitution should already be prepared to enter into force for the next European elections.
Therefore, the word 'least developed' applies both to the island regions to other regions and, if following the proposal made by Mr Barnier, it is important here to amend the Italian text of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention.
The debate is closed.
Since the colleague said that it would vote against, the amendment is therefore rejected.
Mr President, the amendment which is requested here would lead us any right to chaos.
. I welcome the adoption of the Trakatellis report by this House, because it provides for the establishment of high standards of quality and safety for blood and blood derivatives.
If the European parliamentary immunity is autonomous, the French authorities should take us from the waiver of Mr Le Pen.
I am particularly disappointed by the vote of the European Parliament on the report on the proliferation of vine plants.
Some consider that alcohol, as tobacco and drugs, a product is likely to cause great harm to those who consume and their vicinity. others regard the instead above all as a source of employment and important enrichment.
The rapporteur reserve in the whole welcome the proposals of the Commission's White Paper on this issue, but it nevertheless fears about the possible implications of the reform, the main purpose and decentralise the application of the rules of competition.
In the debate yesterday evening, if I have been able to welcome Jonathan Evans for his work, I have had to say entry my profound disagreement with the overly liberal imprégnation, if not ultra-liberal, for his report.
AID Ireland has refocused its activity in order to draw in the Objective 1 region half of all the jobs of Greenfield Projects in the next three years.
Given the outcry that cause the consequences of this policy, the speeches, funding and other economic and fiscal incentives of the state offset partly the situation.
(The sitting was suspended at 14h06 and resumed at 3 p.m.)
And we are therefore, in October 2000, on the eve of taking a decision on the amendment of the 2001 budget.
However, this has not prevented the Council from reducing agricultural expenditure on a total 555 of millions of euros.
Moreover, we believe that it is obviously not enough simply, simply, to create 400 additional posts.
I can only invite the Council to follow us.
That is why the administration of this House is there for the MEPs and not the opposite.
At the moment, it is the Court of Auditors which we cause the least concern.
Finally, we must address the Ombudsman's budget.
On the contrary, we are of the opinion that this area should be strengthened, given the candidate countries.
We also propose that Parliament continues to be regularly informed.
When we organise a legislative consultation on social, cultural or environmental matters - the Commissioner would agree that I am right - we meet with the Commissioner for budgets, the finance ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets, so as to ask together to ensure that no financial error will be committed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your reception.
The Council has voted from the first reading the appropriations which seem justified for 2001, without taking into account the concerns of order tactics serving the objective of good appropriations that the Community institutions must continue.
Before you verdict on the draft budget 2001, I should like to insist on a number of objectives that the Council and Parliament have in common and which can be translated into an agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority.
We find ourselves in a similar situation in terms of structural policy.
Mr Colom i Naval has pointed out, the consultation of this summer has also led to a good result: in the future, Parliament will have better information in the field of legal bases which have an impact on the expenditure side.
May I remind you that the financial planning planned in the last year for the Balkans was for only 1.85 billion for the whole period informed until 2006.
I would ask you once again to examine without prejudice this proposal maintains that the Commission and to bear in mind this possibility.
That material has of course been useful both for the preparation of the 2001 budget and the 1999 discharge.
Although I very much appreciate the work of this body as a member of the Committee on Budgets, even though I believe all the work of the rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgets, I do not want to miss, as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to point out two amendments that the committee makes once again in the plenary and whose importance is not inconsiderable, in spite of the modesty of the amounts involved.
With these measures, we want to make the legal control once again fully operational, to restore confidence in the legal security within the EU and consolidate the community of law that is the European Union.
In considering the removal of this initiative without any provide replacement measure, the Commission clearly flouts the political will expressed in Lisbon and the priority laid down by this Parliament.
This decision was so astonishing and it has given the impression to many of us that the whole of this programme, which is very important, was simply become a bubble that refer to the Committee on Budgets and the European Commission.
The third point concerns the common agricultural policy as defined in the draft budget.
If employment is the political priority of the Union, the fishing industry, as the economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.
I particularly welcome the funding of Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000 programmes, the continuation was decided upon at the end of last year, has been able to be guaranteed.
As regards the aid to the Mediterranean countries, for example, the backlog relates to the budgets of several years.
Mr President, during the debate of past years, I used to travel the floor on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, for which we have heard this afternoon Mrs Iivari.
Nevertheless, I would like to say to the House this afternoon that we must not lose sight of the fact that the European Union spends only 1% of the GDP of the Member States and that the bulk of this money is managed in the Member States.
I now come to the overall strategy.
This brings me to the strategy of my group, because the basis for our conviction is the desire to give the European citizen for money.
Quite the opposite: we must do everything in our power to ensure that this House is an example of transparency, efficiency, and good democratic control of the European institutions.
We must consider how to solve this problem.
We want to promote the process of democratisation and we want to achieve a balance between the traditional areas of foreign policy that we have to deal with.
The most difficult problems in the new budget concern external actions.
It goes without saying that an economical management is necessary, it has our support, and we should not deceive ourselves on this point.
This is a very exceptional initiative, especially at first reading, and this is a thankless initiative, because it cannot, in the current context, obtain a majority of votes in favour.
That being so, the importance of the allocation for Kosovo is not without its problems.
The budgetary policy must inspire confidence among citizens towards the European policy.
We must therefore support all measures to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises.
the level of budgetary implementation;
Bearing that strategic line in the approach to the budgets of this year and the years to come, the European Parliament fully occupies its place in the budgetary procedure.
In fact, with the transfer of 175 million euros, we have made an assessment of 25 million more than what was intended.
As regards the MEDA programme, the Council has stated that the commitments made are not problems, given the eight years of payment arrears.
I believe that Mr Duff was here this morning, when we talked about the European Council in Biarritz.
My reply will be very simple.
Zapata assassinated was the last of the 25 defenders of human rights to be murdered, and recently the Colombian press has denounced the 'Plan 100' paramilitary groups seeking to murder 100 defenders of human rights.
The attitude of the Council I am pleased a little more today than in July because, as is often the case in crisis situations, the European Union appears to be the last to manifest itself on the international stage and to make its voice heard.
The question, Mr President, and I shall conclude, is whether we do not have a means of exerting pressure stronger than that proposed by the President in its information and if the aid that we are going to grant will be totally different to that of the US, that is to say, not geared towards fumigating cultures, but towards their substitution, and also to the social aspects rather than military.
The questions that several Members and myself have asked specifically affect the situation in Colombia.
Their objects being related, I call on questions together No 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.
Subject: Tax on financial transactions The call for a tax on speculative capital constantly gain ground in recent months, with the proliferation of committees ATTAC (Association for Taxation on the financial and aid for Citizens) in France and in Europe, and the amendments tabled to the French National Assembly and the Senate.
I would also like to answer the question of its influence on the volatility of currency markets, and particularly the effect of a tax of 0.1 thousand on the speculators waiting devaluations of the order of 20 to 50%.
It call for in paragraph 26 the establishment of an international organisation arbitration to erase the debt of the countries of the South.
This is also what happened to the euro at the level of a year, either for regret or wish.
I would like to add to what has been said Danielle Auroi, in relation to the countries of the South, that certain estimates, made by specialists, give interesting figures: for example, a band ranging from 50 to 250 billion dollars, which could be recovered of a tax on Tobin type, while, at the same time, the UNDP, a figure amount of USD 40 billion per year, the amount which may be sufficient to give minimum conditions of life for the hundreds of millions of people who lack in the countries of the third world.
In recent months, cases have been discovered, in particular, in different parts of France.
I therefore ask the question, since a representative of the French Presidency is here, whether the slaughter of these cows will be paid on the Community budget or if you pay on the national budget and if you feel that it would be a good thing that the pays on the Community budget.
May I ask for your indulgence and ask you to hear the answer?
So the action of the two governments concerned is limited by this international law.
I do not understand how the Commission can already say in February it needs, and the Council in July.
In this way in the name of subsidiarity, the Union lacks, in fact, one of its duties, as has happened, in recent weeks, both in the north of Italy as in Spain.
As a Member mindful of this majority, how can I endorse the disbursement of GBP 11.5 billion paid by the British taxpayers - it is our current annual contribution - if it does not enjoys a wide approval of the public?
A flexible attitude of the Council would make it possible to reach an agreement at second reading in order to complete the budget.
If anyone need to be convinced, that it simply see the evidence.
This strategy has already been introduced by Joan Colom i Naval, the Vice-President responsible for buildings.
The political messages present in the budget for this exercise - and the Commissioner Schreyer mentioned, are many: the adaptation of the agricultural policy, new structural programmes, a better implementation of the structural policies, the monitoring of the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit for the creation of a European Union stronger and more competitive and the fight against social exclusion.
The war waged by NATO has too destroyed and left behind it too great suffering.
Despite what has been agreed, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to achieve this objective in the existing budgetary limits without undermining the agricultural budget needed for sustainable rural sector in the present Member States.
And I say to you very clearly: we need to give its opportunity to Koitunica, and I therefore hope that he will ensure an amnesty over the coming weeks or months; but meanwhile, I hope, however, that, in political terms and in budgetary terms, political conditions are linked to the introduction of these two new budget lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction.
The elections in Yugoslavia have shown two things: the people ultimately had enough of the dictator Milosevic and they have given their trust to Professor Kostunica.
I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners will also be released shortly.
Failing that, we inevitably fall in the financial engineering ',' in the redistribution and cuts, both in the environmental and social expenditure in cooperation, without being safe provided that the amounts intended for the Balkans are sufficient.
In the context we are dealing with, it comes to resolve major problems for society, such as unemployment, for example.
There is, of course, a very important point is the fact that we have begun the heading four, with its approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to resolve the problem, particularly because the Council does not wish to participate enough food for thought.
The priorities are an important part of any budgetary work.
This is not to result in the run-up to the expiry of the Treaty, but it would be worrying if the legal framework post-ECSC allowed to maintain such practices.
This brings me to a third comment on the task which is now before us.
The distrust of politicians in the EU continues to grow, as I have been able to me distracted.
I pay tribute for this.
The readiness to the discussion of all the institutions concerned has exemplary collaboration, thanks to which we can - I hope very much, to reach an agreement at first reading.
We who are engaged in favour of European values in a Eurosceptic country, we now a further argument for the EU, i.e. protection of people who are more effective, which is important for the citizens in the modern society.
I have noted that my own country is preparing to carry out an amendment of the law on personal data, which, in the current state, deprives the elected representatives of any influence on the decisions of the Commission.
There are many other points also problems arise and deserve the judgment of the practice to be insured.
The Commission would first like to remind you of the commitment we have all taken towards the citizens to guarantee the protection of personal data processed by the institutions.
With this statement, the Commission will accept that the scope of the regulation should be limited to the activities of the first pillar exclusively.
In order to honour the political agreement that it has reached with the Council and the rapporteur to allow the approval at first reading, the Commission rejects any other amendment that would not part of the Paciotti report approved by the Parliamentary Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, except Amendment No 69, which corrects Amendment No 41.
Thus, it is urgent that the inter-service group staff should be strengthened very quickly at the heart of the General Secretariat of the Commission, so that all proposals to act of general scope can be accompanied, during their examination by the college on the basis of Article 299(2), a detailed impact statement.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market considers that it is important to stress that we can only compare like with like.
Given the importance of fisheries for the outermost regions, I can only be saddened by this observation.
Since the creation of a inter-service group for the outermost regions under the chairmanship of Mr Delors, a fruitful and long way to date, and I would like to address the most sincere thanks of the Europeans of the outermost regions to that chaired that group.
In fact, if from the Treaty of Rome, it was referred to the French overseas departments, it took 1989 and the specific programmes of options relating to remoteness and insularity, the famous POSEI, so that the European Union has finally conceded that the permanence and combination of the structural disadvantages of the outermost regions justified a specific treatment in relation to other regions of the Community.
I do not doubt that the proposals that the Commission will formulate the Council bear the mark of these qualities.
This issue is all the more relevant that we are approaching enlargement of the Union to the East.
This right to difference is nothing else, moreover, that a product of the principle of equality, which also requires to deal differently what is different.
It is a document that we consider, and my team as rich in ideas, proposals, which is at the heart of the problems and which does not escape any of the issues of concern of the Community remoteness.
Your report, Mrs Sudre, quite rightly emphasises the need for action in the long term.
With regard to the relaunch of the diversification of the economy, we have made progress in several important areas.
It is important now that a large number of projects is presented in the context of the DOCUPs, but, at the same time in this action on the ground, we must consider in depth the needs, to access, specific of each of these outermost regions in this information society.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
I shall, of course, part of your speech to the President.
I am concerned with the risk of a general failure of a large number of machines and rules that would jeopardise then question the decisions of Parliament.
This food authority and the legislative proposals before us, designed to guarantee food safety, receive the support of this Parliament, Commissioner.
The main task of this Authority will be a task of scientific consultation, because the debate on food safety must be 'pure ".
Mr President, I would like once again to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and for his openness to the opinions of the other committees.
When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to put into practice the precautionary principle.
On the always controversial question as to what extent we must allow him to look at nutrition, to really give advice and to be consulted by those who are essentially concerned about the management of the risk, we have also said that, when it comes to safety, these issues should at least be in the task of consultation of this Food Safety Authority.
A central element of this last point is to ensure that the rich heritage of traditions which is ours can continue.
The elements which will enable this respectability to see the light of day do not require laws or legislation, but integrity, irreproachable academic quality, independence, accountability, transparency and comprehensibility.
A good scientific knowledge is certainly necessary in order to better assess the risks associated with the chain of food, the plate.
Mr President, the enthusiasm for the establishment of a European Food Safety Agency, as our rapporteur would prefer call it, is obviously considerable.
As long as the programme of the WHO remains adequately funded and supported, it does not seem to be necessary to create a more body, especially not an agency whose scope is limited to the 15 Member States of the European Union.
Food safety is an essential condition for the consumer; indeed, they want to be able to eat healthily and it is up to us to take care of this.
If we do not develop any new framework directive, we can only smile on many things in the area of food safety.
We must therefore amend the Treaty on European Union in such a way that the Commission has the opportunity to apply sanctions in the field of food, exactly as it can do so today in the field of competition.
I support all the actors participants, that they are political, administrative or others, who work in the context of the strategy 'food for all'.
I do not agree with these words, because we can discover that a man is more than a body.
It must be the real brains of coordination of the network of national agencies which, in turn, will have to activate and coordinate a network of centres of excellence on food safety at regional level.
Therefore, I am of the opinion that your Amendment No 11 and my Amendment No 17 are perfectly compatible.
The reform of food legislation in the European Union must be done at the level of the European Union.
His report does not propose both of the changes that it puts the emphasis on a number of elements.
We have said very clearly in the report, and I welcome without reservation.
However, the creation of a European agency on food safety is very positive.
It is to be hoped that, in the interests of European consumers, they will be respected.
It is needed, I believe, to define precise deadlines in which it will be necessary to notify the European Commission certainly arouses justified concern.
The EU must have the highest standards of food safety for its citizens.
The Commission now proposes the creation of a European Food Safety Authority.
I fear that Europe again exposes the risk to provide itself with an enormous administrative apparatus, unable to act.
In fact, the efficiency is inversely proportional to the levels of bureaucracy and the level of expenditure undertaken.
Prevent double and parallel work in several institutions.
We must avoid, however, that, in the shadow of the debate on the White Paper, in the public strengthens the fear of a bureaucratic Europe which affects the quality of the products without effective way to remedy the fraud which threaten the health of consumers.
As you know, the Commission attaches the highest importance to its strategy on food safety.
The Commission is planning to adopt a proposal for a Regulation establishing the principles and objectives which will form the cornerstone of food law and will be the framework for future measures for the protection of health in food.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
To come to my report, I consider positive in the Commission 's proposal and must say that the Committees on Foreign Affairs and the development have done much to improve it, in particular on certain points.
As Mrs Bonino clearly stated, it was a step forward by the Commission's proposal for a regulation.
The proposal for a regulation from the Commission seems to us very vague.
It is necessary to organise properly the allocation of mine action operations and to finance research for the work of detection and mine clearance and for the instruments which may be used simply on the ground to help developing countries.
In the course of the last eight years, the European Union has spent more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget to the fight against anti-personnel mines.
But we cannot penalize people whose government committing of violence.
Firstly, I have already spoken, I think it would be a mistake, consequently well certainly, but even counterproductive, to make accession to the Ottawa Convention an absolute condition for the granting of Community aid for the fight against anti-personnel mines.
I cannot accept Amendment No 19.
Secondly, the international community suffers from a lack of coordination of its efforts at world level and especially in the affected countries.
Mr President, the Socialist Group shares the pride that has just been expressed at the moment Mr van Orden on the subject of the European Union.
Remember the Soviet bombes-jouets in Afghanistan!
I thank you for the quality of your report.
Mr President, the Cambodians call the mines the eternal quintessence.
The population perpetuates justified suspicion towards the forces uniform, whatever they may be, which is explained by long years of war.
Mr President, I am pleased that there is finally a European legislation, under the form of regulation, on anti-personnel mines and that we now have a good report by Mrs Bonino on this subject.
- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, very ladies and gentlemen, today we are entering a very sad question.
It is no coincidence that the landmines are, in the first place, in crisis regions, in other words in regions which could take the initiative of a different nature to overcome these crises.
On two kilometres of a hamlet in Bosnia, in 1999, a sign point out the presence of mines in a field, which does not prevent the presence on the scene of a small boy.
It is a tragedy that it is the civilian population which is suffering from the inability of its leaders.
On the eve of the Fourth Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference, which will take place 15 and 16 November in Marseilles, I am convinced that your work with our delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries, chaired by Mr Obiols, will make it possible to make progress with our project of dialogue and peace.
All mines are stored in deposits.
- (DE) Mr President, since I agree with almost everything that my colleagues have said earlier, I feel it is unnecessary to repeat I therefore renounce use my speaking time.
Your concept of open cooperation is relapsing into the institutional pattern dominated by the officials of the Commission.
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, which wants decisions to be taken at the closest possible level of the people concerned.
Since, however, the main amendment proposed by the Group of the European People's Party come to find a large majority, I approved the report.
Mr President, I abstained during the vote on the resolution on the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz, for two reasons: the first because I voted separately, in a way that is nominal, paragraphs 2 and 5, which has enabled me to express my opposition frank in relation to these two paragraphs.
In other words, around the table of the common European home, some mangeraient the card and other minimum menu.
Of course, we can always do better, and democratic control must not weaken, we believe that the listing of these rights and their inclusion in the Treaties did not constitute the priority problem in the European Union.
There have been discussions about the referendums and the amendments which have been tabled on this subject.
In the elections in 1999 at the European Parliament, the electoral participation has achieved 40%, if we exclude the countries in which the vote is compulsory, and those in which this European elections was combined with national elections.
In order to achieve the objective of a European constitution - what we want - we must avoid imposing patterns rigid and methodologies, which inevitably lead to the failure of the desired objective.
A genuine social constitution should align, from the top, the best of the acquis for the world of work, women, immigrants and the citizens.
Without denying the laudable intention to strengthen, clarify and deepen the European Union, as well as to simplify the texts to come closer to the citizens, I have not voted in favour of this resolution.
the allocation of powers and responsibilities
I regard it as absolutely crucial the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU entails membership of the Union to the Council of Europe Convention on human rights.
But the report by Mr Gil-Robles comes to help me, because it proposes that for some issues, sectors and matters, some Member States of the European Union to agree on a joint action.
The desire to allow an ever-increasing number of decisions on important areas to be taken in the qualified majority is contrary to basic democratic standards.
Today, he is trying to prevent the relaxation of strengthened cooperation, and it will eventually lose the part, too.
The present report seeks to give concrete expression to the position taken in this direction of our Parliament (resolution of 13 April 2000).
. (SV) Our opinion on the so-called flexible integration is generally positive.
- British Labour members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcome the welcomed contribution to the continuous work of the IGC on closer cooperation, without fully adhere to all the details of it.
These islands must feel part of the European Union which, I hope, will make a paradise for tourists and their people themselves.
On average age, those regions and their people do not belong to Europe and, even today, they are not really considered to be European.
In fact, the peculiarities of these regions, which generally derive from insularity and remoteness in relation to the European continent, but also of their chronic dependence on a limited number of products or even a single production, require specific measures adapted to the exceeding of these constraints.
Mr President, I apologize if I still obliges the Presidency and the interpreters to listen to my last explanation of vote and, in particular, would like to express my solidarity with the translators of our explanations of vote, as far as I am concerned the Italian Ornella Buson.
It seems clear that the agency aims to capture the powers of national defence, or to paralyse, to serve the objectives of the Commission.
This does not prevent the Commission and Parliament to christen this agency 'European Authority', a name which is totally contrary to the philosophy which is supposed to the inspiration.
This is not what the Bowis report, where one has the feeling that food safety is essentially regarded as a new pretext to fuel the well-known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission at the expense of national bodies and the security of citizens.
Therefore, I think I can, by this statement, condemn these unspeakable acts on behalf of our European Parliament, which has always advocated respect for religious freedom and tolerance among all the communities.
Madam President, I understand the accusations of the rapporteur. However, by voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we vote not only appropriations, but also for or against a specific guidance of the policy.
I ask you to support the amendment of the A-206 line, 'acquisition of property', according to the amendments which will be adopted, so that we do not exceed our own ceiling limited to 20% of all administrative expenditure.
Before the vote on the proposal to amend 929
Section VI, Economic and Social Committee
Report (A5-0276/2000) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing additional technical measures for recovery of the stock of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES Division VIIa) (COM(2000) 0190 - C5-0219/2000 - 2000/0071(CNS)).
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The export subsidies dumped on the world market, surpluses of foodstuffs, which creates a serious disabilities in terms of competition for agri-food industries in many countries, for example, of developing countries.
In order to obtain the necessary financial resources to an increase in aid to the Balkans, the Member States must proceed to a redistribution of the sums available in the context of the budget.
However, Parliament has been able to adopt a number of important priorities - especially a greater effort in the fight against unemployment and poverty, on a number of important issues relating to the environment and equal opportunities, etc. (FR) We voted against the attacks by the right to the LIFE programme and the European Women's Lobby.
- (SV) We maintain our opinion on the MEPs' travel costs, namely that only the actual costs incurred in the journeys which fall within the framework of their mission must be reimbursed.
I assume - and I hope that the Commission will research constructive solutions to this effect - that we are going to have to cover the period between 2002 and 2005 through a transitional regulation.
- (DE) In its obsessive desire to regulate and liberalise, but above all in order to muzzle truly the national parliaments, the European Commission has tabled a proposal for a regulation with a view to a compulsory and immediate application, instead of a proposal for a directive, which must be dealt with the cravache to Parliament and the Council to enter into force on 31 December of this year already.
We will therefore support the efforts undertaken by the Commission with a view to reform this sector, and we are opposed to all new measures to promote.
A development which made highly dependent on capital borrowed.
Nicholson Report (A-0276/2000)
It is important to be able to guarantee that the sums allocated to the title of aid are not used for military purposes.
Our firm view is that the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases must be achieved mainly to the cost that will have to pay the real polluters (i.e. the large industries), to the detriment of their excessive profits.
Moreira Da Silva Report (A5-0271/2000)
It should spend the money, harmonising and coordinating the expenditure for the policy of research in all 15 states of the European Union.
Only by precaution, we are right to want to learn more about these substances.
Voting time is over.
This European format replacing the national format which is already used everywhere at the present time.
The loss of data serves to establish the statistics of the balance of payments which would result from this amendment would be minimal.
It must you realise that it is mainly the small and medium-sized enterprises, which are affected by this problem.
For years already, we are calling for emphatically harmonising the efforts undertaken in this direction.
I believe that this report is of crucial importance for a genuine integration of citizens, small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro zone and to increase the acceptance of economic and monetary union.
The free movement of capital in single currency cannot accommodate obstacles or major differences.
However, the European Parliament and the Commission really attach great importance.
I support the dual policy that wants to follow the rapporteur to encourage the banks restive--minority too much to act.
We cannot force banks to exert an activity unprofitable, but as politicians, what we can do is to support the amendment tabled on behalf of the PPE-DE Group by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs calling for measures to be taken even before the end of the year and preferably that these standards are become reality when we begin to use the euro coins and notes.
This is what is the proposal that I submitted with Mrs Peijs: bring the banks around a table, not to impose constraints, but because we can no longer strengthen the political pressure.
It goes without saying that if the cross-border payment systems remain as expensive as today, the credibility of these new coins and notes these new will be directly jeopardised.
We are of the opinion that the accumulation of statistical data on the national payments of the European Union are a remnant from the past that no longer be justified in an integrated area, unified, and that it is an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the market.
To hear the speeches of some of my colleagues in the committee, those who attend this House for longer than I do, I had the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, which this Parliament is submitting for the fourth time, belonged to this category.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you in advance for the support that you will give to my report.
If it is up to the European level, we must strengthen the opportunities offered to regions.
Principale source of job creation, both in terms of quality of quantity, SMEs play a crucial role in social cohesion and for land-use planning.
The care that she has brought to the study of the proposals and consultation that it has had the desire to pursue with many interested parties have been an asset to better define and optimise the implementation of this programme.
Thirdly, we must seek the European added value.
It follows that small and medium-sized companies cannot live if unemployment is weak and if public budgets are free to debts and supplied enough to foresee such investments.
Businesses need clarity.
Above all, when a company or unipersonnelle a society relying less than 250 employees has a project, it must be possible to receive funding not only with a guarantee to 120%, but also on the simple basis of a good idea.
The national states, even the regional or local authorities serve already huge pumps to finance, designed to drain of taxpayers' money, that is to say the sums levied on the majority of the population, including the most disadvantaged, towards the large companies, and hence to their owners and their shareholders.
The breeding ground for small and medium-sized enterprises includes thousands of fragile tests, which are fuelling the large companies staff and ideas.
What I expect of the Commissioner, particularly among all the measures we have proposed here is that it facilitates and speed up access to aid and information, for the Heads of SMEs will be able to use the information with efficiency.
All these countries hold a prominent place in the multiannual programme.
Finally I welcome the idea of giving us an annual meeting in order to make an assessment of the implementation of the programme.
The recent incidents against the Greek minority of Himara more imperative the need to promote measures of democratisation, strengthening of the institutions and respect for human rights in Albania.
A impressive number of Albanians leave their countries because of the insecurity there, social problems, societies.�Even family and social structures.
We need preventive measures tailored to Albania and helping to the construction and the reconstruction of the country in order to make it possible to live in dignity in this region.
That is how the documents travelling from a body to another and that the European Committee, for example, refuses to make public the report, which concerns, among other things, the Customs Assistance Mission (CAM), drawn up by the Albanians.
Let us try to look the truth in the face.
Mrs Karamanou, congratulations on the point of view extended that has governed the concept of your report.
This is a very important matter which is shaped by historical, social, political and economic factors.
We will never know the exact number of victims.
The common economic activities create peaceful links between people.
What I find instead unacceptable in this report, and I say this with frankness, is that it confuses the effect and the cause, in that it is confusing a procedure for the granting of visas balanced, and therefore the possibility of migration, with the cause of illegal immigration.
The important institutional changes that are the result of the Amsterdam Treaty have had an impact on the management of asylum and immigration issues.
Thirdly and finally, the action plan and its method of implementation must be considered at regional level.
Naturally, this requirement we also invites us to show restraint in the field of European regulations.
This is the time or never lay particular emphasis on the strength of Community action.
I also urge that are introduced the proposals codified in the event of a modification of the current European legislation in order to incorporate the amendments in the existing regulations or directives.
The principle of subsidiarity, it is clearly understood, we are committed in two directions: decisions should be taken at the lowest possible level, but recognise that the lowest possible level can be a very high level, when the general interests are at stake and threatened if they are not protected in a uniform manner everywhere.
This report is a model of brevity and clarity and I hope that my colleagues will take account seriously.
The report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not awakened the enthusiasm of its members.
That is what I was referring in the report on the SLIM project, because the Community legislation, and Mr Medina has just prove with the reading of the articles of the Treaty, is scarcely comprehensible, even for the experts.
As a result, certain aspects of the report little enthusiastic about me, because I would have preferred a report more 'communitarising' with regard to the internal market, and, above all, because the report does not go in this direction on this point.
What is important for the institutions of the Union, is that we engage strongly to improve the quality of legislative texts, in particular by taking account of subsidiarity.
The debate is closed.
The persistence of this situation could exert a negative influence on the citizens with regard to the euro.
Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and internal affairs has prepared with great care the Karamanou report.
Having said that, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to take advantage of our oral question and this debate to address both sides - since our motion for a resolution is addressed to the two parties - and I would like to calmly few considerations.
The peoples of the Union that we represent here are demanding.
Although water has passed under the bridge, the agreement is, however, expired and has not been extended.
I can understand the reasons for the Commissioner, but not those of the Director-General.
We could say that, fewer than eleven after tie-up, we continue to pay the previous agreement and the previous to the previous.
Mr President, we have held a similar debate a year ago, and the fact that it has taken a year to start the negotiations shows how difficult it is to find fishery resources for the impressive fleets of the EU.
At the second agreement, things were very clear.
But we must also realise that nothing is eternal, not even the fish resources!
That is why I particularly want to make it clear that if the PPE-DE Group has distinguished itself of others, not only for having supported, defended and encouraged the fisheries agreements, but also for having encouraged their extension significantly.
Thirdly, since the fisheries agreement is interrupted, the exploitation of the Sahara place of fishing by Community and non-Community fleets which are not subject to the control of the Commission or that of the Member States continues: we are talking about, above all, a large fleets in the Netherlands.
I can understand, because fishing is a source of income and jobs for this important poor region, in relation to European standards.
The other point I would like to emphasise is that the temporary aid paid to fishermen and shipowners in compensation for this year without a job end at the end of the month, which is an unbearable situation for them, they all prefer to work rather than to receive aid.
A year ago, as a Member for the Andalusian party, I am negotiating and I propose initiatives in the corridors, in the offices, in the Committee on Fisheries and during the hearings with the Commissioner, so that should be taken into account the special idiosyncrasies of Andalusian fishing fleet which fishes in Morocco.
Spain has developed a remarkably positive way the difficult neighbourhood that has always existed between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco.
As the Andalusian and Spanish Member, I am claiming the right of thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families to maintain and defend, and that this Parliament will also defend, their jobs, which are being jeopardised for almost a year.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
A story of almost twelve years, made of reassuring words spoken by the authorities, delaying tactics, expectations, personal needs and placebos for the people concerned, the stubborn defence of old rights for citizens, which seeking nothing other than their rights.
As you know, the matter is very complex and concerns seven hundred people working in more than 25 Italian universities.
If the Italian legal order is reformed and changed, as has been the case for the academic staff, we do not believe that the Commission can intervene, therefore, that every European citizen benefits from fair access to all categories of professions.
The injustice lies in the fact that two people filling the same task and working together to receive a different wages and are subject to different conditions.
In my view, there is, however, nothing worse than to have to warn the people a ruling in their favour could be a series of reassuring words and have no concrete result on their existence.
I would remind you, I would remind the Commission that I hope for a response to the fact that, in the case Allué, the Court specifies that it is contrary to Article 48, paragraph 2 of the EEC Treaty that the legislation of a Member State restricts the duration of contracts of employment of foreign language assistants to a year with possibility of renewal, if there is, in principle, no limit of this kind against the other teachers.
I believe, however, that these affairs affect at the heart of the fundamental principles of freedom associated with the European law, particularly the freedom of movement, and no exception cannot be tolerated with regard to these principles.
As shows the current debate, we continue to encounter obstacles, many obstacles in the way of this internal market, and not only in the present case.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(The President cut the speaker off)
On behalf of our Parliament, I immediately sent to the President, Mr Thomas Klestil, as well as Chancellor, Mr Wolfgang Schüssel, the messages of condolence and solidarity in the test that such a tragedy calls for the victims, their relatives and the whole of the Austrian people.
Are there any comments?
I support the proposal of Mr Ceyhun, and I would be very grateful to the Council if it could make us know whether it intends to call a new proposal on this matter.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group believes this incident of such importance that we believe that it would not be treated as it should be in the framework of the urgent debate.
I have the feeling that you join the motivation, Mr Barón Crespo, if I have understood you correctly.
Madam President, some time ago, we discussed in our House of the issue of sanctions against Iraq.
It is urgent that we are having a debate on this subject before the entry into force of the changes proposed by the British authorities; the Commission must also indicate clearly what the law in this respect.
(A5-0314/2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the adoption of a convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, particularly in the area of the fight against organised crime, the laundering of the product of infringements and crime in financial matters (10213/2000 - C5-0394/2000 - 2000/0815(CNS (CNS)).
The statements must be followed by specific actions to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.
The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot remain in the hands of a specialist agency under the sole control of national governments.
On the other hand, Article 8 of the draft convention restricted to only essential interests grounds for refusal of mutual assistance that could invoke the requested state.
First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Marinho for his work and say how the fight against economic crimes not only deserves our support, but also our vigilance.
Repérer, continue, condemn the money laundering of terrorists and smugglers of arms and drugs: yes, of course!
Our task is to detect, trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of organised crime.
These elements are located in the amendments and, to judge by the debates in committee, I am optimistic that they will be approved by Parliament.
It seems to me that this set of initiatives develops in a way which threatens to destroy the protection offered by Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
But the reality is not as simple as that.
To conclude, Mr President, the PPE Group supports the compromise amendment which we have reached with Mrs Roure about the activities of lawyers.
The second measure, the second instrument, is the harmonisation.
Other speakers have already welcomed this Portuguese initiative.
That was the aim of the joint meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the Ecofin Council on 17 October last year.
The best way to strengthen parliamentary control and judicial control over Europol, is to include the Europol Convention in the legal framework of the European Union.
The creation of a provisional unit of judicial cooperation is a step in the right direction, which the European Parliament has been striving for a long time.
That is the meaning of the guarantees, namely to move this aspect of freedoms.
The European Parliament is the Community supranational body of the establishment of this report, and my speech therefore call on you to support the validity by supporting our rapporteur.
It is only when the institutional model and the rules which will govern the European area of justice will be laid down that the citizens and Parliament can decide on the measures that the Council has proposed to us.
Eurojust is therefore a logical step in this work, which aims to give the citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice, strengthening the fight against forms of serious crime.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on the excellent report she has presented to us, in line with one of the decisions taken at the Tampere Council.
However, as with Eurojust, we are talking about the coordination of national public prosecutors and judges to fight against all forms of serious crime - and here I agree with the approach of the rapporteur, extends the concept: we no longer talk only of cooperation for purely transnational crimes, we are also talking about cooperation for the repression of criminal activities.
We will have the opportunity to engage ourselves in this provisional unit, from 1 January 2001, but the Commission wants to support the debate on what must be the definitive unity of Eurojust.
Both sides, there has been frank stance - it seems to me - who have not, however, led to inflexible opposition.
The problems at the level of expenditure did not too worried; other areas were far more worrying.
It is unacceptable that we do not have clear objectives and that we cannot measure the results; it does not happen in any other institution.
A second point, Commissioner: with regard to the hierarchy of competence authorising, overlaps really unacceptable have been observed.
I want to stress that he has played a positive role in a number of problems.
It is clear that this work consortium does not divide in the joint financial responsibility.
Therefore, we really worked to the recovery of 3.4 million, and we can say that we have achieved more than 90%.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of nine months of work and a long search for compromise, this is the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Even if it does today to say 'yes' to this Charter, I hope that this Parliament will leave hanging any doubt, in the course of the next few weeks, on the fact that it requires the Council that this Charter is legally binding and that the latter must guarantee citizens' access to the European Court of Justice.
This position joined, as you know, taken by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Biarritz, which themselves have approved, unanimously and without reservation, the Charter, and I can only invite you, on behalf of the Council, to follow this position, perhaps you indicating a few reasons.
But it is above all by the strength of its content that the Charter, I am sure, will date.
For its part, the European Trade Union Confederation has been able to complain about what it considers to be shortcomings, such as the lack of reference to the right to a minimum income, for example.
But a number of figures, including Members of the European Parliament, have proposed that an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be inserted in Article 6 of the Treaty on Union, which already referred to the European Convention on Human Rights.
Our group has approved the Charter unanimously, with the exception of the British delegation.
As the European People's Party, we are unanimously in favour of the inclusion as quickly as possible to the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties, so that it has force of law immediate for the citizens of the European Union.
They have shown that we could work on European issues of a new and exemplary way, superior to that of the Intergovernmental Conference, since it gives these works an open and democratic nature, enabling citizens to fully exercise their right of access to documents and to participate.
The right to health, social security, housing or the minimum income is non-existent or only in the order of solidarity.
Fourthly, and this is particularly significant for me, the Charter of the principle of the indivisibility of civil and political rights, on the one hand, and social rights, on the other hand.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this Charter is simply the umpteenth demonstration of the capacity of the Union and our Member States to multiply the empty texts, the declarations of intent.
The representative of the Commission to the Convention in Turin has added to the document a legal scope.
After the time of the market, the hour of the Europe of rights is perhaps finally arrived. The concept of citizenship in the European Union is a concept fairly new.
The Charter is, in fact, drafted as a text that may have a binding value.
I also note with great pride that a representative of the group to which I belong in the Finnish Parliament, Mr Gunnar Jansson, has played a very important role in the drafting of this Charter.
As I said yesterday evening - I repeat today - there are too many shortcomings in the field, everywhere in the European Union, and, sometimes, overwhelmed by our desire to develop police and judicial cooperation, we neglect the importance of ensuring that the innocent do not become the passive victims, collateral damage of the war against crime.
Madam President, the draft resolution of the European Parliament on the Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the same ambiguity that the work of the forum.
The Italian constitution envisages, for example, the limit of good customs; the Convention provides for the limit of rights of others, of public order.
Mr President, today, in the vote that will take place at noon, we will put an end to a process that began in 1984, when the European Parliament has approved the draft Treaty on European Union, where appeared already the request for a statement of rights, a process that we have continued in 1989 with the resolution by Mr De Gucht.
The Charter will produce effects. It will produce, or not it is included in the Treaty.
That is to be welcomed and not to fear, as seems to think Mr Bonde.
It seems that all the struggles for the emancipation of social classes disadvantaged of the century which takes end have been unnecessary and did not tell us anything.
The Charter fills a gap in the law of the EC, it reinforces the protection of individuals against the attacks to which they could be the subject of the European police, the authorities who are fighting fraud and those responsible for monitoring the competition.
I do not understand those who are opposed to the Charter on the pretext that it does not contain everything they would like to see included.
Mr President, I shall continue in the same vein that Mr Gahrton.
I would like to make a third remark about the rights of third-country nationals.
Just as the Court of Human Rights, the Council of Europe also has a solid experience in terms of such forms of control. We can to base.
In view of the text of the Charter that we are going to approve - with a large majority, I hope - today, it is clear that we will be able to protection of fundamental rights more important and more current than would have enabled the accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.
That is why it is necessary to carry out other step.
This is vital if we want to win the support of the European population in respect of the Charter.
After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be my grid of analysis for this report and, as far as my personal resources, intellectuals and resources collaborators who will be given me will allow me, I would like to make a analysis by law, country by country of respect for the Charter in the fifteen countries of the Union.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would first like to join the words of Mr Moscovici, the President and welcome the essential contribution that the Members of the European Parliament have given to the debate, in the Convention, in particular the role that Mr Méndez de Vigo has played in the Praesidium of the Convention for the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I do not repeat that some of the salient points of this debate.
The Convention has chosen to include expenditure of fundamental rights inspired by the various instruments of the Council of Europe, the Treaties and the constitutions of the Member States.
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:
In the current state of affairs, it also belongs to our Parliament to tell the Turkish people that there are now three conditions to its accession.
In addition, it would not have been possible to set conditions only by a decision of the European Parliament.
That is why I have taken careful note of the suggestions made by Mr Morillon concerning the conditions for the accession of Turkey, and they deserve great interest.
I am pleased to be able to say that, in the meantime, the Turkish Government has accepted this partnership as a basis for future cooperation, good cause to hope that we will achieve precisely what we set out to achieve, that is to say, by our political help, the reform-minded forces in Turkey, to give new impetus to the process of reform and to push for the accession sought to the European Union.
For me, the most important thing is that Helsinki triggered in Turkey, in the Turkish public opinion, a debate on the conditions for Turkey's accession to the EU, and that this debate supports and promotes the reform-minded forces in the country.
This text is submitted to you for opinion.
What intends to do now is to give an impetus needed in the framework of a future accession.
I do not know how will take place in the vote but I would urge Turkey to deal with this issue seriously.
The European Parliament will play its role in the promotion of relations with the political parties, NGOs and the press, as well as in the development of its relationship complex and sometimes tense with the Grand National Assembly.
Mr Morillon, your report is, in my view, quite responsible and realistic.
On the occasion of your visit in Turkey in March, as now, you mentioned at least specifically the problem of the Kurdish people.
It has both a great naïveté and a large enough to consider that the Europeans will persuade the Turks, I quote: 'a radical change of their habits and their mentality'.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report presented to us arouses me serious concerns.
Recommendation (A5-0325/2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the approval of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487/1/00 - 456‒C5-0570/2000 - 2000/2233(AVC))
Nevertheless, we must, the next time we will be discussing the computing power, realise that there must be a broader control, and therefore more able to respect the human person.
Recommendation Duff/Voggenhuber report (A5-0325/2000)
In indicative include:
The rights contained in the Charter are already included in the national constitutions and defended by national parliaments close to the peoples and their cultures.
For example, Article 19-1, which mentions that: 'collective expulsions are prohibited', does not specify that this ban can be suspended in the event of war or serious unrest to public order.
We are giving a brief explanation of these three objections in order.
The right for a government to dismiss arbitrarily its constitution is the definition of a characteristic tyranny.
However, I repeat today, we have all to be proud of the conditions in which we have taken this important step for Europe.
A society knowing rights, but not duties, becomes a selfish society.
That is our fight priority for the affirmation of fundamental rights is implemented in political choices.
Just as the method of the Convention is interesting and fruitful to establish a basic text, seeking a broad compromise, provided there is no justification that we are depriving the European Parliament, embodies the representation of the European peoples, the opportunity to amend, to enrich the text.
This Charter must be improved and our Parliament must propose a strategy to enable its updating and its enrichment.
Therefore, it should not be adopted and proclaimed at the Council meeting in Nice: this summit should initiate a European debate on this Charter.
Fortunately, the leading tendency of national governments seems marked the stamp of common sense, i.e. that of a Charter to the purely political scope and non-binding.
Created as "pregnant" by the Cologne Summit, it is auto-proclamée 'Convention', a name which reminds an unpleasant 1793 terrorists and the excesses of the French Revolution implemented by another Convention.
On the other hand, the method which has been used, the exclusions which have been made and the ambiguity surrounding the nature of this text casts a fairly harsh light on the new totalitarian ferment which are upon at the heart of the process of European integration.
Fortunately, the European Parliament has not yet in this area that an advisory role, pending the full implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but it manages to play in the wrong direction, at the same time hindering the right decisions.
As regards the way to proceed, the views differ.
In fact, it was thus a century ago here and, after it has been somewhat limited, this right is now a revival.
The last thing we want is that the single market make it possible for criminals to introduce back door.
We also support the future creation of a convention facilitating the fight against organised crime and money laundering, as well as the various measures proposed for these purposes.
In fact, we are creating a provisional unit consisting of representatives of judges or policemen who exert an activity of judge in our fifteen Member States.
Mr President, as a member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I am dealing with enormously from the question of the prospect of accession of Turkey.
The attitude of Turkey on the Cyprus issue is also unacceptable.
We nevertheless agree with the criticism of the rapporteur, who believes that there is a lack at the moment, an effective assessment of the results of the activities of EIB lending, and that there are also deficiencies from the point of view of the public scrutiny and democratic control of the activities of the Bank.
Turkey, despite all its difference, has always belonged and still belongs fully in the European reality.
The accession of Turkey to the European Union has become a question of more than ever the order of the day.
Mr Morillon says that Turkey should endeavour not to see the European Union as a Christian club 'exclusive', which would like to exclude Turkey.
Turkey really respond to democracy, when it learn to live with its past, such as the democratic Germany has learned to live with his own, and too, we have asked him.
As soon as the authorities in Ankara will have understood that the status quo is unacceptable for Europe and for the rest of the world, significant progress can be made: the island can be reunited and a comprehensive settlement, fair and sustainable in accordance with international law will be provided tomorrow.
To tell the truth, why all this remains absent from the report of the European Commission?
It is in this balanced framework that we must resolutely continuing our action to promote the rapprochement between the Union and Turkey.
If you treat the Armenian issue in connection with the accession to the EU - I would ask you to be careful to my words: to deal with the Armenian issue in connection with the accession to the EU - the project which we have discussed today will not begin, but also simple.
This is also the reason for our insistence that an assessment to be drawn up of the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, so that in Marseilles, quite rightly, we can stop the necessary guidelines.
However, we have managed to maintain the dialogue and sometimes sensitive issues: stability, terrorism, emigration, human rights, for example.
The fact remains that the Council has tried, particularly since 1995, to provide the Mediterranean's most important means, to the measure of the challenges of the partnership.
It is in fact - and I would also like to say as a person from Central Europe - an extremely important issue.
Mr President, as you know, there is a saying in English, which says that when a star does not appear in a spectacle, it is like a representation of Hamlet without the first repressor.
We want to see met the policies relating to the issues relating to the single market and reach an agreement in order to introduce the cumulative origin, in parallel with the sub-regional free trade agreements for all partners engaging in this way and adopting the harmonised protocol on rules of origin.
We learn with great satisfaction that the Commission intends to give new impetus to the Barcelona process.
I have underlined these aspects because this is where we must seek the key to the relaunch of the process and that we must add to this the enrichment of the political agenda of Barcelona.
Therefore, it must be our priority should be to guarantee the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we must make every possible effort in the name of this cooperation and that the funds committed is implemented efficiently, in accordance with the - let us say - selfish generosity of the European Union.
That is the important and specific questions that I would like to ask, and I should like to thank Mr Brok for having enabled this debate just before the Presidency and the Commission can discuss these matters.
The world is moving in the direction of a globalisation now inevitable. In this context, it is necessary to organise large blocks acting as actors in the great landscape of global competition.
It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries have requested that a quarter of the appropriations for the programme MEDA-I expired in 1999, and the funding was EUR 4.7 billion.
In this sense, the proposal for a new impetus on the part of the Commission is positive and we are in total agreement with the two priorities that Mr Patten has highlighted in its interventions and repeated before this House this afternoon.
This is a warning for the European Union to play a much more active role in the Mediterranean region that, historically and culturally, has contributed to the wealth and the grandeur our European continent.
But worse still, at the same time as in this Chamber calmly we exchange of views sometimes extremely divergent, ever more Palestinians are massacred.
Aid for reconstruction
If, however, we do not find the means, in December, to implement this regulation, this means that the debate we are having today concerns an empty shell.
The Commission is often too bureaucratic and often passes through overly complex procedures, we must not and do not want to turn a blind eye, and I hope that the Member States do not, on the role that they have played in this respect.
The media in this region have often been responsible for the tragedy that it has suffered; they must be free to work in accordance with the rules in force in our democracies.
But I am also pleased, because I believe that Parliament has managed, through uninterrupted pressure, to bring about a successful outcome to a situation that was not particularly pleasing at the outset.
I repeat: there is a real need to avoid unnecessarily spending money in unnecessary meetings.
However, we must not concentrate only on Kosovo.
I also regret that a series of programmes have been put in the performance reserve, the reserve of behaviour.
In Feira, it has recognised the quality of potential candidates for accession to the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process.
I recall the main priorities assigned to the CARDS programme: the strengthening of institutions in the sense of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction, regional cooperation.
The European Union was right to react positively to the accession of President Kostunica in power.
An initial examination took place on 6 November.
As the European Parliament has called for in its resolution of 16 March 2000, that they initiatives will the presidency of the European Council intend to take to play a more active role in order to ensure the full implementation of the UN peace plan?
How are we to have this recovery without settlement of this conflict?
I can simply indicate that France and Germany - and here I am speaking as President of the Council - have raised these issues during a bilateral summit Vittel last week, and it was decided to form a working group in order to remedy the problem.
At the same time, the Union continues to make a substantial material aid to these two countries, through its various programmes, particularly TACIS.
The honourable Member's question gives to the Presidency the opportunity to dispel some confusion.
And I would add an additional clarification: it is particularly in these two texts, to strengthen the penal framework to fight against organised criminal networks of smugglers.
In the report that the Council of Ministers Turkey has adopted on 21 September as a programme of reform, are included in the part of the legislative changes several projects: within the framework of the civil code of measures strengthening the actual equality of men and women in the youth areas: better combat violence family; better condemn these violence, through the creation of specialist family judges and finally prohibit the possibility of reducing punishment for crime of honour.
Therefore, the Presidency has no answer to make on this point.
The next week, there will be a meeting of the European Conference, my invitation, in France, in other words with the candidate countries.
Do you believe that the 'Austrian model' - namely the taking of bilateral majority decisions - in the future will be an instrument for taking decisions ignoring the European institutions and to build a new institution, or a new group, to be able to circumvent the rule of unanimity in the Council?
The Council has not been seized of this letter, but the Presidency has, of course, replied to Mr Cem. terms of this answer have been communicated to all the Member States.
By what the President-in-Office see the position of Mr Cem - Mr Moscovici has not responded to this - which claims that it is not possible to take account of the Cyprus question, if we want to promote the partnership between Turkey and the European Union?
We must be aware that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than a mere fisheries agreement and, as he knows, if we were to reach such an agreement, and all that that entails, it would have been able to hide a deterioration in relations between the European Union and Morocco.
And it is for this reason that I wish to express my scepticism about the outcome.
With regard to the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal cases, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that this principle must allow the strengthening of the cooperation of the Member States, but also of the protection of the rights of individuals.
The supplementary questions must be made by other Members.
Furthermore, the Commission, in the communication that it has adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union's oil supply, indicates that it intends to present, at the European Council in Gothenburg, a plan for energy savings and diversification of energy sources which should contribute to strengthening energy efficiency, particularly in buildings and transport.
In this spirit, we have launched, during the vote on the resolution on the embargo, within the framework of the Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 November last, an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with the international bodies that defend human rights.
It is therefore up to NATO to take the provisions it deems necessary to ensure that such facts cannot be repeated.
(The sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
When we talk about money, those who give this money have the privilege to clearly define the political objectives, and that is what the Commissioner has always done.
This presence, in principle, can open up a new perspective for the whole of the policy we are pursuing.
If we consider the region as an area of political antagonisms in power, we will be doing wrong.
Parliament must be consulted and regularly informed; that is the second request from the rapporteurs, demand that we should all support.
The Heads of Government have also confirmed the Union's determination to support this process with a technical and economic assistance.
It is Parliament that has supported the Commission proposal to create the European Agency for Reconstruction.
As the House knows, we do not believe that it is necessary to provide an explicit reference to this in the regulation.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The leaders agreed to extend and update the framework for cooperation Eurasian 2000, which is the work programme for the next ten years.
I believe that this reminds us, in Europe, the important role that we play in Asia, and not only in the area of the economy and trade, although it should be necessary to point out that one of the reasons for the restoration of Asia is that we held our commitment to keep our markets open to Asian exports over the last two years.
I believe that it was a very good political statement, but we still have some problems to resolve.
We know that the Commission considers the ASEM with the utmost seriousness, and we support sincerely in this attitude.
It is necessary to improve the existing mechanisms at the level of the transposition of Community law in order to increase legal certainty and overcome the current slow.
It should therefore encourage the creation of new regional organisations, starting where there is already a Community presence, as is the case in the Western Pacific and the South Pacific.
This will be vital for the sustainability of fisheries.
I believe that the future of fishing in international waters depends on these organisations and all the efforts of the Commission, Mr Commissioner, boil down to little so defend the position of the United Nations, both in the Convention of 1982 that in New York, which has been mentioned here, our presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing must be very active.
That is why I believe that the Commission can play a leading role in that go on the ground and encouraging fishermen to cooperate with it and to propose a solution to which we can all endorse.
Furthermore, the Commission must assume a series of tasks in the field of negotiations which must be carried out within the framework of the RFOs.
Mr President, I encounter the same problem that Mr Nicholson, but in a still more acute form.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the solutions advocated by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Sometimes we are coming to ask ourselves whether the cyclical crisis in the market is not, in a sense, the result of the speculative action of PNR business structures, thus ensuring the control of the sector according to their interests.
The EU's supplementary aid proposed by Mr Garot in his report is, in my view, contrary to the good sense in these years of Agenda 2000, of enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe and reform of the agricultural policy.
I believe that it is quite remarkable that the rapporteur has shown here what can be done with a little administration when it pursues a defined project, which clearly appears in the report.
On one hand, the biggest producers or those who are integrated with the downstream companies abiding away from this arrangement, preferring the systems they have already: individual savings loan, banking, equalisation fund.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say that, above all, on the substance, and account of the Austrian agriculture, I welcome the Commission's proposal to be a regulatory fund.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.
I understand that we want a common organisation of the markets in the area of intensive farming and dismantling of the agricultural policy, insofar as it is connected to the territory, where it is a question of production connected to the territory.
There is already a COM pigmeat, and we must not commit the mistake of the question, despite the fact that, basically, it works well.
According to the Commission, it is right to do to submit a discipline that the farmers who take part in the regulatory funds, because they receive in exchange some guarantee of income, whilst those which do not take part in the funds do not receive this guarantee.
(The sitting was closed at 11.00 a.m.)
The resources from the value added tax on represent 36% and the traditional own resources 15%.
Another element of the reform is also closely linked to a priority identified by the Court are: the increasing importance to give the evaluation of the results and performance in the context of a distribution of resources which responds to predetermined priorities and clearly defined and measurable objectives.
That is a good thing, and I would like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, as well as the members of the Court of Auditors and the services of the Court of Auditors, supporting the reform of the Commission with this report.
In this connection, it is also circumstance that I announced that, for the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we have proposed to amend the European Treaty in order to be able to create a European Public Prosecutor to pursue fraud damaging the financial interests of the Community I hope very much that this proposal will not simply be recorded at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice or crept under the carpet, but deal with seriously.
The reality described in the annual report is rather disappointing.
The number of errors is too high for giving such a guarantee.
The amount intended for activities of equipment is 240 million too low.
I would also have liked to see the report of the Court of Auditors fusse a little more user-friendly and it would have put forward some clear recommendations - for example, one or two recommendations by chapter.
A convention on the protection of the financial interests of the EU was adopted in 1995.
The Commission and the Member States should handle in this direction and exploit its conclusions in order to strengthen the effectiveness of their methods of management of EU finances.
I know that this report and the work that Parliament is about to begin within the framework of the discharge procedure will contribute to greater vigilance in respect of Community expenditure.
At the moment, I would like to silence me, Madam President, and expect that a member of the Council to come here.
As in other years, the Court is not arrived in identifying exactly the shortcomings.
Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union approach and the report of the Court of Auditors clearly shows that we still have plenty of work to do, even in the candidate countries.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have recently concluded an agreement with the Court of Auditors, which was to be able to obtain in advance information on the report of the Court and to keep silent in this respect.
I would also like to 'harass "the Council and ask why the situation does not advance on Article 24 of the Financial Regulation.
Perhaps a bit of a European common sense will resolve the problem and to give George Bush its rightful place in history - the dustbin!
We do not have to look for scapegoats, nor in our institutions in our Member States.
First of all, concerning the procedure for the presentation of the annual report to Parliament and to the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am delighted to hear that the Members of this Parliament feel that the situation is this year is more satisfactory than previous years.
Nevertheless, we shall have the opportunity to examine.
When the audit justified, we mention everything that should be.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you will certainly have noticed, the last part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors has been the victim of an unfortunate virus, which is proxy between his speech and this House.
Some amendments, such as Amendments Nos 1 and 18, relate to questions which fundamentally interested in the United Kingdom, and it must be said that all the groups in the United Kingdom, that they are socialist, popular or, the Greens have defended with great vehemence, and they have been approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Mr President, in March of this year, we voted on the directive on the funicular for passenger transport.
We believe that, in this case, the manufacturer the obligations arising from the law on the safety of products must not burden the trade.
We have heard the justification for them and the resumption of industrial arguments mentioned in committee.
From the moment that the seller is able to inform each time the buyer of the nature of goods and reservations about the information, that should be enough.
Finally, I have one last little thing to ask the European Commission on Article 4 on European standards and the question of whether these standards must be published.
I am satisfied with the exceptions which are made for charity shops and non-profit-making organisations as well as for the second-hand goods sold on the markets or in the context of sales of individuals.
The reliability of the safety of products and the assistance sales represent an added value for the European label at a particularly difficult time and crucial.
If we invite also the Commission to submit near future a proposal on the safety of services, we cannot see why we should and would like to regulate here and now the aspects relating to services, rather than to wait for the Commission's proposal, and we can already foresee that the difficulties of definition of different regulations will arise and that the legal uncertainty will increase with time.
A few words only on the main aspects of this proposal.
We are now being offered the possibility of opening the system to third countries, in particular the candidate countries: simplification of procedures concerning the emergency measures at Community level in such a way as to be able to provide a rapid response on the advice of a regulatory committee.
This new requirement does not imply any additional important responsibility in the case of this kind of shops.
Replacing the word "producer" with the word "supplier ', as proposed in the amendment 11, generate more confusion than precision, given that the directive does not offer any definition of the word' supplier '.
Although the Commission is in favour of a rapid establishment of the network, the procedures must be discussed between Member States.
Such certificates can be used to always but cannot be regarded as inherently reliable.
Having explained why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 to 30, 32, 33, 36, 34 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31, 35 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, given that these amendments are an improvement and clarification of the proposal of the Commission.
Of course, for Mr Barón Crespo, an Italian Socialist cannot be part of the European Socialist Group.
In my view, there is no contradiction between Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37.
With regard to the order, I leave to the President to decide, and I would remind you that I am against, in any case, on each of the three amendments.
The Mediterranean countries outside EU are facing, it is true, particularly acute problems of economic development there a constant tension due to the inequalities between the regions.
As far as respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, in the spirit of a harmonised European policy in the field of immigration, in addition to the legal instruments to ensure equal treatment, it would be necessary to create instruments for financial support for all those young people who, having completed a round of studies, higher or university, in the European countries, would return in their country of origin to start a professional activity.
I should like to highlight a factor, which I regard as frankly crucial to address this issue. I am speaking of inequality in the workplace.
Although belatedly, the Commission has presented a programme on Community strategy for equality between men and women (2001-2005), which differs markedly from previous programmes, particularly in the fourth action programme, which ends at the end of this year.
Despite these reservations, I have voted in favour of this report. firstly because it has been taken account of several proposals for amendments of my parliamentary group and, secondly, because this report calls for studies on the situation of women on the national labour markets and the insufficient access to social security systems, two problems for which we need relevant statistics broken down by sex.
My party expresses serious reservations about the regulation of the sale of consumer products by means of Community legislation, as it makes reservations about the concept of the mutual recognition of standards.
This misunderstanding is now being eroded, and the Labour amendments offer a guarantee not to touch of charity shops and to see them excluded from the scope of the directive.
Finally, Amendment No 15 leaves the hands free to the Commission for the language regime of the agency, which we consider to be very worrying.
The simplification of the decision-making procedure, the creation of decentralised operational centres (and not just in Pristina, which is equivalent to the separate Yugoslavia - and the management of the dual structure between the Management Board and the Commission can be positive measures to combat the bureaucratic important failures of the European Agency for Reconstruction.
We are therefore voting against the proposal of the Commission and against Parliament's report.
A adaptation of the existing Community regulations in this area can therefore be regarded as justified.
What is more, the funds cofinanced by the Member States to aid more or less hidden.
Despite its serious shortcomings, the Morillon report is clearly further than the Commission's proposal on the partnership between the European Union and Turkey.
We, we have voted against it.
In like the rapporteur, we must admit that Turkey has made progress in certain plans and positive signals exist.
From 1987, Parliament itself was committed to the path of recognition, and the adoption of this amendment shows the coherence of Parliament on this debate.
The Union must do more proposals and design the accession of Turkey as an essential geopolitical strategy.
Such ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey.
For several years, as a member of the delegation for relations with Canada, I was able to observe the operation of one of these regional organisations, NAFO (Fisheries Organization of the North-West Atlantic), to which the Member States are involved in this region, including Canada, and all those who use to this place of traditional fishing areas, including France, Spain and some other European countries.
It will be pleased that when its own fleet of gunboats, under European flags, will uphold its policy in the field of fishing.
What is important is therefore not to satisfy the desire for hegemony of the Commission by weakening the position of Europe, which would be entirely contrary to a proper application of the principle of subsidiarity.
Finally, after tough negotiations, we have reached a final result that it is worth defending.
Thus, this proposal, which aims to replace three directives relating to the incineration of waste, aims to improve the quality of air, water, soil, the health of people, reducing the emissions of pollutants linked to the activities of incineration and co-incineration, including dioxins, furanes and heavy metals.
But I think that we should also stress - and this is an innovation, that it is no longer just the emission of these substances in the air; it also concerns the emission in land and water.
The proposal has improved during the various tests.
The introduction of stricter limits in the field of nitrogen oxides for the new coincineration plant, such as cement kilns is both a breakthrough and an incentive for the reduction of emissions, even if the standards proposed do not reflect the best available techniques.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please forgive me - in particular Mr Blokland, for these few minutes late.
In conclusion, this directive is a major contribution to the reduction of the negative effects on the environment and the risks that they represent to human health.
The European Parliament honor, on behalf of the rejection of discrimination and the fight against exclusion, and in compliance with the responsibilities of everyone, to give a strong impetus to the implementation of a mechanism which will enable us to make specifically exist the essential principle of solidarity.
We note, however, major differences from one country to another; we lack, however, detailed and comparable statistical data which would make it possible to draw up a reliable state of the situation, to determine what the countries are more effective systems, and how, what their weaknesses, etc. It is precisely the reason why my opinion, which has been drafted at the request of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, stresses that it is necessary, before establishing some rules in general value, in terms of supplementary sickness insurance, that the Commission should publish a Green Paper bringing together all the data scattered, which will have been treated, as well as the relevant information.
Up to now, they were the subject of a certain taboos.
The risk of citizens worse health and that older people can have full access to a private insurance because of the high risk that they represent is unacceptable to the development of our society.
The other point of view, illustrated by the original words of the rapporteur and shared by many colleagues, is to promote the regulations and the codes of conduct needed to establish, between insurers, forms of mutual costs guaranteeing to all the provision of a good quality of care and to counter the risk of seeing develop discriminatory practices and a selection of risks and customers.
It seems to me not normal that the money which determines the turn of transition in a queue.
The new proposal of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which is to draw up an inventory of all form of a Green Paper and then to decide whether we need a directive or a recommendation, seems to us to be fair.
A discussion is currently under way in the Netherlands on structural changes to the system.
On this basis, it is up to the Commission to take an initiative and articulate specific key points which will serve guidelines for health systems of the Member States.
It is therefore unthinkable to consider a one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of health insurance.
That is why I believe that we need to focus on the content of the report by Mr Rocard - that we congratulate - which asks the Commission the provision of a service, the drafting of a Green Paper which will allow us to know the current state of insurance in the Member States and also to look to the future.
The two systems are based on a model three legs, makes comprising the state, the company and the private sector.
The European Union has already drafted a degree of rules in the field of supplementary pensions.
Mr President, I wish to thank and congratulate Mr Rocard for his report and to congratulate Mr Marinho for the opinion of its Committee on.
This study will form the basis of a communication from the Commission to the Council and to Parliament containing initiatives or measures.
With regard to the amendments of the Committee on Budgets, I can say with satisfaction that they have all been accepted.
We have made our support to the characteristics of the programme, such as the multi-faceted approach to the phenomenon, the measures in the field of health, education, housing, cohesion and complementarity with other policies, and the participation of non-governmental bodies, but also the same people who are being hit of social exclusion.
This means that we must take advantage of the bottom-up phases of the round to return to a situation of balance or surplus.
I would remind you in this context that the last Ecofin Council has asked the Commission that the assessment of stability programmes resume precisely as early as next year this aspect of long-term public finances relating to the ageing of the population.
One of the good features of the Netherlands programme is the special attention given - as I said before - to the impact of the ageing of the population on the public purse in the next few years.
Therefore, in the case of Germany, the result of the budget for the year 2000 will lead to a surplus of 1.5% of gross domestic product.
If we add to this the changes in the exchange rate of the euro in relation to the dollar, we have a significant negative impact in terms of inflation.
On the other hand, they aim to make compatible with a public system of distribution with private capitalisation systems and, of course, they are also compatible with support for the creation of investment funds specific likely to provide tax benefits to long term and help to tackle the problem of ageing.
It is thus the third principle that guides us: the precautionary principle.
It should be remembered that several regulatory proposals are currently being discussed, which will contribute to reinforce the effectiveness and the relevance of the Community mechanism and, therefore, I hope, the confidence of consumers.
However, this relatively low incidence does not justify any complacency.
Frankly, I was disappointed that the Prime Minister Jospin makes no mention of the very positive role played by the Community in recent years in his speech yesterday.
We must obviously determine the reasons for the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.
The Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission is already giving high priority to controls of the Member States in connection with the protection measures against BSE.
With regard to the safety of animal meal, let me remind you that there is already a wide range of controls aimed at ensuring that animal meal are not risk of transmission of BSE.
Yes, just as difficult to believe that this may be, it has taken four years to get a measure that I consider crucial to the protection of public health.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I urge the Council to make known finally its position on the regulation on TSEs.
In the current situation, the only way to interrupt the cycle of transmission of BSE is fully to ban the use of such animal meal.
In this connection, I should like to point out that the Liberal group to which I belong presented a proposed amendment which I hope to see adopted.
The policies must be changed so that the true responsibility for this crisis to be penalised and that specific decisions permit a first step towards the end of this tragic crisis.
We therefore need to review.
The labelling of beef which has been decided, which is a minimum labelling and which entered into force for two and a half months, does not allow for properly tracing the origin of animals, and we have belatedly banned specified risk material.
It must be that the public is fully informed about the characteristics of the test I am talking about.
At the time, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you did nothing, or almost, as your similar have done nothing about the impact of Chernobyl, nothing about the AIDS epidemic, nothing about contaminated blood, always with the same reason: not to panic the public.
The prohibition of France provoke a massive increase in the demand, but the offer is not unlimited and prices will suffer an extraordinarily heavy pressure.
Consumers have lost confidence, and to stem this phenomenon, it is necessary to generalise the BSE tests on cattle and sheep.
It seems to me to be more important to move in the direction of the Commission's proposal, namely to ensure that animal meal meet the highest safety standards.
For the rest, I am in total agreement - once - with what my fellow Members, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs Grossetête, have said.
Let us, members of the Council and of the Commission, you have a large financial basis for conducting a strong political.
We must solve the problem.
Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased to hear here in this House, that we must at all costs to change the CAP.
We had denounced, even here, with Jimmy Goldsmith, in its time.
The food must be safe.
I think it is exemplary that France is resolved to take that step.
But we are not helping them there!
I am therefore surprised to see that corpses are still used or processed in these conditions.
The Phillips inquiry into BSE has just been published in the United Kingdom.
I would suggest to the European Commission to apply the precautionary principle towards the French beef.
We must be aware today, since we are still in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what are the measures to be taken.
Furthermore, I have, of course, all these proposals are concerned, I am not immune.
If the citizens of Europe tell me that the legislation has not been properly applied or fully, then we may réenvisager the question, but not for scientific reasons, but will be because the legislation has not been respected in the European Union.
The best way to do not hear us, is not to invite us.
The Commission considers that the first readmission agreements, currently being negotiated with Russia, the Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco play an important role in the clarification and the coordination of these policies.
What proposals does the Commission in this area on the basis of Article 31 of the European Union?
(The President cut the speaker off)
During this time, the aim has been to reduce the public deficit in order to obtain a monetary policy which is more appropriate, interest rates that are lower than market rates and more growth.
I always say that the euro will not be introduced on 1 January 2002 but that it is already in our pockets; we have with fractionnaires different currencies, but we have already in our pockets.
The ozone limits set out in the directive 92/72 have not been overtaken in the capital, but it should be noted that no measure has been taken in the middle of the summer.
Subject: State aid in the audiovisual sector At a seminar of the French Presidency devoted to cultural industries, a representative of the Directorate-General Competition of the European Commission has estimated that the legal obligations of investment imposed on the channels constituted state aid from the fact that these investments were made compulsory by the legislator.
It must be respected and protected '.
However, that is not self-evident, because this new growth is very inegalitarian and can be accompanied, as we have seen in the United States for ten years, to persistent phenomena of insecurity, exclusion, poverty, urban ghettos.
The governments of the Member States have refused to accept this definition, which is a little too simple and far too vague.
And in the difficult climate as a result, increasing numbers of people do not follow, are marginalised and excluded.
Mr President, we hear very often in this House, such a tune, the glorification of the European social model, the social market economy, that we oppose with pride - as many think, the savage model of the United States of America.
(The problem technical)
This is a huge figure.
Furthermore, all the political levels must be involved.
I support the need for better known the causes of poverty, I support the preventive action against exclusion in the wake of mergers, industrial change, relocations, rural desertification, urban excessive concentration, with the help of innovative and practical responses, involving the social partners, local and national administrations, as well as the joint action of citizens.
We have seen a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and on the role of social and structural reforms.
It is a problem formalistic due to the fact that, in the Treaty, it is only makes reference to social exclusion and not to poverty.
I believe that these proposals are a pragmatic response to your request.
However, approval of the global strategy does not necessarily mean approval of the proposal in detail.
If we define a clear and binding framework for the Member States, the various systems to meet these demands should have a longer period of put to the test.
Renewable energies will not become a panacea for solving this problem, but nobody doubts that they can contribute largely to alleviate, to diversify sources of energy and to reduce our dependence towards hydrocarbons, which, moreover, does not disturb.
I shall now return to three of our demands.
Imposing realistic targets can therefore only strengthen the citizen 's confidence in energy policy to be implemented.
I believe that a strong policy in the field of renewable energies is a symbol for the Europe of tomorrow.
Finally, the European countries must prove through these agreements they will help to achieve the Kyoto objectives.
It seems to me to be regrettable to exclude any category of waste which can contribute to the overall production of energy from waste - either for small-scale projects or within the framework of a more comprehensive calculation.
The formation of the bulk of peat by bog and in the production of waste wood is comparable to that of other biomass.
Finally, I want to inform Mr Chichester that the broad in my region, there was already a draft wind well advanced and that it announces promising, so I invite him to come realize itself.
The debate on the renunciation of nuclear energy, in Sweden and in Germany, for example, has shown that, without replacement energies possible environmentally friendly and competitive, the debate turns short. It is inevitable.
That is why the Member States must impose binding targets.
I am therefore optimistic about the future of renewable energies potential provided that the appropriate incentives are put in place.
I believe that we must enormously courage to give renewable energy the place it deserves.
There is no doubt that a very sharp increase in the price of oil confronts us more brutally to the problems associated with our energy dependence towards the fossil energy sources.
Therefore, we cannot accept Amendment No 28.
Nevertheless, in doing so, the Commission does not forget that the words used does not prejudge its right of initiative and that they should be compatible with the single market in electricity.
On 26 participants, the national reconciliation commission of Tajikistan has only one woman, while the country into account 25 000 widows.
Studies show that the presence of women in the ranks of the UN peacekeeping forces, although in limited number, improve relations with the local populations and the moral general them.
The Theorin report deals with this issue in detail and contains many repetitions that we are asking, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to delete in order to develop an official document.
From a political point of view, I see Amendment No 19 or a failure a tactical fallback rather than a compromise in terms of content, which should in any case be unworthy of the female cause.
They have been captive.
Then a Portuguese example, where the doors of diplomacy are open to women that after the Revolution "April 1974 'Our ambassador in Indonesia, Mrs Ana Gomes, has recently shown in West Timor, that the role of a woman and its sensitivity to the problems and the suffering of a people, who has addressed only a long struggle of 25 years for freedom, can be seen by everyone and especially by the European Parliament.
Very few Member States have done to date. I was told that there are two or three.
That is why we must also, in future, take account of this aspect during the preparation of the policies of the European Union.
Unfortunately, the report does not define this concept, nor establishes distinctions.
Please pass on our protest to the Council.
They have different experiences, which are essential to the way in which the policy is exercised, especially when it comes to manage crises.
The debate is closed.
I now turn to the second point, because we intend to regulate the sector, we must obviously examine a number of points.
In the course of the last few weeks, I have discovered a vested interest on the part of both international trade unions that a number of trade union organisations.
The second objection, so you are favourable to the payment of a salary for women at home?
All those who are currently engaged in undeclared work e.g. employment in decent social conditions.
Furthermore, this project has also enabled two to three families to combine to create a whole employment household help.
We were met in plenary in this first part-session of October, when we learned, at the time of our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia, the brave reaction of the Serbian people and immediately, you will remember, ladies and gentlemen, we have asked for the lifting of international sanctions.
In so doing, Europe has demonstrated the vitality of its civilisation in the history of the world and a creative political capacity geared towards the future.
There can be no doubt about the fact that the issue of the status of Kosovo is a democratic question.
Furthermore, we would like to have a chance to prove to the Europe that we are able to develop only the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro in Yugoslavia, recognising the genuine democratic principles.
I must say that I had been - I was listening to you - very impressed by your mastery of a situation Oh! how difficult, as well as by your determination.
This will be settled in the next Minutes, Mr Watson.
Access to documents and information relating to the activities of the institutions enables citizens to put the bodies of the European Union before their responsibilities and stimulates reflecting greater efficiency.
A fifth important amendment, in my view, is the one concerning the annual report, which must particularly deal with the documents to remain secret, or at least that remains secret.
Things are not clear on this point, and it is not impossible that we can also remain in force more restrictive provisions, but particularly on this point that we have tabled amendments.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, for its part, is opposed to the idea that the documents relating to issues of foreign and security policy should be automatic and comprehensive way, an exception to this rule of public scrutiny.
If we want the citizens can really defend their rights, these places of information require well-trained staff who take in some way by the hand of the citizens in search of information and which serve their guides within the complex labyrinth of the institutions.
These are essential if we are to avoid so-called transparency boils down to transparency for beginners.
It must be welcomed that the European Parliament has succeeded in bringing together a broad majority in favour of greater transparency.
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work.
Mr President, openness and transparency in the European Union are not looking a favourable day.
If this is the case, it would then be a bad calculation, credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens who are at stake here.
The concept of documents is various forms of our days and we will ensure that access is the broadest possible for the greatest possible number of documents and for the most various types of documents.
Mr President, we know the position of the Commission on public access to documents in reading the internal manual, which was submitted, on 11 October, the Commission's officials in order to explain the way in which they were to deal with the requests from the Members regarding access to documents.
This point of the regulation must be abolished or at least be supplemented by the obligation of taking account of the interests at stake.
The old models of international cooperation with all their old habits and diplomatic rules of the game in which everything happens behind closed doors are no longer in the kind of modern cooperation that the EU has become.
We must not make confuse this objective and the role of Parliament, or with future interinstitutional agreements.
I consider that a step has been done towards the possibility for citizens to exercise their right to information and knowledge.
It is, however, not only that I would like to thank: Mrs Maij-Weggen itself, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and by means of the enhanced Hughes procedure is the second author of the report, also deserves warm thanks.
Transparency must become the mainstay of the activity of the European Union, but the right of access to documents is not enough in itself to make transparency a reality.
The European Parliament asks, therefore, that the European security and defence policy to be included in the future in the structures of the European Commission.
In his speech to the European Parliament, on 3 October last, President Prodi referred to the institutional triangle and pointed out that, in a European system based on checks and balances, the flow of operation of each institution contributed to the common interest.
I must admit that the great challenge of this regulation is to give a precise definition of the documents.
I would like to stress that the Commission could, when the time comes, almost all the amendments, such as Amendments Nos 9, 18 and 21 in part, and Amendments Nos 23, 25, 26.1, 28 F, 35, 38, 40.1 and 40.6, 42, 41.1 and 43.1, 47, 49 and 52.
I would like to vote sometimes in favour of the proposals made by the Commission, and for that reason it is essential that Members have the list of the amendments that the Commission can support and that of the amendments that she does not want to support.
Fund of clean banks
Finally, and this is a more controversial topic, the Committee has called with vigour to make use of the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.
These amendments replace different proposals in the report, which will probably be rejected in the vote and which will therefore be replaced by the new amendments from this consensus.
Mr President, in the light of the excellent vote of support this report has received, and given the reply of the Commission this morning, it appears as obvious - recital all of the parties on which we have voted - on the basis of Article 69, paragraph 2, we should postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution, to enable us to initiate fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council.
Mr President, I am sorry to have said that the PPE-DE Group had also have liked to see evening 's vote postponed, but it is you, Mr Coordinateur, which came tell me that you prefer that the matter be postponed until the second November part-session, rather than to vote for this evening.
The reason why I would suggest that we bring the vote is, as Mr Goebbels has said, that this is a very important subject.
I do not know how the roll-call vote costs, but it is undoubtedly of hundreds of thousands of francs, or Belgian francs, of our budget.
I know that in France, the principle of slaughter of the whole herd has been applied, and that this does not seem to be the best way to combat this phenomenon.
to remove the animal meal of animal feeds, not only of cattle and sheep, but also of pigs, poultry, fish;
This is not acceptable.
It is through measures such as elsewhere that consumers will be reassured and that farmers will hear the message of solidarity that we want to convey to them.
We must go further as a matter of urgency, it is necessary to change the common agricultural policy.
The ban on using animal meal as feedingstuffs is only the first step in this direction.
We greatly regret, however, that the amendments tabled by our group have not been adopted.
I believe that it would be logical that working hours of those who work in polluting companies should be reduced.
I would like to conclude by stressing once again on the fact that the generalisation of the exploitation of hazardous waste must not lead us to live with the production of such waste.
Indeed, if pensions, for example, were less weak, there would be less poor.
The report envisages a package of EUR 100 million over five years to reduce the poverty.
I fully support the proposal to implement a Luxembourg process plus in the field of social exclusion, containing guidelines and national action plans.
In fact, the report calls for the establishment of qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion.
In submitting its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission responds to the appeal made by the Council to submit 'by June 2000' a 'initiative of cooperation in this area'.
Mr President, I abstained for a very specific reason: in my opinion, this report has not done, from the ecological point of view, the progress that I had hoped and wanted.
I hope that such a system should be extended to all the cities of Europe.
Certain proposals of the European Parliament are unrealistic and cannot receive my accession.
We must also succeed in the future to do better known the best existing practices.
The high-wage mindful of the environment should be offered the opportunity, in a liberalised market, voluntarily to contribute to cleaner energy, while for others, everything still remains as before.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
These three reasons are the following: firstly, because it moves in the direction of the process of consolidating democracy and in that of strengthening the requirement of respect for human rights, particularly with regard to the indigenous peoples.
Mr President, in this debate, we wish to express, as quite rightly said the other Members who have spoken before me, solidarity and the support of this House in the parliament of Central America, at a time when we are struggling to be maintained the priority in the framework of the European Union's external relations with the countries of Latin America.
I am not the reservations that has been able to express our comrade and dear friend, the chairman of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, Mr Seguro, with regard to the issue of human rights.
Finally, in its dialogue with the authorities in Central America, the Commission again stresses the importance which must be given to the process of regional integration, as an instrument of consolidation of democratisation and the development of the region.
To cling to power it has not hesitated to grab the nagging debate on the ‘ ', causing an outbreak of xenophobia: hatred on the other, from abroad, the Burkinabé or Mali, and yet they are many to live and work on the Ivorian soil for many years.
The establishment of a real democracy in Côte d'Ivoire now cannot be done without the institution of an independent committee of inquiry into the crimes committed and without the official commitment to uphold human rights and civil peace.
Some believe that the importance of democracy is relative when it comes to Africa, complex procedures, that we must leave time and, I believe that there is no possible compromise with democracy and the question today for Côte d'Ivoire is the same as that which arises, for example for Guinea, where we now know that there are people who are imprisoned and that there is no democratic system.
I shall end with this: the dictatorships will implement, Mr President, because there are people who are suffering from poverty, which do not have access to knowledge, who do not have access to knowledge.
It would not be illogical that the European Union now requires new presidential elections which all the candidates could this time participate.
In very many parts of Africa, we are faced with ethnic and religious brassages very different.
These elections must allow the representation, at national level, political parties that have been excluded in the presidential election and compensate, thus, even if only partially, the imperfections of this first election.
on the situation in Burma.
The authorities are conducting a major offensive directed against the Shan people and Karen, and as the rapporteur has pointed out of the United Nations, there is no sign of dialogue between the SDPC and the NLD.
That is why, we reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.
I hope that, by giving an urgent and priority to this issue, Parliament is sending to the Burmese people a clear message, meaning that its desperate situation is not forgotten, not are aware of the fact that in Burma, it is getting worse rather than improve, and that we are determined to try to change the course of events.
This took a long time.
In Asia, the danger that the economic and political reforms should be decoupled, that liberalization and economic progress arise without liberalisation of the sector policy and without strengthening the rule of law, although I am of the opinion that, eventually, the absence of the rule of law is detrimental to trade, subsidies and investment.
Mr President, I can join the previous speakers on many of the key points, because many things that are happening in Vietnam today are unacceptable.
However, the publication Human Rights Watch, that Mr Swoboda was quoted, says that Vietnam has recently done certain efforts to improve its situation from the point of view of human rights.
These highly confidential documents we provide a view curious on the scenes of the policy pursued by the Vietnamese authorities.
The Commission remains convinced, however, that a lasting solution to the present situation cannot be achieved by means of a dialogue between the military regime, the opposition democratically elected and representatives of the ethnic minorities.
The Vietnamese authorities exert clear pressure on the press of the country to adopt a regime of self-censorship.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
We also call on the EU to lend aid and assistance, not only in the south-west of England, but also to all the other regions affected.
I would ask you all to support our resolution.
There is an urgent need for the Union to stop confine ourselves to exceptional speeches when disasters have arrived.
The Commission has taken two initiatives in this direction.
Mr President, an error of purely linguistic has crept in one of the amendments to the joint resolution.
A postponement of the vote would mean a postponement of the mission entrusted to the Commission.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The report is based on the observation that a proportion of increasing health insurance in Europe is covered by systems of supplementary sickness insurance.
I find it a little strange to try to now force the Commission to a motion for a resolution and ask him in a same time to establish a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and health insurance complementary.
At a time when the ageing of the population is sensitive, it is essential that we attempt to improve the health care system in Europe.
We obviously cannot give it our backing.
Mr President, there are undeniable arguments in favour of the accelerated procedure for the implementation of the Basle review on the capital adequacy.
As regards the sense of urgency that Mrs Villiers has added to the feeling of necessity of the Commission by calling like to see a fast-track procedure for the adoption of these measures, it is obliged to note that the rapporteur himself acknowledges that this new regulation will not taken on anti-competitive practices which, unfortunately, is unfortunately widespread in the United States.
We must also ensure that the Basle decisions do not lead, by an increase in capital requirements, a second drawback for banks.
That being said, I believe, and I would like to stress this, that the economic operators are also satisfied with the approach given to these regulations on capital, which strengthen the issues relating to the risk.
These are a few ideas on how we might reach a quick legislative process, controllable and effective in the context of the current regulations of the Treaty.
Indeed, the time has come to recognise that the institution of the 'European Ombudsman has experienced enough and that it has already brought enough evidence of its maturity to have its own budget.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, joined to say that the powers of the Ombudsman must be extended, and that the sooner the better, particularly in the area of investigative powers of the Ombudsman, set out in Article 3 of the 1994 decision.
An Ombudsman is, of course, subject to the rules of confidentiality, but for citizens, it is good to know that one or one which fulfils this function may have access to the documents to which them, as citizens, do not have access.
The report tabled was therefore seeks to the recommendation by the Ombudsman to the Commission to allow the candidates and candidates in the contests organised by it to consult their corrected papers.
We believe that the Community institutions should carry out their recruitment procedures for staff, that all recruitment procedures, with a maximum publicity and transparency, in order to avoid any suspicion of partiality, injustice or administrative incompetence.
I am referring to an amendment concerning the requirement of the indisputable proof of the conduct of an oral test, for example.
Mr Bösch has already explained here briefly the amendments to the report.
I asked two questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal competitions, and I have received its share of the precise and detailed answers.
This is the beginning of a process of openness and transparency in the way of government.
Firstly, the corrections of examinations organised by the Commission are still anonymously.
It is, of course, of July 2000.
VOTE
(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone vote)
. (DE) During the evaluation of the directive on own resources of credit institutions, it must look closely several interests which are in conflict.
This is the way to born the idea of a European Police College for the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries.
That is the position defended by the rapporteur and shared by the European People's Party.
The social situation in most of the Member States of the European Union is currently likely that the need for cross-border cooperation between the various police services is actually important.
The majority of the speakers who have spoken until now seem to think that it is essential that the College has a permanent seat.
The umpteenth provisional decision, but not precarious, the gift that the Council is used to make to this Parliament.
The rapporteur would like to see more prevention of crime, assistance, innovative developments and border surveillance and also wants to change the internal security to include respect for the law and order.
This were the ideals that they would advocate us, and that was the kind of state for which they working.
I would be in favour of a balance of standards in some Member States of the European Union.
Since the initial reflections on this issue, which took place at European level at the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission is committed towards the Member States to promote action to develop what we could consider it as a police European culture, focused on the highest standards in the field of ethics, respect for the rights and freedoms of the people, and effectiveness in the fight against crime.
It inclines for the development of a Police College, above all, in an intergovernmental perspective.
For the reasons stated above, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report.
. (SV) I have voted against the report on the provisional establishing the European Police College.
It is clear that many of our courts are very slow and heavy and that it is very difficult to act quickly in the face of these problems.
Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, the fact that it is still linked to the Rules of Procedure "Brussels II 'which excludes children whose parents are pending divorce, as well as the children designed out of wedlock.
My mother has known such a divorce and abduction 85 years ago and it always talking.
I would therefore like to tell the House that, in the action programme on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions in civil matters - which we hope will be adopted before the end of this year - the Commission proposes that the first and the main priority to be given to extending the scope of application of the regulation of Bruxelles-II and, consequently, this regulation on the right to visit, to cover without any discrimination children from married couples and children from unmarried couples.
We shall now proceed to the vote
Nowadays, sport - it has to be said, is closely linked to other economic sectors such as the audiovisual industry or the promotion and sale of sports products.
What we need is an intelligent and flexible way to interpret the existing rules.
That is to say, a real violation of democracy, even if we avoid look at things from this point of view.
The Commission expects therefore soon to receive an answer to his request detailed information regarding the measures laid down by the British Government.
The proposal was initiated by the Chancellor of the board in a statement made before the examination of the budget, six months before the declaration of a full budget of spring 2001.
Again, I thought that what was said by Mr Simpson really has served to reassure us as regards the probable intentions of the British Government.
Traffic jams are we not only lose a lot of time, but they are a problem for the whole of the environment and I therefore believe that if the British Government actually commits the funds needed to solving these problems, it is for the benefit of everyone and in particular of all European citizens.
We are more or less the only oil producers in the European Union and yet we are facing the price of petrol and diesel the highest of all the countries of Europe - GBP ``equilibrium the litre of diesel in the UK.
The debate is closed.
The European Parliament must make them to know that it is on their side, and I suggest, once again, to observe the silence that expresses our solidarity and our feelings.
Madam President, it is totally support, since I am part of those who have requested the inclusion of this point.
We have made good progress.
The Union will deepen its relations with all of the major groups and, as soon as possible, contact the new American administration.
Given the remarkably brilliant record of Mr Prescott on the way in which he had negotiated itself, how come not only Mrs Voynet, but also, I believe, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, most of the other EU environment ministers have rejected this?
What can be feared, is that the momentum will be lost, that the US negotiators do not change, and everything is to begin again in May.
This time it is the forests which have proved the main stumbling block.
If this warming is continuing, part of the territory of the countries of the European Union will become sea or desert.
The standard of living is high and the price of oil products low.
I congratulate Commissioner Wallström for her efforts in The Hague and wish to have more chance.
Without doubt, was better to have no agreement only have an agreement that is bad and, in this case, the American proposal was a proposal to the rebate, totally unacceptable for Europe.
The climate changes have important consequences in the developing countries.
I repeat this idea in its wording English: Forest turns from being carbon sinks "carbon sources.
Only this credibility will enable the European Union to guide the rhetoric and the action of the COP 6 'B' in Bonn.
We must make our own evaluation of what has happened and prepare the documents for establishing contacts with various parties and, of course, with the 'umbrella group'.
Of course, the continuation of the forthcoming COP 6 or the continuation of the COP 6 will be the ratification of an agreement within the Union.
Before the European Council, we will take further next Sunday, Pierre Moscovici and myself, a ministerial conclave, in which I invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, as well as a session of the IGC, on Monday on the occasion of the General Affairs Council.
The minimum number of Member States participating should be set at eight, while the clause appeal to the European Council, which is currently a genuine right of veto, would be replaced by a right to mention.
We can regret, but I am obliged to make this observation.
The European Council will discuss the state of progress of accession negotiations, and therefore of enlargement.
The Lisbon European Council had approved guidelines designed to promote an innovative and competitive European economy.
The protection of consumers is a growing concern of the Europeans, for obvious reasons that I do not need to develop.
We must be prepared for this enormous enlargement.
That is, in the final analysis, the yardstick to which we will have to judge the Nice Summit.
(Applause)
The first is that the candidate countries must adopt and implement the acquis communautaire, but the task that they share with us.
We are deeply attached to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we do not just want to proclaim the.
Admittedly, the text could have been better, and we can improve and clarify after Nice.
I find it simply unacceptable that several governments have simply swept to the table the issue of the inclusion of a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty.
You do not want to incorporate in the Treaty, which demonstrates that this text should be set aside.
We speak with a single voice Language‒describes within the WTO.
Given the prospects bleak success of the Intergovernmental Conference, I believe that it would not be appropriate to add to the agenda this complex and controversial issue.
I urge the French Presidency to should do everything in its power to bridge the gap particularly destructive.
The Commission, in the area of trade policy, drew up a proposal which must be carefully examined.
Although the previous Treaty has made some progress in terms of the extension of the formula, it has also introduced this senseless formula of the codecision procedure with unanimity for citizenship, social security, the rights of independent persons and also the cultural policy.
The simple fact that this issue be raised in itself shows clearly the absence of a policy of strengthening of ties of mutual trust between the countries which make up the Union.
It is precisely in this situation that the Intergovernmental Conference bogged down for months, because no one wants to relinquish its toy.
The experience of this year we say that the developments to provide - after Nice, looking towards the future of Europe - the process of constitutionalisation of the Union must not be entrusted to the method now obsolete confidential negotiation between the representatives of the governments.
If the majority does not become the rule, the decision-making process be bogged down in the mire inevitably, as has just to point out so rightly Mr Prodi.
If this aspect of subsidiarity is very important, we have not heard in the debate today.
That is what we have done, the enlargement of 1995 was adopted, we moved on the reflection group wisely chaired by Carlos Westerdorp, Amsterdam has happened, we are now on the eve of the Nice Conference and the situation has hardly changed, Mr President: we go back to the institutional problems, unresolved that will enable us to complete an ambitious task, I want to talk about enlargement to 27.
Let us not add to the disappointment that is going to cause Nice, if the Council naturally proves unsuccessful, the great disappointment that our Parliament cause among the peoples.
In the past, we have proved that it is possible to achieve this goal and, coming from a Member State that has received a draft planned transition towards accession, I very much hope that we shall succeed in an enlarged Europe and peaceful.
But we must realise that, if you have the right of veto, all the others have also.
But there will have to be a first transition in view of the elections in 2004, because a number of new Member States will join us before or during this parliamentary term run until 2009.
The President-in-Office of the Council has addressed the issue of closer cooperation and he said that the move towards a consensus on this.
Mr President, primarily, Nice relates to the necessary reforms and on the leftovers in the prospect of enlargement.
If we enjoyed only a few features of this mentality, if we insist less on the things that are going wrong in our continent and a little more on the things that go, we would be a little more glad that now.
We must not only extend qualified majority voting in force in the Council of Ministers for the transport of goods, we must include services, investment, intellectual property and competition which are linked and adapt accordingly Article 133 paragraph 1 of the Treaty.
In fact, the granting of such a right to the European Parliament also leave the way open to the arbitrary nature of the policy of party on this issue ultra sensitive.
So we must also, as said one of you, referring to the American optimism and the way in which the Americans speak for themselves, we must also be able to recognise the value what works and what advance.
I would also like to say that I do not believe that there is a problem between large and small countries.
We have worked hard, but we are up against this old problem, and I do not believe that the development can be triggered by the movement of one country, because we come up against the realities, once again, national, political, democratic, very strong in twelve out of fifteen countries.
Finally, Mr President Védrine, you noted perhaps too tense situation and talked about a certain degree of pessimism.
In general, could you take measures aimed at strengthening the security so that such events cannot be repeated?
I believe that we must take measures that we have not yet taken so far, so that the guests of this Parliament feel here as hosts, and do not have to fear of threats.
Hospitalité here, hospitality and respect there.
I would like to thank you for your contribution, Mr Tajani.
The best tribute to Ernest Lluch and his memory would be to respect its message - dìaleg in Catalan. Can we all give it its chance in the Basque Country?
Of course, on the other hand, everyone can express its opinion.
B5-0550/2000 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Council, on the political situation and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan.
When I speak of organisation, I am also thinking of the European Union making so great efforts and which, in my opinion, must obtain can take responsibility for it.
In the second place, you will see in the resolution, the very clear desire of the House to pin the security and defence policy on two pillars balanced: civil crisis management and, in the case of failure, the military management, the two pillars being complementary.
Mr President, given the delay which has been made and my duties, after, I shall try to shorten a little the speech I had prepared.
These relations will take in particular the form of meetings between the North Atlantic Council and COPSI, and meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European countries that are candidates and/or allies.
Take, for example, what has happened in the Balkans, where we can say that everyone has played its part fully.
We have also in this period very taken by the United States informed of the current developments under the European security and defence policy, which is a sine qua non condition to ensure that it develops harmoniously, as is the case at the moment.
The second edition of the European Union's annual report on human rights has been presented to the European Parliament. A human rights forum will be held in Paris on 13 December.
This policy, you say, has not ambition to compete with the Atlantic Alliance, which remains today the basis of the collective defence of its members, or to set up a permanent European army.
On the other hand, if I mentioned the figure of 100 000 soldiers, this does not mean that we endeavour to exceed the objective set in Helsinki, but that we have a reserve qualifications and different specialities which enables us to ensure that the 60 000 men in the aim of the Council would be achieved, whatever the operational conditions of their jobs.
Allow me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to mention in a few words the profound political sense, approved by a large part of our public opinion, of this new task in which Europe acquires a tool of political influence lacking.
The problem which we now face is to ensure that, when we talk of consolidating liberal democracy in Europe, we consider the whole of the continent of Europe, as this is the aim of enlargement and the process of enlargement.
We need to incorporate a coherent three distinct elements: Community policies, the CFSP (including the ESDP) and the action of the Member States.
In spite of our laborious procedures, we do not need a force of 60 000 men to fulfil our objectives.
We must therefore put urgently in place a solution of humanitarian aid.
I do not agree with the cynics who claim that Europe is becoming provide for a toy unusable, but it is true that, in many situations, the rapid reaction force will not be mobilised directly.
The EU must not equip itself with a own defence with fixed staff.
To conclude, I shall express the deep concern that the members of my group and myself feel in the face of the constant deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan. I would like to urge the Commission and the Council to do everything possible to intensify efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement and help the civilian populations, particularly now, with the onset of winter.
To tell things very simply: where, when and under what conditions the European intervention power qualities enter into action in the future?
It enables us to understand the appalling record of these two months of the Intifada: 270 deaths, most of them Palestinian, and nearly 10 000 injured, often disabled for life.
Hence his relentless efforts to set up an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction can no longer be dismal.
In the second place, contrary to what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it is possible or desirable that the European Union should make more than it has done already in the face of the conflict and the escalation of violence that knows the Middle East, particularly now, in this period of transition that cross the United States.
Mr President, in my speech I shall focus on the report by Mrs Lalumière, report that I think it is well thought-out and clearly formulated.
But there is no political concept and there is still no real common foreign and security policy.
The only problem in the EU is that so far, it has not managed to obtain the interests of public opinion for this type of action despite the fact that they are considerably more sustainable and more effective.
Mr President, there still remains, of course, the budget and the question of how the distribute.
I say this in spite of the bulk of the outward reassurances that have been put forward miraculously on the subject over the last few days.
For the moment, this capacity we lack seriously and we must, at the end of the day, that the Member States are studying their spending programmes in the field of defence which differ enormously from one country to another.
Even those who are concerned about the usefulness, which can result of such a decision to create what we call on the European army must consider the important political aspect of this decision and its influence on the cohesion of the European Union.
The presence of a Minister for Defence, for the first time in this House is a historic event such that we have reserved you the night sitting for our Members are not too impressed.
For all these conflicts, a non-military crisis management as a pre-emptive measure is better than a military management.
Russia intend, long term, remain united to an undemocratic regime?
Therefore, Europe is not going to represent a new alliance, as I have heard mention, I believe, by a development incomplètement informed.
I have received a motion for a resolution, pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure, to wind up this debate.
Given the scale of the task, four committees were involved and an unprecedented procedure has been put in place, with four parallel reports.
The package of measures proposed in the White Paper must contribute to modernise and make effective operation of the Commission.
It would be a good thing that the reform is the opportunity to limit their intervention in the only areas which do not involve expenditure.
The differences of appreciation which have arisen are not only political, but even more reflect the cultural differences between the Fifteen.
The new internal audit service, under your direct responsibility, Mr Kinnock, Vice-President responsible for reform, will have as the main task of the analysis of the functions and internal control systems that exist within the Commission.
Working together has been a pleasure, and I think that the fact that we have been all the four involved has deepened and enriched the process of treatment of a crucial reform of the Commission reform, which is essential for the future of the European Union.
They can expect to be transferred to other European institutions, to be freed among the national governments or to work in the private sector.
Therefore, our Committee on Constitutional Affairs rappelle-t-elle its commitment to a strong Commission, which is independent, efficient, transparent and politically responsible.
As the Committee on Budgets, we believe that activity-based budgeting problem because of the lack of visibility of expenditure and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority.
This will mark evident, the good will of this Parliament in relation to the implementation of this reform with the Commission.
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work.
It is a disgrace when we think that the European Union raises champion of the modernisation of economic life!
Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteurs to support the work of the Commission, it has not yet made a global and coherent response of the Committee of Independent Experts, which aims response a policy for the management and not only better administration of the institution.
This change in attitude must be translated into a transparency in the administration.
In my view, there is no structure whose importance is more we are fifteen nations, tomorrow twenty or more, an entire continent, the part of the world more mechanised, who live in the Union, and, in the Commission and its structures.
The change is never easy.
In so doing, however, the Socialist Group believes that the current functioning of the Community public administration is quite efficient.
The result is known and attracts the dedication and the competence of the majority of the components of the Commission and its administration.
Many thousands of requests for projects are awaiting a assessment for more than a year.
The debate, as we have seen, is not so much on the principles, the objectives or the opportunity of the reform on the procedures, the pace, the timetable and the possible malfunctions or unwanted consequences of its implementation.
I would like to begin by inform the House - as Mr Van Hulten has mentioned earlier - that the meeting of the College of this morning adopted the proposal of the Interinstitutional Agreement establishing an advisory committee of standards governing public life, such as the exposes the action 1 of the action plan of the White Paper.
I think that Mr van Hulten has once again stressed this point during the debate.
The main objective of this overhaul is to simplify the procedures, to increase the transparency and to strengthen the budgetary rules, which will result in practical terms by a reduction in the number of exceptions and special arrangements incomprehensible and, consequently, greater efficiency in terms of the budgetary procedure.
It is, in fact, little economic to the Commission that the texts provide for a payment of 20% for the costs X and 30% for the costs Y and then, there is regrouping and verification of evidence for small amounts.
The next item is the report (A5-0337/2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations [2000/2051(INI)].
These aspects particularly affect NGOs.
Of course, this is not enough, but we must nonetheless shelter cartoons on the weakness of our development aid.
We will return to this matter, because this is in itself a framework of quality.
Mr President, I returned today in Mozambique, the country where the European Union has provided humanitarian aid of high quality in the wake of the floods, reconstruction projects for which the funds have already been allocated are, once again, delayed pending a signature in Brussels.
In view of these realities, the need for greater involvement and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is essential.
We now have a harmonised framework for the development of the country strategy papers and the indicative programmes of cooperation in all developing countries.
What is more, the creation of SEM did not put an end to the disparity that existed between eight larger administrative resources.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, if I particularly wanted to be with you today for this debate on the first package maritime in the European Parliament, it is because you are going to examine three important texts, which are a first, crucial step on a subject that recent events have unfortunately put on the agenda of the topicality.
This could allow, moreover, from the point of view of the Presidency of the Council, to discuss with the Member States in order to obtain an agreement in the Council on the basis of your proposals and to adopt the text at first reading, if necessary the qualified majority.
This rapid and targeted response, embodied by the two trains from Erika measures and the six proposals, has launched an important momentum.
The lesson must retain this House in its debate this morning is that we are forced to conclude that the maritime laws are in the world, in a state of mess, and that we must get down to the task of up.
We must send a clear signal to ships will not be responding to the standards of safety and mean that we do not tolerate in European waters or in European ports.
For small tankers, we are adopting a position of compromise between the ceiling of 5 000 tonnes that had set the IMO and the issue of 600 tonnes that the Commission has set.
These data will have to be put at the disposal of the European authorities, the Member States and port, as well as the public interest.
The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region, requires the creation of a Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution.
The environmental organisations are also involved in the cooperation at local level.
Changing the directive in the direction of a more rigorous in its application, harmonisation of legislation, particularly with regard to the selection of vessels subject to inspection, and the scope of the different types of inspection, is clearly positive.
I should like to point out that the urgent procedure that you are invoking now does not take place.
As regards the limits of liability of classification societies, it is important to my mind that the Council and Parliament expand reflection, regardless of what will be decided today.
A black box, a black list, all the things that we are dealing with actively, despite all I would like to highlight a few points.
In response to this catastrophic situation and anarchic manner of maritime transport, Europe has risen to the challenge and, eleven months after the Erika, the European Union will be able to announce that procedure never will have been worked as quickly.
One measure how the liberal logic opposes a high level of maritime safety.
Whatever, finally, the technical measures which will be taken, one of the major sources of insecurity will remain as long as we will not have rebalanced, in the Channel zone and Atlantic, the exponential growth of trafficking linked to the hypertrophy of ports in the North Sea.
It would be to the credit of the President-in-Office of the Council on the basis of cleaning up its own act, also in his own country.
Madam President, since the sinking of the oil tanker Erika, a package of measures has seen the light of day, under political pressure, in order to improve the safety of ships in the sea.
Greek vessels flowed, without any storm in around, Mr Gayssot.
Thirdly, I believe that it is becoming clear, in this type of dossiers, that there is no relationship between our oil supplies, on the one hand, and the fact that we always use fossil fuels on the other.
Let us therefore finally the political courage to our ecological ambitions.
That is to say that, in this field more than in any other, our responsibility is large, and we must, it seems to me, to silence any self-respecting institutional.
From the point of view of Finland, for example, it is crucial that Russia is part of these agreements.
I am thinking of both the strengthening of requirements concerning the standards for the construction of oil tankers, the improvement of rules for the control of ports, and also, therefore, to the closer regulations applicable to classification societies of vessels.
Madam President, today we are talking about maritime safety on the basis of three reports which I warmly congratulate the rapporteurs.
With regard to these three new proposals on maritime safety, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs, who have, in a very short time, demonstrated how our Parliament is determined to adopt new measures to improve safety at sea, controls, standards for the construction and shown that it is no longer tolerable that similar accidents from happening again.
Madam President, our continent has recently been struck by a series of maritime disasters wide-ranging, particularly involving oil tankers.
More than 80% of accidents are linked to human error, but there are reasons for human error, which are social order.
A or a parliamentary used the word 'traceability'.
The Directive on control by the port state is designed to verify the respect of international requirements and not to introduce new regulations.
Amendment No 18 binds port state control to the rest periods for seamen, even if the application of the provisions on working hours of seafarers is already fully covered by the directive 99/95.
I am pleased to see that the rapporteur has introduced a reference in Amendment No 21, the special system of control, and I mark our agreement with the main idea of this approach, but nevertheless stresses that the wording should be tightened up in order to clarify matters.
Amendment No 4 and the part of Amendment No 18 on the point K are not acceptable.
I can assure you that if a shipowner refer to registering a ship under these flags, it would do well to reconsider in the light of our proposal.
The Commissioner has spoken for 18 minutes, and over all this time, it has cited dozens and dozens of articles, and it has declined the position of the Commission.
Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision on a set of actions relating to the trans-European network of collection, production and dissemination of statistics on the deadlines for intra-European and extra-Community assets (EDICOM) (COM (00) 0458 - C5-0401/00 - 2000/0201(COD)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)
By withdrawing our resolution, I nevertheless expresses the conviction that our Parliament would have done better its voice heard in devoting, in view of the Nice European Council, a specific and separate resolution to the issues so important and so difficult for the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than dealt with in the context of a single resolution including also all the other items on the agenda for the Council.
(More than twelve Members standing, the oral amendment is not retained) (Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0337/2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000/2051(INI))
I voted against in protest against the fact that the European Union does not yet manages to act as it should do so in this area.
Although the proposal to amend the existing directive on the control of ships as the Watts report does not meet the real needs, they represent some progress in the right direction. For these reasons, we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have voted in favour of the report.
We can thus lament the fact that the Commission's proposal has not taken on board the idea of creating a genuine European Corps of surveillance, on the model of the 'coast guards' in the United States.
The safety of ships, the protection of life at sea and the environment require that we are attacking the unaccountability shipowners, that we take very strict measures for the control of the state of the ship and imposing severe penalties to shipping companies which violate safety rules, which improves the conditions of seafarers, gives an appropriate training and guarantee on-board staff which meet the increased needs of vessels.
Unfortunately, the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis the opposite.
The sinking of the Erika accident in December 1999 has been at the root of the emergence of the issue of maritime safety in the Community policy agenda, and it is under pressure from the European Parliament, that the European Commission has proposed the texts that we have voted on today, almost a year after this sinister shipwreck.
The existing compensation funds have been badly fed, and this is transpired that all too clear in the case of the disaster Braer, following which the fishing industry of the Shetland Islands has been too little compensated in comparison of damages incurred.
I have already said, Madam President, that in the past I have had the opportunity to sail.
The rapporteur's proposals aimed at harmonising the European level can only be positive.
It is an important aspect, since it relates to the classification societies of vessels.
This would be a great success, because the Europe that we need, on the eve of enlargement, is not a rigid, hierarchy supranational Europe, distant, but a Europe that is flexible and close to the people, based on respect for national democracies.
The struggle for power that are engaged increasingly openly many Member States cloud the prospect of any compromise.
The Nice Summit main task will be to ensure the effectiveness of the institutions of the EU.
In a week of the summit, I personally optimistic!
I am not in favour of an automatic link between QMV and codecision and, here too, I believe that any decision designed to extend the powers of codecision should be considered on a case by case.
In changing Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe extend qualified majority voting, currently in force in the Council for the trade in products, to other areas such as public services, intellectual property, health or education.
Thus, Parliament is forbidden to exert an influence, it is falling to the voice and remains silent in the name of fidelity partisan, national and government, and forgetting its obligations towards the citizens.
I also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty, which will be adopted in Nice.
The share the European Union teams A and B is a mistake, and I therefore disagree with the idea to allow a third of the Member States to pre-empt the others.
Its new role has put an end to the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.
There are many aspects to which the British Conservative Group can support in this report, in particular the insistence on the enlargement of the Union.
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have chosen to support the report on the establishment of a common European security and defence policy.
But also against the peoples of the European Union, which will, in any case, to finance the new defence expenditure advocated in the report and which will not even the guarantee that these military forces are not a day used against them, in the name of the 'policing'.
It is also serious to insist that a state is not wishing to take part in a mission should be forced to pay a financial contribution which will be divided between the Member States who are involved in this war.
The external military resources do not provide solution, because it does not remove the origin of the conflict and does not change the public.
· the fact that the military operations would be financed by a line of the Community budget and that the Member States would have to contribute financially to the operations, even if they do not wish to take part (paragraphs 49 and 50)
The EU would, on the contrary, advantage to amend the priorities laid down in the framework of the Petersberg tasks and it should concentrate its efforts on the implementation of civil and humanitarian tasks.
I support the report by my colleague Mrs Maj-Britt Theorin.
But it mentions the needs of this category to get the demand for tax deductibility of domestic services' and a 'adaptation of prices and costs to the financial possibilities of individuals'.
It is incredible that we still had to recommend to the 21st century that the Member States should guarantee to domestic employees the right to social security and pensions.
For many young people, the first contact with the labour market is likely to take the form of employment in the black economy.
Things are getting worse when it is a matter of women from distant countries which have accepted this work by necessity and which have no alternative to continue to provide for their vital needs.
The reform of the Commission will be judged on coins, hence the need for monitoring reports of regular that the European Commission will present for the duration of the programme and the importance of the complete assessment expected in December 2002.
In a still recent past, various scandals and malfunctions led, in March 1999, the resignation of the European Commission.
Finally, I believe it essential to remind you that, through this reform, which is essential for the future, we expect both more rigorous and more transparency in the Commission in its daily management, but also a greater sense of responsibility on its part, in the strict framework of the powers devolved upon.
The Conservatives also support the affirmation of paragraph 7 of this report that we must ensure democratic control and the operation of the system in three pillars.
(The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)
We have learned - and I would like to add immediately that I cannot believe - that the President of the Council and of the French Republic will be present tomorrow for thirty minutes, in order to take the floor.
Therefore, I believe that it is out of the question that we have a thorough and substantiated position.
But itself, let's vote, and I am a supporter of a resolution as suggested Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others.
It has worked on these texts even in the night, as well as on the figures relating to the weighting of votes in the Council and the distribution of seats in our House.
Madam President, I would very much like to speak in favour of maintaining the report by Mr de Roo on the agenda because it has been very well prepared and must be the subject of a common position at the last Council of Ministers the environment of the French Presidency, which will take place next Monday and Tuesday.
Thank you, Mr Parish.
In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy - that Mr Brok chairs - he smokes in the sitting.
The political basis is clear: harmonise the market by taking account of a high level of protection of public health and of consumers, based on the existing regulation and promoting the scientific point of view.
It is about their conditions and conception of life, in which the protection of health becomes increasingly important.
This rule can, moreover, apply to all drugs récréationnelles but dangerous provided that the consumer of drugs is the only run the risks.
Yesterday, the United States, trials have been won against the tobacco multinationals for poisoning and lie on the non-toxicité of products.
With regard to the export by the EU of cigarettes banned, for health reasons, within the Union, we believe that the only sensible solution and is logical to put a stop to it.
Rather than draw lessons from failure in Luxembourg, on 9 October last year, we persist in a legally indefensible attitude.
I have carefully examined the statements made by the Commissioner addressed to my colleague Mr Hume: 'No loss of jobs on a massive scale in this sector.
It is Parliament and the Council to approve this proposal for a directive and to examine, among other things, its appropriate legal basis.
I do not think that we can borrow a limited way, that is to say that, regardless of the content, and the substantial highlighted Mr Maaten and others - runs the risk that, if this Parliament and the Council will accept the restrictive interpretation proposed by the leader of the European People 's Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and all the Community institutions find themselves bound hand and foot at the level of the legislative development of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law.
The weak point of the proposal is that it places the emphasis strongly on the promotion of free competition.
I would say in conclusion that, since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has the power of coordination in the field of the environment and consumer protection, and that it is obviously will work in close cooperation with the Council and the Commission on these matters.
In fact, it has absolutely nothing to do with tobacco, but the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities would also able to entail a ban on advertising for alcohol or chocolate, since it is a well-known fact that the sugar can also be dangerous to health.
I really do not understand that a majority of Members can wish a relaxation of the rules for the export in relation to the wishes expressed by the governments of the Member States - governments which also represent the many industrial circles concerned.
It is a fact that 80% of smokers want stop, but the tobacco industry does little policies in place to help these smokers to stop.
If we keep trying again to dictate to other countries public health standards they should apply by extending our quite sensible proposals for the internal market to exports, we will put in danger the excellent work done by Mr Maaten.
We are in favour of the application of a uniform method of test recognised by all the countries of the EU, which must be implementation by an accredited laboratory tests in a country.
The effects of tobacco consumption on health are now widely recognised, and the legislators and public opinion share the same feeling that it is now time to adopt draconian rules and regulations for this product.
Therefore, the Community rules would be in harmony with the future international agreements, which we would avoid the danger of trade barriers and hence enhance the protection of consumers, while ensuring a high level of public health.
It would be better to wait until the question of the whole additives to be treated in the context of the first report of the Commission.
With regard to the laboratory tests, the amendment dealing with the approval of the tests is superfluous since a different article guarantees the movement of goods which are in line with the provisions of the directive.
Madam President, this report is about the most simple: currently, the directives on summertime have a period of validity of five years, then they must go back to the European Parliament to be renewed.
of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on summer-time arrangements, that we are examining today, is a good proposal.
I therefore believe that we should not extend too long on this subject, given that the Member States and the people have already widely accepted the regulation on summertime and that it has been recognised as an integral part of our annual rate.
In my view, it is good that the issues of zones timetables and application of the directive on summertime remain the competence of the Member States, as suggested in the proposal.
It would be more reasonable to put an end to summertime at the end of September, about six months after its beginning.
It can nevertheless agree with the idea of making appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report of 2007 mentioned in Article 5.
It has been clarified that no trial leading to the changes to the genetic identity of the participant cannot be accepted.
If we approve it, we will have when even a regulation which ensures therapeutic progress and does not leave the protection of patients in the current state, but improves, and I therefore argues in favour of this compromise.
These groups must be maintained in the scope of the directive.
I am also pleased that we managed to put safeguards to gene therapy and cell.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his work and thank him for the efforts he has made to reconcile opposing views.
These programmes concern the fight against cancer, the prevention of AIDS, the prevention of drug addiction and the promotion of health, and their interruption would mean the cessation of the relevant actions and the work of the networks which have been put in place.
It is very advantageous power in advance overcoming the ground, in order to make progress as far as possible, to bring us closer greatly, and, in the event that a second reading would be necessary, to ensure that we almost decide.
In addition, we must not lose sight of the fact that both the prevention and promoting that the vigilance will always be more important and that it will therefore be necessary to provide larger budgets and give greater importance.
Madam President, following the Trakatellis report on the extension of certain existing European programmes in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about the direction in which the European policy on public health is evolving.
According to my information, the Council has also given its agreement in principle.
In the European Union, paradoxically, the abolition of internal borders in order to promote the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital goes hand in hand with the maintenance of 15 borders to police and criminal justice, which the Member States have difficulty disregard.
Finally, the initiative represents a considerable progress towards the creation of a criminal justice airspace, although partial and limited, but it responds to the real needs of an enormous amount of European citizens who, when they are victims of an offence outside the territories of their state of residence usual, are so far almost without recourse.
What have we asked for these groups of people?
At the same time, there is also a need to guarantee a special training for professionals in direct contact with the victims.
The victims should not become double victims, victims of crime suffered and victims of the system.
In this context, it is also important that the relatives, the family of the victim, the facts to be informed of professional and low-key way if they emit the desire and can also count on the support necessary, avoiding that they learn all the details in the press.
This applies regardless of the type of crime we are talking about.
Whether it be at the level of the Member States, or that of the Union, we must never divert the fundamental principle that every individual should constantly take responsibility for its actions.
In other cases, it may be possible to obtain the information useful in a language of the European Union, which is not their own.
I am very pleased with the response of the Parliament in favour of this first text on a subject which is so crucial, which allows the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building gradually to offer our citizens assistance in situations which are often difficult to live.
Vote on request for urgent procedure
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
For example, in the night of 23 to 24 November, have we reached an agreement with the Council on the essential points of a budget, which is certainly not brilliant, but which is nevertheless reasonable.
The Commission had also proposed a revision of competition EUR 300 million.
But I have also learnt of the discussions that it is much more difficult to get to the formulation of a Council position negotiable, to receive a mandate and to lead purely national self-interest in a common European decision slightly reasonable and justifiable.
I hope that the work for a recruitment common office, as we say in German modern, that is to say, a European authority of recruitment, really make progress, so that we can respond to the problems which will arise to all the institutions - the Council, as the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions - in the next few years, namely the need for staff.
The Council refuses to carry out this review - it appears that we should already have the data - and I would like to prevent: to use the flexibility instrument two consecutive years - indeed, in less than fifteen months and the first to less than six less than the approval of the prospects - financially empty the flexibility instrument because it prevents its renewal and its possible accumulation, which is scheduled up to match 600 million.
This amount very important, which responds to the existence of very high requirements in 2001, including can be financed through the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument EUR 200 million.
It is by taking account of this new element that the Council has voted in the second reading a budget increase of 2.5%.
Finally, before you proceeded to the final adoption of this budget, I would like to highlight the Council 's commitment to the respect of certain basic budgetary rules, in terms of the reserve of appropriations, legal base and classification of expenditure.
And, contrary to Nice, the three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - are all, I believe, satisfied with the end result.
Ladies and gentlemen, the resurgence of cattle infected with BSE makes immediate action needed in the budgetary context, and precisely for the protection of health, for the protection of consumers, but also for aid to farmers affected by this situation.
Furthermore, the Council has defined, for the framework programme of assistance for reconstruction in the Western Balkans, a multiannual amount, admittedly indicative, which is compatible with these financial perspectives.
In struggle, we succeeded in getting a few million euros further.
I would like to thank Mrs Haug very sincerely.
It is therefore think that the% of the budget of the European Union is best used.
If I understand what you have said, we should not use the reserve, because it is contrary to the rules.
I therefore believe that we have seen very good things, in addition to many others, that I cannot mention now because of the short speaking time.
Although the agricultural appropriations, which account for almost half of the total budget, increase of more than 5% even taking account of the letter of amendment, the total increase in the budget is only 3.5%.
We see now the great danger that the opposition increases in the next few years between the MEDA projects for the countries of the Mediterranean and the Balkans, when we all know that there is an urgent need for funds in this area.
Satisfaits Having overcome the difficulties which meant if the narrow path towards the objective sought to fulfil the commitments made in Helsinki towards the candidate countries without undo the Union, to allow the Europe of tomorrow to continue to operate with efficiency.
They are real, even if they do not go as far as the Presidency, which has shown, I note, as a national, of a great openness - would have liked.
A new legal basis is planned for the status of European political parties and Parliament entrusted the status of requiring institutional provided for in Article 230 of the Treaty.
In recent weeks, three important progress has been made.
This is the sense of the statement adopted in Nice and reflection committed to coordinate at European level the fight against doping.
Among the threats, there is, we all know, global warming.
In addition, in Nice, the European Union has put in place the necessary permanent bodies to the definition and the conduct of a common foreign and security policy: a political and security committee, a military committee and a European Military Staff.
For this cooperation, for your support and also for your reception, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe, the French Presidency would like to thank you.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We must now carefully examine the text to Parliament.
(Applause)
As I see it, this is a failure not only in relation to the proclaimed ambition of the European Union to change the institutions in order to be able to properly welcome the new members improving the efficiency of the European Union, and I see a failure in relation to another important objective, perhaps too little mentioned, the approximation of the European Union and the citizens.
Good questions, in our eyes those which has been conveyed the impressive human tide that, throughout Europe, has travelled to Nice on the eve of the summit.
First of all, the Fifteen have signed hastily and under the gas tear the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
(Applause)
My group is disappointed by this Treaty and concerned for the future that we preparing, we also opposerons-nous with all our strength.
Mr President, you have the floor.
I have already replied on this point, and I entirely agree with what he has said on the need to improve considerably the public debate I will not go back to what I said, but it is true that, all too often, the citizens feel foreigners to decisions that are taken in the bodies that they do not know.
Mr President, I should like to know whether the European Parliament 's competence in the field of summertime is a new victory for the Nice Summit.
Découragés hitherto by the complexity of clinical trials, laboratories may find, in the willingness both by the Member States by our Assembly, the courage to develop the market in the paediatric medicinal products, even if it is not sufficient in size to enable a return on investment!
Should we renew the change of summertime that had been set up at the time of the oil shocks, in a goal of saving energy, and which had been extended until 2001?
The victims are not always protected as it should be in the framework of criminal proceedings.
Many passengers and holidaymakers will benefit from this European initiative.
Mr President, the time for me to welcome Mr President of the Commission and the Presidency of the Council which advance, and to point out that, probably never in this Parliament, expressed such unanimity on the results of a summit.
The derogation that works, is that, under the leadership of the French Presidency, in six months, has, it seems to me, done its work on six important components.
However, my great fear, is that the United Kingdom, France and Germany are now able to reverse the delicate balance which existed between the Member States of different sizes and between the institutions for several decades.
In fact, we find it difficult to see, in this decision in Nice, which is clean to facilitate enlargement.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be very brief today.
As a result of this, when we shall vote on the Treaty of Nice, my vote will only be negative.
Mr President, the most important result of the Nice meeting lies in the fact that it is nonetheless managed to a treaty, so that we can now prepare their place to the candidate countries.
The real winners of this conference, Mr.
So, let us forget Nice, look at post-Nice - and you will allow me to place my hope in the draft convention great put forward by Belgium for its Presidency, because the proof is made, we must make the nine, we must change of method, we need to speed up the story: 2004 it is too late, it is too far, it is too dangerous.
Instead the spirit that prevailed in Nice has been, rather than ask ourselves how to move Europe really: ask ourselves how we could block, how we could achieve a system of decision at intergovernmental level, how we could claim, once returned home, of having been the defender of national interests.
This before what we are after Amsterdam and Nice, it is a Europe of princes, a Europe of the national administrations, and not a Europe of political unification.
We cannot continue without qualified majority decision on the key issues.
It is true that - and I paraphraserai Mr Bayrou - I am at this bench since this morning, firstly with the President of the Republic, and then by myself and the criticism mounts, it seems to me, moderate, friendly, but critical.
We must not forget that this is the first time, in fact, since 1957, reform, that we really reviewing the grid.
We are in the constitutional systems and powers may not be confused.
Thank you, Minister.
But it has not been incorporated into the Treaties and has not been mentioned in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Treaty on European Union.
Finally, there are some positive elements: the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty, the article on political parties and their status, the right of this Parliament to translate the other institution before the Court of Justice - it is also an important element of political control - the new formula for the European Commission, which puts the so-called 'Prodi law' in the Treaty, which strengthens the President and the new composition of the Commission - reasonable compromise that I accept and which will operate, with time, and, as my colleague, Mr Tsatsos, was pointed out, the road to the future.
Mr President, we have already delivered to a rigorous evaluation of what happened in Nice, but it should be remembered that Nice is party to an agenda very limited.
Let us dedicate things: the Charter has not been taken up in the Treaties, it is not even mentioned.
We want to prove to the Heads of Government that we can do better.
In spite of the laudatory statements made to its own subject this morning by the French government, the IGC has not ended.
Mr President, the French Presidency is not present at this debate, it is not easy to criticise.
Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the method of the Intergovernmental Conference has done its time.
2001 Budget (continuation)
This does not mean, however, that we could do more and better.
These maximum oblige the Commission to set priorities within the limits of a certain budget as any authority must do so.
The vote which will follow this debate concluded a long and complex process for the adoption of the budget of the European Union for the year 2001.
That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by returning to Article 272; the financial perspectives have been maintained, even if we have used the flexibility instrument.
Let me just say to the Council that, concerning this game, we still the balls, and that, on this side, we intend to play as long as we do not have obtained a good result.
We do not want a proposal for the revision for next year is already included in the Colom resolution, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we share her point of view critical when she says that this way of solving the financial shortfall in Category 4 distorts the multi-annual nature of the major external objectives of the Union and the definition itself of the financial perspectives.
For this to be possible, we will have to define, for the future too, the priorities of major proportions.
That is the only way the money that is made available to our citizens, will be used properly and wisely.
If we add to this already calculating the SAB to come, almost comes to 8%, whereas in all the other areas - whether in the policy of training, the area of internal affairs actions, including research, foreign policy, the administration and pre-accession aid - we have only a growth rate of 1.1%.
Since this cooperation is so good, we will certainly still the continue in January, during the presentation of the supplementary budget.
The criticism of relations between Russia and the Baltic States which have still not been able to be satisfactorily resolved we should also take.
We are following with great interest the development of society and of domestic politics in Russia.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia has been the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.
Even if President Putin guarantee the development of democracy in his country, it is not automatically the guarantor of a stable and democratic Russia.
We must not be cunning but build a Europe of economic cooperation.
As far as the Caucasus is concerned, Mr Van Orden is absolutely right.
If we look Russia to the outside world and punctually receives direct impressions of Russian interlocutors, quickly risk to talk about a selective way of a Russian reality which is in fact the image that we made yourself in Russia.
In political terms, the common strategy proposes to Russia to enter into a permanent dialogue on politics and security, and to create this a permanent mechanism.
In this paragraph, I wanted to stress how important it is to mark the fact that Russia really gets into political union with Belarus.
Do you support such a project, Mr Patten?
In this context, as Parliament knows, during the last summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi has begun an in-depth dialogue on energy.
I very much hope to make me personally to Kaliningrad at the beginning of next year, and not only because Immanuel Kant has spent all his life.
Once again, I congratulate the honourable Member for his excellent report, which concerns an issue of very great importance, on which I am quite sure that we look again and again in this Parliament during the next few years.
You put me in a very difficult position.
Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is very important, because the mad cow crisis has enormous effects on food products, on the manufacture and import of food products.
The Council has expressed its concern at the many meetings with Russia, at all levels, in particular to prevent the excessive use of force and possible extension of the conflict, to make effective and independent investigations on violations of human rights, to support the OSCE assistance group in the performance of its mission and finally to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid.
Mr President, it is a point of order: it is customary in this House that when the questions were not the subject of a satisfactory oral reply, they are treated afterwards in writing.
(Interruption from Mr Posselt)
This directive dates from 1992.
It is in this sense that we will have to work.
These groups are obviously not the subject of an exception in the new proposal.
The presidency and several Member States have already received from the European Committee of the various sugar manufacturers letters relating to the Commission proposal which they will take account in their deliberations.
Question No 6 by (H-0886/00):
I would first like to say that, in my view, the President-in-Office of the Council has not yet answered the question by Mr Korokas.
We must now put in place the authority and I believe that the awareness of the European authorities is strong, and that it will be necessary to go forward.
Specifically, the representative of the presidency, in this case the French ambassador in Algeria, "he met Mr Ahmed Taleb?
We welcome the provisions proposed in this respect by the preparatory committee and decided by the General Assembly in relation to the method of accreditation of non-governmental organisations, at the preparatory process and the special session in September 2001.
The partnership contains a number of references to the European Convention on Human Rights.
As the Council has argued by the honourable Member in his previous answer, the process of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal cases will allow for better protection of the rights of individuals.
I would like to urge again.
It provides, in particular, the political control and the strategic direction of a military operation of crisis management.
I should simply like to recall that the system of the Treaty makes a difference in treatment between taxes and indirect taxes whose harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market - Article 93 - and the approximation, provided for in Article 94, the laws which have a direct impact on the establishment or the operation of the common market, including those concerning direct taxation.
Looking brief on these three great areas.
If the classic attitude whereby 'in doubt, remain enemies' persists, it could to blow the Stability Pact of southern Europe based on the principle of regional cooperation.
We also need the cooperation with Yugoslavia and more precisely a bilateral cooperation.
Mr President, our group supports the work carried out by Mr Baltas on the report on the opportunity to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with the Republic of Croatia.
Mr President, I had, during the years when I have exercised the mandate of President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the opportunity to accompany many Croats in their efforts towards freedom and prosperity that they identified for their integration into the European institutions, like other peoples of our continent.
In view of the results achieved by Croatia this year, I must admit that I do not doubt our ability to make progress hastening.
That is what we think, and the speed with which we have adjusted our policy towards Croatia in recent months shows.
We need to Croatia to give the government and to the people of that country all possible assistance in the years to come, and we are very grateful to the honourable Member who has the wisdom to encourage us to continue in this direction.
In this connection, it is incomprehensible that thousands of members of Laskar Jihad have, in the spring, go in the Moluccas in order to stir up once again the conflicts.
In the Timor, militias are blocking the return of refugees and rescue workers are being harassed.
On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I shall confine myself to three points.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen for her excellent work.
However, in this respect, the country is no exception.
Continuing violence which the scene are the Moluccas, Aceh and Irian Jaya causing great suffering on the population.
Tomorrow, we leave the Sakharov Prize.
The latest news from the Indonesian archipelago, however, we oblige us to ask if the situation of President Wahid and its believers is not even more serious, more critical than suggested in the analysis of the rapporteur.
If we want to help Indonesia, we now have to intervene with money and concrete actions, and not only with words.
This is an extremely valuable report because it enlighten us on the development of events.
It is clear that the difficulties of Indonesia will not be resolved in a day.
Protection of financial interests of the Communities
The obstacles to its independence, both in the recruitment of staff in terms of its structure, must be abolished.
It is therefore essential that a process of internal reform, the Commission finally to materialize his declared intention to no longer tolerate any fraud and continue accordingly.
I believe that this is what must result, and which must also result in Nice.
We would like to see the Member States initiate negotiations with a view to the adoption of a uniform legislation in the field of crime, but we reject that our countries are dependent on a federal public prosecutor falling within the EU.
I would also like to know why the publication of the communication from the Commission on this subject has been postponed to the next day the Danish referendum on the euro.
I have tabled an amendment seeking to designate these countries name, because it is time to make it clear who they are and that they be covered with shame.
I am sure that OLAF believes that it is in its interests to make it transparent the choice of its top leaders.
However, we must ensure, in the European Parliament, not miss out on the beam in our force for us to focus on the mote in the neighbour, the Commission.
We are trying to switch off a fire, but the smoke we suffused.
Nobody can understand me either.
To grasp this connection, I venture to highlight four points that I consider fundamental in the work of the budgetary control authority.
With regard to Parliament itself, its problem is the Treaty.
It is also worrying enough, Commissioner, that the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - should be explicitly mentioned the order concerning respect for the rights of Members.
The latter can, for example, recommend to the Committee on Budgets to freeze or reduce the amount of appropriations earmarked for the budget lines concerned in the budget for the following year, or only to permit any transfer of appropriations, as it is a question of increasing the budget lines concerned, and that, until the end of the internal ongoing investigations. It can go so far as to ask that the President of the Commission requires the resignation of the or the Commissioners concerned by the serious problems that have been observed, a European Caesarian in some way.
The report calls for detailed inventories of operational activities, detailed examinations of budget lines and irregularities, as well as an internal audit of the parliamentary committee.
Commissioner, the legal basis relating to the transmission of information to the European Parliament is the EC Treaty and not the interinstitutional agreement.
Without changes, the final outcome of this common position would be a inequality of weapons not only in relation to North America, but also in Europe.
I really do not see why we do not lead here as in all other cases to a compromise.
It is a proposal which has come a long - and, I fear - tortuous path, to overcome some of the existing difficulties.
The first amendment relates to Article 4, which establishes what must be the competent authority to control supply.
We have now ended up with a proposal which would lead to a real muddle, a complete free-for-all with its trail of potential disputes at a delicate moment in the negotiations.
In the United Kingdom, the regulation of the times, by means of the voluntary code of practice implemented by the Committee on takeover bids, is a real success: this is a good example of the pragmatic approach to a highly complex issue where the legislation would be less appropriate.
But what is even more important is that it allows us to advance the Lisbon Agenda for the creation of a European economy competitive and dynamic.
The important thing for us here in the European Parliament is ultimately the contradictory interests, for example, the Executive Board versus the shareholders, the major shareholders versus small shareholders, the companies versus the financial market, to be regulated under a minimum form at the European level.
Some amendments proposed by Parliament are making other improvements to the text of the Council's common position. They highlight the points which may give rise to difficulties of interpretation and insist on a more prompt transposition of the directive.
In fact, it is by no means certain that the definition of fair prices which is being proposed is better than another, because the different definitions currently used in the Member States all are quite adequate.
The debate is closed.
In addition, during a period of three years, the artist will have the right to demand professionals in the art market any information concerning the amounts that are caused, which is sensible because they must hold a register of purchases and sales.
Therefore, it is the Austrian legislator who is targeted and not the European legislator would merely create positive framework conditions for artists and auction houses.
Moreover, in the issue we are dealing with, the need for a common position is all the more great that only a common position will enable the European Union to carry more weight at international level to the interests of the creators can be defended at global level.
I trust in the wisdom and understanding of this House.
In Germany, for example, in 1998, 7 000 artists who have transferred their rights, only 274 have finally recovered money, not to mention the fact that 40% of resale rights is last recovery costs of sums owed.
In short, there is no need for a harmonisation of this kind in the sector concerned.
A similar amendment was rejected at first reading.
They thought that the translations could follow in spite of this fairly tight timetable and difficult.
However, we came to such an extent that we can no longer defer this debate.
We have proposed in the committee to carry out a year ago.
Our Parliament is of course on the side of these values and will cease to defend it.
The technological development and fluctuations of the markets will lead changes in any case.
Here, we cannot find legal justification for exclusion from competition.
The limitation of the universal service - the pillar of the postal sector - to 50 grams risk of putting the regulated national posts in a delicate situation, in the sense that they can hardly offer a universal service at an affordable price to the citizens, regardless of their place of residence.
I would remind my Conservative colleagues the problems they have had in the United Kingdom when they tried to privatise the British posts.
We have neither more nor less turned the safety net of the postal service users in a hamac in which the big players in the postal sector can continue to vautrer and act in freedom.
I am very pleased because, even when, this concept of special services claimed to new technologies outside the scope of the universal service.
Madam President, Commissioner, we cannot and will not tolerate such a situation.
That is why the European Commission has not proposed, as a second phase, a total liberalisation of this sector.
This is a development of this kind that I wish the other Member States of the European Union.
Mr Bolkestein has recently condemned the little liberal attitude of the French in the Dutch press, at least that is what announced the title of the Rule in question.
In this connection, we could mention Spain, which has been a fund of this type and use this to talk about the uncertain legal framework on which the fund is based, virtual criteria relating to its composition, discretionary avals of its application.
We are voting on tomorrow: I hope that this vote will take place before the amendment from Mr Atkins or that of Mr Sterckx, otherwise I will have to vote against this report.
Royal Mail participates in competition, and distributes my letter in Malmö in Sweden.
Madam President, Commissioner, that we have learnt from the debate, or rather the controversy caused by Commissioner Bolkestein in its continuation of liberalisation of the postal services company, in the absence of any assessment of the first stage and in violation of the rules laid down by this directive? What under the guise of progressive terms and enhancing such as modernisation, liberalisation, accompanying technological booms, we are leaning in a decline in the social quality of a country.
The preservation of the universal service with a compensation fund which would make it possible to initiate private benefits for the benefit of the public service will probably long fire.
These limits and these delays have also contributed to a debate in which we often confuses means and ends.
You cannot raise this matter, Madam President, not to mention the economic and social cohesion.
Madam President, allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, because he has actually done a complex, hard work, and it has tried to find a balance between the proposals, positions and points of departure and arrival completely different.
I fear that this proposal still strengthens the current position of the monopolists at the taxpayer's expense and increases the threshold imposed on the new entrants.
I am also pleased to see that our Liberal friends of the continent show the example to the British Liberals.
Admittedly, I accept that liberalisation in itself is not a problem and that it can be beneficial for consumers.
Justifiée, because it falls within the logic of the founding treaties of the European Union, which highlight the completion of the internal market by the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment.
The universal service is the cornerstone of the policy of the Community in this area and that we are doing all this aims to create a climate conducive to improve it.
The special services are also a sector in which innovation and modernisation must be encouraged.
According to him, by the end of the decade, the opening up to competition from almost the whole of the postal market seems inevitable.
I believe that there must be solid guarantees to maintain permanent universal service and its obligations.
That is why I cannot and will not remain silent when the future of the sector is threatened by a possible decision which would result in not respond properly to the challenges that have been launched at all in Lisbon.
Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.
However, I would remind you that this common organisation of the market has primary objective guaranteed access to the Community market of its products.
I am glad that we have yet been able to reach a unanimous vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development I thank my colleagues and Mr Fernández Martín, rapporteur for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, for his support.
We cannot stop us to express our concern for the banana production of some of the ACP countries, of small countries in the Antilles and producers of some West African countries which are traditional suppliers of the market in bananas and with which we have made commitments that we cannot forget.
Therefore, I hope that this report be supported in its entirety by the Members of this House, as was the case in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Meanwhile, the United States first condemn the historical reference periods but now advocate their own historical reference periods.
Powerful interests come into play, in particular those of the US, which are not themselves of banana producers, but which have hidden the American capital in commercial companies.
It sometimes seems that the Commission, in the proposals of deregulation of trade and agricultural production at international level, goes further than the Cairns Group.
It is a pity that the Commission and the Council to persist in a solution to seriously compromising this production, especially after 2006.
The successive decisions of the WTO does not say that it is forbidden to give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers.
Thus, the transitional period should be around 15 years and in any case less than 10 years; the compensatory aid must include guaranteeing the income of Community producers and the sale of production in the outermost regions, but must also include aid to the bodies which commercialise bananas are produced.
I hope that it will see our arguments today, because the system proposed by the Commission, this tariff preference, even EUR 300, threatens to be unnecessary in the facts because the ACP producers will be decimated by the said system of the 'first come, first served'.
VOTE
(Parliament approved the proposal by the Commission)
The Commission refuses to accept the other amendments.
Before the vote:
(Parliament accepts the oral amendment)
Report (A5-0376/2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the reform of the procedures and institutions of budgetary control (2000/2008(INI))
The majority of smokers do not know all the risks and does not bear the real price of their choice.
I have always held in this principle in my long parliamentary career of 35 years.
I fear that their hopes are pointless.
It is our ultimate attempt to put on cigarette packets labels and images which reflect the real dangers of tobacco.
Lehne report (A5-0368/2000)
This analysis seems, at the same time, relevant and justified even today, and that is why I voted against this report in its entirety.
It is rightly that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights persists in the rejection of a ceiling and in the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be below 7%.
To oppose this directive is for my group also a way to give a clear political signal: we must not lose our time to create unnecessary rules in Europe.
If it is right to denounce the Stalinist dictatorship of old, how can we give any confidence to Mr Putin, the murderers of the Chechen people, the godfather of the various mafias, one which strives to wipe out all the opposition, civil society (trades union, political parties), in order to strengthen its personal power?
Of course, Indonesia does not merit such a development of relations because we cannot say that, in recent years, its leaders are distinguished by their great democratic spirit and by their great merits, but we must take into account the Indonesian citizens, and therefore in favour of this development of relations and these subsidies.
The unit will be only criminal acts committed by officials of the EU.
The Theato report on the fight against fraud enables us to discover that the European Central Bank, no doubt to prove its well-known independence, has not considered right to accede to the agreement on the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
That concludes voting time.
Either we part of the club, or we are not, and we must therefore we bow to this decision.
It does not therefore call EEB - Everything bananas aim causing. Do not, ladies and gentlemen, a change of name.
The system based solely on tariffs, however, is an important element which addresses the balance of the Commission's proposal and is an important basis, which should enable the Council to make progress.
There are furthermore measures for the marking of these bananas in national and regional programmes to promote rural development.
Europe and the United States work closely to the defence of the values we share.
We think that we will be discussing a new round of the WTO and of the implications for the cycle of the many bilateral trade initiatives which are the subject of debates in the American hemisphere.
He said, quite rightly, that transatlantic relations have developed a great deal over the past ten years, in large part, it is true, the American side thanks to President Clinton, but I believe that history will remember that there has also been a European contribution to these new relations - fundamental contribution - with the 1990 transatlantic declaration and the New Transatlantic Agenda adopted under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995.
It will therefore be important to undertake a reversal of the march and to compose a transatlantic agenda for the year 2001.
I would like to conclude with the Dominican Republic who said: 'The WTO was supposed to be an impartial referee applying common rules and where the various countries could learn to play the game.
Secondly, even if we can welcome the decline of the Communist deception, the collapse of the Soviet Union has left a sole superpower: the United States of America.
I know that it maintains a constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and the committees which deal with these issues.
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
These objectives, the overarching objective and secondary objectives, represent the touchstone allowing us to judge the concrete proposals presented by the Commission.
It is obvious that such a solution - the registration in one country with the possibility of providing services throughout the European Union, can lead to an avalanche in countries where the level of tax is weak.
Thus, an agreement was concluded in 1992, then regarded as a minimum harmonisation, which envisaged that the standard VAT rate could not be below 15%, the Member States with the possibility of applying one or several reduced rates cannot be lower than 5%; the derogations being laid down in this case.
We have asked the European Commission to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and to call a report on this subject to the Council and to Parliament.
In summary, the aim of this proposal is laudable, but the method is ill-conceived and if we really want to encourage the e-economy of Europe, it would be good to provide our electronic trade in VAT rather than try to impose our problems to others.
If we want to respect the requirement of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, we must take all possible measures to limit their production.
The only case for which no tax is not yet seen is one of supply in the European Community from a third country.
The positive discrimination of air transport must stop.
The companies from third countries which are not members of the European Union are not subject to any taxation.
The compact discs were reported are not so archaic and there should be tax, while the programmes transported by Internet would be dutyfree!
However, the proposed solution can only prove technically unworkable and make obstacle to the development of on-line trading in the European Union, precisely the time when everyone wants, on the contrary, their expansion.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems in the European Union are deteriorating and lose in return.
We should seek to encourage electronic commerce and not new ways of the tax.
The Liberals tell us that it must be less state as possible.
The Primarolo group has drafted simple rules that must be applied.
The group that I represent in this House, however, makes an objection and believe that it should be balancing the situation between the daily, which enjoy a reduced rate of VAT, and the daily online, which do not.
A kerosene tax cannot therefore exist within the framework of an international consensus, in order to ensure the balance of competition.
I particularly welcome the fact that the report emphasises one of the key points that I raised in my report for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, voted by this Parliament a few months ago, namely that, since it is certainly politically difficult to achieve an international agreement on the taxation of aviation, at least in the short term, we should be using alternative tools to achieve the same effect, including a tax on emissions.
In fact, the industry pay 100% of its infrastructure costs through the control of air traffic and airport charges, which totalled USD 4 billion in 1998 - unlike other modes of transport, such as transport by rail or by road, which are still enormously subsidised.
The current situation is against.
In this regard, there is clearly a problem about the emissions caused by air traffic Even though the percentage is not so high, it significantly increasing and we cannot therefore underestimate.
This system would be damaging to SMEs within and outside the Union, particularly if we consider the proposal to reduce the exemption threshold for the excessively low level of EUR 40 000 turnover annual.
If we are too greedy as regards the matter before us, we really risk the future of electronic commerce, important for Europe.
The principle wanting that providers established outside the Community and making services to customers in the Community should not register in one place must not lead to a shift in tax revenue among the Member States.
Given that the discussion is not yet finished in the Council, and waited that the Commission wants to carry through the issue of VAT and electronic commerce relatively quickly, I believe that the wisest would not yet formally accept the amendments made by Parliament, but to try to harness the greatest possible number of these proposals in the negotiations in the Council.
I cannot therefore accept the proposed amendments.
Thank you very much for all the issues that you have raised this week.
Three months only after the accident, the Commission has, on, assumed its responsibilities by adopting a first package of measures, that the European Parliament has fully approved on 30 November last year.
With more than fifteen directives or regulations in force, it is, in fact, urgent to standardise the practices and to exercise greater control on the application of the Community regulations, in order to avoid possible differences, important and unacceptable, within the European Union in the field of maritime safety.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for its constant commitment in the area of maritime safety.
I would like to remind Members that in the field of air safety, compensation applied in the European framework and in the American framework does not equivalent to the amounts applied in other countries.
Secondly, I would say to you that it is the French justice which could confiscate or freeze the funds of a company for compensating some damage or other; it is the French justice which could establish responsibilities beyond those laid down according to the criteria objectives of the current international regulations on hydrocarbons to pollution.
The Commission considers that such adjustments are in line with the establishment of a system of more equitable levy which also encourages a more rational and efficient use of the road network.
Given the criticisms, particularly those of Ireland and France, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has given a new interpretation: it would now a tax for all users, including the lorry drivers in the UK.
I am decided to ensure that the food proposed consumers responds to the more stringent standards, that it should come from within or outside the Union.
Of course I understand the concern of the honourable Member.
I am sorry to tell you, Commissioner, that your reply does not have to be.
The comments made by the honourable Member are important.
In Nigeria, the indigenous All-Ijaw accused Chevron to encourage violence against them and to go as far as to pay Nigerian soldiers to draw on the demonstrators in the naval base of Warri.
In its report adopted on 15 November, the Commission concluded that operating aid granted under Regulation 1540/98/98 had not resolved the problem of prices charged by South Korea.
I believe that all of the intentions is extremely reassuring, but, meanwhile, the fact is that our shipyards are closing.
Question No 38 by (H-0868/00):
I understand, Mr Commissioner, that you do not want to change your decision in spite of the fact that ten Member States are opposed to such duties.
This initiative is based on a Council Regulation amending the Regulation, which defines the current GSP.
I represent some farmers and I am therefore very concerned.
We are working in the committee, we have not taken this week, Poul Nielson being absent because of the shift in the Balkans.
It is currently working on the safeguard clause and if Mr Clegg needs arguments, to speak with its beet growers, I should like to its disposal.
I would like to thank Mr Liikanen for his reply, which is in all points very positive and valuable.
I shall be discussing with my services when the budgetary resources for next year will be defined.
Currently, the efforts made by my services and myself seek to restrict the consequences of the distance between the parties and the future court.
Like the specialised courts in patent law in Düsseldorf, Munich and other German cities, but also of London, a Community competent court in terms of Community patents should be very specialised.
In order to avoid this provisional situation takes a definitive nature, the Commission, on 13 July of last year, has mentioned in a letter to the Member States concerned their obligation to indicate what their competent courts in the field of Community trademarks.
As the honourable Member knows, a complaint was in itself any influence on the progress of the project concerned.
Question No 47 by (H-0877/00):
This means that the Commission will use the legal means at its disposal in the direction heard in the regulation.
The question is: who must address these students to understand that, when they follow this round of studies and completing in Britain, they have the right to have results.
The King, elected for a limited period, for example, could be chosen among the Finnish MEPs the most deserving.
It may also be envisaged as a question of competition, since it can continue to practise of duty-free sales in the southern part of the Baltic Sea, on the line between Helsinki and Stockholm, while they are banned on the line between Umeå and Vasa.
We must rectify the situation by stimulating and encouraging the multilingual content, given that it is absolutely crucial for the success of the European sector of content.
The problem which concerns me most is that small businesses do not always have sufficient guarantees, or the commercial record established to give investors.
In order to complete the ambitious development of this European programme e-content, there is a need to simplify and secure the procedures planned.
It is for this reason that the measures of public subsidies in favour of the content industry in the EU (their usefulness has been demonstrated) must also pursue a culture and a high level of education and towards cultural diversity.
On the other hand, there are the communication networks which need content to fulfil constantly their cyberspace and who regard as self-evident to submit content, to seize and exploit regardless really the rules of production.
Mr President, I welcome the launch of this programme and -content would like to draw attention to two aspects.
That is why I support the amendments which call for the adoption of specific actions in the field of new technologies.
Firstly, the Commission welcomes the fact that the European Parliament stresses the social and cultural dimension of digital content.
Assessment and management of environmental noise
I am grateful for the support that the Christian Democrats, and also part of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, have given to this specific amendment, in order to start to restrict aircraft noise.
It is this year, six years late, and under the insistent pressure of the French Government, which the Commission presented its proposal on noise indicators harmonised.
It is a moderate proposal. Scandinavia has already stricter standards than those proposed for 2012.
Orly Schiphol, Barcelona and other already meet strict standards.
Another important point put forward by us and which will be important within the framework of the problem of noise emissions due to aircraft, concerns the need to provide for additional noise indicators, in addition to that mentioned by the rapporteur.
By lack of common standards in the European Union, we have seen situations of notorious distortion of competition between airports and lack of equality between the citizens of the various Member States.
That is why I find the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange so important.
Firstly, I must say that I am delighted with this report.
That was the idea of principle behind Amendment No 36, although I believe that this idea is not yet sufficiently thought through sufficiently.
We should check that carefully and adopt the combined approach on the two plans, i.e. establish limit values for each source of emissions on the one hand, and on the other hand, to define quality standards for these emissions.
We had to be more time, and I regret that we have not prepared, even if, in general, I support the framework directive.
As soon as the Member States will have provided comparable information, the Commission will take into account the question of limit values at Community level, as well as other measures in order to reduce the number of people affected by noise and to refer to the Council and to Parliament.
Food additives other than colours and sweeteners
These are the three criteria.
Thank you, Mr Rehder, I feel I am supportive of your question, because if you have a carrot in the throat, I personally am a cat in the throat, as we say among us, but the flu short rather here.
In addition, in the case of dietary chronic problems, the risk of cancer is increasing.
It is then also proved that the Commission did not have the appropriate instruments to intervene properly.
Tomorrow, a new step to be recorded in the programme. Mr Marit Paulsen, the Liberal Group, will be track and will have the opportunity to further improve the present directive.
The Member States and the Commission now have a better instrument for ensuring that Community law in the field of animal feed is properly applied and to ensure that, in cases where crisis situations appear in third countries, speedy reaction are possible.
We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities and that until now, it is above all the cities that have been 'poor parents' in this area.
The process of planning must be implemented in a way that is fair and innovative.
The 2000-2004 multiannual programme for sustainable development in urban areas is an appropriate instrument to achieve it, that the application of Agenda 21 is an excellent way of coordination and development of actions.
The reduction of transport and the abandonment of fossil fuels at local level are necessary in order to achieve a change from the point of view of climate threats we are experiencing today.
Many voices have suggested that this budget was too reduced.
It is anticipated that the main partners in this context are the Commission and the networks of local authorities whose legal responsibility is to develop and implement policies relating to sustainable development in urban areas.
The Court of Justice and even the bodies of conflict settlement of the WTO consider that the precautionary principle is to be applied in environmental matters or in the field of public health, and sometimes even against the Europeans, as shows the case pending the milk cheese believed.
The objective should not be limiting the damage or compensation, the primary aim must be to prevent harmful effect on health or goods of people.
From 1996, the European Parliament has declared itself in favour of a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle - only if we had listened.
One absolute scientific certainty on the new products or substances does not exist and will never be established.
To conclude, if the precautionary principle must be implemented effective and credible, it is vital to bring all the key players, including the representatives of civil society, in the political choices that surround its implementation.
Finally, health and the environment must take precedence over other considerations, in particular those of economic order.
A related prerequisite for the application of the precautionary principle is that the concerns about the possible harmful effects are equipped with a scientific basis.
Only yesterday, in Lisbon, an American, Professor George Carlo, which was given a study on the effect of the waves for human health by the Food and Drugs Administration, has revealed that the use of mobile phones runs the risk of causing the appearance of brain tumours, Alzheimer's disease and injuries of the skin.
Mr President, the environment and public health are equal to a machine which the complexity is such that we need to monitor its multiple functions in order to be able to intervene and thus prevent the problems.
The application of this principle must avoid at all costs to curb innovation and economic activity, to create overcautious and industrial stagnation, to become a way to divert competition.
Parliament has certainly noticed that the Commission is in agreement with most of the questions raised in the motion for a resolution.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Its Article 2 enshrines the right to life, every time in Spain terrorism kills a person, it is the whole of the European Union who feel concerned in what is one of its most important principles.
Our intention is not to replace the legitimately established institutions, but to encourage them to protect our rights and our freedoms without making concessions to terror.
VOTE
It has also reminded the observation of the Council on the classification of budget lines on the draft early retirement of the Commission and on the administrative expenditure of fisheries agreements.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
I think that this is no longer present!
Over the past feel that the number of 23 428 is insufficient, but they will, however, be satisfied with the area of growth that is being offered.
This deletion, which has started from the middle of last year, has resulted, as we feared a dramatic fall in the rate of adoption of projects and implementation of payments, so that the annual implementation of authorisations for this fund was less than 1% at the end of June 2000.
This text is an ideal licence for closing the General Secretariat of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.
Before my departure, they have said to me: 'It is Christmas, and we, in Bergamo, we are celebrating Christmas and St Lucia.
We are particularly very critical of the overproduction of agricultural products and the use of the means of information of the EU to sell this surplus.
Mr President, I voted in favour of the García-Margallo y Marfil report, which concerns the taxation of services provided by electronic means.
Mr President, I shall try, before 2004, to do something for Malta in making a statement in favour of it.
For all that, I say this with a certain amount of solemnity: it is the maximum that I can accept a Europe, for me, too liberal!
The deadline encourage the posts to develop and modernise their services still and facilitate the planning and investment in the market.
They will continue to put pressure. The money that they earn with the distribution beyond the limit of 150 grams allows them to strengthen their position.
The liberalisation of postal services proposed by the Commission is neither appropriate nor consistent, which is why I voted for the report and all the amendments which have been tabled which express the same direction.
de Roo report (A5-0378/2000)
Not being convinced of their compatibility with the WTO, we also have reservations on the subject of Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31.
A globalisation which despises the most basic rights of the human person.
This would be contrary to respect for national identity (Article 6, paragraph 3 of the Treaty of the European Union).
It must be stressed that the linguistic minorities, instead of being crushed by the globalisation of the Internet, have found new cultural and economic openings.
Mr President, if there is no other results, the haggling of Nice will have informed the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union.
The tone of the joint resolution is, in this point of view, far too unilateral.
The delay in the publication of the written conclusions - which are still not officially available at the moment, four days later - shows the difficulty of drawing up clearly of the decisions taken in the confusion.
The only way to avoid future of dangerous conflicts, is to remain the traditional view that Europe is founded on mutual respect for national communities.
The Nice Summit was Sunday by an agreement which should lead to a draft treaty.
The resolution on the Nice Summit, which has just been voted, do not reflect.
Finally, I would like to make a reference to social policy, on which France pinned during the presentation of its Presidency, but which ultimately remains a full hand of very much, despite the declarations of intent and the titles of the documents to the content very vague and clearly insufficient in relation to the existing problems and the huge discontent, the demonstration of workers in Nice will have been an important expression.
Clearly, nothing has changed for the really important issues such as taxes, taxes, social policy, asylum and immigration.
The salient debate on Nice is the image of a treaty finally without father or mother, since it is son to anyone. The French Presidency has confused excuses, rather than to take clearly the results of the IGC and their reasons; the political groups, which correspond to the governments of the Member States, have increased their criticisms.
On the contrary, the power of the national democracies decreases in force of limiting increasingly the right of veto and to give ever more power in Parliament of the EU.
If we had been able to foresee these consequences at the conclusion of the Treaty of Chicago during the year I was born - 1944, no exemption from tax for fuel and other equipment for aircraft would probably not been agreed.
The zero risk does not existing, scientific or less policies must apply the criterion of proportionality, judge the risks uncertain and assume their responsibilities.
This Parliament has, however, also fought for this reduction in the funds allocated to the innovative actions should be compensated for by the use of flexible framework, set out in a statement on the financial perspective.
Everyone has a role to play and we are operating in a global market, it is undeniable, and it is the innovations which will enable Europe to maintain its place among the major technological development in the new industries and, in particular, in information technology, on the premise, of course, that they receive sufficient financial resources and a realistic and relevant support.
During the previous speeches, serious few words have been spoken about the budget. EUR 400 million really are only a minimum for the funding and it will be necessary, during the second half of the year, to take advantage of the opportunities for extra funds offered by the flexibility instrument, as the report notes.
In my opinion, it must be accompanied automatically from the loss of European added value, in contrast to the conclusion of the report.
As we all know, in the European Union, unemployment focuses on the least developed areas of the economic and technological point of view, especially the territories of the Objective 1 Thus, it is crucial that the innovative actions have not only a technological nature, but that they come from an explicit desire to develop the economy and employment.
When I have just returned in my home region of England, and I see that absolutely no local authority has used the money that it has received during the last period, I doubt that we demonstrated the efficiency we need in the future to receive the new communities.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to make to Mr Markov my thanks and my congratulations for the constructive presentation, extremely competent and serious in the draft communication on these innovative actions of the ERDF for the period 2000-2006.
Energy efficiency and aspects of environmental policy have not been forgotten in these guidelines, but can give rise to innovative measures under the third issue, which concerns regional identity and sustainable development.
We hope, however, that the projects should be chosen at regional level, as indeed Mr Berend understood in his speech.
The debate is closed.
That is why we are asking for in this report and in the three additional amendments that the Commission multiplies the efforts to impose the international WTO dispute settlement procedures.
It seems to me that the Commissioner must show the industry that it is doing everything in its power to respond to this external threat.
Finally, of course, we expect that, from 18 December, in the meeting of the group 6 of the OECD, the arrangement 'ships' should be examined.
But it seems that the finishing line each time postponed so that we never achieve.
As you all know, this procedure will take more than six months.
For the major corporations such as for their political lawyers, claim less state simply means that the state and its funding must be available to them exclusively.
But to achieve this, to ensure that the process to consolidate the shipbuilding industry and jobs and reassure the families that depend on, we must continue the aid beyond 31 December 2000 because, on the market, we are not on an equal footing, there is unfair competition and dumping practices.
The improvement in the competitiveness of the EU's shipyards is encouraged by the Commission, but in the face of the massive price dumping applied by South Korea, the possible improvement of productivity is not enough.
He also pointed out that the existence of this mechanism should not create distortions of competition in the EU.
The presence of the nuclear submarine with a fault in the waters of the Algeciras Bay has unfortunately turned into a diplomatic conflict between a military nuclear power and colonial and a Member State second area, according to the latest classification of Nice, which does not assert its rights and is subordinated to childhood explanations.
When, by means of the medical part distributed in the country of the owner - that is to say, by means of the British press - we discovered that the disease was serious, instead of change centre, they arm-twisting the qualification of the centre.
Of course we are waiting with interest the reply of the Commission to see whether the objective has been achieved.
Mr President, I too should like to start by expressing my condolences to the family of councillor murdered and the Members of the Group of the European People 's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and to reject this barbarity of ETA and fascist groups which protect him.
I also believe that it would be appropriate for the submarine Tireless to be driven in Britain to be repaired, as soon as possible, when the appropriate climatic conditions will allow.
The honourable Members have asked whether the Commission considers that the Directive 89/618/Euratom on the information of the population on the health protection measures applicable and the behaviour to adopt in the event of a radiological emergency and Directive 96/29/Euratom laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation applied in the case of the submarine and what measures had been taken accordingly.
If it is better lawyer that our advisers, I look forward to hear it. This brings me back to Article 37.
One aspect of the Euratom Treaty concerns the transport of radioactive waste from one Member State to another in the European Union; but, as Gibraltar is, of course, part of the UK, transport of waste will take place in a part of the UK to another without cross another Member State of the European Union.
That is my opinion, but simply enough to win the confidence of the people living on the rock.
However, we see here a Member State which addresses public opinion in another Member State as it would with any state in the world, as if, basically, there was no affectio societatis fifty years after the start of the European company, as if European solidarity did not progressed.
It is a fact established, that, at a time, the only submarine operating in the British waters was a German submarine.
Here we debate, but the citizens, based on their knowledge and their intuition, running their attention to the European institutions.
It is clear that the reduction of investments in new military equipment linked to the restrictions of the military budget decided by the Labour government in the future multiply the case of withdrawal of military equipment for repair of substance.
On the other hand, it does not extends, contrary to what some people would wish, the classification of ports likely to receive submarines broken down, nor the questions of technical safety of nuclear reactors or the conditions which must meet a submarine to be sent repair in another place.
It should be to help more, ask the Community institutions to strengthen the financial, human and material resources of the UNHCR.
I would ask the Commission to increase again this aid to UNHCR and also to appoint this last as coordinating body in all its contracts with NGOs.
It must therefore be able to have access to the civilian victims and his staff on the ground can be deployed in a safe and have the necessary resources for the achievement of their mission.
On 22 November, the Commission adopted a communication on the institution of a common asylum procedure and on the granting of a uniform status of refugees valid throughout the European Union, but towards this final objective that tends the common European asylum system defined in Tampere.
I shall conclude by paying tribute to the work that Mrs Ogata has done for the UNHCR and in welcoming Mr Ruud Lubbers to his new post.
It seems to us important to encourage a political amnesty in Yugoslavia for the restoration of democracy, but we believe it is also important to condemn without doubt the resumption of the terrorist incursions and activities at the borders between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo because they remind alarmingly what has happened during the conflict in Kosovo, where Western powers have been certain responsibilities.
Our compromise resolution is clear in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.
I also appeal to the President Kostunica that it explains what has become of people like Mr Ukshin Hoti, whose fate, that we do not know fully, we have the greatest interest.
I also agree with the fact to call on the KFOR, in order to avoid any other attempt to violence in the Presevo Valley.
I agree with the measures now being taken by KFOR to deal with the problem and I continue to call on all parties to moderation.

We need the international community exercises its democratic right to monitor, not as interference in the internal affairs of an independent country, but as a political procedure, cautious and preventative.
The situation in the prisons and in police stations is completely unacceptable, particularly because of ill treatment and torture that are widespread.
This treatment would be exactly similar to that which we see in Western Europe and the Minister Hikmet Sami al-Turk, faced with these protests, has postponed the transfer, so that a social and political consensus on the reform of the prisons is developing in Turkey.
It is urgent and it is for that reason that we have decided to put this item on the agenda.
It goes trial on 8 January of next year. It is accused of having participated in a meeting of Tunisian opponents in France, as indeed it denies.
When activists and responsible for these associations want to meet of the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, their houses are surrounded by the police and those who go there are attacked in the streets by men in civil.
The second problem is basically only one example of the many harassed.
My group, like this Parliament, is particularly sensitive to the human rights situation in Tunisia and in the rest of the world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us a bit of a measure please.
The negotiations have gone extremely well, I am delighted that we have great progress in these negotiations which, I hope, lead to the conclusion which referred to the honourable Member.

B5-0912/2000 by Mr Van Hecke on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
We cannot, I believe, Mr President, Commissioner, in withdrawal on this attitude.
The military have taken power in this context, which, as always, has only served to worsen the situation.
This attitude is in the continuity of the policy of French imperialism.
The Commission is also very concerned about the recent outbreaks of violence.
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.
A unfair competition can help to downgrade the quality of the working environment in the shipbuilding sector, to reduce the technical knowledge and to create a loss of jobs and lead, longer term, to a monopoly situation, which would be detrimental to world trade.

That is why I would like to thank all my colleagues for the contribution, particularly during the stage of amendments, as well as the technicians of the committee whose valuable aid to allowed to finalise this resolution.
The adoption of the social agenda by the Nice European Council strongly satisfies us, and we hope that the Member States will take this opportunity to promote the development and coordination of social security systems and care intended for older people and promote other measures which will ensure the reintegration into working life, such as lifelong learning.
The promotion of lifelong learning, a subject already addressed by another speaker - is a subject that I also support.
Of course, the people of more than 60 or 70 years can still be many useful things, but it is not normal to make their income dependent on the work they provide.
In its monthly bulletin of July 2000, the European Central Bank has also launched several urgent warnings in this regard.
For my part, I believe that the Member States are more able to resolve this problem by means of their legislative instruments.
With its proposals for active lives during the age, society is gaining an entire generation.
The promises on pensions must be held, pensions, though, must be guaranteed by the funds in these countries without their payment at the expense of the EU's common monetary policy.
We have experienced the most important social revolutions over the last 100 to 150 years, when our life expectancy has doubled.
It only gives sense of the mathematical increased life expectancy of the medical progress has enabled.
They have subsidise - society as a whole has therefore taken part - older employees have left their jobs but no young worker has been committed and a great deal of posts have been removed.
The tax and family policy should, on the contrary, to ensure that women and men who have family obligations can freely decide to have a professional activity or not.
My brother and myself have joined there.
The future initiatives in the field of public health are addressed rather to questions of health and care for the elderly and the promotion of a healthy old age.
Mr President, I have accepted the amendment tabled by Mr Pronk, both the 2 3, in which he asks that the text should be changed and insists on the concept of demographic development, instead of ageing of the population.
It does not duplicate the advertising or promotional operations of operators in the networks or with those of the public authorities.
Mr President, the Committee on Budgets was of the opinion that it is, in principle, in favour of the proposal of the Commission.
That is why it is very important to achieve a balance that can be achieved by measures to promote sales and advertising.
I think that as far as the marketing and the sale, learning as a framework for life should be placed at the centre of the programmes for education, because precisely the new technologies, the management of the research of outlets offering entirely new to a modern logistics.
First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Dary for his excellent report.
The next point relates to the discussions in the field of export and intervention.
There must be no publicity and special premiums for products which are not requested.
Everyone has enough to eat, if we do the promotion of a product that advocate clearly against the consumption of another product.
The proposals to Amendment No 18 and 24, first part, by means of which the deadlines during which the issues and products to be proposed will be assessed, are reduced from three to two years in order to improve the efficiency of the instrument of promotion.
In the Greek version, Juta Mrs Haug is presented as rapporteur to the male, implying a man, and Mr Marcuse Ferler as rapporteur to the female, implying a woman.
This is a good example of the way in which small changes in practice can have considerable effects.
That is provisionally the last Friday in Strasbourg, in other words, Strasbourg loses 12 days of presence of Parliament.
Furthermore, I should like to wish everyone, and in particular the few who have taken the trouble to attend, this Friday, this last sitting of the year 2000 in Strasbourg, enjoyable festive season and a new century which is good, but above all wise.
