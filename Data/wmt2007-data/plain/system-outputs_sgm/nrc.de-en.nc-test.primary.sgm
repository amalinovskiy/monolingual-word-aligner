<seg id=1>After races Europe's House Divided</seg>
<seg id=2>A common feature of the extreme right in Europe is their racism and the fact that they use immigration as a political lever.</seg>
<seg id=3>The Northern League in Italy, the Vlaams bloc in the Netherlands, the supporters of Le Pen's National Front in France, are examples of parties or movements, which to common theme: rejection of immigration formed and to demand for a simplified policy to rules.</seg>
<seg id=4>While individuals like Jörg Haidar, Jean-Marie Le Pen come and, unfortunately, not to leave may soon), will the rassenfrage from European politics not soon disappear.</seg>
<seg id=5>An aging population and domestic and more open borders increase the racist fragmentation in European countries.</seg>
<seg id=6>The big parties in the right and the left have the problem, and in which they head in the sand and put all prospects against have hoped, it may soon disappear.</seg>
<seg id=7>But it is not, as the history of racism in America shows.</seg>
<seg id=8>The race relations were in the US over the decades - and still do today - at the heart of the political debate which went so far that segregation as important as the income was, - even more importantly - to political zuneigungen and attitudes to determine.</seg>
<seg id=9>The first step to deal with the rassenfrage is the cause and effects of racist hostilities to understand, even if that means unpleasant facts.</seg>
<seg id=10>That is precisely what, in the US economy, a large number of research, sociology, psychology and politikwissenschaft. This research showed that people of different race far less trust each other.</seg>
<seg id=11>The White are less willing to social spending to support because they believe that minorities in order to encourage more racist divided societies have less competent governments, more corruption and nepotism, more crime and less public benefits per dollar tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id=12>It does not mean that the answer must be that andersartigkeit eliminate racial and same communities. But it is the realities behind this question, to accept a solid public policy on the draft rassenbeziehungen.</seg>
<seg id=13>Of course, there is no agreement, Americans, as it is.</seg>
<seg id=14>Yes, some action to minorities in the allocation of jobs, access to colleges and public contracts to prefer.</seg>
<seg id=15>These measures, as a type of redress for once begangenes wrong as they should, more importantly, to help shape rollenmuster left gebliebene and perhaps unwillkürliche discrimination to overcome.</seg>
<seg id=16>Other reject such action on and to say that it is only one not to rassenunterschiede respects policy combined with a free market and family-friendly bedürfe values to minorities to create jobs and help that the families of color stay together.</seg>
<seg id=17>The latter is essential for any policy is one of the most important causes of poverty in the US is the spread of households with only erziehenden parents - (mothers) Among the color.</seg>
<seg id=18>Regardless of the right, is the question as to how the races dealing to a major task in the US policy.</seg>
<seg id=19>Of course, minorities progress towards more integration and better economic successes.</seg>
<seg id=20>In the 1950's were not even farbige forward in bus to take place today, two of the most important players in the US foreign farbige.</seg>
<seg id=21>However, you can be sure that right-wing politicians in America on the map, ,rassen "as a tactical means.</seg>
<seg id=22>Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, the former assistant of Nixon and Reagan, in the last elections as independent presidential appeared.</seg>
<seg id=23>He published recently successful book entitled: "The Death of the West: how people dying and the invasion of immigrants our country and our civilization put".</seg>
<seg id=24>But for every book as this, there are ten other with a serious analysis of the rassenfrage in America.</seg>
<seg id=25>Political analysis and debates about the rassenbeziehungen are terrible behind, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=26>The question is mostly, too, with regard to zuwanderungsquoten and grenzregelungen that limit, treatment and not in terms of the related social problems and the chances of an increasingly racial mixed in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=27>Of course, a clear immigration policies needed to the accumulation of illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id=28>But this cannot all be controls on the border with Mexico, not everything that American policy to rassenfrage the country has to say.</seg>
<seg id=29>Europe is rich and is growing older rapidly; Europeans, of generous fürsorgeprogrammen abgepolstert is no longer "dirty work", say in agriculture, or in the leather industry to adopt.</seg>
<seg id=30>Already the power a increased immigration inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=31>Europeans are willing but soon, the US any mistakes in their policy on minorities and any signs of racism across the Atlantic accuse.</seg>
<seg id=32>On reading the European press, one of rassenfragen often a überlegenheitskomplex to us certain: Americans have problems with racism,; we are immune to a few of those neo Nazi, skinheads and, of the sort.</seg>
<seg id=33>In recent weeks has shown that the rassenproblem in Europe of Paris to Amsterdam much deeper in and, as in the US - to the sad fact is that rassenbeziehungen inhärent hard, and that a trust and cooperative dealing not easy about rassenschranken hinwegkommt.</seg>
<seg id=34>If Europe's large parties not begin to the rassenspannungen in Europe more to investigate and to understand and ,rasse, "one of its priorities to be as individuals, Le Pen, which see the gaps to fill their message of hatred, Alberto Alesina wirtschaftswissenschaft is Professor at the University of havard giavazzi, Professor Francesco; the wirtschaftswissenschaft at Bocconi university in Milan is part of the group of economic advisers of the President of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=35>The French exceptions combat!</seg>
<seg id=36>The focus in Europe today is right to enlargement and the Constitution, which are currently between the EU Member States, the attention.</seg>
<seg id=37>But the result of some geplänkel galliens with the European Commission the fate of the new and enlarged Europe scarcely less serious determine.</seg>
<seg id=38>France has unilaterally decided to the Stability and Growth Pact to ignore it by a vorausgesagtes deficit, far beyond the limit of 3% of GDP is brutto inlandprodukts, in buying took.</seg>
<seg id=39>The French, to keep the rational strict their thinking to good, but if they are budget estimates, is not Descartes but opacity asked.</seg>
<seg id=40>France was one of the leading Ireland's critics, when the Irish Government in 2000 their surplus, then in the 4% of GDP was only to 0.5% reduced.</seg>
<seg id=41>Other countries have been against the stability pact, but France is the first country to this with open hämischer contempt did.</seg>
<seg id=42>But should such a surprise anyone.</seg>
<seg id=43>France is simply the EU rules on his eingefleischten habits, namely its own culture as something extraordinary to see.</seg>
<seg id=44>For example, France prevented by its veto persistent reforms of the common agricultural policy (gea).</seg>
<seg id=45>As we already know that means a children's gea ansehnliches and entirely unverdientes gift to the rich European (especially France) farmers and, at the expense of survival fighting farmers in developing countries and consumers in the EU.</seg>
<seg id=46>It seeks to France, to an old politics recourse, namely unprofitable private companies on the brink of zusammenbruches with the taxpayers' money to pressure.</seg>
<seg id=47>The Commissioner for competition, Mario Monti, must not lose this fight: he needs the support of those who in the market and of the equal treatment of all believe.</seg>
<seg id=48>In this case, things are simple.</seg>
<seg id=49>The French government plans to the company to Alstom entsetzten, a company that a number of high tech products including the TGV, the French hochgeschwindigkeitszeug, has developed, but recently went bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id=50>The French Government claims that they never in its plan to save Alstom, determine that a plan with all known justifications of dirigisme: preservation of jobs, the protection of investors, and so on.</seg>
<seg id=51>Moreover, it is the French government, as it is at Alstom a high tech firm is that research and entwicklungskarte and that investment in R & D are good for growth.</seg>
<seg id=52>Alstom by the nationalisation company's saving, is obviously wrong.</seg>
<seg id=53>The company consists of many different parts. Some of bring profits, others are bankrupt, what to do, it is obvious that the firm crush.</seg>
<seg id=54>The gewinnbringenden parts, such as the TGV work, will easily find buyers works; that no profit abwerfen, should be closed.</seg>
<seg id=55>The French taxpayers money is better for the support of the redundant workers spent than for subsidies to unprofitable companies alive.</seg>
<seg id=56>It is important that the European Commission not to France, in the competition policy as apparently already with its fiscal rules excluding.</seg>
<seg id=57>The Commission should public aid to private companies in France as well as they prevent such subsidies in any case, the EU has.</seg>
<seg id=58>The Commission has on this front has some successes, as forced by Germany, regierungsbürgschaften for the public banks.</seg>
<seg id=59>In particular Alstom and France in general should not form exceptions; they should be the same standards to keep.</seg>
<seg id=60>If the Commission failed to act, the EU will more like the French government officials spielwiese appear</seg>
<seg id=61>France has already taken a leading role in the foreign policy, with Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin more and more as the Foreign Minister in Europe is a, and so is.</seg>
<seg id=62>France also violated essential provisions of the common economic policy and the of public aid to private companies.</seg>
<seg id=63>The European Commission to what remains of its credibility, lose, and as a minor Paris district look like?</seg>
<seg id=64>A defeat in the Alstom case would have far-reaching consequences for Europe and not only for its competition policy.</seg>
<seg id=65>Oil war lost</seg>
<seg id=66>For decades, America under democratic and republikanisch presidencies, a number of clear energy objectives pursued consistently, weltölpreis as stable as possible; the oil the country in which a possible way drosseln; foreign dependence on imports, wherever possible, to reduce; and the oil imports into a number of origin.</seg>
<seg id=67>Even if it seems different, under the Bush administration, none of these targets changed.</seg>
<seg id=68>Many observers believe that Bush have embarked on a new course, because the invasion of Iraq seems to run counter to these objectives.</seg>
<seg id=69>A large increase in oil production in Iraq to the dependency of relative to the US of oil by other energy sources to increase, as a result of the extra supply in weltölpreise probably collapse.</seg>
<seg id=70>This would in exchange an increase in US dependence on imported oil, especially from the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=71>The irony here, however, is that the US under the UN, vorkriegsprogramm ,öl for food "(in the UN, not Saddam Hussein the levels of Iraqi ölverkäufe abroad to certain) greater control of the Iraqi oil sector ausübten, when the future in a democratically governed Iraq will do.</seg>
<seg id=72>If the Bush administration stable, safe and cheap imports by many sides, uses, then they would have simply the embargo against countries such as Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan and its oil from there hereinschwabben can.</seg>
<seg id=73>But was the American interest in the Iraqi oil not of their economic or of energy.</seg>
<seg id=74>The Bush Administration recognized that Iraqi oil, above all, a crucial geopolitical levers.</seg>
<seg id=75>Who always Iraqi oil controls, dominated Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=76>Saddam's power based on his control over the second largest reserves in the world.</seg>
<seg id=77>He clearly understood the role that the oil for his power played.</seg>
<seg id=78>With the possibility of invasion and defeat of, threatened Saddam, Iraq's oil fields anzuzünden.</seg>
<seg id=79>Much of the later looting and destruction of Iraqi öleinrichtungen and pipelines reflects the widespread recognition of that control of the oil the rule over Iraq means.</seg>
<seg id=80>In the US invasionsplänen, securing the oil fields a crucial priority.</seg>
<seg id=81>The aim was not to expand the supply and the Americans to lower prices, but Saddam from its power base to separate and ultimately a new Iraqi government and to stabilize.</seg>
<seg id=82>Iraq's future depends directly on the fate of the Iraqi oil.</seg>
<seg id=83>But the whims of ölgeschäftes unresolved, especially under such circumstances, be difficult to see how the Bush administration within the next few years will be able to achieve their goals in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=84>The logic is simple.</seg>
<seg id=85>The US must the öleinkünfte use to us taxpayers the burden of the financing of the regime in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=86>All wiederaufbaupläne attached in the long run, the ability of Iraq on large amounts of oil, to export.</seg>
<seg id=87>If Iraq's oil can be not ausliefert, President Bush its promises to the Iraqi, the American people, or the Community not deliver.</seg>
<seg id=88>Before the invasion of Iraq's oil production was the capacity on three million barrels per day.</seg>
<seg id=89>Iraq is its production within the time frame, the nötigt is to an Iraqi government to establish, not back to this level can raise.</seg>
<seg id=90>Any increase of Iraq's oil production requires that oil fields to develop what substantial investment, legitimate, a representative government and political stability means.</seg>
<seg id=91>Not even the Bush Administration believes that these conditions soon to.</seg>
<seg id=92>In fact, political stability the main condition for the increase in capacity.</seg>
<seg id=93>Historical examples Iran, from Kuwait, Russia, and even Iraq even show that, after the wiedererreichen political stability around three years to raise markedly capacity and to achieve a higher level.</seg>
<seg id=94>Iraq needs to several years to write a new constitution, a legitimate and democratic government, with the establishing of öleinkünfte on its regions, to negotiate new investitionsgesetze enacted, and its economy for foreigners attractive.</seg>
<seg id=95>It needs time to continue with the international oil companies and countries to negotiate, technical feasibility studies and to rebuild its oil fields, in motion, and to explore.</seg>
<seg id=96>So it seems even a time framework of three years as optimistic because it is, that the occupation of that time ended, Iraqis will build their own democratic government and a political stability to be.</seg>
<seg id=97>You need not to mention that the situation is very different, can develop.</seg>
<seg id=98>The tensions can still years to remain.</seg>
<seg id=99>No one should be surprised if Iraq's oil production even under a democratic government is suddenly comes to a halt.</seg>
<seg id=100>Historical experience to suggest that arbeitskämpfe and similar disorders that oil can prevent, in democratic countries represent a greater threat than in undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id=101>If its förderkapazitäten Iraq in the next few years, this will not increase can quickly the US outside as well as their energy disrupt.</seg>
<seg id=102>As to the US to rebuild Iraq in the long run finance?</seg>
<seg id=103>Who will pay, a fragile democracy Iraqi alive?</seg>
<seg id=104>Can the US their occupation sustained if it to the Iraqi people not food, health care and other basic services can offer?</seg>
<seg id=105>These are questions inconvenient. They remain fundamentally unbeantwortbar, until a stable, democratic regime in Iraq the steady flow of oil exports determine and ensure.</seg>
<seg id=106>The murderer guardians of human</seg>
<seg id=107>It would be not so deeply sad, we should laugh: Libya is chairman of the UN elected!</seg>
<seg id=108>As caligula horse Senators to be made, at least klebte blood, whose hufen.</seg>
<seg id=109>Of course, the process entirely legally: the chaired rotiert each year from one part to another.</seg>
<seg id=110>This year, the number of Africa, the chairman of the vote and it appointed Libya.</seg>
<seg id=111>Only the US and Canada voted against.</seg>
<seg id=112>To their forever lasted shame, the European countries the.</seg>
<seg id=113>It is significant for the state of the moral corruption of the UN that decision now, at this difficult time for the organization, was taken.</seg>
<seg id=114>President Bush has to the UN, to prove that it is serious about Iraq with its resolutions, otherwise they will suffer the same fate as schmachvolle the League of Nations, in the 1930s, aggressive policy Nazi Germany and the Fascist Italy completely powerless gegenüberstand.</seg>
<seg id=115>Libya just now in the Chair of the UN body to vote, who is responsible for human rights is a negative impact on the legitimacy and the moral authority of the whole organization down.</seg>
<seg id=116>Let us remember: Libya is a totalitarian tyranny, his head of state, Al Colonel Muammar that often unberechenbares behave with extremist policies by the dictators of the world.</seg>
<seg id=117>He is one of the most repressive regime of the world, which is not even the vortäuschung elections and where there is opposition immediately crushed.</seg>
<seg id=118>Under his rule, Libya terrorist organizations in the world - supported by the IRA to towards various Palestinian extremist groups.</seg>
<seg id=119>The sanctions for the role of the country in which the crash of the pan passagiermaschine the Lockerbie, Scotland has played a decade ago, have not yet been lifted.</seg>
<seg id=120>In the past decade is the position of the UN as a symbol for the ideal peaceful community ever been infiltrated.</seg>
<seg id=121>It was totally unable to the wars in the Balkans and to prevent at least in one case, Srebrenica, saw a Dutch peacekeeping force the worst massacre in Europe since 1945 stand of the Bosnian Serbs 000 unarmed Muslims in.</seg>
<seg id=122>A Dutch aufklärungsausschuss later a admitted that the Dutch UN force in fact in this war was involved.</seg>
<seg id=123>Rwanda. hardly had begun to the genocide ordered the friedenssichernden are responsible for the UN funktionär withdrawal of the UN troops from the country in the field and überließ racist massacre the bloodiest since the second world war.</seg>
<seg id=124>The name of this funktionärs Kofi Annan.</seg>
<seg id=125>The - probably vergebliche attempt - the UN, now on the Iraq crisis to give the impression that they speak with the voice of reason and the international legitimacy is only depressing and pathetic to name.</seg>
<seg id=126>But at a time when the UN inspectors in Iraq seem like the salvation, to send a gangsterbande dig, can the fact that Libya's presided over the Human Rights Commission is transmitted, perhaps in history as the mistake in, the failure of organization has lowered, with much hope launched.</seg>
<seg id=127>Organizations not usually go under - and there are certainly too much raison d'etat to ensure that the UN, to schleppt.</seg>
<seg id=128>But it is only a shadow of what they should be and may be.</seg>
<seg id=129>The UN of today is nothing more than another word of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id=130>Authoritarianism to advance</seg>
<seg id=131>Last Thursday I condemned the judges of the Indonesian zentralgericht in Jakarta to a year prison.</seg>
<seg id=132>The editor-in-chief of nachrichtenmagazins pace weekly, I am, under the verdict, to a wirtschaftsmagnaten called tomy winata verleumdet to have I by its possible involvement in a fire in the southeast textile market in Jakarta have assumed. Moreover, I am guilty, been declared by the spread of lies riots fuelled to have.</seg>
<seg id=133>Is my case and other similar cases already a reference to the end of a further democratic short-lived experiment in Indonesia?</seg>
<seg id=134>The "riots" the supposedly schürte, I found in March last year, rather than almost two hundred randalierer, which as supporters winatas spending, office of pace, attacks, on fire on threatened, the workforce and a drangsalierten reporters wounded.</seg>
<seg id=135>In the attempt to peacefully to resolve the situation, I was persuaded to me, to talk to the central police station in Jakarta to go to my horror was police station but control the mob.</seg>
<seg id=136>I was beaten and have, while the police wegsah.</seg>
<seg id=137>Fortunately, we came many journalists with tonbandgeräten cameras and to aid.</seg>
<seg id=138>The publication of their photographs caused a public outcry, in turn, Parliament, forced, to organise a public hearing.</seg>
<seg id=139>The police chiefs of the country and the Jakarta vorgeladen, and the leaders of the mob were under massive public pressure, prosecuted charged.</seg>
<seg id=140>But winata entging a police investigation, and the only because he claimed that his supporters have vorheriges without his knowledge and his consent traded.</seg>
<seg id=141>Then he drehte the tables and even to erstattete strafanzeige against Ahmad taufik, the author of the article, against the editor teuku iskandar Ali, him redigierte and against me.</seg>
<seg id=142>The years of trial was marked by a number of suspects developments which all winata beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id=143>First, by the police and the prosecutor built case, falsified documents presented so obvious, that the police two responsible anklagte.</seg>
<seg id=144>But the Court had our request to verfahrensaufschub until the legal status of the prosecutor and the police built on case.</seg>
<seg id=145>The proceedings against the two policemen seems to be delayed.</seg>
<seg id=146>One of the police, the commander of the newly created (and financed by the US) anti terror unity of Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id=147>The other is on a fortbildungslehrgang for police have been sent.</seg>
<seg id=148>After that, the sixth month of the process, was the chairman of the three-member richtergremiums suddenly to a chefin stadtgerichtes appointed, one hour of Jakarta is removed.</seg>
<seg id=149>One of my lawyers said that it him in his 35 jährigen career in court not happening is that, by a leading judges during a process underway austauscht.</seg>
<seg id=150>In fact, was the judge, despite their promotion, in another case in the same House continue as chairman.</seg>
<seg id=151>In our process took a judge in the Chair, before in winatas zivilrechtsverfahren a judgment against pace, like.</seg>
<seg id=152>After all, in its statement on a winata meineid when he bestritt pace, an interview given to have.</seg>
<seg id=153>The trial was a bandaufzeichnung telefoninterviews taken place; the reporters, of the interview, led, as well as two editors as witnesses said under oath; from the official record of telephone company, trial as evidence the call into a experts and concluded that the vote on the tonband by tomy winata was.</seg>
<seg id=154>The judges but did's request pace, the detention and prosecutions winatas because of meineid and are rieten us, to place, as we did.</seg>
<seg id=155>Then given the judges and request a rejection of the decision to of resolving winatas meineidfall to postpone.</seg>
<seg id=156>Given such an inadequate process, came my conviction and the prison little surprising.</seg>
<seg id=157>However, I am confident that we will prevail in the end, if pace appeal to higher courts.</seg>
<seg id=158>The Indonesian courts of higher level are clean and the President of the Supreme Court is a staunch advocates of democracy and freedom of the press. The case pace could become a pioneering victory for our democracy are, like the famous US Supreme Court decision in the case of the New York Times against Sullivan.</seg>
<seg id=159>It is the obstacle defamatorische charges raised. This decision ensures that American journalists public people to account.</seg>
<seg id=160>In no country in the world, it knows better than in Indonesia that freedom of expression and of the nachweislichen indicators of democratic development and that the criminalisation of journalists a frühes signs of authoritarianism.</seg>
<seg id=161>In the 1950, Indonesia, was a liberal democracy. In 1956 took then President Sukarno with the military drastic measures against the press.</seg>
<seg id=162>The critical voices were calm, consolidate the uncontrolled power easier fell. In July 1959 had Sukarno by decree the "controlled democracy".</seg>
<seg id=163>In the first years after sukarnos fall in 1966, all standards a real democracy, including the press restored (except for Communists).</seg>
<seg id=164>But in the early 1970's began Suharto again against the press and to finally various media to ban and many journalists to imprison.</seg>
<seg id=165>After the press be brought under control, were also rapidly other political rights curtailed and the Indonesian democracy failed again.</seg>
<seg id=166>Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia is the third largest democratic country in the world and the largest democracy in the Muslim history.</seg>
<seg id=167>Two parliamentary and two direct presidential elections, including the recent runoff - verliefen free, fair and peaceful and were proof that Islam and democracy can coexist well.</seg>
<seg id=168>The enemies of the democracy, however, has never been sleep.</seg>
<seg id=169>Radical Islamic groups, indiscriminate bombing and groups with strong authoritarian tendencies have it up in the innermost one of President Megawati managed.</seg>
<seg id=170>But just Megawati suffered a defeat in the presidential.</seg>
<seg id=171>Also, the newly elected President Susilo journalists continue to pursue?</seg>
<seg id=172>To my conviction and the proceedings and condemnation of colleagues the end of the hard-won third democracy in Indonesia herald?</seg>
<seg id=173>The answer lies in the support of a democratic activists in Indonesia and abroad can win.</seg>
<seg id=174>The loss of Indonesia - a potential beacon of hope for all pro-democracy activists throughout the Muslim world - would be a terrible defeat.</seg>
<seg id=175>Of the of the death penalty morality.</seg>
<seg id=176>The US, due to its refusal to abolish the death penalty, often criticized.</seg>
<seg id=177>Now claim many, the abolition of the death penalty is a prerequisite for a civilized criminal justice system.</seg>
<seg id=178>Nobel Prize Gary Becker goes.</seg>
<seg id=179>European governments are totally against the death penalty, in the European Union, it is entirely banned, and some Europeans regard the use of the death penalty in the United States as barbaric.</seg>
<seg id=180>Many European intellectual even argue that not only the death penalty, but in general, no deterrent to criminals.</seg>
<seg id=181>While Europe with crime, in the last 50 years far below those America were, over a long period, could afford most crimes relatively "mild" to meet occurred there over the last 20 years to a drastic increase in verbrechensraten.</seg>
<seg id=182>By contrast, these figures are in America partly because a further use of penalties fallen.</seg>
<seg id=183>It also means, too, the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=184>I am for the execution of a murderer of convicted persons, because, and just because, I believe that to other murderer discouraged.</seg>
<seg id=185>I would not convinced, would I am against the death penalty, for revenge and other possible motives should not as a basis for the policy of a state.</seg>
<seg id=186>The empirical research on the death penalty took in the US with a pioneering study Isaac ehrlichs its outcome, 1975 in the American economic review published.</seg>
<seg id=187>In some subsequent studies, the abschreckungseffekt as much smaller described in others than more.</seg>
<seg id=188>The existing data, but rather limited, so its conclusions should not only on the basis of econometric beweismaterials.</seg>
<seg id=189>Of course, can with political decisions about any kind of punishment not wait until this evidence is fully.</seg>
<seg id=190>But even such limited quantitatively data give reason to believe that the death penalty has a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id=191>Most people, especially murderer, fear the death, especially when he quickly and with some certainty verübung after the murder of entry.</seg>
<seg id=192>David Hume said in his abhandlung over suicide that, "No one life wegwarf, to maintain the worth was.</seg>
<seg id=193>For our natural fear the death is so large, schopenhauer similar... ", is as follows:" What if it then come to is that the schrecknisse of life schrecknisse outweigh the death of man, will put an end to his life.</seg>
<seg id=194>But the schrecknisse of death afford substantial resistance... "</seg>
<seg id=195>The opponent of the death penalty often claim that the state had no moral right to life someone to take, not even a hideous murderer.</seg>
<seg id=196>For anyone who believes in the deterrent effect of the death penalty, but this is a totally wrong conclusion.</seg>
<seg id=197>To understand the reason to suppose that for every executed (for example, rather than to lebenslänglicher prison) sentenced murderer three murders prevented, with this is a much smaller number is than in the abhandlungen ehrlichs or other work on the issue of deterrence.</seg>
<seg id=198>It follows that for every not executed three murderer innocent victims to their lives.</seg>
<seg id=199>Indeed, the government would indirectly so many lives "," if you take the death penalty not began.</seg>
<seg id=200>The save three innocent lives for any person hingerichtete seems to be an interesting well used, even if a execution two save lives, seems a convincing the cost.</seg>
<seg id=201>Admittedly, the argument for the death penalty is with lower number of lives geretteten less schlagkräftig.</seg>
<seg id=202>Even if a execution only a save lives could be the still used a more desirable if the gerettete life to much better, as the unused, as is usually the case may be.</seg>
<seg id=203>Many people are against a balance between the quality of life and of geretteten genommenen.</seg>
<seg id=204>I see no reason, however, such a comparison not to.</seg>
<seg id=205>Consider a berufsverbrecher, of a people deprived and kills. victim led a respektables life and leaves several children and a spouse.</seg>
<seg id=206>Suppose, it would be possible, the life of an innocent victim of the execution of such verbrechers to protect.</seg>
<seg id=207>It is clear to me that it must have more weight to the lives of saving as a criminal life.</seg>
<seg id=208>Of course, not all cases so clearly, but the comparison in terms of both the quality of life must be part of any reasonable gesellschaftspolitik.</seg>
<seg id=209>This helps explain why, in the case of the death penalty, not only in the case of murder but in lower crime used to.</seg>
<seg id=210>If in exchange for executions, for example, a reduction of the diebstahlsfälle is to be achieved is far more a mildere form of punishment.</seg>
<seg id=211>Despite massive violations of rape as a murder of schweregrades well to come and understandably calls for according to the death penalty will be, I do in these cases.</seg>
<seg id=212>A convincing argument, the death penalty only in mordfällen apply is the "marginal deterrence."</seg>
<seg id=213>If, against the death penalty, are the perpetrators would have an incentive to their victims to kill to itself, not to be (that is the reason why the severity of penalties in general to the schweregrad the crime should be tied).</seg>
<seg id=214>One problem is that, of the death penalty threatened murderer to go further than this would, in order to escape their arrest, which, in turn, the todeszahlen could increase.</seg>
<seg id=215>While the marginal deterrence an important factor is, I believe that the attempts of the murderer to his arrest - may be at the expense of their own life -, an indirect evidence are criminals fear that the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id=216>I am, of course, the risk may innocent execute, headache.</seg>
<seg id=217>I agree, on the death penalty would greatly weakened if the number of innocent executed indeed would be as large as often claims.</seg>
<seg id=218>I believe, however, that the appeal in the US an extraordinarily large protection, but not so much to unwarranted condemnations, but well against unwarranted executions, so that, if anything, very few cases of innocent people are executed.</seg>
<seg id=219>With the development of DNA identification, this protection, enormously expanded.</seg>
<seg id=220>Again, the debate on the death penalty is essentially a debate about deterrence (the effect, given the length gezogener appeal can lose).</seg>
<seg id=221>I understand that some people are sceptical about the evidence mentioned, although I believe that they are both in this respect, as well as in terms of common sense in this wrong.</seg>
<seg id=222>The idea of people, even a murderer, life to take is disturbing, but sometimes are highly unpleasant measures needed in order to prevent even more of the cost the lives of innocent victims.</seg>
<seg id=223>The people against Putin</seg>
<seg id=224>I have the choice of Vladimir Putin as successor to Russia's first democratically elected President, Boris Yeltsin, who.</seg>
<seg id=225>Because now KGB and mafia structures Russia rule and the judicial system to manipulate is assumed that Yeltsin his successor even which wanted to avoid a future criminal.</seg>
<seg id=226>But we, Putin auswählten, had the task, to find anyone to Yeltsin's reforms you, not to him and his family to protect.</seg>
<seg id=227>Yeltsin was well furchtlos strebte and not his personal survive, but the survival of the democratic idea in which he introduced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=228>Yet is this idea is now because of of us elected successor in danger.</seg>
<seg id=229>I way the responsibility for the support Putin's not by me.</seg>
<seg id=230>We were not close friends, but he and I worked together in key situations, and I have never been in doubt his sincerity.</seg>
<seg id=231>Putin is after his convictions.</seg>
<seg id=232>The problem is that his beliefs -- including his faith that Russia flourish only if it is governed by a single machtquelle -- are wrong.</seg>
<seg id=233>This great mistake leads Russia in the political ruin.</seg>
<seg id=234>Of course, no one in this spitzenamt without mistake to commit, even basic, and in particular in turbulent times.</seg>
<seg id=235>Yeltsin was no exception, but he recognized its mistake.</seg>
<seg id=236>When he silvesterabend zurücktrat in 1999, for example, he asked for forgiveness for the war in Chechnya began.</seg>
<seg id=237>Putin, seems unable to recognize, its mistakes and admit and keeps to a policy that long after their failure for the world is visible.</seg>
<seg id=238>One of Yeltsin's mistakes was his failure to moral priorities at the top of its agenda.</seg>
<seg id=239>Russia had the Stalinism and the Gulag system must regret.</seg>
<seg id=240>Without exception have the whole nation must feel remorse, as the Germans since 1945 remorse perceived.</seg>
<seg id=241>This failure is important, because it could Putin unqualifizierter belief in a central authority, lead to the state of the security services zurückerobert was.</seg>
<seg id=242>In fact, if the national regret the Gulag era as a direct result of the ban on Communist Party and the exclusion of the former KGB staff of political office must mean.</seg>
<seg id=243>Although such political review in post-communist societies are complicated, as well as well as collaboration opferrolle widespread and the limits in between often blurred, have a good solution can be found, as in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id=244>Because nothing has been done, Russia's security structures remained intact and could a political comeback address that they now have reached.</seg>
<seg id=245>The political resurrection of the KGB, Putin structures and their efforts to dissent silence, have Russia back in a country of überläufer transformed.</seg>
<seg id=246>It is impossible to independent politicians and independent media silence, without independent sources prevent, which is why the Kremlin under Putin its attacks on the so-called "oligarchs" has focused.</seg>
<seg id=247>Mikhail Khodorkovsky's arrest and trial, that is why orchestriert.</seg>
<seg id=248>The security services, the Kremlin dominate, hope, by the independent sources remove the independent political life in Russia destroy.</seg>
<seg id=249>Without independent intellectual bases widespread, a climate of fear.</seg>
<seg id=250>But fear is not only degrading, it also promotes a bad governance.</seg>
<seg id=251>Yeltsin understood intuitively that fear and a centralized decision-making from the top down, are not of a modern country to govern, so it was that the relationship between citizens and state reform.</seg>
<seg id=252>Putin is still not understand that a political system system now as is incapable of mistakes and to correct, as in the Soviet era.</seg>
<seg id=253>As not very educated man leads Putin Russia in full and deeper sincerity in the same zersetzung, the collapse of sowjetstaates accompanied.</seg>
<seg id=254>The people to catch to grasp.</seg>
<seg id=255>They recognize that Putin's desire to a strong and effective modern state to create not into a modern state because not from above, but is governed by informed citizens, their leaders to see their mistakes and to rectify.</seg>
<seg id=256>Putin seems inability to his government also to ahnen.</seg>
<seg id=257>This is one of the reasons why Russia since neuestem so aggressively against its neighbors, Ukraine and Georgia, on and tries to its military presence places like region to maintain the breakaway region Moldova.</seg>
<seg id=258>By its influence in Russia's foreign nahem asserts that believes the Kremlin, Russians at home, his omnipotence to.</seg>
<seg id=259>Given the narrow debate in Russia and the ability to manipulate the Kremlin, elections is a change of government, the only option for those who want to preserve the democratic idea in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=260>It is no good, the illusions it.</seg>
<seg id=261>Those who, Putin confront, have to decide what they want, and say that, if the regime, not to the constitution, to have the right to it with every notwenigen means to force.</seg>
<seg id=262>The power in Russia can now no longer only in the box decided.</seg>
<seg id=263>As in Ukraine, Lebanon, and Kyrgizstan, it will be decided in the streets.</seg>
<seg id=264>Taxes and spending (please raise)</seg>
<seg id=265>An excessive burden can reduce incentives and growth hinder</seg>
<seg id=266>A a low taxation but can do the same.</seg>
<seg id=267>Governments, the only about meager tax have, have no money to basic public goods available to.</seg>
<seg id=268>Even worse is that low tax revenues in poor countries rather than less on low rates on flawed steuereinhebungssysteme are due also to the unproductive enterprises.</seg>
<seg id=269>In the case of India shows the importance of a well thought tax system.</seg>
<seg id=270>In Bangalore have hi tech companies in gepflegten grünanlagen weltklasseuniversitäten with following hochgeschwindigkeitsdatennetze built.</seg>
<seg id=271>Beyond this universitätsgelände shape, open abwasserkanäle, not entsorgter waste and urgent reparaturbedürftige roads picture.</seg>
<seg id=272>While technologiefirmen terabytes at a time of data in remote continents send to move the local public transport with almost medieval speed continued.</seg>
<seg id=273>For this reason, companies in Bangalore their own bus services, have treaties with private providers of water and have their own generators to before the ausfällen in public electricity to protect.</seg>
<seg id=274>The state can chaos not remove, because he is bust.</seg>
<seg id=275>The Indian staatschulden is more than 70% of GDP. more than half of the tax must therefore zinsentilgung to be spent on.</seg>
<seg id=276>The debt are not due to excessive spending in the past.</seg>
<seg id=277>The public spending in India is around 15% of GDP, compared to be in the OECD average 40% of GDP for public spending used.</seg>
<seg id=278>The financial difficulties India have their cause, in a badly drawn and badly managed tax.</seg>
<seg id=279>Compared to international standards seem the fiscal regulations and einkommenssteuersätze for individuals and businesses adequately.</seg>
<seg id=280>Yet is the revenue of the Indian Government of income taxes only 3.7% of GDP. The value of the revenue is half of South Korea, and other Asian Tigers.</seg>
<seg id=281>About a quarter of GNP dropped on agriculture, but not even wealthy farmers pay taxes.</seg>
<seg id=282>Export-oriented businesses in the software industry and in other sectors enjoy relief for their profits, while the employees of these companies, lohnsteuer.</seg>
<seg id=283>Despite appropriate tax evasion is widespread.</seg>
<seg id=284>This fraud can take place, because the government or in more staff in the systems of ausforschung steuerhinterziehern invested, rarely with a prison sentence to be, and are often enough with bribes their way out of trouble track.</seg>
<seg id=285>The tax evasion in "" direct income and gewinnsteuern reflects the chaos in the "" indirect taxes reflect on production and consumption eingehoben.</seg>
<seg id=286>Over 60% of indirect taxes in India accounts for taxes. The share of indirect taxes, is, in turn, gesamtsteuervolumen 60%.</seg>
<seg id=287>The basissteuersatz, with 16% of produktionswertes a company fixed.</seg>
<seg id=288>There are still a number of perks and privileges, aufschlägen.</seg>
<seg id=289>So, in categories such as food, streichhölzer baumwollgarn, computers and a vergünstigter tax of 8% applied.</seg>
<seg id=290>In addition to polyesterfasern containing products, on cars, air and a mature "special excise" (sed eingehoben) by 8%.</seg>
<seg id=291>The "additional excise" (aed, not to be confused with the SED) account for goods on "important".</seg>
<seg id=292>Moreover, there are many complex exemption from duty which enjoy gesamtjahreseinkünften of companies with less than 10 million rupees and firms in difficult or backward regions.</seg>
<seg id=293>Overall, these exemptions in 70 broad categories, which put in 259 eintragungen, 52 conditions and 7 lists are divided, each of which, in turn, many points.</seg>
<seg id=294>Relief Laden abuse.</seg>
<seg id=295>To a certain price can rangniedrige officials who considerable discretion in the application of the conditions, which led to the regulations favorable interpretation.</seg>
<seg id=296>Goods, a high tax subject (polierter granit, for example), as goods with a lower tax sold (not polierter granit, for example).</seg>
<seg id=297>The evasion of taxes is more widespread than those of profit and income taxes.</seg>
<seg id=298>Hinterzieht a firm and tax, the tax in the industry in comparison to the gain of high tax, it is also the competition was forced, if they are to survive.</seg>
<seg id=299>In increasing tax evasion invent governments "additional" or "special taxes, and thus to more to tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id=300>As suffers the einhebung direct taxes.</seg>
<seg id=301>The finanzbeamten for a new einstufungen paid bribes, the difference between the value of poliertem and not poliertem granit and the actual verschwiegenen revenues create "black", which has no einkommenssteuererklärung aufscheinen.</seg>
<seg id=302>The evasion indirect taxes, not only the State in the provision of basic public goods, but is the company, the incentive to productive technologies to introduce a more production style needed.</seg>
<seg id=303>But as indirect taxes easier to the operation of many small production as a large hinterzogen can scale are not to realize.</seg>
<seg id=304>In this context, it is worth that Indian companies in the software industry, where all firms of indirect tax free, efficient economies.</seg>
<seg id=305>India could follow the example of China, where the rationalization indirect taxes in 1994, the conditions for a large schaffte boom?</seg>
<seg id=306>Or are koalitionsregierungen in a strong democracy to such reform incapable of?</seg>
<seg id=307>Last year, led by the BJP government by laws to a drastic reduction of deficit.</seg>
<seg id=308>Then, set up a working party which the necessary changes in the tax and spending policies to develop.</seg>
<seg id=309>In July, the proposed force, to raise taxes (and not to cut spending) by, among other things, most exemptions indirect taxes off.</seg>
<seg id=310>The new Indian government under the leadership of the Congress Party, these proposals also welcome.</seg>
<seg id=311>If the Congress party and the opposition plan to finish, they are a wide-ranging step for sustainable economic development of the country and resolved, and the idea that democracies are not able to enforce the measures needed to development.</seg>
<seg id=312>What is true with Turkey not</seg>
<seg id=313>On 16 December, Orhan Pamuk, one of the writer berühmtesten Turkey, a court in Istanbul on to the charges, "the national identity to offend," to after it, for the open discussion of Turkish genocide 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916 has had.</seg>
<seg id=314>Pamuk must with three years in prison expect.</seg>
<seg id=315>The efforts of Turkey, who confront the official line, with fine to punish and einzusperren, convinced me that I was right to when I the negotiations to the country's membership of the EU rejected.</seg>
<seg id=316>The European Council in December 1999 awarded the status of Turkey's EU contenders, which meant that Turkey of the Union at a later date, not to join.</seg>
<seg id=317>The Council asked the European Commission then to, until October 2004 to decide whether Turkey the political criteria for membership sufficiently fulfilled, including democracy, the rule of law and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg id=318>This was one of the recent decisions by the Commission under Romano Prodi fällte of which I was a member.</seg>
<seg id=319>Of its 29 30 Members thought that Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the criteria, to proceed.</seg>
<seg id=320>I was the only abweichler.</seg>
<seg id=321>The Commission's report on Turkey, even by the then for the EU to Günter Verheugen was drawn up, beeinflusste my decision.</seg>
<seg id=322>In this report has been mentioned that in 2003, 21.870 Turks asylgesuche EU einreichten which 2127 adopted.</seg>
<seg id=323>In other words, EU governments even realized in 2003 that the Turkish Government over 2000 of their own citizens, had.</seg>
<seg id=324>Meanwhile the Commission published a progress report on Turkey, the einräumte that reform under the more islamisch eingestellten government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan would continue, albeit at a slower pace.</seg>
<seg id=325>But the report presented and serious concerns: human rights violations, including torture, were continued; the influence of the military remained too large; freedom of speech, not everywhere with; non-Muslim religious and cultural minorities;, discrimination and violence against women was not strong enough fight.</seg>
<seg id=326>It has not much has changed since the talks in October have begun.</seg>
<seg id=327>Alongside the current persecution of pamuks there are examples of unacceptable behavior.</seg>
<seg id=328>In March 2005 unterbrach the police force a demonstration celebration of International Women's.</seg>
<seg id=329>In May, the greatest lehrergewerkschaft banned because it is eintrat, the 14 million Kurds in Turkey in their mother tongue to inform.</seg>
<seg id=330>Intolerance, in fact, at the top of the Turkish Government.</seg>
<seg id=331>The Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said recently unvermittelt a press conference in Copenhagen on when he a Kurdish journalists in audience erspähte and the Danes, refused to these hinauszuwerfen.</seg>
<seg id=332>Such actions and attitudes justify my vote of October 2004 enough.</seg>
<seg id=333>But even if these defects would be, if Turkey is still not in the EU to join, because it is not a European country.</seg>
<seg id=334>Christianity, feudalism, renaissance, democracy, and the Enlightenment have made us industrialization at what we Europeans have, but they have not made the Turks to what they are.</seg>
<seg id=335>Therefore I am not convinced that the reforms in Turkey, to push the European Commission have been implemented, the accession would continue.</seg>
<seg id=336>I suspect that it even withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id=337>Moreover, Turkey's accession would inevitably lead to the Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova would join, and perhaps Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.</seg>
<seg id=338>The first three of these countries are certainly European as Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=339>It makes the three republics outside, includes but the former Yugoslavia, a would the EU with a around 35 Members mean.</seg>
<seg id=340>What a Union would be?</seg>
<seg id=341>The EU is not simply a freundschaftsclub.</seg>
<seg id=342>It is based on the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.</seg>
<seg id=343>As the guardian of the Treaties, the Commission needs to protect these four basic freedoms, that means that it should be the Member States, and sometimes to force, if need be, to change their legislation.</seg>
<seg id=344>The policy in Sweden the law, Volkswagen in Germany and the discrimination against foreign investment in France are fallbeispiele with which the Commission made unpopular.</seg>
<seg id=345>But they were needed</seg>
<seg id=346>When I left the Commission, I was on a pile of 1500 such proceedings.</seg>
<seg id=347>In the EU, the consequence of that a State drastic measures must accept that a strong impact on its internal affairs.</seg>
<seg id=348>This will be so different Members be impossible.</seg>
<seg id=349>The EU would victims of what the historian Paul Kennedy as "imperial überdehnung".</seg>
<seg id=350>The EU would excessively strong gestreckt.</seg>
<seg id=351>So feared the former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, that the accession of Turkey to the dissolution of the EU would cause, and so the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: "the betritt Turkey would be more than the EU could cope."</seg>
<seg id=352>But the most important reason against the accession of Turkey is a matter of democracy: the majority of the population wants it simply not.</seg>
<seg id=353>Bolivia's crisis Latin fail</seg>
<seg id=354>Bolivia is in no respect, a typical Latin American country.</seg>
<seg id=355>Aside from Haiti, it is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, it is even of even greater instability and has a history with over two hundred coups since independence.</seg>
<seg id=356>In a region with a strong indigenous past and present a shattered and isolated Bolivia, Guatemala is perhaps the only country in Latin America, the indigenous peoples form the majority.</seg>
<seg id=357>His topography and ethnic division of autonomous bring forces and even abspaltungsbestrebungen out the national unity on bedrohlichere way put than in other countries.</seg>
<seg id=358>Moreover, it is together with Paraguay, of course, the only nation in the subcontinent without access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id=359>It would be extremely imprudent, Bolivia's current crisis on the rest of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=360>Generalisations are too simple: in other countries, the institutions more, poverty, especially the extreme poverty -- has declined, and the battle for natural resources is, by and large, resolved.</seg>
<seg id=361>Even in countries like Venezuela with large reserves and a traditionsbewussten, nationalist government, the current practice, foreign investment in energy resources allow soon the boom-and-bust achtjährige of President Hugo Chavez survived.</seg>
<seg id=362>Though many countries, of Chiapas, "araucania", of amazonien after ayacucho, indigenous movements exist, they nowhere in Latin America a real threat to national unity.</seg>
<seg id=363>Bolivia is neither a warning crisis, still seems the altehrwürdige "domino", the Lyndon Johnson, both as well as in the case of Che Guevara Bolivia anschlossen, valid, or even less reasonable.</seg>
<seg id=364>Yet, Bolivia's current crisis on the "democratic deficit" that Latin America is now plagt.</seg>
<seg id=365>In Ecuador and Bolivia, Haiti, the elected leaders overthrown, for various reasons.</seg>
<seg id=366>In Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua is flawed pronounced either democracy or not, and in Venezuela, Colombia is threatened by different causes.</seg>
<seg id=367>None of these cases is exactly the other, they are in different, threatening, harmful or conciliatory.</seg>
<seg id=368>The question is what can be done in this situation, which heavily from die ausblick from only a few years ago, the picture certain.</seg>
<seg id=369>In the last Assembly the Organization of American States in continued lauderdale in Florida, the United States a good idea of other on and brought it largely by their support to case.</seg>
<seg id=370>The story began a few years ago, when the former Foreign Minister Argentine Dante caputo and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), were charged, a draft for the report on democracy in Latin America to draft.</seg>
<seg id=371>They concluded that an early warning system for democratic crises in the region would help to act, before things like now in Bolivia of control.</seg>
<seg id=372>As a result, the UN team caputo persuaded the Chilean President Ricardo Lagos, the initiative to and with some of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id=373>Indeed, it, but the initiative came does not go very far.</seg>
<seg id=374>Even in 2004 published UNDP report on democracy in Latin America found it hardly mentioning.</seg>
<seg id=375>The US and the new Chilean Secretary General of the OAS, Jose Miguel Insulza, brought the plan the OAS meeting in Florida again on the table, but rejected it because of the well-founded fears of Latin Americans, the idea would be to Venezuela to mix with the anachronistic fears of Latin Americans, against the sacrosanct principle of non-interference to violate.</seg>
<seg id=376>Although the continent, not on the principle of some did, the idea of an early warning due attention.</seg>
<seg id=377>Currently, there are probably little what the US about the situation in Bolivia can do, however, is the situation for all some dangers.</seg>
<seg id=378>Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition leaders and kokapflanzenanbauer, may be an honest, though, be bad beratener democratic leaders, but his supporters are completely free of authoritarian efforts?</seg>
<seg id=379>Hugo Chavez financed may not Morales and the other Bolivia critics, but are not in fact Venezuela and Cuba is trying to interfere in the affairs of the country in which Che Guevara almost 40 years ago than guerillaführer died?</seg>
<seg id=380>Perhaps Bolivia make Santa Cruz their business from the threat of secession not true, but they are the oil and gas reserves in their rather with the indigenous people in the Highlands of than with Brazil from industrial São Paulo?</seg>
<seg id=381>Before the events such extreme, have reached the OAS (not the US) may intervention.</seg>
<seg id=382>The region is dependent on this intervention, in time, consistent and on a proper democratic basis, an intervention, which, from the traditional US intervention and traditional indifference from Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=383>Of the decline of France's it?</seg>
<seg id=384>The French are notoriously sensitive if not defensive what France's standing in the world.</seg>
<seg id=385>The French State is much money for propagierung the French language and culture, and the French, but are painfully aware that global position their country no longer has the same status as previously.</seg>
<seg id=386>So it is no surprise that the publication of a report by the European Commission over the last presidential elections in which said that France's economic ranking of European countries in a period of 10 years from the third to the tenth place has, to a soul-searching and led to controversy. Soon, President Jacques Chirac his rivals Lionel Jospin to blame the "France's demise".</seg>
<seg id=387>The OECD and Eurostat, the European office responsible for such data, thought this aspect of the debate by their chance that France, Germany, Italy, and Britain, for example, in the same per capita living standards for enjoy ended.</seg>
<seg id=388>The public controversy, remained.</seg>
<seg id=389>This year's demonstrations against the pension, growing disputes with the European Commission on the monetary policy and bickering with America because of the Iraq war made besorgte discussions about the "French decline" revived.</seg>
<seg id=390>The now meistverkaufte sachbuch in France is a "of Nicolas Baverez, la tombe qui decline in France (France)</seg>
<seg id=391>Baverez 'book is a range of zitaten of de Gaulle and Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id=392>The author according to France achieved its past achievements in the 1970s with the introduction of the TGV schnellzuges and the Airbus.</seg>
<seg id=393>He geißelt both Mitterrand Chirac, both for their "common talent to win elections, and France to make losers."</seg>
<seg id=394>The success of the book is itself a reference to a kind of "malaise".</seg>
<seg id=395>But what type of small?</seg>
<seg id=396>Baverez 'degeneration of proof is not as convincing as he thinks.</seg>
<seg id=397>So he leads, for example the dahinschwinden of jobs in industry as obvious evidence of the decline in France.</seg>
<seg id=398>The deindustrialisation of all developed countries, however, is in common.</seg>
<seg id=399>France is even better than most of its rivals among the rich countries, and, unlike in Britain, Germany or the US, the same global market share in the sector, to maintain it in the early 1970's,.</seg>
<seg id=400>The foreign investment, according to a better level of competitiveness, France is also very well.</seg>
<seg id=401>A recent report by the Council for economic analysis according to are the direct investment in France in 2001 60 billion euro, has almost twice as much as in Germany.</seg>
<seg id=402>Also the preisliche France, improved competitiveness (20%) over the past three decades through increased productivity, the rapid lohnwachstum auslöste.</seg>
<seg id=403>The heart of France's long-term economic difficulties, however, is precisely the fear of loss of industriearbeitsplätzen.</seg>
<seg id=404>In traditional areas such as the car industry is France or remains a strong industrial power; in innovative markets in which small businesses new technologies spread, but it remains back.</seg>
<seg id=405>France, for example, only $30 billion in for R & D of technologies,, compared to 51 billion dollars in Germany, 98 billion dollars in Japan and 265 billion dollars in the US.</seg>
<seg id=406>In short, is Baverez 'analysis simply in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id=407>During the last twenty years, France has gone through a series of crucial important reforms: economic and financial liberalization, the abolition of only devisenkontrollen, and the end of the krediteinschränkungen, European liberalization, reduced inflation and trade deficits, the introduction of the euro and the forced the globalization of the country.</seg>
<seg id=408>The French malaise has nothing to do all this.</seg>
<seg id=409>France's problem is that it fails to recognize that the new world of it already part of it.</seg>
<seg id=410>The French staatskapitalismus is dead and France, it is difficult, with its dahinscheiden abzufinden.</seg>
<seg id=411>France seems to be the only country in which a Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, is committed to a day later on television to excuse for his statement that "the state not omnipotent is".</seg>
<seg id=412>There are many reasons for this French schizophrenia, one of the key depends, with political happened over the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=413>Until 1981 in France, there was a clear separation between right and left.</seg>
<seg id=414>Since then, both the governments Mitterrand as well as their ideological Chirac mitigated to the difficult process of adapting to Europe and globalization.</seg>
<seg id=415>A round "shock therapy" à la Margaret Thatcher twenty years ago, may have created a new political awareness.</seg>
<seg id=416>But the by kleckerweise implementation of reform it allowed the French, in a world of life and in a different to think.</seg>
<seg id=417>This is one of the key reasons for the devastating political upheaval, during the last before the presidential election campaign has taken place, as the sentiments parteichef Jean-Marie Le Pen, to the Prime Minister Lionel Jospin reached the second round of the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id=418>The rise of the extreme left, during this campaign for 10% of the vote, could also been, instead of this political failure.</seg>
<seg id=419>France needs more of a political than a economic revolution, if this is to put up with the reality of this reality is that the "decline France" a fear is that the French people even generates.</seg>
<seg id=420>The value of European values</seg>
<seg id=421>Europe's governments have the talks about a constitution resumed, after this last December because of a dispute over voting were broken.</seg>
<seg id=422>Such differences are by compromise resolve, the most likely be found.</seg>
<seg id=423>About it, however, agree to be is a clear idea of what the European Constitution to be achieved.</seg>
<seg id=424>European integration is based on two fundamental principles: solidarity and subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=425>Two principles are at the interface between the philosophy, sociology, politics, economics and right.</seg>
<seg id=426>For years they find the legal and institutional framework of the European Union expressed - in the Treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (where they are called the preamble) and in the current draft Constitution.</seg>
<seg id=427>Both principles are so in history and in the ideals of the EU in.</seg>
<seg id=428>But what mean solidarity and subsidiarity really?</seg>
<seg id=429>Consider first the solidarity in at least two respects interpreted as static: solidarity, in the only to the distribution of income and wealth, and when the far-reaching dynamic concept of solidarity, and in the production of income and wealth will be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id=430>In the history of European integration after World War II, was the first stage, that of the European Coal and Steel Community - the dynamic in solidarity, are, in the economic reconstruction and development () as well as in the vertragswerken, especially in the Treaty of Rome.</seg>
<seg id=431>This does not mean that the dynamic solidarity later no longer given was: the European Monetary Union, for example, is an expression of solidarity dynamic.</seg>
<seg id=432>Although some countries no immediate advantage of the introduction of the euro had voted to their yet, because they are of the long-term effects of the common currency that were.</seg>
<seg id=433>In other words, the dynamic solidarity is policies aimed at investment, innovation, economic growth and job creation.</seg>
<seg id=434>However, as the figures for GDP growth in the EU to show solidarity, the dynamic in the last decade weakened.</seg>
<seg id=435>Particularly worrying in this context, the gap Europe in the areas of research and development.</seg>
<seg id=436>The implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in 2000, adopted by the EU, from the European Union the most competitive economy in the world is to create, however, is of a growing shift towards statischer threatens solidarity of the high cost of the welfare state and high taxes to finance its reflects.</seg>
<seg id=437>The überhandnahme the static solidarity lies in the aging of the population from the slower growth, in addition to a structural imbalances in the national budgets.</seg>
<seg id=438>One of the major future herauforderungen of the EU, the drafting of lösungsmodellen to today's prevailing static solidarity to the old people, in solidarity towards a dynamic of the young people in the focuses.</seg>
<seg id=439>In the end, the European Union cannot afford that the current consumption continues, that is, the investment needed to prosperity in the future.</seg>
<seg id=440>The principle of subsidiarity is the concept of solidarity is similar when it also allows for: the two interpretations of vertical and horizontal of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=441>The vertical subsidiarity describes the separation of powers between the various levels and the sovereignty, so between the EU, the nation States, regions and local authorities.</seg>
<seg id=442>The best-known application of this principle is the federalism.</seg>
<seg id=443>In the European Treaties is vertical subsidiarity clearly defined.</seg>
<seg id=444>But is it enough to the emerging institutional and constitutional framework of the Union grasp?</seg>
<seg id=445>The horizontal subsidiarity describes the accountability and freedom of the people and social and economic machtbeziehungen.</seg>
<seg id=446>These include the relations between the state, society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=447>But have the society and the market on its own rights and hoheitsbereiche, not by the State to be granted.</seg>
<seg id=448>The problem arises so in securing the autonomy of each area.</seg>
<seg id=449>For example, for horizontal subsidiarity is the single market, a new kind of economic freedom and growing competition between companies created by the State safeguards for these companies were abolished.</seg>
<seg id=450>Horizontal subsidiarity means that the state or in society, in the economy, the individual freedom and responsibility violating must, it is the greatest of respect.</seg>
<seg id=451>Moreover, horizontal subsidiarity means that a "overriding power" where support to grant, where the individual freedom and responsibility not enough to the goal of respect for human dignity.</seg>
<seg id=452>This support should be implemented, but in a way that the natural potential of individuals, society and promotes market.</seg>
<seg id=453>But this is only possible if the role of horizontal subsidiarity is clear. This is neither the European Treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights or in the work of the European Convention.</seg>
<seg id=454>In short, Solidarity nowadays means redistribution rather than growth (for example, today's generation expressed their solidarity with future generations), and subsidiarity means today the distribution political power and not the careful division between the state, society and the market.</seg>
<seg id=455>Today, both values defined so that the state of the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id=456>So, the focus on market-based growth often as identification with half of America's foreign values interpreted.</seg>
<seg id=457>But these values are deeply rooted in Europe, and should also be brought to the surface.</seg>
<seg id=458>The EU should restore their dynamism, by a model of solidarity and subsidiarity, the more the market and society and the prefers the socio-economic impact of the state reduced.</seg>
<seg id=459>Government institutions should be responsible for the provision of public goods (as defense, justice, as well as tax and monetary) society for social goods (such as culture, education, and aid need people) and the market for economic goods (with the profit, growth and employment in associated).</seg>
<seg id=460>In the 21st century, Europe must back on the values of both - the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, return if its historical goal of integration to achieve: the freedom and prosperity to achieve the needed to overcome the differences and political divisions that disasters in the 20th century auslösten.</seg>
<seg id=461>In this spirit, the European Constitution be written.</seg>
<seg id=462>The policy of the values</seg>
<seg id=463>The debate about the American elections has still not nachgelassen.</seg>
<seg id=464>As President George W. Bush has managed, more than three million votes Senator John Kerry to get and also in both chambers of Congress a Republican majority vote?</seg>
<seg id=465>In the answers, but there is little agreement two issues appear in many statements on.</seg>
<seg id=466>It is a figure.</seg>
<seg id=467>At a time and uncertainties and threats had people more confidence in the President, the they knew, as a candidate, whose skills not been seemed.</seg>
<seg id=468>The second issue are values.</seg>
<seg id=469>People voted for a fabric of values, and not for a particular policy.</seg>
<seg id=470>Indeed, it is reported that some () with Kerry politics, agree gave their voice but yet Bush because they, with its general attitudes "to" felt.</seg>
<seg id=471>The United States is now in terms of the elections clearly divided.</seg>
<seg id=472>A blue bogen) (democratic States in the north, east and west umspannt a huge (republikanisches) in the area and in the South.</seg>
<seg id=473>Moreover, this is the division, local reflect.</seg>
<seg id=474>Wahlkreisschiebungen, i.e. the drawing of wahlkreisgrenzen to a particular political party to favor -- are no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id=475>In fact, people tend to be in areas where other parts of their values, you republikanisch or democratic.</seg>
<seg id=476>What exactly be these values?</seg>
<seg id=477>They have allegedly something with "God, guns and gays" -- with God, weapons and gay, to do.</seg>
<seg id=478>Religion plays an important role and, among other things, the truth wörtliche the Bible to genesis.</seg>
<seg id=479>The possession of a weapon is a key individualismustest, and the use of weapons in wars is nothing abscheuliches.</seg>
<seg id=480>"Modern" gays and other practices are as maßlos rejected.</seg>
<seg id=481>As the political scientist Andrew hackers, recently said: "Bush's candidacy is invested so that it is the majority by around 60 million people, verhilft to itself to be satisfied.</seg>
<seg id=482>Is the whole phenomenon, there is an American or other places similar trends?</seg>
<seg id=483>One answer is that the politics of values now than American phenomenon can produce a majority, but this is not as.</seg>
<seg id=484>Europe and other parts of the world are equally divided.</seg>
<seg id=485>Personality is undoubtedly important, and below the obvious political differences hide wertefragen, may not have come to light.</seg>
<seg id=486>But traditional political differences on disunity on fundamental values based, lower, play a role in the election.</seg>
<seg id=487>For example, English is the Prime Minister Tony Blair, the next big leaders before an election is, on the map "and" personality speaks of politics, but it represents, above all, a fabric of values the middle class.</seg>
<seg id=488>It speaks of "modernization of" or, "in the 21st century at him," it will be a curious, but ansprechende mixture of change and stability to mediate.</seg>
<seg id=489>The found the conservative opposition so far no effective response.</seg>
<seg id=490>Even on issues such as tax cuts and severe asylum values are not as they brought into play as the Republican Party that has in the US.</seg>
<seg id=491>A similar picture arises in Germany, where the obvious influence of wertepolitik even less.</seg>
<seg id=492>The debate in Germany is in large part, a political debate.</seg>
<seg id=493>If the opposition government talks to health reform or -- as least happened, to combat unemployment offers, which is to liegendem competition rather than to competence to values.</seg>
<seg id=494>Yet lurking among known battlefields of political debate in Britain and Germany wertekonflikte as elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=495>The parties to those who fight for it to be content with itself, "to be", but it may not be fully realize that this is only partly a question of policy is.</seg>
<seg id=496>It is unlikely that religion in the European policy to an important factor will opinion polls show that the religious regulations of a few big differences between Americans and Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=497>Arms are also another place in a European awareness. Most Europeans see as important in their absence.</seg>
<seg id=498>In Europe is also a trail pazifistischer unverkennbar values.</seg>
<seg id=499>But is the issue of political correctness ("gays"), Europe has a unterschätzte role.</seg>
<seg id=500>Above all, shares Europe even Europeans, because the "national" question raised in all European countries.</seg>
<seg id=501>This is a werteproblem, triggered by fear.</seg>
<seg id=502>People want to know where they are, and turn it against, the US and towards Europe, or against Europe and towards their own country.</seg>
<seg id=503>In any case, we leave the area of political guidelines and even the politics and enter the grim empire of symbols and myths.</seg>
<seg id=504>This is in any case, the hauptrisiko, the democratic countries are exposed to, for the politics of values is a dangerous development.</seg>
<seg id=505>In democratic societies, whose greatest achievement was the banishment of fundamentalism of politics was, it leads to a fundamental divisions.</seg>
<seg id=506>An enlightened public debate must be a debate on policy by a together of values is determined.</seg>
<seg id=507>To insist, is thus a primary objective of policy of freedom.</seg>
<seg id=508>The time of the naht interest rates</seg>
<seg id=509>A schwalbe power, no summer and a month normal arbeitsplatzwachstums and rising prices in the United States do not mean that the bundesaufsicht US banks fear of small economic deflation and have lost.</seg>
<seg id=510>But the time will come, interest rates in the world are beginning to grow, for central bankers, are to arise inflationstendenzen to stop.</seg>
<seg id=511>As far as and when it will be - whether in this autumn, in 2005 or 2006 or 2007 - America and the world economy will be faced with financial anfälligkeiten, the success of monetary stimulationsmaßnahmen over the past three years in the containment of produktionsrückgängen and reflect the dämpfung of unemployment.</seg>
<seg id=512>For short-term interest rates are low astonishing: only 2% in the euro area, only 1% in the US and Japan to zero.</seg>
<seg id=513>The expansionist monetary policy has been successful, but only by the rates on historical tiefstände pushed - and by investors were convinced that the borrowing for a long time in their current remain.</seg>
<seg id=514>The most important result of monetary impetus was a preissteigerung in assets: everything that abwirft profits, a dividend or rent pays, at much more attractive - and thus geldlich far more valuable - if interest rates are very low and likely to remain low.</seg>
<seg id=515>This explains the great gap between the current real estate prices in the US, securities in New York, London, and Frankfurt and long-term bonds allerorts and what we normally for its fundamental values should.</seg>
<seg id=516>So what will happen if the central banks begin to raise interest rates?</seg>
<seg id=517>In 1994, led to the increase in interest rates for short-term to zinsanstiegen in long-term area -- and the falling prices for the long-term bonds - at least the double standard of, what prognosemodelle voraussagten at the time.</seg>
<seg id=518>Moreover, interest rates rose in the peripheral economic areas in the world, developing countries, far more than in the large industrial rates.</seg>
<seg id=519>The first danger, about it, therefore, for the year 2005 and beyond concerned must - if interest rates around the world, in all likelihood will rise - is thus another wave of financial crises in entwicklungsmärkten.</seg>
<seg id=520>For countries like Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Thailand, Korea, Malaysia and has set the 1990s shown that zinsspannen greater, and capital flows, remarkably quickly can reverse, regardless of how favorable IMF officials and analyses of large banks assess the politics of a country.</seg>
<seg id=521>At the time of the zinsspannen schwellenmärkte are unusually low.</seg>
<seg id=522>International flows, apart from zuflüssen in the US - are not yet at that level, with the "irrational" überschwänglichkeit combined would bring, but this could happen before interest rates to rise.</seg>
<seg id=523>The prospects are alarming, for if the 1990s a taught, that no one should the stability of international finanzflüsse overestimate.</seg>
<seg id=524>The second danger stems from high assets within the large, developed.</seg>
<seg id=525>The prevailing thinking in the bundesaufsicht US banks - with which I agree - is apparently is that the information technology revolution continue that wachstumstempo of potential output in the US is very high, and thus the output gap relatively high.</seg>
<seg id=526>The conclusion is that interest rates might indeed well over a considerable period to remain low.</seg>
<seg id=527>Moreover, confidence in the bundesaufsicht US banks is high and the last remnants of the 1970's, the risk premium inflation rates herausgepresst.</seg>
<seg id=528>As a result, interest rates, in terms of the 1980s and 1990, remain low, even after produktionsstände to their full potential.</seg>
<seg id=529>These are of course all good news for those who assets as long-term bonds, stocks and real estate possess.</seg>
<seg id=530>Prices for the long-term assets was exactly the point in the reduction of interest rates: after all, is a source of shareholders in particular, the immobilieneigentümer stimulating on spending from.</seg>
<seg id=531>The bad news is that, even if it is expected that interest rates low for a time, they are not indefinitely remain so low.</seg>
<seg id=532>In a word, if interest rates rise, will the assets fall.</seg>
<seg id=533>These are precisely the times - especially when assets quickly and much decline - in which we see as well our central bankers to fulfill its main task: the reduction in financial volatility and promote economic stability.</seg>
<seg id=534>While such time, we are also firmly, like many people, the long-term bonds or shares, real estate, do not, because they believe that the current prices in terms of the key attractive, but because prices over the past years have increased.</seg>
<seg id=535>For policymakers is a crucial issue, for those who long-term assets owing to steadily rising prices have acquired, are also those who sell them again as soon as the preistrends, apparently gegenläufig develop.</seg>
<seg id=536>In particular, America's current account deficit is drohend as massive cause instability on should prices long-term assets clearly fall.</seg>
<seg id=537>The challenges facing the world, economic policymakers over the next few years to see are certainly other than those which it since the NASDAQ zerplatzen bubble faced.</seg>
<seg id=538>The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those by zusammenbrechende production and looming deflation arise.</seg>
<seg id=539>As we have learned in the 1990's, however, this does not mean that the difficulties easier to tackle.</seg>
<seg id=540>America's contradictory prospects</seg>
<seg id=541>Recently, I was in a very interesting experience: in America have international policy finanzökonomen and of national realities policy -- "-- nachgerade macroeconomists very different views of the likely effects of huge American leistungsbilanzdefizits.</seg>
<seg id=542>The international, finanzökonomen keep a financial crisis, followed by a painful and perhaps prolonged recession in the US for likely.</seg>
<seg id=543>By contrast, the national, to see a macroeconomists expected kursverlust dollar not as a crisis, but as an opportunity to speed up economic growth</seg>
<seg id=544>The macroeconomists presented the situation around so: at some point in the future foreign central banks will no longer be willing, so far as dollar-denominated securities en masse to buy, so the American currency to support.</seg>
<seg id=545>If they so dollarkäufe hire, will the value of the dollar fall, and the landing is hard.</seg>
<seg id=546>With the dollar wertverlust macroeconomists will, however, the US exports to other countries and employment more attractive in America will improve, as more workers in the emerging export migrate.</seg>
<seg id=547>The development would be like in Britain, as if the währungsbindung aufgab and the British pound to the Deutsche Mark devalued or, as in the US in the late 1980's, when the dollar against the pound, the Deutsche Mark and, above all, against the Japanese yen, devalued.</seg>
<seg id=548>The international, finanzökonomen see the future to much düsterer.</seg>
<seg id=549>In their eyes, the end of dollarkäufe by the central banks not only to a devaluation of the dollar, but also lead to a levels in the long-term interest rates in the US, which directly to the spending and briefly later, the investment costs.</seg>
<seg id=550>Of course, expect finanzökonomen that the US exports from a kursverlust dollar benefit, but by the delays in demand, the exportanstieg one or two years after the decline in consumption and investment occur.</seg>
<seg id=551>The jobs of eight or ten million people are in the service sector in the export and the importkonkurrierenden area shift, with a rise in structural unemployment is to be.</seg>
<seg id=552>Moreover, it could come to a finanzpanik: for large financial institutions with their liabilities short-term and long-term assets will be difficult to a sharp rise in long-term interest rates $to cope with.</seg>
<seg id=553>This imbalance can just as easily financial pressure and lead to the bankruptcy as then during the crises in Mexico, East Asia in the 1990's, and a few years ago in Argentina, as the imbalance between the currencies of local gehaltenen assets of banks and their financial liabilities to $congestion and ultimately led to bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id=554>If international policy finanzökonomen this scenario draft, do the macroeconomists, all of this klinge after a case of unfähiger monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=555>Why should the American Federal Reserve long-term spitzenzinssätze allow just because no other banks dollarkäufe more conduct?</seg>
<seg id=556>Should the Fed not intervention and instead even long-term US bonds buy and with a long-term interest in a budget is compatible with the help of full employment?</seg>
<seg id=557>The finanzökonomen to respond by saying that the Fed, not the force.</seg>
<seg id=558>If it has the choice between full employment and price stability, then the finanzökonomen, will decide the Fed to price stability, because the memories of the rampant inflation in the 1970's, still very present.</seg>
<seg id=559>As a kursverlust dollar leads to an increase in the import prices and thus a negative shock to the supply side of the economy, interest rates, the Fed must increase, not decrease, and bonds not buy, sell.</seg>
<seg id=560>On both sides of this debate are committed strongly serious economists, which I appreciate.</seg>
<seg id=561>I am not wise enough to decide which side, is right, but I know very well that of which side I hope that it is in the wrong.</seg>
<seg id=562>Trittbrettfahrer Europe</seg>
<seg id=563>In the United States, the need to pursue an inadequate fiscal expect penalties.</seg>
<seg id=564>Their bonds are less value than those from better, States.</seg>
<seg id=565>The higher payments to the nachlässigen do have, serves, to some extent, as disciplining measure to the temptation to spend the money now, and then to pay.</seg>
<seg id=566>Of course, the discipline of the market: the perfect anleihenmarkt "is" implicit future liabilities (as promised pensions) not on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id=567>Nevertheless, these forced fiscal combined with the budgetmaßnahmen of individual States contributed to it in the US since the Great Depression haushaltskrisen, not much more.</seg>
<seg id=568>We turn now Europe.</seg>
<seg id=569>Before the introduction of the euro, there were in individual States southern budgetkrisen, led to high inflation.</seg>
<seg id=570>Because of the single currency but is the way to resolving a budget crisis of inflation blocked, because the European Central Bank (ECB) wacht over monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=571>So although European countries their finanzdefizite rules can no longer about inflation, allowing it to the single currency, the schuldenkapazität, indeed, the other Members, for the right to use and their ausgabenorgien expand to some time in saus and braus to life and the political responsibility to postpone later on.</seg>
<seg id=572>These possibilities for a stop to the Stability and Growth Pact was launched, the state must deficits below 3% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id=573>Last week broke now Germany, once the disziplinierteste vorzeigeland budget of the EU, the rules of the Pact for the fifth time in series, without (a) excuses.</seg>
<seg id=574>Finance peer Steinbrück, to understand that it with sanctions against Germany expect the European Commission, because otherwise the credibility of the Pact be at stake.</seg>
<seg id=575>Unlike two and a half years ago, Germany would not so this time against the sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=576>Steinbrück was, however, clear that he would expect that the sanctions because of the predicted deficit by 3.4% of GDP largely symbolic nature be penalties and not that of the government or economy with significant costs would be.</seg>
<seg id=577>The stability and growth pact works, yet nowhere, nearly as, as originally intended.</seg>
<seg id=578>What is the discipline?</seg>
<seg id=579>Will the willingness of the German Government, more debt and greater deficits accumulate less, because the market those States recognizes and punished, a weakening of their fiscal position accept?</seg>
<seg id=580>The answer is "no".</seg>
<seg id=581>Interest rates for the euro in denominierten public debt of twelve Member States of the euro area are all very similar.</seg>
<seg id=582>The market thus it seems not to take care that the countries have a different potential, exports boost to those finanzflüsse lukrieren to that for the debt or for different or current forecast staatsquoten needed.</seg>
<seg id=583>Willem Buiter the University of Amsterdam and Anne sibert of the University of London believe that the willingness of the ECB, ultimately all debt of the euro area as security to accept the market's ability to act as a driving force budgetary caution, undermines.</seg>
<seg id=584>As long as a small part of the German debt as security for a short-term credit or as a heart of wertpapierpensionsgeschäfts liquidity can serve to improve, will be much more value of those conditions be determined, to which the ECB as these security accepted as of its real value.</seg>
<seg id=585>The fact that the ECB all these debts as liquiditätsquellen equal treatment, is a more weight than any analysis of the differences in national long-term risks.</seg>
<seg id=586>In the long run, this dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=587>A reasonable chance of long-term of price stability, requires both discipline as well as solid haushaltsmanagements.</seg>
<seg id=588>Will the immediate punishment the market in a way that later in rücksichtslosigkeit degenerate, can be eliminated or lack of institutional rules to future generations to give a voice is with grave risks to be, perhaps not today or tomorrow, but some determined and then for a long time.</seg>
<seg id=589>Over the years, the introduction of the single currency and the way as it has been carried out, and led to more unease.</seg>
<seg id=590>The policy throughout the euro zone is deflationär invested.</seg>
<seg id=591>It failed to carry out transfers, that would be needed to the single currency, for those regions to unsustainable, whose position, deteriorated, which are already in recession, if their policies of the ECB.</seg>
<seg id=592>The institutional foundations for a stable long-term fiscal be undermined.</seg>
<seg id=593>And now, Buiter sibert convincing and that the ECB the market too little room granted to the rigour to reward and to punish the squanderers.</seg>
<seg id=594>More visible are no lines and for the next time this is not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id=595>But if things do not change, could the ground under the euro well in movement.</seg>
<seg id=596>Milosevic and Hussein jurisdiction as a farce:</seg>
<seg id=597>Kriegsverbrecherprozesse were once a serious matter.</seg>
<seg id=598>You remember the photographs of Herman göring and Schuster heß in Nuremberg, put in the dock sitzend.</seg>
<seg id=599>Some were nazigrößen, relatively recently, but fair trial even hanged.</seg>
<seg id=600>Today, the trial against the verworfensten leaders of our world degenerate into a farce.</seg>
<seg id=601>The trial of Saddam Hussein and his cronies from the Ba'ath is by a continuing series of peinlichkeiten.</seg>
<seg id=602>The accused try, with a posse after the other, Hussein shows every form of disregard for, except the judges the court's bare hintern to show.</seg>
<seg id=603>It is difficult to imagine that a result in the eyes of the world's legitimate Iraqis or appear.</seg>
<seg id=604>Alldieweil has the trial Slobodan Milosevic to funeral changing, after four years of tedious testimony and a waste of more than $200 million.</seg>
<seg id=605>In Cambodia over the United Nations and the government for almost a decade, how the elements of the survivors of the Khmer Rouge trial to.</seg>
<seg id=606>The mass murderers, the 20th century, came to power, were, if they do not verstarben, while they were still in power, condemned, with volksaufständen killed or for their crimes to be tried.</seg>
<seg id=607>Who can be proud that the last Communist leaders, Romania Nicolae ceauşescu, and his wife without even the appearance of a fair trial were shot?</seg>
<seg id=608>The formal brimborium real courts once seems better than the selbstjustiz, even if in the end, in both cases, death.</seg>
<seg id=609>There are now two credible methods, against a abgesetzten tyrant act.</seg>
<seg id=610>A nation of their former leaders on trial, even as the Argentines in the 1980's, for the disappearance of more than 5,000 their citizens responsible generals did.</seg>
<seg id=611>At international level, is in future to the Nuremberg trials model available under the circumstances, however, doubtful that sometimes siegermächte penalties for crimes, such as "crimes against humanity" -- impose it, for the time when they have been committed, no proper definition,.</seg>
<seg id=612>There was a time when the benefits of both national and international processes were visible.</seg>
<seg id=613>Local "processes enabled it to local communities, by close involvement in the process trauerarbeit to do.</seg>
<seg id=614>As judge and jury could the countrymen the accused also greater sensitivity in the assessment of the blame for they were to be aware of the difficult circumstances under which the dictator abgesetzte fällte its decisions.</seg>
<seg id=615>Argentina's proceedings against the generals was successful ritual of the junta in difficult transition to democracy, but the experience ended in tears and selbstzweifel.</seg>
<seg id=616>Even after their conviction, the generals, powerful enough to end the processes and then the pardon by them next President to force.</seg>
<seg id=617>Even today, the Argentine politics of by the legal consequences of 20 years previous processes caused by complications.</seg>
<seg id=618>At the international level, the decision of the UN security on the creation of the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also welcomed with great confidence.</seg>
<seg id=619>The ICTY fällte, led by Antonio Cassese, a number of fundamental choices.</seg>
<seg id=620>But then the judges who had the misfortune to be able to carry out their wildest dream -- the negotiation, their court, against erzschurken Slobodan Milosevic.</seg>
<seg id=621>It is not clear how the Serbs in a process domestic with Milosevic would be treated.</seg>
<seg id=622>Much of the political party would have been on the Court had controlled.</seg>
<seg id=623>At international level, feared, not too much to politics, but in law.</seg>
<seg id=624>Milosevic's trial should be more than fair, should a symbol of the justice of the UN.</seg>
<seg id=625>So it was allowed Milosevic to defend themselves, from the point of view of efficiency and length of the process a riesenfehler.</seg>
<seg id=626>The number of witnesses to the charges called to again and again the same grauenhafte history of Serb aggression and brutality to witness, knew no borders.</seg>
<seg id=627>It will still take months to find out what went wrong and why, the process of hinzog over four years.</seg>
<seg id=628>My instinct tells me that the well-meaning gerichtsbeamten, too much of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission influence, made a model, in the judicial faculties desirable as an alternative to vergeltungsjustiz proclaims.</seg>
<seg id=629>In the South African process was not the most important issue for the future of the accused, but in the past of the victims.</seg>
<seg id=630>Every victim was encouraged, its story to tell, the accused heard to.</seg>
<seg id=631>In the case of during the 20th century caused massacre can such reprocessing require decades.</seg>
<seg id=632>The victims to encourage speeches, and then the defendants that right to praise by the own political merit to delay the proceedings, is a recipe for not end wollende delays.</seg>
<seg id=633>A lesson that we from the processes against Milosevic, Hussein learned is that you men or women not in court should provide to their charismatisch caused attractive an end to it.</seg>
<seg id=634>They are in the process of power, especially if it allowed them to defend themselves, and the courtroom to justify the own career.</seg>
<seg id=635>Tyrant should only Court, when they are clearly defeated.</seg>
<seg id=636>Ironically, it was a benefit of Nuremberg courts that it with the representatives of siegermächte were occupied.</seg>
<seg id=637>These were a constant reminder of göring heß, and their stooges that the allies in charge had and the Nazis unabänderlich were defeated.</seg>
<seg id=638>Clear aim of the process was always the punishing the guilty, not of the future geschichtsschreibung.</seg>
<seg id=639>The tragedy of the trials against Milosevic, Hussein that the "i" history in their case, the tüpfelchen lacked -- and history even trial was.</seg>
<seg id=640>The this herrührenden unschlüssigkeiten from the responsible led, internationally as national -- to procedures, the fantastereien of rehabilitation and return easier.</seg>
<seg id=641>In the case Hussein could fantasterei even a reality.</seg>
<seg id=642>Economic divisions Iraq in</seg>
<seg id=643>Iraq presented, all observers as a between Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds divided state.</seg>
<seg id=644>But as a fundamental line but along the growing gap between rich and poor -- a line that now insurgency as religiously motivated battle has contributed, as well as the opposition to the Americans US-led occupation.</seg>
<seg id=645>As Iraq has been freed, many hoped, especially poor people of charismatischen leader, of them from the bitter reality would save their everyday life.</seg>
<seg id=646>These people are in fear of grew up and had no idea how the democracy in their society would have or as human rights groups and bürgerrechtsbewegungen help to shape the future could make.</seg>
<seg id=647>Soon it was in Iraq with a new social face line.</seg>
<seg id=648>On the one hand, were those who had, in a democracy, it on power and its goals made.</seg>
<seg id=649>They learned the language of democracy to what is in this process to money and influence is and how independent organizations, does the rights and privileges to defend.</seg>
<seg id=650>On the other hand, this line but remains the vast majority of Iraqis helpless, including the widows and divorced from their men or women who have abandoned anyone, for them and their children is.</seg>
<seg id=651>For these people mean democracy and human rights nothing.</seg>
<seg id=652>They have no education, are poor and sick.</seg>
<seg id=653>As the victims of an educational, over a decade ago, have collapsed, they only have a few knowledge that could help them in the Iraqi economy maroden a employment.</seg>
<seg id=654>While the Saddam's rule, there was no effort, the living standards of the poor.</seg>
<seg id=655>I have the huge elendsviertel visited Iraq and families found that in behausungen lived, where it hardly a shelter, by and beset by of insects, and where the water under the door durchsickerten.</seg>
<seg id=656>In day and night they live in darkness.</seg>
<seg id=657>These families need nothing fairly decent accommodation, food and the prospect of a job, but they await the death and fear, before the verhungernden shout their children.</seg>
<seg id=658>When I met with the women in these behausungen, überhäuften me to ask: democracy, the US Food and give homes?</seg>
<seg id=659>Will they stop their men, women to beat?</seg>
<seg id=660>Be our children by the citizenship win?</seg>
<seg id=661>We will then have a right to divorce of husbands, leave?</seg>
<seg id=662>My answer to all these issues was "yes".</seg>
<seg id=663>Yes, the democracy are you the right to adequate housing, to education and work, your children, citizenship and you will get your men like.</seg>
<seg id=664>You will, however, hard work and effort to your rights.</seg>
<seg id=665>The women, replied: "Saddam has us 35 years, eingebläut, without work and without aufzumucken to live in fear.</seg>
<seg id=666>What can we do now?</seg>
<seg id=667>In these areas, where most Iraqis life, succumb people bitter temptations.</seg>
<seg id=668>Many of them are by policies or the government.</seg>
<seg id=669>They gleiten on in violence, theft and sabotage.</seg>
<seg id=670>From a false angestachelt verlockungen heldentums that it during the long Saddam's rule, they could not ausleben brings the poverty to carry out money for violence.</seg>
<seg id=671>The poverty worse the trauma of the gewaltvollen, wars and gräueln, history of Iraq, the people against the kill abstumpfen was.</seg>
<seg id=672>Although, many young men by the conditions in Iraq to violence carried by, I am convinced that we are only appropriate jobs and shelter provide have to them abzubringen.</seg>
<seg id=673>Above all, jobs would help the young people, their lives by new serious work.</seg>
<seg id=674>We must not by the army of unemployed fictitious, so-called no work jobs hide.</seg>
<seg id=675>We need the people jobs, offer them the chance to contribute to the reconstruction of the country to do.</seg>
<seg id=676>Everyone is by nature to a useful member of society.</seg>
<seg id=677>But the culture that under Saddam gedieh Iraqis, convinced that political ties are the only way to power, money, and knowledge to gain to overcome this attitude needs it, and a dynamic economy.</seg>
<seg id=678>This means, in turn, that the power of the new Iraqi government must be limited to the growth of the private sector, must be a wide-ranging understanding of democracy and human rights to be encouraged.</seg>
<seg id=679>Religious groups are ready to contribute to this process.</seg>
<seg id=680>We can also the technocrats, under Saddam served to rehabilitate, so that they get the chance to their country to serve.</seg>
<seg id=681>Finally, we must grant loans poor families, to enable them to a respektables life.</seg>
<seg id=682>Above all, the government must no effort fail to the Iraqis the value of democracy and freedom and to persuade them to show how important the Constitution to achieve their dreams of a better life.</seg>
<seg id=683>This will not just in a country where many people the gesetzesbruch than heroic act.</seg>
<seg id=684>Iraqis But we have also learned that power is in the hands of fewer people must be focused and that establishing fair conditions, the fight against all forms of corruption.</seg>
<seg id=685>If the constitution as the guarantor of democracy, freedom and security must serve to Iraqis to learn to fight this fight to make.</seg>
<seg id=686>Islamist identity</seg>
<seg id=687>Everywhere we see today, as Islam as a political force (used and abused).</seg>
<seg id=688>Some Muslims use him as a call for action; many in the West and elsewhere) (understand him as a "other" for clear and exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=689>As a Turk I feel both this debate immediately.</seg>
<seg id=690>The reason why the Islam in the view of the West as a "the other" religion seems, is that the West has seen a systematic entinstitutionalisierung of religion.</seg>
<seg id=691>Religion is not out of modern Western life gone, much more, it is the claim, the religious institutions on the conduct of the individual.</seg>
<seg id=692>Religion is in the modern world a much more personal experience and spirituellere than ever.</seg>
<seg id=693>But even within Islam is already a process of religious entinstitutionalisierung experience instead.</seg>
<seg id=694>The politicization of Islam shift the authority of religious classes of Islam, ulema.</seg>
<seg id=695>As in the West, the religious personal experience in Islam.</seg>
<seg id=696>A result of this is the interpretation religious texts by individual Muslim, also by the political combatants, intellectuals and women.</seg>
<seg id=697>Another is the vergröberung of religious knowledge, with the lesson the Koran abused and out of context, to political objectives.</seg>
<seg id=698>Who decides what is now in Islam is allowed and what banned?</seg>
<seg id=699>Who has the authority to religious texts to interpret?</seg>
<seg id=700>Who can a "fatwa ausrufen" or a "Jihad" explain?</seg>
<seg id=701>Now provide activism and terrorism a new source of legitimacy, or rather on this necessary.</seg>
<seg id=702>Thus shares decide what Islam means or not means, and they do this without the authority of religious schools and a spezialausbildung.</seg>
<seg id=703>Indeed, Islam today primarily by political actors and cultural movements and not by religious institutions interpreted.</seg>
<seg id=704>This allowed entinstitutionalisierung Islam, rather than to a local and national social link to be to shift, an imaginary link between all Muslims everywhere to forge, where they are oppressed and bedrängt feel.</seg>
<seg id=705>So can the Islamism, supporters, once the deep zerstritten, uniting: spiritual Sufi and law-abiding Muslim Sharia; Shi'ites and Sunnis; the Conservative Saudi Arabia and the revolutionary Iran.</seg>
<seg id=706>At the same time as its believers leaving rural areas and in the cities, and in the West, is also went Islam in movement.</seg>
<seg id=707>Many seems this development as a negative, and they stress that people will be socially uprooted from what the alienation and for some to terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=708>But social mobility is also the precondition to a modern perspective to win.</seg>
<seg id=709>Of course, Muslims as a result of the brain drain a sense of distance of or even a complete break with its social backgrounds.</seg>
<seg id=710>Therefore, their religious experience of a new kind of, and theological gemeindlichen and institutions of state.</seg>
<seg id=711>The religious experience will instead become a form of social idea within which people, for developing a sense, in the new environment and foreign Islam belong</seg>
<seg id=712>Not the distanzierung of modern life, but the approach to this is the rückbesinnung on religious identity.</seg>
<seg id=713>In fact, a radicalism mostly in groups, because they have experienced mobility and expulsion, with the secular forms of political thinking and urban life in the West are familiar.</seg>
<seg id=714>By the ungewohnte environment uncertainty, find it in Islam their backing.</seg>
<seg id=715>But in order to support this test can, must, Islam in the face of modernity from its traditional unterwürfigen, passive and free sanftmütigen stance.</seg>
<seg id=716>By a veil or a beard, the right to areas for their prayer workplace or school and demand special food claim to be open to Muslims as such to recognize.</seg>
<seg id=717>They show by each in their environment that they and their religious duties to a more than those of their religiosity limit on their lives.</seg>
<seg id=718>For example, of the veil, usually see non-Muslims bear a sign of humiliation and suppression of Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id=719>Instead of a stigma is the veil of Muslims now to positive sign of the commitment to their Muslim identity.</seg>
<seg id=720>Young mohammedanische women in Europe illustrate this transformation is right.</seg>
<seg id=721>Girls, French and German schools bear the headscarf, are in many ways: (concerning the youth culture, its language and its modebewusstseins) their mitschülern closer to home, as their gefesselten ungebildeten mothers.</seg>
<seg id=722>In Europe by the headscarf in public, change these girls unintended the symbol and the role of Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id=723>This tendency goes far beyond the headscarf.</seg>
<seg id=724>All Muslims in the West have a double zugehörigkeitsempfinden, a double cultural capital.</seg>
<seg id=725>They define, by their religiosity, but they also have a comprehensive, secular knowledge acquired.</seg>
<seg id=726>Because they have a double cultural capital, they can also, relatively free between different activities and spaces move - between the home, the school of youth organization and the urban freizeitangeboten.</seg>
<seg id=727>Muslim and Islamist to be, is not the same.</seg>
<seg id=728>What we now see is the transformation of Muslim identity to an Islamist.</seg>
<seg id=729>The religious even the individual Muslims shifted from private in the public sector.</seg>
<seg id=730>The question, which is now a question of whether the search for identity with headscarves and a broad public acceptance of religious practice of Islam can be met, or whether the positive commitment to Islam grundsätzlichere requires a rejection of modernity.</seg>
<seg id=731>A new era for the Islamic science??</seg>
<seg id=732>As science and mathematics several hundred years, a period of great inventions enjoyed stach, particularly in a region of the world.</seg>
<seg id=733>There were the master of disciplines verehrt, medicine made rapid progress and the durchschnittsmensch was curious to know how the nature works.</seg>
<seg id=734>As not to be expected, this region worldwide respect accorded.</seg>
<seg id=735>On the other half of the planet, known scientists punished, even killed.</seg>
<seg id=736>Mathematics, as gottlos and absurd outlawed and later of religion subject.</seg>
<seg id=737>Of living was low.</seg>
<seg id=738>The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, while a ignorantes Europe to poor remained.</seg>
<seg id=739>Both regions were determined by the religion (historians are different view about the role and the nature of religions in this context), but science erblühte in only one of the two.</seg>
<seg id=740>Now, the roles of Islamic Middle East and the West of course reversed.</seg>
<seg id=741>Since the second world war, the United States dispute world leaders in science.</seg>
<seg id=742>Throughout this period, the gescheitesten students home withdrawn, attract of superior forschungsuniversitäten and better ways.</seg>
<seg id=743>Until recently, is more than half of all university students in the US in the areas of mathematics, science and engineering born abroad.</seg>
<seg id=744>Many of these talents, after the qualifications, and both industry and the government went their advantage.</seg>
<seg id=745>However joined Islamic cultures in a historic period in which a science equated with Western influence and was avoided.</seg>
<seg id=746>Even in countries where oil revenue research in considerable pushing forward, could have Arab ruler such investment not encouraged, with the result that their societies are not so far advanced as they had.</seg>
<seg id=747>Recent has a demand for more political respect Islamic Nations moving to invest in technology, which, given the Pakistan and Iran atomambitionen particularly clear.</seg>
<seg id=748>Such weapons have, political weight, but science, behind it is trite and old.</seg>
<seg id=749>The respect of the ausreifen of knowledge, is much bedeutungsvoller as products from the discovery of the past.</seg>
<seg id=750>Imagine that the influence of, by a pakistanisches generates would institute, the world leaders in the cancer research.</seg>
<seg id=751>Would the political rhetoric shift, when researchers in Oman a key to fight AIDS discovered?</seg>
<seg id=752>This is a unused chance.</seg>
<seg id=753>There is, however, another, not only for Islamic societies.</seg>
<seg id=754>The US has in the recent past to fehltritte done.</seg>
<seg id=755>Science, across the government, by the President, downward by "glaubensangelegenheiten" replaced.</seg>
<seg id=756>The reports from spitzenforschern by political officials legal when the facts of official widersprachen conviction.</seg>
<seg id=757>By a religious beeinflusste government encouraged school systems to shift its focus of science on "values".</seg>
<seg id=758>Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entry visas and less become harder to get what the flow of young talent of American universities is holding.</seg>
<seg id=759>Big wissenschaftsorganisationen vain. protests.</seg>
<seg id=760>At the same time the tax laws changed, investors short vermögenszuwächse to bescheren what long-term discourage investment in research.</seg>
<seg id=761>Half a $1 trillion, for the war in Iraq, provided a sum, for example, support for the entire basic research in the past thousand years.</seg>
<seg id=762>Even if the US a fundamentalist ages, and they risk clearly the loss of their world dominance in research.</seg>
<seg id=763>Japan has the link between political power and science in 1980 recognized.</seg>
<seg id=764>Japan's leading industrial Akio morita, the President of Sony, and the politicians rechtsstehende shintaro ishihara was a number of speeches, in 1986, in a book entitled The Japan can say that no published</seg>
<seg id=765>It outlined a national strategy of that was that impact on the world's leaders in science.</seg>
<seg id=766>The key idea was that military power obsolete could be made, if the "food" of militärtechnologie by other nations controls.</seg>
<seg id=767>The title of the book concerns Japan's project to say "no" to the American military influence Japan, once the decisive military technology.</seg>
<seg id=768>It is clearly possible to a knowledge-based economy through the use of erdölreichtum build.</seg>
<seg id=769>It was, for example, Texas, like the US, southern States once economically and poor in decline,.</seg>
<seg id=770>Although it was in possession of oil revenue, increasing the inflows of dollar in an economy's wealth not only as strong as one might say.</seg>
<seg id=771>Thus decided Texas be ölgeld for a ausbildungsstiftung to use.</seg>
<seg id=772>This budget is now in, for example, of the Harvard University and on 15 universities distributed.</seg>
<seg id=773>The result is atemberaubend: in the area of air industry is from California is virtually disappeared, but is flourishing in Texas.</seg>
<seg id=774>Research centers consortia and telecommunications are in droves, Texas come, even by the Canadian telekommunikationsriesen Nortel.</seg>
<seg id=775>Although the manufacturing industry in the US in the crisis, Texas, one of the strongest economies produktionsorientierten worldwide.</seg>
<seg id=776>There is no reason why the same result not in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=777>First, the Islamic world, their pride legacy rediscover and it to embrace.</seg>
<seg id=778>Iran debates about Iraq</seg>
<seg id=779>No country in the Middle East focused more on the events in nachkriegsirak as Iran.</seg>
<seg id=780>With its western neighbours link Iran's geographical proximity to a long history bloody conflicts with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, religious and emotional ties with the Iraqi Shia and concern for the policy of the United States in the region.</seg>
<seg id=781>Given the continuing tensions with the US, Iran, particularly in the face of may no longer dauernden US presence in Iraq concerned as well as because of the dominant America's role in the future of Iraq, Saddam Hussein.</seg>
<seg id=782>To outsiders, it is probably difficult, the internal debate in Iran to follow, but these discussions, there are and they are fiercely fought, even if the more international public not at first glance is clear.</seg>
<seg id=783>In this debate on Iraq, Saddam Hussein are three basic approaches visible.</seg>
<seg id=784>The pragmatists are of the view that Iran with the US in Iraq, Saddam must necessarily cooperate, even if it is, the rights of Iraqi Shia of.</seg>
<seg id=785>For this reason it should Iran an assurance that a new leadership in Iraq these population not treat hostile and friendly make bilateral relations.</seg>
<seg id=786>Further to the fundamental interests of the pragmatists of maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq and the repatriation TENs in Iran of Iraqi refugees.</seg>
<seg id=787>The moderate pragmatists want that the Iranian Government pressure on America is living in Iraq, so that members of the Mujahedin Khalq MKO (r) be extradited and the organization up.</seg>
<seg id=788>In return, the Iranian Government their support for the preservation of peace, stability and security in Iraq offer.</seg>
<seg id=789>In a word, the pragmatists like the iranisch American relations on an agenda limit, mainly national affairs Iran's concerns.</seg>
<seg id=790>This approach is by and large, by conservative forces in Iran.</seg>
<seg id=791>Another approach is a more active role in the reconstruction of Iraq of Iran.</seg>
<seg id=792>The advocates of this line are of the view that Iran might well established its infrastructure human and institutional links with Iraq's reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=793>Ultimately, it says it will, the US and the international community Iranian recognize the value of cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=794>In return for the Iranian cooperation should the infrastructure of the MKO in Iraq to be broken. This may be a promise of Iran at be harder to activities of Al Qaeda and to their members expel living in Iran.</seg>
<seg id=795>First and foremost about the Advocates of this position, however, that Iran of American side will guarantee that the country is the US military actions.</seg>
<seg id=796>In short, the issue of those working in an open and clear deal: Iran support the stabilization in the current transition in Iraq and promises, cooperative relations with every Iraqi government that should happen, maintain and will ensure that the commitment to improving its regional and international position.</seg>
<seg id=797>This opinion is, above all, of Iranian reformers - inside and outside the government - and internationally, technocrats and wirtschaftsleuten.</seg>
<seg id=798>For the radical, is the possibility of cooperation with the US beyond imagination.</seg>
<seg id=799>They believe America would do to the security of Iran to undermine and its national interests at risk.</seg>
<seg id=800>In the eyes of the radicals to the US at least greater changes of the Iranian Foreign force.</seg>
<seg id=801>At worst, it is argued that the Americans will actively for regime change in Iran occur.</seg>
<seg id=802>They will be actively against the acquisition of knowledge by nuclear Iran and possibly even try to turn the whole Iran's military capabilities to weaken.</seg>
<seg id=803>This radical see the American invasion of Iraq as part of the American strategy, Iran einzukreisen.</seg>
<seg id=804>To feel that they must, Iran with aggressive defending its interests answers, alliances with Russia and other regional powers form and in Iraq to assert its influence to a pro-American, anti Iranian government in Baghdad.</seg>
<seg id=805>This approach to support hardliners of all the political groups.</seg>
<seg id=806>The fall of Saddam's regime was thing exercise in the Iraq crisis.</seg>
<seg id=807>Now comes the hard part: peace and stability to secure, the war on terrorism to gain and the Muslim populations to convince America that it is not the intention is to Iraq to fill his abzusaugen oil, and the Middle East after his ebenbild.</seg>
<seg id=808>Meanwhile, the rejection of the US in the form of suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism likely to increase.</seg>
<seg id=809>Iran is a major force in the region remain, for his political dynamism and its Muslim identity found great nachhall throughout the Muslim world.</seg>
<seg id=810>What happens in Iraq, has a great impact on Iran and the US would be well advised to face up to this fact.</seg>
<seg id=811>The American threats or the suggestions of a new war in Iran fuel resentment and frustration and strengthen the most radical forces.</seg>
<seg id=812>If the US such a development, should they wish to avoid the influence of their own radical limit and understand that American interests in Iraq best by a more cooperation with Iran served.</seg>
<seg id=813>The way out of Iraq</seg>
<seg id=814>Iraq is finally reached the point, in which all seem to want the same: the withdrawal of koalitionsstreitkräfte from the country.</seg>
<seg id=815>The recent from the British Ministry durchgesickerte checks on a document the withdrawal highlights this desire.</seg>
<seg id=816>The only question is how to him.</seg>
<seg id=817>As long as the koalitionsstreitkräfte remain, the violence likely escalate.</seg>
<seg id=818>But they go, it will also be an escalation, only faster.</seg>
<seg id=819>The real question is how to get to the point, in which Iraq a police and army, the results can be zutraut to maintain law and order.</seg>
<seg id=820>It is still a long way to go, until this goal anything is reached.</seg>
<seg id=821>Despite the courage of the many Iraqis, the army or police join, no one should be surprised if some motives, that is not purely.</seg>
<seg id=822>Northern Iraq be old scores paid, in areas such as irbil, traditionally ethnically mixed, is a factual ethnic division introduced.</seg>
<seg id=823>In other areas, the law of Sharia force enforced.</seg>
<seg id=824>How can the Iraq so uniformierte services up to be effective and impartial enforcement of the law, without taking account of ethnicity, religion, gender and trust can?</seg>
<seg id=825>The traditional answer is, people to recruit and train them the right to the "values".</seg>
<seg id=826>But it is not enough time.</seg>
<seg id=827>Other ways are necessary.</seg>
<seg id=828>Without a deep values enshrined needs of Iraq civil organizations on the ground, the police and army to account.</seg>
<seg id=829>This may take various forms, but it is really important is that it people at local level and, indeed, involving the power structures on bezirksebene, regional and national level to support when they show abuse.</seg>
<seg id=830>If there is a local review, whose value national reinforced and recognition of,, most of the likely uniformed services accordingly, and if they do not, they can easier identified and accordingly.</seg>
<seg id=831>This may sound, high hopes, but in Afghanistan, a country Iraq in many ways the, there are groups on this work.</seg>
<seg id=832>The cooperation for peace and unity (cpau) provides a model, how this can be done.</seg>
<seg id=833>Just as in Iraq, the reduction of violence for ordinary people in Afghanistan top priority.</seg>
<seg id=834>The cpau has in the last three years across the country have worked, to friedenskomitees bezirksebene establishing by friedensräten in the surrounding villages support.</seg>
<seg id=835>The initiative has to do with a culture of violence so deeply rooted is that children sooner be learned by deaths sowjetsoldaten zählten.</seg>
<seg id=836>The committee therefore try to all parts of the Community together, including teachers, stammesführer, religious leaders, women, police, soldiers, judges and business to find new ways to non-violent conflict.</seg>
<seg id=837>Although has not formally monitoring of the role of the Committee was (this is planned for the future,), the mere fact that the army, police and judiciary Committee, they are in contact with the rest of the Community that provides feedback and creates confidence.</seg>
<seg id=838>Some results are remarkable.</seg>
<seg id=839>In a workshop was the local militärkommandant courtesy for a few hours over and remained in the end, for the whole week.</seg>
<seg id=840>To conclude, he apologized for his violent past and committed itself, its 2000 man strong privatarmee to disarm.</seg>
<seg id=841>Now he visited the offices of committee regularly.</seg>
<seg id=842>Iraq is now start projects such as the humanitarian "center (humanitarian begegnungszentrum) in Kirkuk, a überwachende function to fulfil by the ethnically mixed local populations the opportunity to their problems and to help to solve.</seg>
<seg id=843>But all too often judicial decisions, even if they were adopted, as a result of intimidation not implemented.</seg>
<seg id=844>By the American and British forces has already been much good work to strengthen civil society.</seg>
<seg id=845>You hear nothing about the workshops authorising of women or the successful organization of elections in small framework across the country.</seg>
<seg id=846>But the mobilization of civil society is a huge challenge, especially when, as in Iraq, quickly and to a large extent be done.</seg>
<seg id=847>Military are still needed, but as incentives to disarm, including the prospect of economic opportunities that are fertile as crime and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id=848>Fortunately, the building of civil skills as cheap as important.</seg>
<seg id=849>The humanitarian "center serves the Kirkuk, annual costs of $75,000.</seg>
<seg id=850>With $10 million more 100 centers such may be created, and it would be much more "small change" left.</seg>
<seg id=851>The challenge is to this approach to him to expand and is fully behind the brave people, to take up the challenge to the powerful to account.</seg>
<seg id=852>Otherwise, it is unlikely that the Iraqis security, that, after so many years of suffering so desperately need.</seg>
<seg id=853>Democracy nil? on</seg>
<seg id=854>The decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak surprising for a Constitution, a direct election of the President in several gegenkandidaten allow, could in Egypt and in the Arab world as a huge step towards democracy be.</seg>
<seg id=855>For people in the West, the pluralist democracies are accustomed to, it is perhaps difficult to understand what an enormous change, in a country that may be, for more than 50 years under Rule.</seg>
<seg id=856>In the current system, Egyptian citizens only all six years on the day of the presidential elections in the ballot box, and the single name on the ballots their approval or not.</seg>
<seg id=857>That explains why someone like Mubarak every time over 90% of the vote, when, in different turnout.</seg>
<seg id=858>It was Syrian and Iraqi leaders with such systems even better; this is undoubtedly because and addresses the voters on any ballots aufzuscheinen.</seg>
<seg id=859>Often, argued that the democratisation process in the Middle East would not advance to Egypt, fully to represent.</seg>
<seg id=860>Egypt was the path of democratization but not for, without its constitution to change, namely the pharaonischen powers of its President to limit and whose term to limit.</seg>
<seg id=861>Mubarak is after all already in 24 year his term as President.</seg>
<seg id=862>Thus, his announcement, for a presidential with several gegenkandidaten to ensure that an important first step.</seg>
<seg id=863>The regime is perhaps that the process to take advantage of his advantage, but of course of events is perhaps not so easy to control even when people feel that they have to be in power.</seg>
<seg id=864>The flaschengeist of democracy had his bottle leave.</seg>
<seg id=865>At least Egypt is not the only country in this region problembeladenen, which is now on the way towards democracy made.</seg>
<seg id=866>Turkey on the one hand, the Middle East and Morocco on the other are already way.</seg>
<seg id=867>The real pressure, this time from the strict timing and the positive results of the recent elections in Iraq, in Palestine and to a lesser extent, in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=868>In the unprecedented demonstrations against the Syrian occupation of Lebanon in the wake of the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, no end in sight.</seg>
<seg id=869>Egypt also opposition groups, in recent weeks, increasingly risky märsche Hungary and other forms of civil disobedience displayed.</seg>
<seg id=870>Their anger was up by the arrest of health angegriffenen oppositionschefs eiman only at the end of January.</seg>
<seg id=871>The gnadenlose approach government led to a revival of "national" (enough) Kifaya Movement, an end of Mubarak regime demands.</seg>
<seg id=872>Suddenly seemed widespread view that Egyptians were passive, and activities zurückscheuten, no longer to sustain.</seg>
<seg id=873>An alliance of local, regional and international forces vereinigt against the tyranny of the banks of the everyday Nils.</seg>
<seg id=874>The recent druckwelle from the people seems to have shaken the regime.</seg>
<seg id=875>Only a month ago, Mubarak calls for a constitutional reform as "pointless" on.</seg>
<seg id=876>But what constellation of events, whatever its tide bewirkte, an initiative to change the vote should be welcomed.</seg>
<seg id=877>This is a necessary, though inadequate, first step to deadlocked modification of the political system in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id=878>The Egyptians have already sceptical alibireformen à la Tunisia, where langzeitpräsident be Al abidin Ben Ali the caricature of a constitution, created vordergründig kompetitive elections, allowed, but to a scheinwahlgang led, in a few ausgesuchte "gegenkandidaten antraten."</seg>
<seg id=879>In former presidential elections in Tunisia reached Ben Ali routinely 99% of the vote in this election, it was 96%.</seg>
<seg id=880>Let us hope that it Mubarak with its wahlrechtsreform serious says.</seg>
<seg id=881>As he must sign for the immediate release of eiman only impose and measures to for 24 years of emergency to end of a campaign actively prevented.</seg>
<seg id=882>Moreover, should, Mubarak for a restriction of the term of President twice in five years.</seg>
<seg id=883>As needed confidence-building measures, including an open and equal access to the media, which are now under state control.</seg>
<seg id=884>I announced that I intend, in the coming presidential elections to stand for election, so that a debate on basic reform in motion.</seg>
<seg id=885>I would, however, with pleasure, in my life withdraw if free and open elections in this autumn be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id=886>In implementing these measures would serious Mubarak's legacy in another light.</seg>
<seg id=887>Along with the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine, to a long überfälliger Arab spring of union freedom.</seg>
<seg id=888>Historic election in Egypt?</seg>
<seg id=889>On 7 September elect the Egyptians its new President, the ten candidates part of 24 years acting President Hosni Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id=890>Although his re-election nearly there is no doubt that it is pursuing the electoral process in many places but with a great deal of interest.</seg>
<seg id=891>In this election, 000 for national observers, and hundreds of foreign journalists flows this week in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id=892>Although the äußerlichen criteria of fair round in fact met, important aspects of the lack of credibility, krasser way.</seg>
<seg id=893>Despite contrary promise is of equal very long way from.</seg>
<seg id=894>Mubarak keeps still disproportionate many assets in hand: wiedererkennungswert faktisches, a monopoly on the state-controlled electronic media, as well as about 85% of the press.</seg>
<seg id=895>A week before the election wait some candidates still to broadcast their wahlwerbesendungen in Egyptian TV.</seg>
<seg id=896>All members of the electoral commission. For the presidential election of Mubarak appointed and with the new wahlbestimmungen took it independent herausforderern any chance.</seg>
<seg id=897>After a judgment by the Supreme Court, since 2000, 8 000 Egyptian judges the elections and monitor the results confirm.</seg>
<seg id=898>The judgment was an important step towards fair elections, because the situation of judges in the last 50 years independence fairly well against the zugriffsversuche of executive power could claim.</seg>
<seg id=899>Thus had to Mubarak regime on various tricks to use the richtervereinigung auszubooten.</seg>
<seg id=900>It took, for example, "judiciary", thousands of loyal to government officials, which is a deal in law, but could show no experience in court has had to be the real judges the hands tied because, in a protest by a boycott of their überwachungspflichten task would be, once again, the police's infamous Ministry fallen.</seg>
<seg id=901>In the past, added the richtervereinigung with unpredictable effects.</seg>
<seg id=902>The legislative elections in 2000, reached the ruling party Mubarak's of real judges monitored constituencies around 38% of the vote, while the stimmanteil where the judges, at work, on 86% rise.</seg>
<seg id=903>This year it promises very different.</seg>
<seg id=904>The spring was the judges a nation-wide Assembly on. It agreed that the presidential election (or parliamentary) only then to monitor, if the government of judges full independence and the exclusive control of wahlvorganges gives.</seg>
<seg id=905>On 2 September by their final demands: the choice of civil society groups to be seen, the definition, who is a legitimate judges to wahlzwecken, must not be changed, and no box must be removed, without the vote before a legitimate ausgezählt judges and the result of this confirmed and sent.</seg>
<seg id=906>So far is after a stalemate, because the chairman of the electoral commission has publicly in Egyptian TV declared that he any monitoring of the electoral process by citizens of..</seg>
<seg id=907>Another interesting development on the eve of the vote is the widespread public debate as to whether his voice should now or the presidential elections to boycott.</seg>
<seg id=908>Several Members have their opposition to the election in protest against the all too restrictive wahlbestimmungen fernzubleiben, Mubarak a vast advantage to the other candidates give.</seg>
<seg id=909>On the other hand, urges the strongest einzelopposition supposedly in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, their supporters to voting on a conscience and demands it, not to take any "despotic, corrupt rulers".</seg>
<seg id=910>This is an implicit, but still a rejection, Mubarak's alleinherrschers of the last 24 years.</seg>
<seg id=911>Around 34 of civil society organisations are despite repeated objections government thousands of young Egyptians on the monitoring of elections.</seg>
<seg id=912>These groups are of the opinion that the national and international monitoring of the elections may not be a problem if the government should not any plans to the round to manipulate.</seg>
<seg id=913>The regime kontert that any monitoring by foreign people a violation of the Egyptian sovereignty and national observers an affront to the integrity of judges.</seg>
<seg id=914>This argument, but immediately the basis, when richtervereinigung stripped of their support for the civil observers were known.</seg>
<seg id=915>Whether the Mubarak regime is now due to increasing demands at home and abroad for free and fair elections in panic is simply or if it is incapable of party's gewohnheitsmäßigen abzugewöhnen fraud, the current sign the vote on Wednesday verheißen nothing good.</seg>
<seg id=916>Meanwhile, the Egyptians, for the first time an exciting foretaste of opposition to the tyranny and enjoy some newly discovered freiheitsraum.</seg>
<seg id=917>Europe's $envy</seg>
<seg id=918>In the monetary can focus not only commercial transactions but diplomatic and political zänkereien.</seg>
<seg id=919>If that happens, will economic transactions and difficult subject major uncertainties.</seg>
<seg id=920>The politicization of money in the depression of the interwar wirkte economically devastating.</seg>
<seg id=921>But it is also more recently, rightly unpleasant währungskriegen.</seg>
<seg id=922>In the 1960's, the international financial order was at the heart of the political tauziehens.</seg>
<seg id=923>Each side, for what was going on, very different theories and statements.</seg>
<seg id=924>The Europeans - particularly the French - klagten about what General Charles de Gaulle the "exorbitant privilege" of the US dollar called.</seg>
<seg id=925>The general and his finanz guru, Jacques rueff, claimed, the US would the status of the dollar as hauptreservewährung under the Bretton Woods regime fixed exchange rates to use such deficits to allow and thus for its overseas military abenteurertum pay (then in Vietnam).</seg>
<seg id=926>France responded with the reputation: financial to the role of the dollar, and tried to end the largely discredited return to the gold standard.</seg>
<seg id=927>Europeans began a long discussion on the benefits of monetary union, to the achievement of the dollar in the eyes look.</seg>
<seg id=928>But the American point of view, the international role of the dollar a case.</seg>
<seg id=929>Other countries could change and their exchange rates on this for a greater competitiveness in exports sustained.</seg>
<seg id=930>The US Government was given a undervalued yens powerless and nährte the to the rest of the world would the dollar used to attack America's productive base.</seg>
<seg id=931>The Nixon administration was concluded that the only way to save the American economy, is the monetary unilateralism, a drastic geldausweitung so that other countries are forced to adjust their exchange rates.</seg>
<seg id=932>This long forgotten fighting suddenly appear to be a very topical.</seg>
<seg id=933>The world is not more under the regime of fixed exchange rates, but remains the dollar the major reserve currency - a kind of floatendes Bretton Woods.</seg>
<seg id=934>For us, the role of the dollar as a reserve currency a potential threat, while not Americans as another case of American neoimperialen search for dominance seems.</seg>
<seg id=935>In this decade, China has taken place, in Japan in the 1960's held. It keeps its exchange rate down to the growth of its exports anzustoßen.</seg>
<seg id=936>Thus, China is the target of us complaints about unfair competition and their efforts to an adjustment of the exchange rates to force, Americans from China would, toys, equipment, and to buy clothes.</seg>
<seg id=937>The producers in the US have decided that in China gefertigte büstenhalter a danger to the American way of life.</seg>
<seg id=938>Now complaints Europeans (especially the French) about the great US deficit, and de Gaulle's argument that the rest of the world for America's war pay, is back in fashion.</seg>
<seg id=939>Some Europeans propose to Asian central banks should be a greater share of their reserves in euro hold the echo of unsuccessful attempt, with the general America by the purchase of gold against the dollar, knees to force.</seg>
<seg id=940>The 1960 ended with the collapse of "and" system in major financial turbulence. Moreover came a inflationärer in güterpreise.</seg>
<seg id=941>All were harmed, America's role in weltangelegenheiten was shaken.</seg>
<seg id=942>A similar collapse would now probably quite other effects yield.</seg>
<seg id=943>The system is now more free exchange rates and the burden of adaptation will be distributed differently.</seg>
<seg id=944>Most Americans not suffer under the clear dollarabsturz because the buyers from abroad their prices on the market to adapt.</seg>
<seg id=945>The Asian economies grow strongly and gathering in their central demands of the US.</seg>
<seg id=946>They are likely to continue this policy, because the alternative a sudden setback for the competitiveness of their ausfuhrsektoren on the market, it is important to view.</seg>
<seg id=947>This makes us a long time, their deficit, which, in the long run, can be sustained, not address.</seg>
<seg id=948>The economically dynamic regions of the world - North America and Asia - are in this way in a pact with what the central role of the US dollar will ensure for the time being.</seg>
<seg id=949>The Americans will continue to accumulate debt because the Asians that of them.</seg>
<seg id=950>The Pact to announce would be against the interests of both sides.</seg>
<seg id=951>This is no American unilateralism, because it is the cooperation with Asia.</seg>
<seg id=952>But for Europeans who are excluded from this Pact, sees it as money and wirtschaftsunilateralismus from.</seg>
<seg id=953>In the meantime, creates the rise in the euro against the dollar for substantial pain in European güterexporteuren.</seg>
<seg id=954>Europe can do not much to relief to give.</seg>
<seg id=955>Indeed, in the new Europe währungskämpfen of greater suffer.</seg>
<seg id=956>In the 1960's, the answers were herumposaunt - the revival of goldstandards, or the introduction of a single European currency - no longer seem to be helpful.</seg>
<seg id=957>A single common currency to possess, has not been as key protection</seg>
<seg id=958>Only the old form of European response - psychologists they could call "$envy" - will increase.</seg>
<seg id=959>It appeals to the European Central Bank to the monetary base expand, as if the imitation of the dollar, the answer to all industrial, structural and demographic problems that Europe plagues.</seg>
<seg id=960>But already brief think should remember that the problems of Europe not währungsmanipulationen depend on.</seg>
<seg id=961>The protest of the new American exorbitant geldprivilegs should be seen as the what it is: a way, with the real European impotence abzufinden.</seg>
<seg id=962>Will it remain envy the dollar, and he will increase if the value of international greenbacks then melting, without any obvious adverse effect on the people who use it and printing.</seg>
<seg id=963>The disease political influence</seg>
<seg id=964>As citizens of other countries in the world, the Americans have to note that the policy in the occupation of public office plays an important role.</seg>
<seg id=965>Few are surprised (though sometimes disappointed) when the appointment of senior judge or diplomats to erfolgter by his loyalty to specific political principles of party or the President's Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id=966>There is, however, almost complete agreement that science a position in the United States to begin in this respect, but to a warnenden example for the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=967>Appointments of science should on objective criteria such as training, skills and performance based.</seg>
<seg id=968>Of course, it is legitimate, a future US health to his opinion on the question of abortion.</seg>
<seg id=969>But it is totally inappropriate to Members of scientific beraterstäbe a test their political loyalty to undergo.</seg>
<seg id=970>Nor should the membership in peer review bodies - a central up to scientific progress - absolutely free from beitrittshindernissen be, not with scientific quality in linked.</seg>
<seg id=971>Unfortunately, in the US scientists increasingly faced with obstacles of this kind.</seg>
<seg id=972>Last autumn the science published wissenschaftsmagazin several article on the subject.</seg>
<seg id=973>In one of these contributions it was about the complete umbesetzung beratergremiums of the American National Centre for health and the environment, a unterabteilung of the centre for disease prevention and (CDC), without any prior consultation with the head of the affected up.</seg>
<seg id=974>Similar cases involved the beratergremium the CDC to bleivergiftungen and prevention, as well as the bioethikkommissionen advisory committee on national human research protections and advisory committee on genetic testing.</seg>
<seg id=975>The current epidemic grassierende political influence in the wake of the beratergremien entirely new be filled and candidates a loyalitätstest, seems to be some observers for an old hat.</seg>
<seg id=976>The American health ministry officials call the as "practice".</seg>
<seg id=977>Now, it is not common practice in America, at least, it was not so far.</seg>
<seg id=978>At least not really worrying is that the Bush administration candidates on its compatibility with their "values" is.</seg>
<seg id=979>The bedenklichste aspect of this development is how this profound ideological in the areas of eindringt, once immune this kind of manipulation,.</seg>
<seg id=980>Perhaps augenfälligste example of the epidemic, ausbreitende political influence was the umbesetzung body of the US, the Institute for safety, with the financing of studies of workers in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=981>Beratergremien were in the past may occasionally exposed to this kind of influence.</seg>
<seg id=982>After all they recommend policies that politicians implement or not.</seg>
<seg id=983>But for studienfinanzierung responsible bodies?</seg>
<seg id=984>In October 2002 veröffentliche science a editorial of David michaels and some of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id=985>For them it was former senior officials, some of these bodies were. In their personal experience supplied them valuable information on this issue.</seg>
<seg id=986>Their contribution was the a story, but what was followed by, was more interesting.</seg>
<seg id=987>There was a flood of letters, where scientists from similar experience reported.</seg>
<seg id=988>A candidate for the koordinationsausschuss institutes of health to the American research muskeldystrophie told how to by a staff of the White House was tested.</seg>
<seg id=989>After their opinion on the various policies of the Bush administration kundig made, of not something with the work of the committee to do that, they had asked them whether they policy the President agree about embryonic stem cells.</seg>
<seg id=990>Another sender, a respected professor of psychiatry and psychology, told by a call from the White House in which to him about his nomination for the national Council informed us against drug abuse.</seg>
<seg id=991>The anrufer declared that he would have it, a review, "to find out whether it any views, for the President would be unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id=992>According to Professor by the, he asked a number of questions with the officials of the White House continually a punktestand rose.</seg>
<seg id=993>For example: "They now have two, three, the President is without taking account of the consequences for ethical reasons against nadelaustauschprogramme [for] intravenös consumed by dependent on drugs."</seg>
<seg id=994>The survey then took a still unerfreulichere am.</seg>
<seg id=995>The candidate officials asked whether he Bush elected have when he was that this was not the case, it was to: "why they have not supported the President?"</seg>
<seg id=996>This is in line with the approach in dictatorships and not in democracies.</seg>
<seg id=997>Scientific beratergremien are there, balanced and well thought-out policy advice to make.</seg>
<seg id=998>If the desired political result is first and foremost, has nothing to be gained, but much lost.</seg>
<seg id=999>For this reason, the choice of what research to support are always a cause an objective evaluation by fachkollegen and not by politicians.</seg>
<seg id=1000>In fact the demands in this respect, one American law, - the Federal Advisory Committee act - that bodies into must be balanced and "of ernennenden Agency not be unduly influenced."</seg>
<seg id=1001>The American health Tommy Thompson and the personalabteilung of the White House should for the rest of the world an example statuieren.</seg>
<seg id=1002>This is very simple: by the law yourself.</seg>
<seg id=1003>Murder Moscow</seg>
<seg id=1004>It is time to clean up the fiction that the postcommunist Russia by Vladimir Putin's "dictatorship of law" less would become unlawfully.</seg>
<seg id=1005>The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of the best journalists mutigsten and Russia, a woman who dared it, the brutal murder of the Russian forces in Chechnya of the public, is the last evidence that President Putin no more than an ordinary dictatorship established, with all the accompanying the disregard for the law.</seg>
<seg id=1006>This recognition is in time for the world, especially for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1007>The German Foreign Minister is just to a strategy for Russian-German relations in which the indifference lawlessness when Putin's national interest in the most powerful member of the European Union is to be enshrined.</seg>
<seg id=1008>This indifference, but to appeasement when they Putin encouraged, his lawless methods on the international stage to, now in its campaign to Georgia to economic ruin.</seg>
<seg id=1009>The murder of Politkovskaya has triggered a unheimliches vu: as at the time, as was at the height of power of the KGB, Putin's Russia people simply disappear.</seg>
<seg id=1010>The killing politkowskajas is the third politically gefärbte murder within three weeks.</seg>
<seg id=1011>Enwer siganschin chefingenieur BP, of Russia, was 30 September in Irkutsk shot.</seg>
<seg id=1012>Andrei Kozlov, Deputy Governor of Russia's Central Bank, of a campaign against finanzbetrug led 14 September, was murdered.</seg>
<seg id=1013>The fact that the Russian Public Prosecutor Yuri tschajka case kozlow the studies in murder took Politkovskaya, is no great hopes for this, as in the case of real democracies if high officials justizkreise hinzugezogen.</seg>
<seg id=1014>Indeed, the involvement of highest Russian regierungskreise almost a guarantee that the murderer never taken.</seg>
<seg id=1015>The murder of Mrs Politkovskaya is a particularly gloomy omen, given that it is their to one of the most powerful kritikerinnen the Russian President was.</seg>
<seg id=1016>In its articles for the last independent newspapers in Moscow, novaya gazeta, and in their books "Putin's Russia" and "Chechnya. The truth about the war wrote about the" Politkovskaya schwindende freedom that a characteristic feature of Putin's presidency has been.</seg>
<seg id=1017>Both the expulsion of the former medienzaren Boris beresowsky and Vladimir Gusinsky, the arrest of Mikhail ölmagnaten chodorkowsky show what Putin's enemies on: prison, exile or the grave.</seg>
<seg id=1018>I beschuldige Putin's government not to Politkovskaya about a auftragsmörder murdered.</seg>
<seg id=1019>As enthüllungsjournalistin Politkovskaya has not only with Putin, but also in many other unpopular made, not least in the current Prime Minister, the Chechen ramsan kadyrow it accused, a policy of kidnappings to ransom policy.</seg>
<seg id=1020>But even if Vladimir Putin people with murder Politkovskaya in the lift their wohnhauses center Moscow have nothing to do with Putin's disregard for the law, created the climate in which this murder happened.</seg>
<seg id=1021>As well as the murder of Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Beckett in the cathedral in many centuries, this clear crimes committed in the belief that the King has fallen.</seg>
<seg id=1022>In view of what Politkovskaya -- was: a democratic responsibility for the press, the Kremlin and his policies to question, would the government to ensure that nothing of the journalist zustößt evil.</seg>
<seg id=1023>Putin's Russia has over the last six years already 12 leading journalists by murder lost.</seg>
<seg id=1024>None of these crimes, enlightened. This would be different if Putin's "dictatorship of law" would be more than a PR strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1025>The six years since Vladimir Putin's Kremlin seem were a time deeply conflicting signals.</seg>
<seg id=1026>On the one hand, the world looks to a young, educated leader, promises to Russia and to modernize the country, particularly with regard to gesetzesvollstreckung and legal practice of closer international norms.</seg>
<seg id=1027>On the other hand, the President to silence when his former colleagues in Russian Security Service (FSB, the former KGB) to the life and limb endangered no security and provide a berüchtigter spionagefälle against journalists, scientists and activists into roles.</seg>
<seg id=1028>These "neo spionen" include the journalist Grigory Pasko, waffenkontrollexperte Igor sutjagin, the diplomat Valentin moisejew, physicists Valentin danilow and others.</seg>
<seg id=1029>The supposed zivilisierende influence to Russia's role as a partner of the West, as, for example, have to be chaired by the G8 summit in St. Petersburg, seems, Putin's Kremlin kabale its to have any effect.</seg>
<seg id=1030>The confrontation with Western values has again a Potemkin village to Days promoted. Russia presented a veneer of laws and democratic institutions, behind this kulisse, but the same rohlinge in an arbitrary manier.</seg>
<seg id=1031>The danger of this world is that Putin lawlessness is exported.</seg>
<seg id=1032>In the Middle abroad is a form of kriminalisierter diplomacy.</seg>
<seg id=1033>Putin's attempt to consider in this context, the presidential elections in Ukraine or to manipulate the regularly raised again withdrawn and criminal indictments against the leader Yuliya tymoschenko.</seg>
<seg id=1034>Consider the conditions in the breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia, the only so it can give, because the Kremlin supported this.</seg>
<seg id=1035>Consider, as the Kremlin tries to its neighbours to blackmail by its energy threatened.</seg>
<seg id=1036>Everyone knows that criminal policeman always dreister, when criminal behavior ignored.</seg>
<seg id=1037>It is high time that the world recognizes the Vladimir Putin as what it is: a man of Russia, in the darkness.</seg>
<seg id=1038>The whole world, to the old Latin principle recall qui tacet consentire videtur -- who silent, seems to agree, and it must be to ask whether it is wise to the formation of a lawless energiesupermacht by Putin silence to accept.</seg>
<seg id=1039>Russia's pipeline empire,</seg>
<seg id=1040>Gerhard Schroeder, less than a month ago German Chancellor was, has agreed to aufsichtsratsvorsitzender the company to be, a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany by the Baltic Sea, and further by Western Europe is built.</seg>
<seg id=1041>In many countries would Schroeder now of a conflict of interests of the trial.</seg>
<seg id=1042>Its obvious moral entgleisung is reinforced by the fact that Russia is at the moment is threatening to prevent gas supplies to Ukraine, if not the state of the country preisforderungen gasgiganten Kremlin Gazprom, to comply.</seg>
<seg id=1043>Russia's strategic mandate is obvious: the Ukraine gas abzudrehen also means Europe largely restrict gas supplies, because some of the largest European gas pipelines through Ukraine lead.</seg>
<seg id=1044>By Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic States be evaded, promises the new pipeline the Kremlin even greater influence, while this is trying to regional to claim.</seg>
<seg id=1045>President Vladimir Putin and his government from former KGB gefährten must, in the decision, how hard they exclude Russia's postcommunist neighbors, worry about more to Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1046>Europe should Putin Indeed, with this new imperial weapon greater?</seg>
<seg id=1047>Worse still, Russia could perhaps this weapon against a on energy angewiesene EU as?</seg>
<seg id=1048>That a German Chancellor ex the company will lead to the Russia a means to give it to the EU economy to manipulate, instead of Europe's dangerous indifference with Putin's neoimperialistischer ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1049>There is no doubt, Russia's media about Europe's growing dependence on Russian energy aware.</seg>
<seg id=1050>It is even schwelgen: after we have increased our concerted gas companies and essential to write Russian leitartikler, Europe will, on the human rights silence.</seg>
<seg id=1051>Putin is in this stance by indirect expressed its commitment to a by him so called "independent" policy to pursue.</seg>
<seg id=1052>Including he understands that Russia of the moral and human rights concerns of Western democracies "independent" should be.</seg>
<seg id=1053>Perhaps some European leaders in fact believe that maintaining the behaglichen prosperity Union rechtfertige our silence to human rights and other issues, the Kremlin lästig.</seg>
<seg id=1054>We can, in business, to "" Affairs position, such as the expropriation of Yukos, but if the Kremlin our values or criticism of Russia's misdeeds, for example, blood-stained in Chechnya, with a price versieht, seem more Europeans to be ready to their shut to hold, as the higher energy prices or even a blockade how to Ukraine on, in buying.</seg>
<seg id=1055>While Putin its court umbildet and the Duma, will be assumed that the hopes of the EU to a growing "of" Russia be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=1056>Putin's Russia, which is, of the post-Soviet hopes for freedom in a new model for oil and gas gasbollwerk its former KGB elite transformed.</seg>
<seg id=1057>In fact, is Matthias warnig, the Director-General of the pipeline consortium, unless the Schröder, is an old friend Putin.</seg>
<seg id=1058>In the Wall Street Journal, this year, reported that warnig, of the Russian branch of Dresden Bank officer, chairing the Stasi was the German secret police, Putin in the late 1980ern have learned, as Russia's president in Germany as KGB spy was deployed.</seg>
<seg id=1059>The Russians government from former KGB workers to allow for the lack of sympathy and intolerance different opinions are the norm, reflects their depletion of trubel reflects the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id=1060>Now the Kremlin seems to think that what is good for ordinary Russians, also for independent nations is good: small and weak countries will not erbarmen demonstrated that Russia as soon as it receives the tools to intimidate, to isolate them and with the prospect of energiesperre to threaten.</seg>
<seg id=1061>As a former head of state of recently independent Lithuania, I have often such threats.</seg>
<seg id=1062>The EU has many agreement with Russia signed, including a for a "common" space for freedom and justice.</seg>
<seg id=1063>The Kremlin understand it very well, such a vorzutäuschen idealism.</seg>
<seg id=1064>His control of Eastern Europe was always on the basis of "freundschaftsverträgen" exercise made, and the Soviet invasions Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, "fraternal operations".</seg>
<seg id=1065>But, as you see, in this common space "Putin" abused, barbaric treatment of Chechens, the businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky in jail, foreign NGOs in difficulties, one of the mitanführerinnen the Orange Revolution of last year, Yuliya Tymoshenko, of Russian militärstaatsanwälten invented for charges of.</seg>
<seg id=1066>If Europeans their common space for human rights and freedoms seriously, they must recognize that these values from berechnenden pöstcheninhabern Putin's Kremlin shared.</seg>
<seg id=1067>The same is true if Russia as ally in the fight against terrorism is seen.</seg>
<seg id=1068>It is conceivable that the home country of "red terror" with countless ungestraften crimes from the Soviet era, whose blutspur, from Lithuania in the Caucasus,, reliable support it provides, Iran and North Korea from the world, to threaten?</seg>
<seg id=1069>It seems likely that the heads of the Kremlin's kalkulierenden only every crisis as an opportunity to exploit, their destructive power and influence to increase.</seg>
<seg id=1070>For decades, my European region at the mercy of the evil mercy.</seg>
<seg id=1071>I can therefore not silence back, while Europe blind in a new hineinstolpert appeasement.</seg>
<seg id=1072>We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, our heritage taught that behind every diplomatic action Russia's imperial efforts hide.</seg>
<seg id=1073>West Europeans who was spared this heritage, our warnings should listen.</seg>
<seg id=1074>Dependence on Russia -- even if they are now in the face of supposedly "charismatischen" Gerhard Schroeder presented, leads only in the abyss.</seg>
<seg id=1075>Gewehrkugeln and elections in Iraq</seg>
<seg id=1076>As the war in Iraq began pursued in 2003, the Bush administration ambitious plans, as in Germany and Japan after 1945 was a long and peaceful occupation and, while the expanding production should ensure a rising prosperity and democratic structures would built bit by bit.</seg>
<seg id=1077>The basis should be a liberal, even post-modern Constitution be women, 25% of the seats in Parliament guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id=1078>In today's Iraq there is no peace and no prosperity.</seg>
<seg id=1079>The Constitution, on the October 15 voted, contains the 25% rule, but otherwise it is far from liberal, to be.</seg>
<seg id=1080>The schlüsselbestimmung (Article 2), that no law "the unangefochtenen rules of Islam" contradict, contrary to the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, and the legislation to stop to international standards.</seg>
<seg id=1081>For example, can the age of sexual mündigkeit girls, not to over nine years set, because, even a woman had nine years old.</seg>
<seg id=1082>It follows that neunjährige girls in criminal and also as a result of the death penalty are subject, for example, the übertritt to a different religion.</seg>
<seg id=1083>In the context of the Shia their ayatollahs with this provision as in Iran over the elected Parliament, because this alone have the right to "rules" Islam.</seg>
<seg id=1084>Outsiders and the few Iraqi liberal are mainly about these Islamic provision concerns, but the Sunni widespread opposition to the Constitution is directed against other regulations: the exclusion of "saddamistischen Baath Party" from political life and from the Federal government and the provisions of Iraq's 18 provinces grant autonomy and allow them to regional governments zusammenzuschließen.</seg>
<seg id=1085>The ausschlussregel is a personal matter for Sunni elite -- including thousands of businessmen, experts and even artists, because, with a few exceptions, they all Baath Members.</seg>
<seg id=1086>In theory the ban in the Constitution be interpreted that it is only for the future.</seg>
<seg id=1087>But in practice, the administrative currently used so that so-called "senior members of the Baath any governance are excluded, and thousands are affected.</seg>
<seg id=1088>The Sunnis the federal regulations would likely to accept if they only for the Kurds gälten.</seg>
<seg id=1089>They know that the alternative is the return to centralization, but the secession of the three Kurdish provinces, mostly dahuk Arbil and as sulaymaniyah to an independent Kurdistan, with its own Treasury, Army (the peschmerga) and production in Kirkuk, with the second largest reserves in Iraq -- to reasons.</seg>
<seg id=1090>The Sunnis reject the same federalism for the Shia on, because it as they Sunni Arabs relatives as the rule in the past have accepted and will do so again, except that they get their own government.</seg>
<seg id=1091>This would allow the new Constitution, because the Shiite majority with provinces in the south, for most of the Iraqi oil reserves, have their own regional government could form.</seg>
<seg id=1092>In the Middle style threaten sunnitenführer suggest that are dissatisfied with the Constitution, now force.</seg>
<seg id=1093>But not the federalism is why Sunni extremists and Islamists lethal attacks commit.</seg>
<seg id=1094>Their resistance is fundamental: they accept the principle of a democratic mehrheitsregierung not.</seg>
<seg id=1095>Instead, they want to rule by the Sunni minority restore</seg>
<seg id=1096>For the Islamists deserve all Shia already death, just as breakaway.</seg>
<seg id=1097>One of the Shiite, leader Muqtada Sadr, talks are also vehemently against of federalism.</seg>
<seg id=1098>His supporters are largely ungebildeten, the poorest and most violent Shia from slums of Baghdad and environment, whose "Mahdi militia" 2004 even then, against the American troops weiterkämpften when Americans Shia, the Sunni angreifern protected.</seg>
<seg id=1099>As a very young geistlicher, his authority of his late father, Ayatollah itself a populist -- ableitet Sadr, is on the resistance of living ayatollahs of Iraq, his ignorance and brutality contempt.</seg>
<seg id=1100>What the religious authority, can Sadr impossible with them into, so it is a Arabic nationalist stance against them and often a recalls that the highest Shiite clergy, Ayatollah Sistani, Persians is, and no Arabs.</seg>
<seg id=1101>In the same way he calls its supporters recall that the El hakims that the Supreme Council of the Islamic revolution in Iraq (sciri) March, and their "Badr militias" price exiles in Iran, many of whom in long and bitter Iran Iraq war fought for Iran to Americans "they have brought".</seg>
<seg id=1102>Sadr is against federalism, because a regional Shiite government his enemies Sistani and the sciri obey and would, he says, the Iranian influence geriete.</seg>
<seg id=1103>To his message to emphasize, Sadr his men sent to the Badr militias, which he attack in Baghdad, where mahdis list are managed, in Najaf, where Sadr after the last year caused destruction hated will he remained, but unsuccessfully, to his men were massacred by the Americans.</seg>
<seg id=1104>It was bad enough, with Sadr as bandits to cope, but now is a simple political and that he probably the central figure for the outcome of the elections to the Constitution in October will be.</seg>
<seg id=1105>To reject the Constitution and election for a national assembly to force the opponents, need a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces.</seg>
<seg id=1106>The Sunnis will probably only in two provinces, but if Sadr his supporters in the slums of Baghdad befiehlt, together with the local Sunni with "no" vote, what would be the capital of the verfassungsgegner decide what the rejection of the Constitution would guarantee.</seg>
<seg id=1107>As a political ganove Sadr is of course ready to be bought.</seg>
<seg id=1108>Last year, he was for murder sought.</seg>
<seg id=1109>Now he wants to be recognized as leader, he wants to money and, at least implicitly, humiliation and of sistanis sciri.</seg>
<seg id=1110>He is likely to offers, perhaps the over has already begun.</seg>
<seg id=1111>But some Shia, he words and gewehrkugeln attacking, have thousands of armed, and to think that he only gewehrkugeln should be offered.</seg>
<seg id=1112>Of the secret police of the decline.</seg>
<seg id=1113>As Hungary Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany had to find, as a aufgezeichnetes admission that his government, have led to log openness new democracies in Eastern Europe, is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id=1114>Just as Hungary, Romania, after communism sought, transparency and honesty in one of the earlier verschlossensten societies in the world to increase.</seg>
<seg id=1115>While we bemühten, led the continued verschlossenheit to a sprunghaften expansion of corruption and amtsmissbrauch.</seg>
<seg id=1116>But it has, at last, a real movement towards more openness. This progress, the European Union accepted when they Romania's accession to the European Union for early 2007, the green light.</seg>
<seg id=1117>In addition to what the EU now for a "functioning market" to, there is an important political and legal changes that I as justizministerin supervised, and so different areas such as increased transparency and control in the establishment of political parties or the complete umkrempelung of the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id=1118>Judicial reforms bear in turn to eliminate corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1119>The former and current cabinet members of Members, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police, customs officials and other employees of the public service and directors of private, charges.</seg>
<seg id=1120>Moreover, new standardformulare introduced on which anyone an official position in the government, in Parliament, in the public or local government, or judiciary, holding its wealth and its financial interests will be.</seg>
<seg id=1121>The new explanations are the detailliertesten in Europe, and, above all, they are published.</seg>
<seg id=1122>Romania's progress, in a report published this month confirmed, shows that the citizens' access to public information is now in eastern Europe as well as in old-established democracies.</seg>
<seg id=1123>Indeed, the report suggests transparency and silence (transparency and silence), of the open society justice initiative (rechtsinitiative for an open society, www.justiceinitiative.org) written, suggests that the new democracies in some cases, the old something can teach: some State authorities in Romania went to requests for information of citizens rather than a similar authorities in France or Spain.</seg>
<seg id=1124>Specifically in Romania, 60% of archivierten you answered, compared to 31% in France and 24% in Spain.</seg>
<seg id=1125>Among other countries, the good stages, Mexico, Peru, and that both in 2002, shortly after Romania, laws information to the public institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1126>But it is not always easier in übergangsdemokratien, of sensitive information to reach, in my former Romanian menschenrechtsanwältin as the Helsinki Committee knows.</seg>
<seg id=1127>We have often Court to Romania's law on the freedom of information of 2001, the publication of information to force.</seg>
<seg id=1128>Even if we had a case, for example, in which it to access to the record abgehörter calls, was approved by the prosecutor, ignored the prosecutor's gerichtsbeschluss easy.</seg>
<seg id=1129>We up a zivilklage against a prosecutor, judge, and a fine imposed for every day, in which the information was withheld.</seg>
<seg id=1130>But only when we had the attention of the media, we got the data, in which the was how many lauschangriffe in previous 10 years were approved, whom they are directed and how long.</seg>
<seg id=1131>With the publication, Romania has begun to from its past Securitate dominated to distance.</seg>
<seg id=1132>Now that I even in the government seats, I am aware of the fact that it is sometimes difficult to share information, with the public.</seg>
<seg id=1133>But if painful reforms are necessary, there is no alternative.</seg>
<seg id=1134>We have economic and political reforms that we have not qualify for EU membership, able to politics, if we are not the monitoring of the public to have and the increased public participation in decision-making, with this openness is inevitably, not have.</seg>
<seg id=1135>This is even to an indispensable condition democratic governments around the world.</seg>
<seg id=1136>As the United States 1966 their law to informed public institutions decided that they were in the exclusive society Sweden and Finland.</seg>
<seg id=1137>Today, some 65 countries such a law.</seg>
<seg id=1138>In Romania, those who have fought for a law freedom of information, this full.</seg>
<seg id=1139>As from parts of the study by the Justice's initiative, were requests for information to the Romanian Government willingly answered and information issued its publication, a few years ago would have been unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id=1140>The Romanian Ministry published, for example, the number of armeeangehörigen, died in 2003, as well as their death (including 13 suicides, two erschießungen and two deaths in use in Afghanistan).</seg>
<seg id=1141>Similarly, the Court of Bucharest, the number of judges, the need for early 2000, had punishments, including the reasons for might imposed sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=1142>The Court übergab the request the Supreme richterrat, the full answer provided: a list of vierseitige sanktionierten judges, with details of the reasons and penalties.</seg>
<seg id=1143>Such information is both a product of continued reform as well as a motor for this.</seg>
<seg id=1144>It was not always convenient for the government, and still is a tug-of-war about sensitive documents underway.</seg>
<seg id=1145>However, the benefits of transparency in the former Eastern bloc has brought, cannot be denied.</seg>
<seg id=1146>While Romania's experience shows that the confidentiality of the authorities still a threat to the innermost regierungsformen democratic values, and that is established in both of the young democracies only permanent vigilance that can prevent this confidentiality, einschleicht.</seg>
<seg id=1147>Of the save the lebensbäume</seg>
<seg id=1148>No one is by the day, without a product to use that comes from a forest.</seg>
<seg id=1149>In far more than most people realize, the Paper, we come to the letter, the water, from our hähnen flow of drugs, the US to heal the timber, from our homes and furniture build, from forest.</seg>
<seg id=1150>Forests provide us with the fresh the air we breathe and provide habitats for endangered species.</seg>
<seg id=1151>They also offer us freizeitmöglichkeiten, in our complex world more.</seg>
<seg id=1152>Roughly 1.5 billion of poorer rural world of forests are directly on to their basic needs to food and firewood needs.</seg>
<seg id=1153>Yet, the deforestation on.</seg>
<seg id=1154>Every year, we lose 14.6 million hectares of forest -- an area that around four times the size of Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id=1155>Irresponsible waldmanagement, lax regulation by the state and enforcement will be strengthened, and markets, illegal logging reward rauben together, the world is their most valuable and most vulnerable forests.</seg>
<seg id=1156>As soon as forests start to disappear, usually follow any amount of environmental, social and economic evil to us all to different kind.</seg>
<seg id=1157>The Indonesian island Sumatra is a good example.</seg>
<seg id=1158>Cellulose and papierunternehmen, now the unbridled and unlawful destruction of forests, the world's richest pflanzenvielfalt.</seg>
<seg id=1159>It is likely that it not discovered plants and endangered species such as the sumatranashorn Sumatra, the elephant, or the orang utan disappear.</seg>
<seg id=1160>If the forests sumatras disappear, will the people from the entire communities without proper shelter and without a decent broterwerb find.</seg>
<seg id=1161>Moreover, there are from the distortion of global markets by the trade in illegally and cheap products produced as responsible companies.</seg>
<seg id=1162>By illegal logging go developing annual tax revenues of up to $15 billion lost.</seg>
<seg id=1163>The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the demand for timber for the reconstruction following the tsunami last year, the already unsustainable demands sumatras forests continue to increase.</seg>
<seg id=1164>Similar threats to forests in the Amazon and kongobecken clear.</seg>
<seg id=1165>The recent Millennium ökosystemstudie (the United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, ma) shows that forests in these and other critical regions due to mismanagement of vice back and continue to disappear, if not serious action.</seg>
<seg id=1166>Information from the Brazilian government shows that the deforestation of irreplaceable amazonaswälder (, among other things, by the transformation in agricultural nutzflächen) last year to 2.6 million hectares has increased, which is the entwaldete gesamtfläche 17% of the Amazon, by can be.</seg>
<seg id=1167>But is the fight against deforestation is not lost.</seg>
<seg id=1168>Various organizations, environmentalists and societies that are to the state of the forests around the world, is to ensure close together to reverse the deforestation and the waldmanagement.</seg>
<seg id=1169>For example, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the World Bank Brazil's government help, an initiative to set up, the 17 million hectares of forest in national into new protected.</seg>
<seg id=1170>The alliance the WWF and World Bank has its partners, led to a trust fund to these protected areas permanently to administer.</seg>
<seg id=1171>Similarly, arose from a summit between the leaders of the countries in kongobecken an extraordinary, cross-border cooperation for waldschutz and good management.</seg>
<seg id=1172>This, in turn, led to an initiative of the Foreign Office of the United States to promote waldschutzes Congo with a budget of $53 million.</seg>
<seg id=1173>Since the first meeting of the leaders in 1999, 3.5 million hectares kongobecken new naturschutzgebiete created.</seg>
<seg id=1174>Given the impact of tsunamis in Asia last December and, given the importance of Ma to data and the entwaldungsstatistiken from the main forest areas, our efforts must be continued.</seg>
<seg id=1175>The World Bank and the WWF assured recently that they are to work together to be global entwaldungsrate 2010 to cut by 10%, and that it with other public and private institutions to work together to implement the ambitious waldschutz.</seg>
<seg id=1176>Studies show that the WWF we weltbedarf waldprodukten to cover and important environmental and social values in the foreseeable future, in the global forest resources allocated and uses different types, including nature reserves, responsibly managed by commercial nutzwäldern and again aufgeforsteten waldlandschaften.</seg>
<seg id=1177>Wirtschaftsbosse, governments and organisations have their role in the implementation of these vision to.</seg>
<seg id=1178>Are the Saudis fanatics,?</seg>
<seg id=1179>Terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia, not only led to the chances of weiterbestandes's ruling al-Saud royal house to call into question, but also raised the question of whether this UK to a fundamentally dysfunktionalen and destructive State.</seg>
<seg id=1180>It seems that the whether the Saudi society a wave of violent fanaticism have produced, of its inspiration from the extreme religious orthodoxy refers.</seg>
<seg id=1181>The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers of September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the US, Saudi Arabia, were festigte gehegte for the view that the UK would be a bastion of authoritarianism and of intolerance.</seg>
<seg id=1182>In some ways, this is true, but as a whole can they not agree to the public in Saudi Arabia to.</seg>
<seg id=1183>On the contrary, it would be a serious mistake to believe that the attitude of the Saudis to the religion of entirely fanatischem Islamism is defined.</seg>
<seg id=1184>Between 2001 and 2003 I was a team of, in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Iran, and a large wertestudie conducted.</seg>
<seg id=1185>Our results show an astonishing nuanciertes the werthaltungen in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id=1186>In comparison to the people in those countries of the Middle East, were Saudi Arabs in general less religious and their attitudes to issues such as democracy and arranged marriages reveal a moderate undertone.</seg>
<seg id=1187>Of course, religiosity in all four countries. In strong over 90% of respondents in that it gave to God, of life after death and in heaven and hell believe.</seg>
<seg id=1188>But the Saudis seem to be less religious than the Muslims in other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1189>In comparison to 82% of the Iranians, 85% of the Jordanians and 98% of the Egyptians to describe only 62% of the Saudis as religious.</seg>
<seg id=1190>The Americans seem to be far religious than the Saudi Arabs. In America declare, 81% as religious.</seg>
<seg id=1191>In part this may variations on country-specific differences due to be defined as religiosity.</seg>
<seg id=1192>Americans, for example, define religiosity perhaps unlike people from the Middle East. Americans may also have a weaker with to their faith as people in Islamic countries.</seg>
<seg id=1193>In part it may be differences between the Muslim countries be explained.</seg>
<seg id=1194>However, the gap in the even defined religiosity between the Saudis on one the jordaniern and Iranians, Egyptians and on the other hand so large that it is the prevailing idea of Saudi Arabia as a highly conservative and religious society into question.</seg>
<seg id=1195>Indeed, talks about the practice a clearer language as mere words: only 28% of Saudis gave in to participate, weekly gottesdiensten while 27% of 44%, Jordanians, Iranians, 42% of the Egyptians and 45% of the Americans to known.</seg>
<seg id=1196>Although these results of traditional perception of the Saudi culture contradict, they are less surprising than it appears.</seg>
<seg id=1197>Religionssoziologen have long argued that the overall religiosity declines if the environment is heavily dominated religious or if religious institutions too are associated with the state.</seg>
<seg id=1198>If state authorities strict verhaltensmaßregeln where, people tend to rebellion and distanzierung of officially sanktionierten religious institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1199>It is no surprise that Egyptians and Jordanians, in countries with no state-sponsored prescribed frömmigkeit life, religious, or as Iranians Saudi Arabs, supported by the state with a "tugendpolizei" to live.</seg>
<seg id=1200>Even on the issue before argued many Saudis surprising Liberal views.</seg>
<seg id=1201>On the question of marriage arrangierten arose an almost balanced. with half of those was that a before, struck among parents should be closed, while 48% love as a basis for a favored before.</seg>
<seg id=1202>Given the deep-rooted segregation and the dominance of the Patriarchate, this outcome a strong need for more individual choice in decisions to reveal that the traditional family fall.</seg>
<seg id=1203>After all, been the Saudis as strong advocates of democracy, which again in with the general idea of Saudi conservatism.</seg>
<seg id=1204>For 58% of respondents Saudis democracy is the best form of 23% were not this opinion and 18% said, not to.</seg>
<seg id=1205>That in a country where no secular nationalist and tradition, a majority for democracy happens, seems illogical.</seg>
<seg id=1206>In fact, the support for the democracy with a number of other liberal attitudes, combined, we in Saudi Arabia vorfanden.</seg>
<seg id=1207>Advocates of democracy tend to less religiosity, more säkularität, more tolerance, to a more critical assessment of the world and to greater concern about the Western kulturinvasion.</seg>
<seg id=1208>Beyond the surveys has over the history out that liberal ideas to gain popularity, if a country by a despotic monarch, the religious establishment is governed.</seg>
<seg id=1209>So, developed in the late 19th century in Ottoman Syria a strong liberal trend in response to the religious despotism of Sultan Abdulhamid.</seg>
<seg id=1210>At the same time, a antiklerikale entfaltete in Iran, secular movement in the name of the constitutionalism - in response to the absolutistische alliance between the Shah kadscharen dynasty and the religious establishment.</seg>
<seg id=1211>Given this similarities between historical precedents and the current situation in Saudi Arabia, we should not rule out the possibility of reform.</seg>
<seg id=1212>Today, umfragedaten show that the Saudis may well begin, greater transparency in the policies and a less interventionist religion to demand.</seg>
<seg id=1213>Museum Europe</seg>
<seg id=1214>In the late 19th century Europe regarded Asia largely either as a source of inspiration for his artists or as focus its imperial ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1215>The Asians on viewed Europe either, as in Japan during the Meiji time, as a model of modernity or, as in China as a barometer of verfalls.</seg>
<seg id=1216>A century later, the Japanese economic miracle picture of Europeans of at least a small part of Asia to a place technological and industrial progress transformed.</seg>
<seg id=1217>Is now, in the first years of the twenty-first century, changing the way in which Europe in Asia and Asia in Europe are perceived, sharply. Asia economies flourish and flourish, while the European Union a deep identity and zuversichtskrise experiencing</seg>
<seg id=1218>Prominent Asians as the former Prime Minister of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, warn Europeans now that, should they maintain their previous course -- Europe quickly in all areas, tourism and high-quality real estate will be irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id=1219>A well-known Chinese businessman, his time between Hong Kong and London aufteilt, said, even more.</seg>
<seg id=1220>In a private entrepreneurs and make leading politicians in Paris, a few weeks ago, he said: "you Europeans you developed to a third world country. your spend their time with the wrong issues -- Constitution, welfare, rentenkrise -- and their systematically give the wrong answers to that their aufwerft."</seg>
<seg id=1221>Europe's views of Asia in general and China in particular are complex and rich from a hellsichtigen adapting to a new competitors and respected, through to purely ideological justified rejection.</seg>
<seg id=1222>As in France in May 1968 the students the streets went to a new world to invent dreaming, they (or some of them at least) from the Maoist China -- a China, which, in the midst of the brutal and cultural revolution was pointless.</seg>
<seg id=1223>Their absurd and Baroque reminder betörtheit was as much a product of their ignorance of Mao's crimes as the result of boredom within a prosperous society, unemployment was virtually unknown.</seg>
<seg id=1224>By contrast, criticize their heirs now open the Asian capitalist model.</seg>
<seg id=1225>Yesterday was a China antikapitalistischer leitstern for utopian revolutionary; today, it has to an ultra-liberal nemesis for a new generation utopian reactionary developed, the defenders of the status quo in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1226>The recently in the streets of Paris demonstrating students do not be as Chinese and Indians; they reject the logic of globalization on and refuse to give up their hard-won social security.</seg>
<seg id=1227>Europe wirtschaftseliten take China and India very different true.</seg>
<seg id=1228>They are now fully aware that their easily nostalgische post-colonial view of these countries as a major export markets and comprehensive reservoirs cheap labor overtaken.</seg>
<seg id=1229>China and inden are to become real competitors, deserve respect, if not schiere ehrfurcht.</seg>
<seg id=1230>Quality, costs and lieferzeiten in automobilproduktion, rich now at the European level heran.</seg>
<seg id=1231>Europe has an advantage of theoretical sciences, for example, in the pharmaceutical industry, but the herausbildende weltklasseunternehmen especially in India are increasingly able to M.I.T. graduates from or from Harvard to recruit, and also their lower labor costs and thus to preserve their global competitiveness.</seg>
<seg id=1232>Unfortunately, the political leaders of Europe from Asia pressures, challenge, but it failed to recognize this as a realitätstest unwiderstehlichen within the process of globalization, and the social and economic terms, as waffenruf to use.</seg>
<seg id=1233>Indeed, among the view that European politicians, from a few exceptions, such as Tony Blair said, its view of the world too slowly, the revolutionary pace of change in Asia have adapted.</seg>
<seg id=1234>Caught between their lack of a long-term strategic vision and its obsession on short-term interests have, Europe's political leaders is largely failed to the respect of Asian colleagues to acquire, in contrast to the European companies, which in the Asians much angesehener.</seg>
<seg id=1235>Of course the EU will in Asia -- a continent, which is broadly failed to its past to bury the gespenstern of nationalism and the door to point out, often as a model of reconciliation, peace and prosperity,.</seg>
<seg id=1236>But is this perception survive if Europe's economic performance, those?</seg>
<seg id=1237>Perhaps the Asians will then come to the European model as a sort of political venedigs to see, a place to be visiting to its former nostalgic Glorie hinzugeben, and the nature of his museumsartigen admired.</seg>
<seg id=1238>The red and the blue</seg>
<seg id=1239>As Secretary of State Colin powells replacement by Condoleezza Rice shows that America's last presidential election remain strong nachhall generates.</seg>
<seg id=1240>But it is not only important for us to understand what this choice of America says, but also for the world.</seg>
<seg id=1241>This year's presidential election demonstrates that America has a healthy democracy has, but also that may be much better.</seg>
<seg id=1242>In contrast to the election of 2000, at the President Bush failed and the majority vote in the electoral college barely won siegte it, this time with a margin of 3.5 million votes.</seg>
<seg id=1243>Although some Democrats still bitter, there are a few serious doubts about the legitimacy of Bush's victory.</seg>
<seg id=1244>America remains divided in red States (Republicans) and blue States (Democrats).</seg>
<seg id=1245>If the 100,000 votes in red Ohio State would be changed John Kerry President (though with a minority of the votes).</seg>
<seg id=1246>The electoral college was in America's constitution, to small States in a federal system to protect, it means now, however, that the campaign, above all, about a dozen umkämpfte States focused in which public opinion is divided.</seg>
<seg id=1247>A more grundlegenderes problem is that it seems unschicklich, President without the majority of votes to vote.</seg>
<seg id=1248>So it is time for a serious discussion of a Constitution to the abolition of wahlmännergremiums.</seg>
<seg id=1249>Some observers also complain about the polarisierende, negative rhetoric and advertising, the campaign charakterisierten.</seg>
<seg id=1250>But this should be seen from a historical perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1251>At a time of the founding fathers were newspapers extremely biased, George Washington was dismayed at the as the political language.</seg>
<seg id=1252>In its early history was the country for a long time in as scarce majorities divided as today, without, at the time of the war and reconstruction to the widespread rhetoric of the campaign, of how closely the competition was.</seg>
<seg id=1253>While the three languages nationally broadcast debate despite the negative wahlwerbung both sides points in a serious format, and were much circles.</seg>
<seg id=1254>In general, it is likely that a President in growing economy re-elected.</seg>
<seg id=1255>In this sense, surprised to Bush's re-election, as low his majority was.</seg>
<seg id=1256>In essence, this is the unpopularity of the Iraq war due</seg>
<seg id=1257>Kerry tried to the war, the slow job creation, the inadequate health and Bush's tax cuts for groups with higher incomes to the central points of the campaign to make, but had some observers sense that it was never a clear message.</seg>
<seg id=1258>Bush konterte with concerns about terrorism and with kulturpopulismus on issues such as homo before and abtreibungsrecht.</seg>
<seg id=1259>In the end stachen security and the kulturpopulismus wirtschaftspopulismus.</seg>
<seg id=1260>The interpretation of the vote, by (after the voting) conducted surveys influences in which voters were issues that need them most.</seg>
<seg id=1261>Most (22%) replied, "moral values" compared to 20%, the economy, called and 19%, the terrorism anführten.</seg>
<seg id=1262>Conservative sozialpolitiker interpretierten these results so that they have won the election for Bush and that their program its next term should dominate.</seg>
<seg id=1263>But a Pew poll indicated, a week after the elections, which suggests that the category "moral values", and a long before abtreibungsrecht homo subject included.</seg>
<seg id=1264>Indeed, polls show that 25% of the population before the Homo support and 35% legal eheähnliche communities for homosexual couples (by Kerry position) support.</seg>
<seg id=1265>Yet applies to the 37%, against the Homo before are, especially in the center of the country that issue to mobilize the Bush supporters for the elections contributed.</seg>
<seg id=1266>An important question is whether the US hopelessly divided.</seg>
<seg id=1267>The geographical wahlkarte with red and blue States led to Internet witzen and comics on the two shores of the blue from red abspalten center of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1268>Some call this "coastopia.</seg>
<seg id=1269>The separation, however, is not so clear.</seg>
<seg id=1270>On both sides, many states only by a narrow majority, färbt. It the card at the level of landkreise, not a Europe of States, much of the country's more from violet.</seg>
<seg id=1271>"cities against suburbs and rural areas" describes the conditions better than coast center "against".</seg>
<seg id=1272>Indeed, public opinion polls show that the most Americans moderate in the middle of the political spectrum gaining, and not to the external two rändern.</seg>
<seg id=1273>But tend political elites, such as, for example, parteiaktivisten and kongressmitglieder to extreme to be as the public.</seg>
<seg id=1274>This seems at first confusing, as an incentive for them to be in the stimmenreichen in moving.</seg>
<seg id=1275>But many kongressmitglieder represent districts, for their parties are safe, and their re-election is by innerparteiliche elections at risk by aktivistischeren and extremeren parteiflügeln dominated.</seg>
<seg id=1276>This tendency is reinforced by the spread of kabelfernsehens spectators, what with controversial "Infotainment" anlockt broadcasts, and by Internet bloggers to bitter controversies without any wording filters in.</seg>
<seg id=1277>Reforms to the limits of kongressbezirke to competition, to strengthen them, would improve the problem but few are acting kongressabgeordnete for changes, the risk of defeat may increase.</seg>
<seg id=1278>The scarce result suggests that Bush less for change was elected, as he seems to believe.</seg>
<seg id=1279>Given the difficult issues of foreign, fiscal and social policy, it would be wise to him, the more the center address when his conservative basis to appease. But remains unclear whether or not a policy of beliefs or of pragmatism will enforce.</seg>
<seg id=1280>Liberation of dependence on oil</seg>
<seg id=1281>Chancellor Angela Merkel, the thematisierung climate change high priority on Germany's agenda for his EU and G8 presidencies priority to start in January.</seg>
<seg id=1282>Here is a concrete proposal, so that the general political leaders worldwide him to consider and to accept and so clear that other governments and companies to him: can simply next G-8 a date will, on the benzinbetriebene cars in large industrialized countries are no longer allowed.</seg>
<seg id=1283>Such a decision would have a clearly positive economic and geopolitical impact.</seg>
<seg id=1284>The real reason for today's energiesorgen are not about the global reserves, but rather that the domestic output by spitzenverbraucher -- Europe, the United States and China, just at the moment is falling in which the growing Asian demand the market pressure.</seg>
<seg id=1285>Available reserves will increasingly be concentrated in the Middle East, because in all the other regions simply faster exhausted.</seg>
<seg id=1286>Moreover, the big ölexporteure are not prepared to subordinate their policy the needs of the market.</seg>
<seg id=1287>Saudi Arabia is to its oil production independent policy, while Iran potential investors with bureaucratic obstacles and discourage corruption.</seg>
<seg id=1288>Iraq is suffering from a lack of security and foreign investors in Russia is constantly a net by and made</seg>
<seg id=1289>These four States have half the world's oil reserves and confirmed two-thirds of what potentially could be exported.</seg>
<seg id=1290>All of this, not the production costs, is the high oil prices and the struggle for ölverträge in Central Asia and Africa of.</seg>
<seg id=1291>On the assumption that high oil prices are good, because they serve the environment, be some basic facts international politics overlooked.</seg>
<seg id=1292>First, on oil imports in many of the poorest African and Asian countries a significantly higher proportion of spending from than in developed countries, which means that economic and social development are at risk, while the new schuldenkrisen horizon.</seg>
<seg id=1293>Returns from oil production of reform in the big exporting countries.</seg>
<seg id=1294>Thanks to their geölten financial strength feel regimes such as those in Venezuela and in Iran less and less tied to international rules.</seg>
<seg id=1295>Laggard verbrauchenden among nations, such as China, are known, on violations of human rights overlooking a lucrative business with authoritarian, oil-rich regime to secure and imitieren as the former habits of the industrial West.</seg>
<seg id=1296>Only the political and economic heavyweights in the world, the big industrial to continue by far the largest consumers of hydrocarbons, can a change on a global scale set in motion.</seg>
<seg id=1297>The change in the transport sector must begin, for about half of the current ölverbrauchs responsible -- a share in the future will likely rise.</seg>
<seg id=1298>The G8 countries should, therefore, to agree on the by 2025, no new benzinbetriebene allow cars.</seg>
<seg id=1299>This decision would not be against the individual as mobility, but against the waste of a scarce raw, the urgent is needed to synthetic materials to.</seg>
<seg id=1300>The political leaders should not certain technology prefer.</seg>
<seg id=1301>Instead, they should create incentives for the industry to develop alternative technologies on fuel from biomass, ethylen, hydrogen and during a transition even natural gas based.</seg>
<seg id=1302>Countries that a political lead, be the domestic industry, as value, a leadership in the future and give energietechnologie markets.</seg>
<seg id=1303>The likely significant reduction in CO2 emissions may finally bring the breakthrough, in international climate policy.</seg>
<seg id=1304>But also economic development comes into play: the cure "our dependence on oil," the poorer, less developed countries, and more of the, as well as prices downward push and the geopolitical energiewettbewerb defuse.</seg>
<seg id=1305>Geopolitical benefits would be equally obviously, because the ability of the great ölexporteure developed countries to blackmail much lower.</seg>
<seg id=1306>This may the negotiating position of the international community in the Middle East and may improve the social forces in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia, strengthen the serious political and economic reforms from seek.</seg>
<seg id=1307>As technologically hochentwickeltes country and one of the large manufacturers Germany is well placed to bring about such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id=1308>Merkel, physics promoviert and their political career as environment has begun, it led in 1995 in the chair at the first meeting of the UN framework convention on climate, which address the credibility of this issue perhaps more than any other EU and G8 their colleagues.</seg>
<seg id=1309>The time for a courageous act from the leadership has come out.</seg>
<seg id=1310>The myth of trade and aid</seg>
<seg id=1311>Trade and aid are to international modewörtern become.</seg>
<seg id=1312>More aid (including debt) and more access to the markets of rich countries products from poor countries seem to be at the top of the global agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1313>In fact revolves around the current debate is not about what should be done, but how far and how fast it should be done.</seg>
<seg id=1314>These are the clear lessons from the past five decades of economic development lost.</seg>
<seg id=1315>The most of this is that economic development for the most part in the hands of poor nations themselves.</seg>
<seg id=1316>Countries that good services provided in the recent past, have schafften this own effort.</seg>
<seg id=1317>Aid and access have rarely played a decisive role.</seg>
<seg id=1318>Take a developing country that about a favored and free access to its greatest neighbors has, happened to be the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1319>Consider, moreover, the country of millions of citizens as workers can send over the border, the volume of foreign investment in international and a fully integrated production chains.</seg>
<seg id=1320>Moreover, the country's banking system is proven by the willingness of rich neighbours supported, in the worst as creditors einzuspringen.</seg>
<seg id=1321>Much better globalization can hardly be, or?</seg>
<seg id=1322>We now take a second country.</seg>
<seg id=1323>This is a country with handelsembargo in the face of the world's biggest market, will be neither foreign aid nor any other support from the West, is excluded from international organizations such as the WTO and is stopped, the IMF and the World Bank borrow.</seg>
<seg id=1324>As this would not as external schwächend enough, will this economy and even their own high barriers to international trade maintain (in the form of State trade, import duties and quantitative).</seg>
<seg id=1325>As the readers may guess have, it is real countries: Mexico and Vietnam.</seg>
<seg id=1326>Mexico, over 3 000 km shares a border with the United States, which not only for a privileged access to, and that workers, but also for a claim on the resources of the US Treasury (which during the peso crisis 1995 was clearly).</seg>
<seg id=1327>America to 1994, received a handelsembargo against Vietnam in 1995, was only maintain diplomatic contacts, and admitted Vietnamese imports more years later, no nation.</seg>
<seg id=1328>Vietnam is still of the WTO ruled out.</seg>
<seg id=1329>We now see their performance in.</seg>
<seg id=1330>Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed in December 1992, Mexico's economy on average to little more than 1% per capita and per year has grown.</seg>
<seg id=1331>This value is not just below the growth of economic superstars Asia, it is also only a fraction of Mexico's own wachstumsleistung in the decades, the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).</seg>
<seg id=1332>Vietnam's economy is, however, between the start of economic reform in 1988 and inclusion of diplomatic relations with the US in 1995 to 5.6% per year per capita has grown, since it is growing in the rapid pace of 4.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1333>Vietnam has seen a dramatic reduction in poverty in Mexico, while the real wages have fallen.</seg>
<seg id=1334>Both countries recorded a sharp rise in international trade and for foreign investment, but, there are, where most matters, completely different: in the images of living standards, particularly for the poor.</seg>
<seg id=1335>These examples show that a country's own effort to be economic fate is more crucial than anything.</seg>
<seg id=1336>Every chance of the market in Mexico, could the effects of political mistake at home, particularly not outweigh the failure to appreciate the peso reversing the real exchange rate, and the inability to the in a small range of exportaktivitäten gained productivity gains on extending the rest of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1337>The most It is to that a country chooses the right strategy for growth.</seg>
<seg id=1338>There is no benefits of Mexico's Vietnam pursued a strategy, which the focused, its economy to broad subjects and the indigenous providers to increase capacity.</seg>
<seg id=1339>The more experience of the post-war supports the conclusion that the internal policy is most important.</seg>
<seg id=1340>South Korea, the breakthrough in the early 1960s, not as the foreign aid in their levels were, but gradually, as it were.</seg>
<seg id=1341>Taiwan received no foreign aid or privileged access.</seg>
<seg id=1342>China and India, the economic superstars today thrive, above all, its own reform.</seg>
<seg id=1343>It is tempting, the few African successes, Botswana and Mauritius, the auslandsnachfrage after their exports (diamonds or clothing) to, but is the story because at the end.</seg>
<seg id=1344>It would be both countries without access to foreign markets much poorer.</seg>
<seg id=1345>But, as in other cases of successful development, it is not their external benefits that it from other abheben, but it is their ability to these benefits to use.</seg>
<seg id=1346>Consider only the ruins, the other countries from its wealth of natural resources have made.</seg>
<seg id=1347>In Sierra Leone calls the word "diamond" hardly images of peace and prosperity in.</seg>
<seg id=1348>Similarly, few of free industriezonen, which will in the world, the results produced on Mauritius were observed.</seg>
<seg id=1349>None of this dismisses the rich from their responsibility to help.</seg>
<seg id=1350>They can make the world for corrupt dictators unfreundlicher, such as by more information exchange and international treaties that dictators sign, not accept.</seg>
<seg id=1351>As would a rise in the number of workers from poor countries, the rich countries must work, and a more room for a growth-oriented policy by a relaxation of the WTO and the dependence on the US in the long run better on the development impact.</seg>
<seg id=1352>It is far from clear that an extension of the market and the range of hilfsmitteln the productive use of wertvollem political capital out of the North.</seg>
<seg id=1353>Development should, not on trade and aid focus, but to improve the political environment in poor countries.</seg>
<seg id=1354>Who is now of who on?</seg>
<seg id=1355>If the great economist Argentine Raul prebisch still alive, he would have no doubt whether the world for head is.</seg>
<seg id=1356>His enormously powerful "dependenztheorie" came with the expectation that the poor countries that are dependent on too rohstoffexporte, never the industrial penetration to achieve the for sustainable economic growth.</seg>
<seg id=1357>Instead, they are in a global cycle Falling commodity and steadily falling einkommensanteile caught.</seg>
<seg id=1358>Prebischs. political response to the protectionism, proved for many Latin American and African countries to his views anschlossen as catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id=1359>The fact is that prebisch over many years, with regard to the long-term trends in the rohstoffpreisen seemed to be right.</seg>
<seg id=1360>Erbarmungslose effizienzsteigerungen in agriculture and in the reduction of natural resources drückten the commodity downward, particularly during the 1980's and 1990's.</seg>
<seg id=1361>Apart from a few rare exceptions, developed economy, the countries which focused on rohstoffexporte, pathetic, while many rohstoffarme Asian countries forward pushed for.</seg>
<seg id=1362>But today, where Asian giants, India and China, in the world economy has explode prices are, oil, gold, wheat and virtually all other raw materials.</seg>
<seg id=1363>While it will always be cycles, oil prices, for example, will probably fall, before they start to rise again, but the long-term trend -- for many raw materials is clearly for a long time to show up.</seg>
<seg id=1364>What many of the actors in the trade and other policymakers seem to have not yet understood, although prebisch it immediately have recognized, is that these dramatic turn of events huge impact on the global balance of forces entails.</seg>
<seg id=1365>Indeed, probably no other aspect of globalization the leaders of our world in the coming decades, major challenges.</seg>
<seg id=1366>The issues that are, are varied.</seg>
<seg id=1367>The rich countries are ready for a few days of our era of kodependenz which they desperately need raw materials, even less than the developing countries the industrieimporte and technology?</seg>
<seg id=1368>They are ready for the inevitable flow of power and influence towards the materials, now that these far richer?</seg>
<seg id=1369>How are the two global superpowers, China and the US to deal with the fact that important rohstoffexportierende -- regions of Africa, the Middle East, through to central Asia, with bad zusammengesetzten nation states are littered?</seg>
<seg id=1370>Some even prophets, appointed by the problem as a limited natural resources, and in which the world with alarming rate critical ausgingen raw materials.</seg>
<seg id=1371>There are many supporters of today's hubbert schen theory of production which says that we have reached the upper limit of förderkapazitäten that austrocknen sources and that from now on, all worse.</seg>
<seg id=1372>However, as the leading ölhistoriker Dan yergin out, have the prophets of the sinking already at least four stated that the world oil ausginge.</seg>
<seg id=1373>Every time radical technological advances have led to this threat in air auflöste.</seg>
<seg id=1374>At the end of the 19th century, oil production, maultiere for ausschachtungen used.</seg>
<seg id=1375>Today, no one thinks, something the 3,000 feet under the bed, oil bohren.</seg>
<seg id=1376>Similar progress has, in the area of agriculture and metallbergbaus everywhere.</seg>
<seg id=1377>No, the world is not that that their raw materials out.</seg>
<seg id=1378>Instead, what happens is that the inclusion of two and a half billion people (in China and India) alone in the world economy a nachfrageveränderung that, to a far stronger aufwärtsdruck on commodity prices to when it will all technological progress may be offset.</seg>
<seg id=1379>That is why the commodity prices rise -- at least for the next 50 to 75 years, and perhaps to people sometime in the next centuries of mining on Mars.</seg>
<seg id=1380>Will the resulting herrührende education a new balance of economic power politics destabilize?</seg>
<seg id=1381>The first world war was clearly caused partly by Germany's fears that the other colonial too, a large proportion of the world's oil and rohstoffvorräte secure.</seg>
<seg id=1382>Similarly, feared World War II, Japan to the stability of supplies of oil and other natural resources from abroad.</seg>
<seg id=1383>Be similar tensions between the resource-poor China (where even of water is a problem) and the West are?</seg>
<seg id=1384>Fortunately, this is not likely, especially given the deal and pragmatic approach of the Chinese resolving their ressourcenprobleme.</seg>
<seg id=1385>The Chinese by in the direction of regions such as Africa and hope that stable trading.</seg>
<seg id=1386>They do not share the political sendungsbewusstsein the Americans, not simply with the rohstoffexporteuren trade, but they also the true belief bekehren want.</seg>
<seg id=1387>Then there are the American leaders who still say that the US, with regard to the independent energy.</seg>
<seg id=1388>But this is all in a joke: unmäßig they may be, they will never.</seg>
<seg id=1389>Understandably, much of the Arab world the invasion of Iraq as a cornerstone of real US strategy, the stability of their energy.</seg>
<seg id=1390>If this is true, is only to be hoped that America has a plan B has.</seg>
<seg id=1391>In the meantime, the commodity prices continue to rise, while the ölexporteure now the largest amount of America klaffendem deficit.</seg>
<seg id=1392>Perhaps there is real strategy of us, is to so high debt in the rohstoffexportierenden countries make that they feel forced to America at whim to hold?</seg>
<seg id=1393>But this is a phrase that prebisch never foresaw.</seg>
<seg id=1394>Hard line in the elections in Iran</seg>
<seg id=1395>The choice of hardliners known as mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, next to the President of Iran is likely to worsen relations with the West and the international isolation of the country.</seg>
<seg id=1396>What the internal affairs concerned, this is still the Islamist regime certainly better than a moderateres result.</seg>
<seg id=1397>Ahmadinejad has clearly a broad basis of supporters.</seg>
<seg id=1398>But the fact that he a populist campaign led, spoke, to help the poor, the benefits of government and condemned, almost as a candidate opposition aufführte is irrelevant: he was the choice of the regime, and in the end he received even rival against other representatives of the hard line among the candidates official aid.</seg>
<seg id=1399>The regime has be tide excellent played.</seg>
<seg id=1400>It was the something more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani, with some of the current political measures did not agree, as a figure of "establishment" to and made its own man to rebel.</seg>
<seg id=1401>The government used to the anti establishment sense to its own rule to the new.</seg>
<seg id=1402>The fact that the last, President Mohammed Khatami, a supporters of reform movement was, though a schüchterner, nothing ultimately reached, that the only, as will the rulers, the political situation umgekrempelt.</seg>
<seg id=1403>Ahmadinejad is a representative of recent activists of the revolution against the Shah a quarter-century.</seg>
<seg id=1404>He was directly the kidnapping of American hostage in Iran, although the exact extent of its involvement remains controversial.</seg>
<seg id=1405>Most concerned by the fact that it is close to the two groups, the main representatives of the most extreme elements in Iran are: the Guards Corps of the Islamic revolution and the basidsch organization.</seg>
<seg id=1406>The first is a parallel, regimetreue army, the second an organization to intimidation of opponents and everyone else who seek a more open society.</seg>
<seg id=1407>Yet, the concern that an even more radical leadership in Iran has come to power by two factors abgemildert.</seg>
<seg id=1408>First, Ahmadinejad will probably Affairs and try to focus on the living standards of the poorest Iranians -- raise with what success is unclear.</seg>
<seg id=1409>Secondly, the same group, since the revolution in power, is the ideology and foreign essentially continue.</seg>
<seg id=1410>The President has less power, as it seems, and, above all, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei overshadowed.</seg>
<seg id=1411>Nevertheless, the election of Ahmadinejad makes it quite clear what a challenge for Iran to Western policy and stability in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1412>First it signals, above all, the most extreme elements in Iran and the terrorist customers country (the Lebanese Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad, as well as the various small groups, the war in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries action) that it the green light for attacks.</seg>
<seg id=1413>They are likely to that Iran supports it, whatever they do.</seg>
<seg id=1414>Outside, Iran is often relatively cautious secretly, but he is the world's leading terrorsponsor.</seg>
<seg id=1415>Sometimes have individual Iranian officials may go it alone in certain operations ordered and coordinated, now, they are still feel free to do so.</seg>
<seg id=1416>Moreover, Ahmadinejad open the Iranian crash program for the production of nuclear weapons.</seg>
<seg id=1417>Most Iranian leaders -- at least those who allowed by the government, was open to work, to support the program, but a calmer and vorsichtigere action before.</seg>
<seg id=1418>Rafsanjani was, for example, to build better economic relations with the West over a arrived on the nuclear front.</seg>
<seg id=1419>With nuclear as President Ahmadinejad of Iran is more likely that the weapons to bizarre way used.</seg>
<seg id=1420>This does not mean that they would he abfeuern, but rather that he they may, for the purpose of diplomatic use blackmail and thus threats to the crisis will increase.</seg>
<seg id=1421>Because the Iranian leaders daily their desire to explain Israel off the map auszuradieren and the us to fight (Ahmadinejad was on its way to voting on a picture of American flag), has increased the risk of confrontation.</seg>
<seg id=1422>After all, Ahmadinejad will probably, stability in Iraq on dreistere way undermined, and his victory is radical Iranian officials and extremists in Iraq itself encourage.</seg>
<seg id=1423>Iran sent already agents in Iraq and supported customers, the country in a clone transformed want.</seg>
<seg id=1424>The Iraqis, including the Shiite Muslims that same direction of Islam annexes as the Iranians to reject such interference on general.</seg>
<seg id=1425>A militantere Iran's attitude, the reibereien with Iraq may reinforce and where other anti-American in violence.</seg>
<seg id=1426>In short, the outcome of the elections in Iran is dangerous, even though its exact destabilizing effect will ultimately depend on how the Ahmadinejad, and how much power of leader of him.</seg>
<seg id=1427>Moreover, in dealing with Iran, the so extremely open and even to the standards of the uncompromising regime by radically, not only for the us a challenge, but also for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1428>Are European countries try to act as if militant Ahmadinejad's rhetoric and provocations care and may as a diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear ambitions be found?</seg>
<seg id=1429>With Rafsanjani it would have been easy, a real agreements or the appearance of cooperation maintain.</seg>
<seg id=1430>But with a high degree of appeasement Ahmadinejad will be needed to even the smallest diplomatic processes continue.</seg>
<seg id=1431>Some Iranian reformers and exiles, the election of Ahmadinejad with the argument about Nice that his government probably shows the true face of the regime and all western hopes a compromise destroyed.</seg>
<seg id=1432>But can also to the success of the regime to reflect the discontent over a quarter of a century radical Islamic rule to neutralize.</seg>
<seg id=1433>Regardless of the outcome means Ahmadinejad's victory that everything that has to do with Iran, likely even more difficult.</seg>
<seg id=1434>From the poor to the rich give</seg>
<seg id=1435>President Bush seems to be to America's budget for years to come to zerrütten.</seg>
<seg id=1436>In President Bush's office saw it as far as the eye enough only budget surpluses.</seg>
<seg id=1437>Now threatening the haushaltshorizont huge deficits, as a result of irresponsible gemisches from that of the Republicans introduced tax, from kränkeln the economy, the bubble of börsenblase and a huge increase in defense spending.</seg>
<seg id=1438>It is even worse, because Bush administration and Congress under the leadership of the Republicans are the haushaltsmisere further to.</seg>
<seg id=1439>The damage they cause, the will, the US is likely to weaken and uncertainty to the world economy.</seg>
<seg id=1440>Traditionally was for America's Republican Party for balanced budgets.</seg>
<seg id=1441>The changed under the Reagan administration. below him Treaty conservative Republicans tax, at the cost of large budget deficits.</seg>
<seg id=1442>President Reagan promised of America's population as tax cuts and military hochrüstung and the continuation of them favored spending and all while.</seg>
<seg id=1443>The result - not surprising - was a huge deficits, beanspruchte them back years.</seg>
<seg id=1444>Both President George Bush, both senj. as well as Bill Clinton, had new taxes to the legacy of Reagan era auszumisten.</seg>
<seg id=1445>The tax were probably complicity of President Bush's senj. defeat to Bill Clinton in 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1446>Yet decided Clinton brave, on the way to a balanced budget weiterzuschreiten. He did this in part, to the funding of pensions safeguard social programs.</seg>
<seg id=1447>When Clinton in 2000 from office schied, was the fiscal the best for decades.</seg>
<seg id=1448>Then appeared President George Bush Jr. on to Reagan revived, with comprehensive, huge tax cuts and military spending increases in the continuation or even expansion of popular spending.</seg>
<seg id=1449>The result was predictable.</seg>
<seg id=1450>In January 2001, the cumulative haushaltsergebnis for the years 2002 to 2011, overall 5.6 trillion dollar surplus estimated.</seg>
<seg id=1451>Already in 2002, this had planned verflüchtigt surpluses.</seg>
<seg id=1452>In the face of the shadow economy, and the possible war in Iraq vorauswirft, have been expected, the Bush administration and Congress under the leadership of the republicans went with recommendations further cuts to careful.</seg>
<seg id=1453>But no, you are their priority is to further tax cuts for the rich above all to the good.</seg>
<seg id=1454>While the government calls a zunahmen in the military.</seg>
<seg id=1455>Now the focus again after the presidential elections in November 2004, zuwendet will certainly meaningful third the non-military spending to be made.</seg>
<seg id=1456>It seems so that it is in the massive deficits will remain.</seg>
<seg id=1457>Even if the domestic spending to the same share of nationaleinkommen maintain, may, the cumulative haushaltsergebnis over the next ten years a deficit of 1.5 trillion dollars you.</seg>
<seg id=1458>But this number may still to be optimistic, because they are likely to the cost of a possible Iraq war not sufficiently, not another round of tax and not risk higher interest rates in the years ahead.</seg>
<seg id=1459>Why do the Republicans so little worried about the mess that they cause?</seg>
<seg id=1460>Some Republicans are tax cuts for the rich more important than almost anything.</seg>
<seg id=1461>Others believe that high deficits, to greater abstrichen in domestic government spending force and so reduce the influence of state what they really want to heart.</seg>
<seg id=1462>The problem of the latter view is that most taxpayers the domestic programs commitments and they therefore greater ausgabenbeschränkungen not easily support.</seg>
<seg id=1463>A much spannendere question is: why do the Americans for such political programs, when they know that they are likely to be in difficulties.</seg>
<seg id=1464>An answer says that many voters would the impending problems simply not.</seg>
<seg id=1465>A better answer points out that really most Americans not for such programs voted.</seg>
<seg id=1466>The turnout at the elections in 2002 was only 40% of the votes cast accounted for about half of the Republicans, so only about 20% of the voters.</seg>
<seg id=1467>Of course, the prospects not so dismal.</seg>
<seg id=1468>The war in Iraq can be prevented.</seg>
<seg id=1469>The proposed tax cuts can social or be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=1470>But I am huge deficits in the coming years ahead and a in the US and abroad growing unease at the aggregate situation in America.</seg>
<seg id=1471>Foreign investors should decide to America's twin fiscal and deficits not continue to finance so favorable conditions to want.</seg>
<seg id=1472>The dollar is weakening, and may be inflationsängste clearer hervortreten.</seg>
<seg id=1473>All of this, the US politicians less selbstsicher and flexibly to respond to economic shocks.</seg>
<seg id=1474>The poor and in the US, as well as abroad be most suffer when President Bush and the American Congress of the people and the world will tell that because of the large budget deficits is no money to the problems of poverty and the health and education to address.</seg>
<seg id=1475>If ordinary Americans not wake up the haushaltsrisiken not seriously, can the rich, with a gift of many billions of dollars to, while the country and the world in the coming years of hard to bear the consequences.</seg>
<seg id=1476>The lessons of the fiscal unbesonnenheit of the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1477>George W. Bush has more than any other President in American history has done, the economic policies of the US to, and has even his mentor Ronald Reagan than.</seg>
<seg id=1478>Only three years in office, he has a fragile political consensus destroyed, to establish a decade long, and the return to build another decade may take.</seg>
<seg id=1479>So, Bush America's long-term economic health and social stability put at risk.</seg>
<seg id=1480>As the long-term challenges for the budget, the US as catastrophic manage not to be unusually, from America's fiscal schnitzern important lessons for other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1481>The main problem of monetary policy is that the leaders of tax and an increase in public spending easily a temporary increase its popularity can bring, by huge state debts, then the future abzutragen reserved remains.</seg>
<seg id=1482>This can offer a few years work; sooner rather than later, however, impose rising deficits and debt a painful political U-turn.</seg>
<seg id=1483>A cynically politicians but can so his re-election erkaufen and is perhaps the onset of the crisis, in retirement.</seg>
<seg id=1484>It should think that voters to world hundreds of such episodes fiscal irresponsibility in recent decades allergic to this type of tricks would react.</seg>
<seg id=1485>Bush, however, is again by it: he bought, today's popularity by huge steuergeschenke distributed and also the military and even to increase spending on education and health.</seg>
<seg id=1486>The result is a deficit of more than 5% of GNP.</seg>
<seg id=1487>Worse is that the long-term prospects for the American budget already worrying, before Bush unbesonnene began its policy.</seg>
<seg id=1488>The average age of the population is to us; hence the for the future steiler a rise in the cost and public health in the pensions.</seg>
<seg id=1489>Careful calculations show that the Bush favorisierten fiscal erzielbaren future revenues the cost of pensions, health care and other public expected of public spending likely to many below 10 trillion dollars.</seg>
<seg id=1490>At some point in the future, so a strong increase in taxes, deep cuts in the public spending or both together needed to Bush's actions to correct.</seg>
<seg id=1491>So why advocates the public his policy?</seg>
<seg id=1492>The reason is that the public interest or little understanding for this long-term consequences aufbringt, although ultimately most Americans, they suffer.</seg>
<seg id=1493>The richest taxpayers are satisfied, because they benefit most from these cuts.</seg>
<seg id=1494>It is incredible, but nearly half of the 5% tax is the richest among us taxpayers benefited, and these are taxpayers expect obvious that the other 95% - the middle class, and the poor - most of the future ausgabesenkungen and tax to bear.</seg>
<seg id=1495>Meanwhile, Bush many voters from the middle class, and convinced that they can be satisfied - without them to say that it for their small tax with much larger cuts in future benefits State will have to pay if the policy of his government, prevails in the long run.</seg>
<seg id=1496>The Americans have a political memory, so that they would be them, fiscal ,achterbahnfahrt "over the past 20 years have already experienced.</seg>
<seg id=1497>When Ronald Reagan was elected, he promised also massive cuts and a substantial increase military spending.</seg>
<seg id=1498>The result was a huge deficit in the mid-1980's.</seg>
<seg id=1499>The cuts made Reagan enormously popular and contributed to his re-election in 1984.</seg>
<seg id=1500>It then took over a decade - of Reagan's second term about the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George Bush Sen. - to the budget deficit, in a surplus to turn.</seg>
<seg id=1501>Of course made this approval of new tax to be what George Bush's re-election Sen. cost and to the political landscape of the 1990's polarized led.</seg>
<seg id=1502>The story will be almost certainly repeat.</seg>
<seg id=1503>Some right-wing ideologues within the Bush administration believe that the budget deficits of days ultimately deep cuts in the public spending force.</seg>
<seg id=1504>They hope to a dismantling of programs as Social Security, Medicare.</seg>
<seg id=1505>In the American public, enjoy these social programs broad support.</seg>
<seg id=1506>The strategy of political rights, the first to lower taxes to then cuts in the social programmes to force, will fail, and that is why the taxes will ultimately have to rise again.</seg>
<seg id=1507>Others within the Bush Administration argue that cuts are important to the US out of the recession.</seg>
<seg id=1508>This argument is wrong.</seg>
<seg id=1509>America's economy could, without this tax recovered, perhaps even sustainable.</seg>
<seg id=1510>Independent hiervon, it is a huge mistake, a long-term fiscal policy on short-term business cycle.</seg>
<seg id=1511>For other countries, there are two basic this lessons.</seg>
<seg id=1512>The first is that the emerging deficits of the US sooner or later, America's international influence limits.</seg>
<seg id=1513>The Americans have therefore only support the Iraq war, because it not with tax had to pay.</seg>
<seg id=1514>As soon as the Americans have to decide whether to their auslandsabenteuer by higher taxes to finance, be it in much less willing to teuere operations abroad.</seg>
<seg id=1515>In fact, in the wake of the public debate about the Bush hinterlassene fiscal chaos to a deep world internal division of the US.</seg>
<seg id=1516>The second lesson is that the countries rising costs of an aging population caused, in their haushaltsplanungen should take into account.</seg>
<seg id=1517>The long-term fiscal is often neither the taxpayers nor Parliament aware of it.</seg>
<seg id=1518>Governments should be obliged to together with their annual haushaltsentwürfen long-term assessments of the budget to to the tendency towards short-term, politically motivated manipulation of budget counter.</seg>
<seg id=1519>The US can other countries as early warning.</seg>
<seg id=1520>The White House should other the same reminder to which magicians on television viewers to their: ,versuchen, they do not home. "</seg>
<seg id=1521>Political stock</seg>
<seg id=1522>Many economic and financial analysts complain that the markets of emerging markets often heavily from their governments and politically manipulated would rather than konjunkturell are.</seg>
<seg id=1523>By contrast, seems to believe in the developed aktienmärkten unausgesprochen to insist that the original force driven by an economic nature, and a forecast their wertentwicklung thus with a forecast for trees comparable.</seg>
<seg id=1524>This description of aktienmärkten in developing countries is not only wrong, this, because the same description of exchanges in developed countries is.</seg>
<seg id=1525>The best analysts know that a prognosis of the stock market wertentwicklung each essentially means predict how well it investors in the stock market, the will of the government's current political environment is ergehen.</seg>
<seg id=1526>Take the stock of the United States, by far the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id=1527>The general view to remain companies by the government and the unbehelligt returns on capital in the US exchange reflect the basic forces of a capitalist economic system.</seg>
<seg id=1528>This is one of the reasons why the us a magnetische appeal to portfolio investors around the world over.</seg>
<seg id=1529>But the profits, the American börsenmärkte so attractive, are the expression of a sensitive political balance.</seg>
<seg id=1530>In particular, the tax stocks have influence, under the veränderndem political pressure over the time from.</seg>
<seg id=1531>So, for example, during the second world war political support for large nachgelassen wealth and the government, the taxes on gains, dividends and high incomes in general sharply increased.</seg>
<seg id=1532>As World War II comprehensive recovery of the Great Depression of dreißigerjahre was raised, President Roosevelt and Congress a tax on excessive profits, in order to ensure that shareholders not too much benefit.</seg>
<seg id=1533>In 1980, however, when there is no war, the stock market, but in a talsohle was, chose the US voters Ronald Reagan, a man who, for very many of the right wing angehörig was to President to be.</seg>
<seg id=1534>He called for - and reached - tax on gains, dividends and income.</seg>
<seg id=1535>Political interference in the stock market does not only on taxes on gains, dividends and income.</seg>
<seg id=1536>Vermögensteuer, tax, duties and VAT - all the direct or indirect of companies - can be paid in erweitertem of profits on the stock market and are.</seg>
<seg id=1537>Wherever they thrive markets, it is no accident that governments to see these taxes are not so far to profits for withdrawal of taxes to destroy.</seg>
<seg id=1538>The politics of markets hear in the taxes not on.</seg>
<seg id=1539>On the contrary, almost every regierungsaktivität has on profits on the stock market, and in exchange.</seg>
<seg id=1540>After börsenkrach in 1929 was the US government many activities from the competition authorities and made it possible to gain monopoly companies to increase their value.</seg>
<seg id=1541>These policies delayed the recovery of high unemployment, but even the enough not enough to rein in the political forces to keep that in favor of the stock were mobilized.</seg>
<seg id=1542>Similarly, it was one of the most important things that President Reagan has done, much of the remaining power of American trade unions, to destroy their piece of the unternehmenskuchen fight.</seg>
<seg id=1543>Such Reagan's fluglotsenstreiks of 1981 was a turning point for the American trade union - and for the stock market, whose spectacular börsenhausse in 1982 their began.</seg>
<seg id=1544>Since the speculative aufblähung of stock reached its peak in 2000, the US stock market, especially vigorously supported, particularly by repeated the reduction of interest rates.</seg>
<seg id=1545>Publicly was, of course, a measure to stimulate the economy justified, not to support the stock market.</seg>
<seg id=1546>But it is a aufschlussreicher indication of the importance of us exchange that the aktienkursverfall one of the most important factors was kept on the economy lastete.</seg>
<seg id=1547>The response of the authorities, not limited to monetary stimulationsmaßnahmen.</seg>
<seg id=1548>The macroeconomic economic the US shows that the effective tax on profits (the percentage of profits, indeed, in the form of taxes in the government paid) culminating in 33,7% in the first quarter of 2000 - the levels reached the stock market and the economy in general - to the fourth quarter 20,2% fell in 2003, when the market had a low point.</seg>
<seg id=1549>This reflects a sharp decline in large part, Congress supported measures to tax break, as well as the perception of companies that they taxes in the current economic and political environment can avoid aggressive.</seg>
<seg id=1550>Moreover, the maximum tax on dividends from stocks after börsencrash from 35% to 15% reduced what long-term investors a significant new verschaffte advantage and the zinseszinseffekt wiederanlage in the dividends for increased taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1551>This was also tax cut as konjunkturanreiz justified, which, of course, that any measure can claim that aims to support the market.</seg>
<seg id=1552>But it is the balance of political forces, the credibility of such a justification decides.</seg>
<seg id=1553>It could be said that the same variables, including the government attitude toward high taxes and the movement, weak in the US since the last 200 years at work - and they are thus expect that they can do so in the future will be, and the high börsengewinne generate and huge inflows attract foreign investment.</seg>
<seg id=1554>Those who think that investments in the US stock market the same strong wachstumstrend for decades maintained, may well be right.</seg>
<seg id=1555>It should, however, be clear what forecast.</seg>
<seg id=1556>In fact, it does not only economic developments ahead, but politics - and even cultural values - the economic performance and shape.</seg>
<seg id=1557>A global eigenheim</seg>
<seg id=1558>Of all investment eigenheime most of a certain place tied and thus gedeih or at the mercy of local economic conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1559>In our fernsehern pursue while we blitzschnell global developments, but our eigenheimmarkt, almost exclusively in the hands of local amateure is, remains in our backyard in.</seg>
<seg id=1560>This may, however, soon change.</seg>
<seg id=1561>Within a month, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) produktbörse working with my firm MacroMarkets and with fiserv and Standard & Poor's's futures and optionskontrakte on home in ten US cities on the market.</seg>
<seg id=1562>The basis of these contracts form the S & P 500 / case Shiller immobilienpreisindizes -- a development of scientific work, which my colleague Karl case and I nearly twenty years leisteten.</seg>
<seg id=1563>We have many years for immobilienfutures committed, but so far to no stock market a futuresmarkt to base such indicators.</seg>
<seg id=1564>The futuresmärkte will it investors around the world to by to buy shares in us indirectly eigenheime to invest.</seg>
<seg id=1565>A investors in Paris, Tokyo or Rio de Janeiro can so in New York, and Los Angeles, Las Vegas eigenheime invest, inhabited by their owners.</seg>
<seg id=1566>Because of a fundamental principle of financial theory of the "-- diversification" or "-- spread risks can expect that interest in the new kontrakten well will be high.</seg>
<seg id=1567>For example, people and companies in New York excessive local immobilienrisiken exposed. They should this risk so by the sale of futures at home in New York reduce.</seg>
<seg id=1568>At acceptable prices are people in Tokyo by the purchase of New York futures on part of the risk to home.</seg>
<seg id=1569>The New York live, still in their family, but their anlagerisiko they have now widely around the world.</seg>
<seg id=1570>A futures market for the real eigenheime since 1991, there was no longer, as the London optionsbörse (the date and now under the name euronext.liffe firmiert), failed to such a market in Britain.</seg>
<seg id=1571>Then you could not sufficient trade.</seg>
<seg id=1572>The stock market schmiss a party, but none was to.</seg>
<seg id=1573>Even the British spread betting markets and some online handelsmärkte could not sustained success.</seg>
<seg id=1574>This time it will be different?</seg>
<seg id=1575>Of course, the start of a new market and an unsafe risky. people only like to parties, if there are many other people.</seg>
<seg id=1576>No one is, as is also no to to. as is on markets with a few investors.</seg>
<seg id=1577>There are too few transactions to those returns to achieve needed to attract enough investors. As in tollen parties is the success of new markets sometimes a mystery, but we know that from time to time well klappt.</seg>
<seg id=1578>There is evidence of a growing interest in trade with futures at home, above all, because the debate to a "immobilienblase" the importance of risikodiversifikation still on.</seg>
<seg id=1579>After the CME their plans announced, been said, one of the Chicago optionsbörse mitbewerberinnen, that you also plane, futures and optionskontrakte for the key areas in the us to market. basis, by the American association of estate issued medianpreise for eigenheime.</seg>
<seg id=1580>But over and above the strong public interest in property investment and the insurance of immobilienrisiken is the success of futuresmärkten, a crucial issue to clear: prices must be laid open and investors, the importance of this prices must be aware of.</seg>
<seg id=1581>I believe that, in many of these futuresmärkte soon with a substantial, within the next year eintretenden drop in some US cities will be.</seg>
<seg id=1582>Prices are, in the traders are described as "backwardation." that is, the price of a futures market today is less than the current price of eigenheims.</seg>
<seg id=1583>This backwardation, may not be the first day of trade with futures occur, but likely within a few months.</seg>
<seg id=1584>This backwardation on some markets may be necessary if this its function to be fair.</seg>
<seg id=1585>All know that, in many of these cities (and elsewhere) in recent years enormous immobilienboom.</seg>
<seg id=1586>International investors are likely to be not to invest in these cities when it on the futuresmärkten no expectations of preisverfalls, as the inhabitants tokios know from bitter experience.</seg>
<seg id=1587>But if this backwardation pronounced enough, could also investors who believe that the US immobilienmarkt decline, of the eigenheimfutures a good return for this, because they are already the futuresmarkt to acquire a better price.</seg>
<seg id=1588>However, the New York, want to ensure their property investment, to some extent minds, when it comes to sell futureskontrakte where a drop already einkalkuliert.</seg>
<seg id=1589>They will only be used to the idea that the market the prices must be expected and that they themselves only for the part of future preisminderungen can ensure that go beyond these expectations.</seg>
<seg id=1590>Such a change will probably then einkehren, if we know in the future market prices.</seg>
<seg id=1591>Until now, the future development of real estate solely a question of different opinions.</seg>
<seg id=1592>If the markets an international consensus about the future home urban world restore, we will, with the risks in these cities better deal can and so that their economies, and our lives, stabilize.</seg>
<seg id=1593>What news move the markets?</seg>
<seg id=1594>The markets in much of the world have been around the 10 may have to accept a kursverluste. Most that occurred in two weeks, for example, may 23; but, since the average prices continue to fall.</seg>
<seg id=1595>These problems, to the international exchanges on problems for the world economy to?</seg>
<seg id=1596>Let us, the most kursverluste.</seg>
<seg id=1597>In the main national indexes came the biggest crash in India, where prices from 10 to to May 23% to 16,9 fell.</seg>
<seg id=1598>The debacle on the other side of the world was almost as large, and the maximum and tiefststände wichen only two days of those in India are: in Argentina gave the prices to 16,1% after, in Brazil to 14,7% and in Mexico to 13.8%.</seg>
<seg id=1599>Also the European markets suffered high losses.</seg>
<seg id=1600>In Sweden the prices fell by between 9 and 22 May to 15.2%; in almost the same time they fell in Germany to 9.7%, in France to 9.4% and in Britain and Italy to 9.3%.</seg>
<seg id=1601>In Asia, prices fell in almost exactly the same period of relative höchstständen on relative tiefstände -- in Korea to 11.5%, in Hong Kong to 9.3% and 8% in Japan.</seg>
<seg id=1602>Many commentators are concerned, these events to the developments in the United States festzumachen.</seg>
<seg id=1603>But in the US fell the stocks between 9 and 24 May just 5.2%.</seg>
<seg id=1604>Nor, China behind global kursrückgang to put, because the rates during this period there even rose.</seg>
<seg id=1605>The standarderklärung the economists, monetary policy to the center.</seg>
<seg id=1606>In the wake of the great deflationsangst 2003 senkten central banks worldwide interest rates and thus lösten spekulationsbedingte booms both on the stocks, both in the häusermarkt from.</seg>
<seg id=1607>Now, however, make this view, however, rising interest rates, which felt for the future more kursrückgänge expect.</seg>
<seg id=1608>This is undoubtedly an important of truth.</seg>
<seg id=1609>The US Federal Reserve hob interest rates on 10 May, indeed, and its chairman, Ben Bernanke, indicated the possibility of further rate hikes.</seg>
<seg id=1610>On 17 May, worsening inflationsdaten reported, which indicates that another streamlining of on monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=1611>The economists like to see the world as a logical and manageable, and imply so that they understand what is going on in it.</seg>
<seg id=1612>But by do so, do you often about the role of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id=1613>Indeed, the only one rate hike in the US in a whole series of rate hikes -- the 16 in a result.</seg>
<seg id=1614>No other major Central Bank, after the kursverlusten to aktienmärkten until 7 / 8 June raised interest rates, as it did then several (central banks and the ECB, India, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, and Turkey).</seg>
<seg id=1615>Another factor is the price of oil, the between 22 March and the 2 May to 24% rise in several absolute höchststände aufstellte.</seg>
<seg id=1616>This was certainly an important event, and it is obvious that it impact on the stock markets around the world may have.</seg>
<seg id=1617>Increases have to virtually all economic recessions since World War II helped.</seg>
<seg id=1618>But not fall the increases in the window in May, when the indexes most nachgaben.</seg>
<seg id=1619>Those who argue that rising oil prices on the stock market kursverluste caused, requires that the markets with mehrwöchiger delay reacted.</seg>
<seg id=1620>Now operate markets is not necessarily especially logical, and so could a delayed reaction to shocks them.</seg>
<seg id=1621>As in all other prices financial markets calls increase again attention in.</seg>
<seg id=1622>When oil prices up as to respect the people, with oil prices will be reinforced and coherent news about the ölpreisentwicklung -- what a growing awareness of such news brought.</seg>
<seg id=1623>The crisis in the Middle East, the news in May dominated, is associated with the oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1624>Investors may have due to the increases ominous indications and the looming it different political actors reinforced perceived.</seg>
<seg id=1625>So declared on 8 May deputy Israeli Prime Minister Peres hostility in response to statements made by the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: "the President of Iran, should remember that, Iran off the map can be swept."</seg>
<seg id=1626>Similarly, the newspapers reported on 13 May, for example, at the start of kursstürze stock exchanges that Ahmadinejad on his visit to Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country in the world -- by students of two of the country's topuniversitäten with that standing ovation to was.</seg>
<seg id=1627>These checks may have been interpreted as evidence that the Ahmadinejad's confrontation in the nuclear issue for this politically pays, which may have been boost the idea that the tense situation in the Middle East could lead to even higher oil prices.</seg>
<seg id=1628>These nachrichtenmeldungen may appear to be much more to be the stock market as monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id=1629>But the public reaction to it, together with the recent rise in oil prices, may be a good part of the marktpsychologie be responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1630>The risks changing over time, and events as Ahmadinejad's and Peres' statements can trigger such changes.</seg>
<seg id=1631>Such things happen on hard quantifiable way. Yet should the analysts in their attempt to the development of the global aktienmärkten to predict the Ahmadinejad's statements may as much attention as those Bernanke's.</seg>
<seg id=1632>It may not like the economists, your attention to the position of the public and their with preisänderungen, global nachrichtenmeldungen spekulationsdynamiken and to concentrate.</seg>
<seg id=1633>After all, they would admit that economic events less be predicted (and the economists even less allwissend) are, as they would like.</seg>
<seg id=1634>But such a focus is intuitively sense.</seg>
<seg id=1635>What is the investors really?</seg>
<seg id=1636>Ahmadinejad is a charismatic shape; Bernanke is not.</seg>
<seg id=1637>Ahmadinejad pursued a abenteuerlichen course; Bernanke does not.</seg>
<seg id=1638>And, perhaps most, Ahmadinejad is a destabilising influence, Bernanke is not.</seg>
<seg id=1639>Indeed, the case of the global stock in May, whatever its final cause may be, in an unstable marktpsychologie to.</seg>
<seg id=1640>It is hard to imagine that he only to the views of the vermutliche festzumachen and monetary policy is not to broader and deeper profound weltwirtschaftliche development, for the basic problems, including the energy and the political tensions.</seg>
<seg id=1641>Why should pay more for fairness</seg>
<seg id=1642>Marks & Spencer, a supermarket and bekleidungskette with 400 branches across Britain, was recently announced that their entire teepalette coffee and, as a whole, to 38 produktlinien Fairtrade, a marketingsymbol for "ethical production" to change that.</seg>
<seg id=1643>The chain sold in its 200 café revive kaffeestuben already only tea and coffee with fairtraide seals.</seg>
<seg id=1644>It also increases their einkaufsmenge shirts, and other goods from Fairtrade cotton.</seg>
<seg id=1645>The announcement came during the "Fairtrade fortnight," a two-week Fairtrade campaign for products in which, among other things, the British farmers from developing countries to vorträgen in various places told how Fairtrade helped their communities.</seg>
<seg id=1646>The movement towards a ethischeren consumption, also in the United States, more important, where the consumers increasingly biologically grown, local food from free-range eggs and turn.</seg>
<seg id=1647>The UK was a survey that half of those the Fairtrade recognized symbol and knew that it on products to the farmers in the third world better business conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1648>There is no comparable us study, but similar data and discussions with my own students point out that the figure would be much lower.</seg>
<seg id=1649>Traders, the Fairtrade seals, producers must be a price to pay the cost of sustainable production line and a minimum secure.</seg>
<seg id=1650>For example, is the price of coffee $1.26 per pound, no matter how deep the market price falls.</seg>
<seg id=1651>If the market price of this value rises, increases the fairhandelspreis so that he had to five cents per higher remains.</seg>
<seg id=1652>Peasants must in turn in cooperatives or other groups, to organize a democratic participation.</seg>
<seg id=1653>Plantations and factories can the Fairtrade seals use when they pay their workers decent wages, health, safety and environmental standards on, trade unions, or other forms of arbeiterorganisationen allow, good shelter to, if not the workers at home and housing, or even children forced to take up.</seg>
<seg id=1654>Not at all finds Fairtrade anklang.</seg>
<seg id=1655>Brink Lindsey, Director of market _ based Cato Institute's center for trade policy studies, believes that the campaign for a "coffee Fairtrade well-intentioned impasse darstelle."</seg>
<seg id=1656>With some any he argued that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices is not the greed of multinational companies, but the enormous increase in kaffeeproduktion in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with new technologies that will enable coffee with less so cheap labor and grow.</seg>
<seg id=1657>From the point of view we should lindeys coffee planters, if we want to help them, either to encourage kaffeeanbau abandon gewinnbringendere plants and order -- and here he has rightly suggests that trade barriers and subsidies of rich countries are obstacles that must be abolished, or to better address products, such as spezialkaffees that higher prices.</seg>
<seg id=1658>To lindeys reasoning, however, is strange that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee as can be seen exactly what he recommends: the coffee planters are encouraged, a spezialkaffee order, a higher price.</seg>
<seg id=1659>The representatives of the free market have nothing against companies by the very openly snob appeal to use for their products to promote.</seg>
<seg id=1660>If the people had a $48 for jamaikanischen blue mountain coffee to pay because the James lieblingskaffee bonds, economists have nothing that the market is distorted.</seg>
<seg id=1661>Why are they then so critical when consumers choose to $12 for a pound coffee spend which they know that he without toxic chemicals, shadow spendenden trees grow, where birds can survive -- of farmers, who are now able to feed and their children to school to send?</seg>
<seg id=1662>The economists would perhaps answers that, if you want to help people, their children to feed and train $10, for a fair traded coffee could not pay, as schmeckt, and then the so gesparten $2 to a spendet aid workers, the poor children with education and food supplies.</seg>
<seg id=1663>This is a possible strategy, but fair trade has certain advantages.</seg>
<seg id=1664>The farmers know that they must provide a product that consumers like geschmacklicher, both in terms of anbauweise.</seg>
<seg id=1665>If their product sold well, they can be proud to have produced, something that is begehrt around the world.</seg>
<seg id=1666>In the view of the producers, it is better to premium by the sale of a given product Fairtrade to get when a mild for receive that they received, regardless of whether they had worked or not, and regardless of quality product.</seg>
<seg id=1667>A higher price for a Fairtrade label to pay is not marktwidriger "," as a higher price for a Gucci label to pay, and it reflects better ethical priorities reflect.</seg>
<seg id=1668>Fairtrade is no state subsidy..</seg>
<seg id=1669>Its success is of demand market on, not by political lobby work.</seg>
<seg id=1670>Fortunately, this growing demand market fast.</seg>
<seg id=1671>It is to be hoped that in all the developed countries and everywhere where people free of spending free, soon similar will be high.</seg>
<seg id=1672>Pigs, calves and the American democracy</seg>
<seg id=1673>In all the headlines about the victory of the Democrats in the US congressional elections in November is an important result of these elections almost untergegangen.</seg>
<seg id=1674>And although this teilergebnis the shortcomings of the political system in the US, it must, my belief in the sympathy American average restored.</seg>
<seg id=1675>The federal Arizona can citizens of a sufficient number of unterstützungsunterschriften direct submit a proposal to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=1676>In the heurigen elections was that this prohibition, trächtige pigs or zuchtkälber anzubinden or in verschlägen to keep the animal to stop freely to move to hinzulegen or its limbs auszustrecken.</seg>
<seg id=1677>Those who the methods of modern landwirtschaftsindustrie are not familiar with the issues, perhaps, why such legislation may be necessary at all.</seg>
<seg id=1678>Under conditions as they 50 years ago, in the animals everywhere herrschten and how they in some countries are still practiced, have all animals enough room to move and auszustrecken.</seg>
<seg id=1679>Today, however, spend roughly 90% of American zuchtsauen -- the mothers of piglets, the production of pigmeat, bacon and ham bred and killed, and the largely imprisoned in their lives, not kastenständen 60 times greater than 220 foot.</seg>
<seg id=1680>That they can, or. Yet hinlegen, their limbs ausstrecken or more than a step forward or move backwards.</seg>
<seg id=1681>Other sows are linked to brief chains so that they are also not..</seg>
<seg id=1682>Also in the calves are kalbfleischproduktion their whole lives individually in small verschläge blocked, where they are not, or. hinlegen ausstrecken.</seg>
<seg id=1683>This is tierhaltungsmethoden arbeitsersparnis -- they facilitate the tiermanagement and allow the attitude or of tens of thousands of animals under one roof. This is more or less qualified staff needed.</seg>
<seg id=1684>Also prevent these methods that the animals by too much movement or fighting each other waste.</seg>
<seg id=1685>After protests of animal protection organisations, the European Union some years ago in their Scientific Veterinary Committee report on this type of farming in mandate.</seg>
<seg id=1686>The report of the committee came to the result that the animals suffer, will not be able to move freely and nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id=1687>To this conclusion, of course, also have been using the normal hausverstandes can.</seg>
<seg id=1688>After the publication of that report was that the EU, at the extent to which einsperren of animals to be banned.</seg>
<seg id=1689>For zuchtkälber naht already with the ban on 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id=1690>Einzelkastenstände zuchtsauen, for the UK and Sweden are banned, already be across the EU are 2013 be illegal.</seg>
<seg id=1691>Gradually to be implemented, measures to improve the living conditions of laying hens, the usually closely packed into drahtkäfigen kept in which they are not even their wing spreizen.</seg>
<seg id=1692>In the US are bundesweite measures of this kind nowhere in sight.</seg>
<seg id=1693>If my European friends in the past, asked why the US Europe on animal are so far behind, I knew an answer.</seg>
<seg id=1694>Were the questions eindringlicher, I have had to admit that an explanation for this may be the fact is that the Americans are less concerned about as the Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1695>In 2002, but brought animal in Florida a legislative on the banning of kastenständen for sows the vote.</seg>
<seg id=1696>To the surprise of many, the proposal of 55% of the voters.</seg>
<seg id=1697>Last month, in Arizona, costly gegeninitiativen the farming industry the prohibition of small kastenständen for sows and calves with 62% of the votes also adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1698>Neither Florida, Arizona are particularly progressive States -- in both defeated George W. Bush 2004 its competitors John Kerry.</seg>
<seg id=1699>So the results suggest to conclude that the majority of Americans, they have the opportunity to vote on it - the attitude of trächtigen sows and calves in close verschlägen ban.</seg>
<seg id=1700>The Americans, the animal as a concern to be as the Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1701>So, to the gap between Europe and the US on nutztierschutz to explain, we should look at the political system.</seg>
<seg id=1702>In Europe managed to the concerns of the electorate in the area of animals in Parliament in the respective countries and to the Members of the European Parliament heranzutragen. The led to their respective national tierschutzgesetzen and to directives that these concerns.</seg>
<seg id=1703>By contrast, were in the US concern in the area of animals not measurable impact on congressmen.</seg>
<seg id=1704>Neither bundesweit even at the level of the individual States, there is a law on the protection of animals.</seg>
<seg id=1705>The reason is, in my view, is to seek that representatives of the farming industry, are capable of millions of dollars in the pockets of congressmen migrate to the to be re-elected.</seg>
<seg id=1706>In the area of lobbying and wahlkampfspenden could tierschutzbewegung despite the broad public support with these by not compete.</seg>
<seg id=1707>The American electoral matters more money than the opinion of the voters.</seg>
<seg id=1708>The discipline is weak and pronounced kongressabgeordnete need money for their re-election even auftreiben -- and such elections are, in the case of House every two years.</seg>
<seg id=1709>In Europe, where the strong discipline is pronounced, not the candidates, but the parties campaigns finance, money plays a smaller role.</seg>
<seg id=1710>In the US, where it so proud of its democratic traditions, pigs and calves are hardly the only losers.</seg>
<seg id=1711>What is new in the new Afghan army all parties?</seg>
<seg id=1712>(the might of the Afghan Interim Government even angezettelte) killing of Afghan luftfahrtministers by a mob shows that the Afghan society is deeply divided.</seg>
<seg id=1713>The first reform in the Afghan army, these trenches, deepen.</seg>
<seg id=1714>The Minister in Hamid karsais government in Kabul, the highest of this new army officers already appointed.</seg>
<seg id=1715>The ministers, General Mohammed Fahim, a tadschike from the northern region, pandschir took three months ago, the command of the troops of the Northern Alliance, the Kabul revenues, after they had opened the way for American bomber.</seg>
<seg id=1716>His appointment as a whole are a direct threat to karsais intentions, to unite the country.</seg>
<seg id=1717>Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic state in which the Pashtuns with two one-fifth the majority.</seg>
<seg id=1718>Each one fifth of the population are Hezaras and Tajiks.</seg>
<seg id=1719>By achtunddreißig now in the imposition of Fahim generalsrang officers are thirty-seven Tajiks and a usbeke.</seg>
<seg id=1720>Each for military service eingezogene members of fifteen, seventeen million zählenden ethnic the Pashtuns, is so under a command structure serve, almost exclusively of Tajiks is.</seg>
<seg id=1721>The language of Pashtuns differs from that of Tajiks, as much as the English, Spanish and millions of Pashtuns in wehrfähigen age have at best fragmented knowledge of Tajikistan language.</seg>
<seg id=1722>The geographical origin of new military leadership is as narrow, as their ethnic profile.</seg>
<seg id=1723>Thirty-five of achtunddreißig officers come from the region of the North of Kabul, the province parwan (where, Bagram, the airport is) and the close gelegene pandschir valley, the former stronghold of the Northern Alliance, heard.</seg>
<seg id=1724>In other words, does this mean that the twenty-seven leaders from the overall twenty-nine Afghan provinces the doors to new military leadership of the country remained closed.</seg>
<seg id=1725>It may be a broad group so closely the impression that it is in their a clique, even entkräften if they at least a representative cross-section of more than a dozen Afghan parties would be.</seg>
<seg id=1726>This is, however, is not the case.</seg>
<seg id=1727>Eighteen achtunddreißig the highest officers come from jamiat R Islami, of Islamic party that over a long period of former theologieprofessor, Mullah Burhanuddin Rabbani, led.</seg>
<seg id=1728>This party ruled in the 1990s the last century to briefly in Kabul and caused the chaos and bloodshed, the most Afghans led to the arrival of the Taliban welcome.</seg>
<seg id=1729>Almost as many Members of the armeeführung from the Communist camp.</seg>
<seg id=1730>The sixteen achtunddreißig officers were long associated with this party whose tricks in the late 1970s of the last century to Soviet invasion between 1979 and 1989 led to two and a half million Afghans life cost.</seg>
<seg id=1731>Today, the communists in Afghanistan about as popular as Hitler's Nazi in the Czech Republic and Poland.</seg>
<seg id=1732>Of course, joined the people in Afghanistan, as well as elsewhere, the Communist Party of the diverse reasons, and not all were convinced ideologues.</seg>
<seg id=1733>But six of Fahim's generals were professional staff of the Communist Party, and after the invasion of the Red Army in the services of the Communists.</seg>
<seg id=1734>These six men and have three further Communists, in the Afghan army officers, served as kollaborierten over the decade dauernden occupation Afghanistan with the Soviets.</seg>
<seg id=1735>Imagine how the French reacted when a quarter of the French offizierkorps after World War II during the occupation of France's Wehrmacht kollaboriert have.</seg>
<seg id=1736>In Afghanistan, spread by news mundpropaganda fairly quickly.</seg>
<seg id=1737>So, Afghan nationalists (to which almost all Afghans are) soon on the political background of Fahim's generals know if it is not already do.</seg>
<seg id=1738>Even these crushing evidence of the bias and shape of selective armeekommandos may to some extent be neutralized if the generals at least professionalism and commitment patriotic values in their work einbrächten.</seg>
<seg id=1739>But unfortunately, have only ten of achtunddreißig of Fahim transported officers on a military background.</seg>
<seg id=1740>A was a pilot.</seg>
<seg id=1741>By contrast, the twenty-four (the background of four generals is unknown) from civil - either from the academic sphere, from Communist parteistuben or, as in the case of a former mullahs, from religious area.</seg>
<seg id=1742>What impact have this statistical data on the reality?</seg>
<seg id=1743>First, it means that the commander of international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, as well as American military and diplomats, in a meeting with the Afghan vizeverteidigungsminister Abdul Rashid Dostum meeting, to be a for his brutality and korruptheit infamous warlords and Communists, still with the old friends in the Red Army in Moscow is combined.</seg>
<seg id=1744>It also means that the Afghan commander-in-chief of the armed forces, as well as the staff and the head of the enlightenment and Communists, whose loyalties are uncertain and which most Afghans suspicion.</seg>
<seg id=1745>Can such a team that by wars zerrissene again a country?</seg>
<seg id=1746>The presence of such dubious team in Kabul suited to the confidence of three quarters of the Afghan people, the appointment of armeekommandos account, to gain?</seg>
<seg id=1747>This list is the appointed or not, the expression of a führungsstils according to the motto "all the winner?" for such an approach is not the risk of (sometime in the future), again a bloody backlash those to incite, whose interests now in so cynically ignored?</seg>
<seg id=1748>Before this unscrupulous, after the power by a small minority and unpopular should agree to the United Nations, European and American policymakers think about answers to these questions.</seg>
<seg id=1749>Of the irrationality tribute</seg>
<seg id=1750>A three high on the new Nobel Prize for Economics, Daniel Kahneman the University of Princeton and Vernon Smith of George mason university in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id=1751>How many Nobel prizes honor auszeichnungen that not only the work of befruchtende Kahneman and blacksmith itself, but also the denkschulen, they contribute to their leaders.</seg>
<seg id=1752>Kahneman is psychologist. He has shown the way in which individuals to systematically far less rational behavior when they orthodox economists suggest.</seg>
<seg id=1753>His research shows not only that individuals sometimes very different action than the ruling economic theory predictions, but also that they regularly and systematically, in such a way that they do so because other hypotheses understand and interpret these hypotheses can compete with those that use orthodox economists.</seg>
<seg id=1754>For most participants - and even for simple observers, this seems to be no great news.</seg>
<seg id=1755>The broker on Wall Street, the act of stocks of which they know that they exploit the irrationality of waste, and that Kahneman and blacksmith.</seg>
<seg id=1756>Much of the obsession of the finanzblase in the economy, based led to exploit the psychology of investors.</seg>
<seg id=1757>Indeed, this irrationality, no news for berufsökonomen.</seg>
<seg id=1758>John Maynard Keynes described the stock market not long ago as an area in which individuals rational handelnde struggle, the foundations of marktgeschehens to, but rather as a type of beauty contest in which the wins, the best guess is that the jury may decide.</seg>
<seg id=1759>This year's Nobel Prize celebrating one of the criticisms of the simplified marktwirtschaftslehre, just as last year, the price of the three winners (I was a) has done.</seg>
<seg id=1760>The winners of the last year have highlighted that different participants have different (and imperfect) have information and that the inequality of informationsstandes far-reaching effect on the workings of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1761>In particular, made the winners of the past year recognize that markets generally not effective and therefore an important role for the government to play remains.</seg>
<seg id=1762>Adam Smith's invisible hand, the idea that free markets as of invisible hand by lead to economic efficiency, is not to see it, because it at least zumteil, there is not.</seg>
<seg id=1763>This too is nothing new for the day by day market work (and by their wealth that them from the inequality of marktübersicht for the benefits to this or that they overcome this).</seg>
<seg id=1764>For over twenty years to so-called "models rational markterwartungen" the economists in their spell. The models assume that all participants the same (if not a total) have information and entirely rational action that markets are fully efficient, and that no unemployment can give (if not gierige unions or governments such by setting wages cause); it is never a kreditverknappung before them.</seg>
<seg id=1765>That such models particularly to the universities America's despite gegenbeweise prevail, shows with, and that science triumphed over ideology.</seg>
<seg id=1766>Unfortunately, such aufbaustudienprogramme students are now in many countries as politicians and are there because of ideas, go as far as that they called fundamentalism, programs.</seg>
<seg id=1767>To put it bluntly, the models rational expectations have contributed to the essential economic theory; the consequence, with their supporters it on the economic thinking used have helped with the weaknesses of many fundamental hypotheses.</seg>
<seg id=1768>Good science recognizes its own borders, but the prophets of models rational expectations to usually such modesty not see.</seg>
<seg id=1769>Vernon Smith was a leader in the development of the experimental economy. It is the idea of that you many wirtschaftstheoretische claims in particular arrangements in laboratory can check.</seg>
<seg id=1770>One reason that economy such a difficult fach is and that there is so little consensus among economists, stems so that economists cannot conduct controlled experiments.</seg>
<seg id=1771>Nature is natural experiments, but in most cases, they change in so many things so fast that it is often difficult to unravel, what the cause of what was.</seg>
<seg id=1772>In principle we are in a laboratory controlled attempts to conduct the more reliable conclusions.</seg>
<seg id=1773>The critics of experimental economy will remember that the subjects of experimental situation bring thinking, from outside the versuchssituation intended they think that the experiments so not as clean and the conclusions are not as clear as in science.</seg>
<seg id=1774>Yet give economic experiments insights into a number of important items, such as the improved management of auctions.</seg>
<seg id=1775>The most important result was that the irrationality of the participants, the heart of the work was kahnemans, repeatedly in the laboratory has confirmed.</seg>
<seg id=1776>The more amüsanten results of experimental economy include those on altruism and selfishness.</seg>
<seg id=1777>It is, at least in experimental situations) that the subjects are not as selfish, as the hypotheses the economists - require exempt is a group - the economists itself.</seg>
<seg id=1778>This is now, because the economy discipline as individuals, attracts the inherently selfish, because the economy contributes to the individuals to forms and they selfish power?</seg>
<seg id=1779>The answer is with great security: a bit of both.</seg>
<seg id=1780>Probably will future experimental research help, the question of the weight of the two hypotheses relative to each other.</seg>
<seg id=1781>The Nobel prize underscores the importance of people and whole economies as they are, to study and not as we would like it to be.</seg>
<seg id=1782>Only when we understand the real behavior of the people, we can also hope, to draft a policy that brought that our economies work better.</seg>
<seg id=1783>Bush's intentions in of the evil energy policy.</seg>
<seg id=1784>In one of the meetings of this year's World Economic Forum in Davos surrealeren weltwirtschaftsforums declared experts from the oil that melting of polkappen -- that happens, more than anyone had predicted, not only a problem but also a chance: large ölmengen may now available.</seg>
<seg id=1785>As a remove these experts, the fact that the United States (the international Convention on the sea, determined who has access to offshore oil and other raw materials, right on the sea), which have not signed on a risk with international conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1786>Yet again they on the benefits to: the oil must never endenden in their search for further the Congress reserves the right not to ask, Alaska to plunder.</seg>
<seg id=1787>President George W. Bush has a sinister talent for, the message to overlook.</seg>
<seg id=1788>For years is becoming increasingly clear that much of its energy is not true.</seg>
<seg id=1789>By a former energiegesetz dictated by the oil industry, which was said, even members of his own party that "a lobbyist is forgotten."</seg>
<seg id=1790>While the benefits of the free market praises, Bush only too willing to the huge energiebranche contributions to provide, even if the US high deficits into the House.</seg>
<seg id=1791>The market failed in energy, but the government intervention should just in the other direction, as the Bush administration has proposed.</seg>
<seg id=1792>The fact that the Americans do not pay the price for the full pollution as a result of their energy is profligate -- especially of their contribution to greenhouse gases, means that the price of energy, which is the excessive consumption maintaining.</seg>
<seg id=1793>The government must promote environmental protection, are intervention in pricing system, through energy taxes, an effective way.</seg>
<seg id=1794>But rather than the environment promoting, Bush has pursued a policy of America first auslaugt and, in the future even more dependent on foreign oil power.</seg>
<seg id=1795>Whatever it is that the demand for oil prices up and drives mitnahmegewinne for many in the Middle East is that America's friends not to include.</seg>
<seg id=1796>Now, over four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, Bush seems at last in the reality of increased dependence on America's woken up to be; in the up schießenden oil prices, it was difficult for him to not as to the consequences.</seg>
<seg id=1797>Yet again, the schwankenden steps his government things in the near future only worse.</seg>
<seg id=1798>Bush refuses still, to do something to protect the environment, and he has permanent prayer that the technology will save us, to have very little money.</seg>
<seg id=1799>What are we so by Bush recently declared commitment to keep America within 25 years to 75% of the oil from the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id=1800>For investors the message is clear: no longer invested in the development of reserves in the Middle East, the ölquelle with far from least cost of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1801>But without new investments in the development of reserves in the Middle East means the unbridled growth of energy consumption in the US, China and elsewhere that demand will exceed the offer.</seg>
<seg id=1802>As if that were not enough, Bush risks with its threat of sanctions against Iran to impose that it is in the care of one of the greatest ölförderer to disruption of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1803>As the weltölförderung almost their full capacity has achieved and prices are already more than twice as high as before the Iraq war, suggests that, even higher profits for the ölbrache to, the only clear winner in Bush's Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=1804>After all, it should Bush anrechnen that he at least has recognized that there is a problem.</seg>
<seg id=1805>But, as always, there is a close look at its proposals on another taschenspielertrick his government to.</seg>
<seg id=1806>Not enough that he refuses to acknowledge the importance of global warming, promoting environmental or enough money in research to put to really something to change, and Bush festival promise that dependence on Middle East oil to reduce, is less important than it seems.</seg>
<seg id=1807>Because only 20% of US oil from the Middle East, he may be objective by a small shift its einkaufspolitik.</seg>
<seg id=1808>But you would think that the Bush administration must surely as that oil in a global market traded.</seg>
<seg id=1809>Even if America to 100% of the nahostöl, could be a decline in oil from the Middle East have devastating effects on the weltpreis -- and to the American economy.</seg>
<seg id=1810>As so often in the Bush administration, there is no flattering explanation for official policy.</seg>
<seg id=1811>Bush winkelzüge political power by antiarabischen and antiiranischen feelings in America encourages?</seg>
<seg id=1812>Or is this just another example of incompetence and mess?</seg>
<seg id=1813>After what we have seen in the last five years, the answer is likely that more than just a little evil intentions and sheer incompetence in the game.</seg>
<seg id=1814>China's roadmap</seg>
<seg id=1815>China faces the adoption of its eleventh fünfjahresplans. So the way for the continuing of the likely bemerkenswertesten economic change in history opened.</seg>
<seg id=1816>At the same time, the welfare almost a quarter of the world's population by. The world has never before seen such sustainable growth and never before has it poverty in derartigem of reduced.</seg>
<seg id=1817>In part, the long-term success China on its almost unique combination of pragmatism and vision due.</seg>
<seg id=1818>While much of the developing countries by the Washington consensus towards unrealistic increases in GDP, were pushed China again made clear that it is a more and more fairly distributed in living standards wants.</seg>
<seg id=1819>In China, it recognizes that it has achieved, a period of economic growth in it to huge -- and unacceptable, on the environment.</seg>
<seg id=1820>Without kursänderungen is ultimately of living at risk.</seg>
<seg id=1821>For this reason is a focus of the new fünfjahresplans on environment.</seg>
<seg id=1822>Even the many more backward areas China grow at a rate of a miracle gleichkäme, if not other parts, would grow faster.</seg>
<seg id=1823>While this, the poverty reduction could, however, is the inequality with the growing differences between town and country, as well as between regions and the Interior has increased.</seg>
<seg id=1824>This year's World Bank's World Development Report explains why not only poverty, but also the inequality a concern and should be the eleventh five-year plan China if this problem, determined to.</seg>
<seg id=1825>The government has for several years of a society harmonischeren spoken and the plan described ambitious programs to achieve this.</seg>
<seg id=1826>It also recognizes in China that the difference between developing countries and more developed countries not only in a gap of resources, but there is a gap of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1827>So, be bold in China plans on, not only in order to close this gap, but also to a basis for independent innovation.</seg>
<seg id=1828>China's role in the world and the world economy has changed, and this is in fact to the five-year plan.</seg>
<seg id=1829>Future growth is not so much on exports, but based on the domestic demand, which is the need to boost consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1830>Indeed, China has with a rare problem to fight: with a surplus of savings.</seg>
<seg id=1831>People in China save partly because of the weaknesses in the state social security, strengthening the social (pensions), health and educational system will also help to reduce social inequalities, feel that the welfare of the citizens and improve the current boost consumption.</seg>
<seg id=1832>Will the So far, China has -- and even its own ambitious expectations almost always than -- could these adjustments to huge on a world economic system to the US by the huge fiscal deficits and already is unbalanced.</seg>
<seg id=1833>If China is less done - and if, as of public side, announced a broader strategy gefächerte investment its reserves, who will then -- America's current account deficit of $2 billion a day finance?</seg>
<seg id=1834>This issue is now, not topical, but it could be as soon.</seg>
<seg id=1835>Despite the clear zukunftsvisionen is the challenge in the implementation of the strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1836>China is a huge country and it would not have come this far, if no widespread decentralization there.</seg>
<seg id=1837>However, there are out of decentralization own problems.</seg>
<seg id=1838>For example, greenhouse gases, are a global problem.</seg>
<seg id=1839>While America says that it could not do something about that companies, the Chinese policymakers responsible acted.</seg>
<seg id=1840>In a month after the adoption of the plan, new taxes on cars, petrol and wood products introduced: China used so market-based mechanisms to the environmental problems of the country and the world to tackle.</seg>
<seg id=1841>The pressure on local government officials, growth and jobs to produce, but will be enormous.</seg>
<seg id=1842>They are of the utmost temptation subject to say that if America an environmentally friendly production has not, to how this will work in China?</seg>
<seg id=1843>To vision into action, the Chinese Government is good policies need, such as the already introduced taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1844>With the development of China towards market, had, for the country problems which also developed face: selfish interests, the arguments behind a veil of dünnen verhüllen market ideology.</seg>
<seg id=1845>Some are for the so-called "trickle down," economy occur, so for a system in which the wealth from the top down leaked: it is making the poor worry about, because ultimately will all benefit from economic growth.</seg>
<seg id=1846>Others will against competition policy and strict unternehmensführungsgesetze turn: be developed only Darwin selektionstheorie their perform miracles.</seg>
<seg id=1847>A strong social and environmental policies, to be made: higher wachstumsargumente treibstoffsteuern, for example, would destroy our aufkeimende car industry.</seg>
<seg id=1848>With such, ostensibly wachstumsorientierten policies would be not only bring about growth, but also the entire vision of Chinese future threaten.</seg>
<seg id=1849>There is only one way, to prevent: open discussions about economic policies to errors to expose and scope for creative solutions to the many challenges to find with which China today is.</seg>
<seg id=1850>When George W. Bush, the dangers excessive secrecy and a decision-making within a small zirkels of kriechern shown.</seg>
<seg id=1851>The with Bush's possible tactic of an discussions and consultations with the Chinese leadership (even foreigners) in their efforts to find solutions to the huge problems, but of the most people outside China not really goutiert.</seg>
<seg id=1852>Market economies regulate, not of itself.</seg>
<seg id=1853>They cannot be simply on autopilot jobs, especially not when the benefits a possible large breitenwirkung to achieve.</seg>
<seg id=1854>The management of a market economy is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id=1855>It is a balancing act, which it constantly to economic changes to react.</seg>
<seg id=1856>The eleventh China's five-year plan is a road map for how these responses auszusehen.</seg>
<seg id=1857>The world looks in ehrfurcht and hope of China, the life of 1.3 billion people will continue to change.</seg>
<seg id=1858>Tocquevilles democratic lessons</seg>
<seg id=1859>It is only appropriate that the world today, 200 years after the birth Alexis de tocquevilles, because of the war in Iraq debate about the nature of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1860>Tocqueville due of glory for the reactionary desire for the past rejected and the triumph of democracy as our fate regarded -- and also warned against the risks of democracy for freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1861>We should his fears still share?</seg>
<seg id=1862>Tocqueville regarded democracy not only as a political herrschaftsform, but primarily as intellectual ordnungssystem that the customs and customs society generally formt. he awarded to the concept of a sociological and psychological dimension.</seg>
<seg id=1863>Democratic systems, as argued Tocqueville, determine our thoughts, desires and passions.</seg>
<seg id=1864>Just as the Renaissance, and, in the 20th century, the Homo sovieticus is the man "democratic" a form of human seins.</seg>
<seg id=1865>Tocqueville was of the view that the systemic effects of democracy that can lead to the citizens, of reason to deny.</seg>
<seg id=1866>They would then only where events, its own values and assess, in fact, but merely the rohen simplizistischen and opinions of the masses.</seg>
<seg id=1867>Indeed, what Tocqueville, "the" Social power on the opinion called in democratic systems, probably the ausgeprägtesten -- a view that the increase in demagoguery and medienmanipulation of modern is right away.</seg>
<seg id=1868>Tocqueville believed that there is no long-term effective ways restriction trend there.</seg>
<seg id=1869>Neither democracy nor small local societies, mutual state control, civil rights could stop the decline of critical thinking, the democracy to cause notes.</seg>
<seg id=1870>Schools could little more than zersetzenden enclaves within the power of the social impacts on the function of thinking.</seg>
<seg id=1871>Similarly, that, even if Tocqueville believed that the quest for virtue in the ancient or a religious belief, the political soul to a conflict between two and the democratic ideal if it in terms of public life would officially prescribed.</seg>
<seg id=1872>In this sense, to include tocquevilles intellectual heirs, the neomarxistischen based in Frankfurt Hannah Arendt school and, above all, the disintegration of reason in modern societies feared.</seg>
<seg id=1873>Indeed, the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet a recently published book The title contre la démocratie elle même (democracy against itself).</seg>
<seg id=1874>The democratic way of life argue that authors, tends to the independent thinking to destroy the "and" culture to suppress; the result was a mediocrity, citizens vulnerable to making the enemies of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1875>But, while the history of murderous regimes, which eingeschüchterte and getäuschte zujubelten masses, only so strotzt, there is the major threat to democratic nations that their citizens to be in favor of immediate bedürfnisbefriedigung in apathy and short-term thinking withdraw.</seg>
<seg id=1876>The past is that, despite the rituals of a historic moments seek, blur by a is after now, after the new.</seg>
<seg id=1877>Even the supposedly educated ruling class are this betörung.</seg>
<seg id=1878>The problem of the democratic spirit is its lack of historical awareness.</seg>
<seg id=1879>The deficits mean of democracy is that, as Tocqueville claimed that the only realistic, but not to maintain erhaltende -- the way open to us, a schicksalsergebener pessimism is?</seg>
<seg id=1880>I am not this view.</seg>
<seg id=1881>There are the means to fight what is growing as "democratic" folly our days what could.</seg>
<seg id=1882>The first is the defence effort to an education system that is critical heads produces, by the nowadays) (mostly neglected subjects of literature, history and philosophy.</seg>
<seg id=1883>If we want that wohlinformierte and critical citizens will be used, such as democracy, they need our schools must stop the latest one modeerscheinungen hinterherzulaufen and start to analytical capabilities of students to increase.</seg>
<seg id=1884>The biggest obstacle in the way of this form of education, the media with their tendency to cultivation of superficiality and zerstreuung.</seg>
<seg id=1885>Many people now spend a larger part of their lives, of the television than in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id=1886>The passivity of the mass media, to encourage diametralen, is in contrast to that active commitment to the democratic citizens characterised.</seg>
<seg id=1887>But it is hard to imagine that the mass media (by demanding newspapers), of their own accord to instruments of education would be that the critical skills of citizens expanded.</seg>
<seg id=1888>These concerns in terms of the mass media is no mere elitistische disregard for the culture.</seg>
<seg id=1889>The question is not only the popularity -- after all, was Mozart, in its time, lockten Shakespeare's works as well as the rich to the poor, but to the refusal of the culture, the thinking challenge and to provoke.</seg>
<seg id=1890>The result of this versäumnisses is a general indifference and passivity of publikums.</seg>
<seg id=1891>In fact, a globalized medienkultur, is incapable of the ability to think kritischem promoting or higher feelings cause, has long been on the march.</seg>
<seg id=1892>It is a culture that by their achtlosigkeit the democratic freedoms is threatened, because it failed to produce any form of responsibility, be it to society, history or the Community.</seg>
<seg id=1893>It is too late to something against a culture of companies, the spirit of this abtötet?</seg>
<seg id=1894>Tocqueville verachtete the elites his time for its complacency, given the power of entwurzelnden massendemokratie.</seg>
<seg id=1895>Will the shortsightedness, our leaders will help its worrying prophecy a reality?</seg>
<seg id=1896>A Europe for all</seg>
<seg id=1897>Alteingesessene members of the European Union seem now to the future of the European Union to doubt, in Ukraine, we look with hope and admiration of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1898>The basic objective of our foreign policy is to advance the EU participate, for the Ukraine has found that national unity, but no end is a start.</seg>
<seg id=1899>European unity is indivisible, indeed: if a nation is excluded, are all unfrei.</seg>
<seg id=1900>We Europeans are unentrinnbar in a net caught, our fate are intertwined with each other.</seg>
<seg id=1901>Every aspect of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, confirms this.</seg>
<seg id=1902>What a European country, concerns directly concerns all indirectly.</seg>
<seg id=1903>We can close the notion of Europe, two of the betuchten and the have-nots, of which the selected and of the ausgestoßenen, never again.</seg>
<seg id=1904>All of the European continent, life cannot, indeed, they must not be excluded from the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1905>The current great European peace and prosperity today's pan-European depend on.</seg>
<seg id=1906>Of course, some people murren that Ukraine is not Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1907>It should come to Kiev and with the people, the young, the old, with fabrikarbeitern, bauernfrauen, lawyers, doctors and teachers, the last winter for weeks in the cold and the snow were ausharrten and to defend their freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1908>They are not linked with those of General de Gaulle's French resistance beistanden?</seg>
<seg id=1909>They are not one of those who in the fight for Spanish Republic in the 1930 died, Budapest in 1956 liberated and fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970ern beendeten?</seg>
<seg id=1910>They are not of the same mind animated as Poland Solidarity movement and the peaceful masses, the 1989 the Velvet Revolution in Prague hervorbrachten?</seg>
<seg id=1911>This is the true European spirit, and no doubt can break it.</seg>
<seg id=1912>Those who think that Ukraine is to backward for membership, I say, they should come in my country and, as mothers, late in the evening work remain and their children in their firmenrechner explain how to a computer used.</seg>
<seg id=1913>It should in the language of every village and every city go where young people in Europe to prepare, by French, German and English learn.</seg>
<seg id=1914>Those who the European ethos Ukraine doubt, should understand that Europe is not a question of hardware and the highways. It is the insatiable desire for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=1915>I believe that our future so promising is how Europe's past pride, and that we our fate than not forgotten borderland in a troubled region that, but that we are Europe's peace and unity as macher shape.</seg>
<seg id=1916>Self-determination is no longer mean isolation, for the reach of national independence means today only the return on the world stage with a new status.</seg>
<seg id=1917>New nations can to their former besatzern a similar fruitful relationship like France, Germany, a relationship which is based on equality and mutual interests.</seg>
<seg id=1918>Such a relationship my government is trying to build, Russia, and by we do that, we can contribute to the enlargement of the European area in which peace.</seg>
<seg id=1919>Of course, it is premature, to do more than the high standing express that the prospect of membership in our enjoys.</seg>
<seg id=1920>We know that our part in this great buildings built not overnight.</seg>
<seg id=1921>We know that the great achievements of the European Union not in documents and explanations are, but in innovative steps to improve the lives of Europeans and their security guarantee</seg>
<seg id=1922>It is not easy to cheap or quickly to do to build, a Ukraine that is worthy of EU membership.</seg>
<seg id=1923>But as the EU itself will they built and be completed.</seg>
<seg id=1924>We know that this is a big challenge, but the price is worth the effort, and Europe should know that this is our goal.</seg>
<seg id=1925>The erneuerungsarbeit Ukraine is part of a creative struggle to a alptraumhaftes century to end the fascism and communism -- ideologies, who were born in the heart of Europe, tried, to gain the upper hand.</seg>
<seg id=1926>Only a few months ago were our children and parents in cities across Ukraine's armed forces, knurrenden dogs and even death.</seg>
<seg id=1927>Only a few years ago, the young journalist Georgi Gongadze, of the public about the corruption of the old regime to educate, of the thugs regime and mistreated geköpft.</seg>
<seg id=1928>But shows our Orange Revolution's last winter that the Ukrainian people won.</seg>
<seg id=1929>That is why I still despite today's doubts and difficulties in my unshakeable faith in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1930>I refuse to verzweifelung as last answer to the confused and cruel history of Ukraine to accept.</seg>
<seg id=1931>I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine on so tragic to sternenlose night of communist legacy bound is that we never the leuchtende morgendämmerung of peace and the true European unity can see.</seg>
<seg id=1932>If the citizens about Ukraine's place in Europe think that they should look behind the façade, they see it, they should, but also more standing.</seg>
<seg id=1933>They should, by the ödland vorbeisehen that communism, has caused over in the poverty and the social differences with which our ausrangierten former leaders tried to extend their misrule.</seg>
<seg id=1934>Instead, they should be the face of our President Viktor Yushchenko, at the last year by a campaign giftangriff, distorted, and, in the words of the great French André Malraux recall, for the "the faces the most beautiful, the injured."</seg>
<seg id=1935>Muslim civil war of</seg>
<seg id=1936>Is the gap between Sunnis and Shia in the Middle East is deeper than the enmity between Israel and the Arabs?</seg>
<seg id=1937>Given the reaction of some Arab governments to Hezbollah's decision, Israel, the attack, you might say.</seg>
<seg id=1938>Even as Israeli bombs in Beirut and condemned tyrus fell, Saudi Arabia, perhaps the konservativste Arabic Muslim state by all, open to the actions of the Shiite Hezbollah, the conflict with Israel entfacht have.</seg>
<seg id=1939>Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, a state that themselves as leaders of Muslim peoples, Arabic, Israel so openly supported.</seg>
<seg id=1940>In addition, Saudi Arabia break with Hezbollah not an isolated case.</seg>
<seg id=1941>, Egypt and Jordan, Hezbollah and its leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah chosen for their draufgängertum condemned.</seg>
<seg id=1942>What is behind this amazing development?</seg>
<seg id=1943>We will witness a fundamental change in the relationship between arabischem nationalism and Islamic sectarianism?</seg>
<seg id=1944>The power of the Sunni Islam Shiite government Saudi Arabia more worried and fear, as they are the Arab unity and the cause of Palestinians committed?</seg>
<seg id=1945>The Arab condemnations of Hezbollah suggests that the gap between the Muslim denominations, in the daily violence in Iraq is already clear, the Middle East deepened and intensified.</seg>
<seg id=1946>President George W. Bush's desire that erstarrten societies the Arab world to shatter, should the modernisierungskräfte against the traditional elements in the Arab and Islamic societies takes to.</seg>
<seg id=1947>Instead, it seems atavistischsten forces in the region to have unleashed.</seg>
<seg id=1948>The open the Pandora's box, a new and more hässlichere era of general violence Union have, perhaps, it can only as "Muslim civil war,".</seg>
<seg id=1949>The gap between the Shi'ites and Sunnis exists since the its Islam, but has the geographical isolation and ethnic of nichtarabischen Shiite Iran, together with the rule of sunnitisch Arab countries about their Shiite minorities in this rivalry for are to.</seg>
<seg id=1950>The tensions lösten to continue with the "Islamization" by the Iranian revolution ", because it was the konfessionsgebundene identity of Sunni Arabs as further pushed into the background, while a general" Islamic "hervortrat self-esteem.</seg>
<seg id=1951>All this changed when Al Qaeda, a Sunni terrorist, much of the wahabitischen ideology and the staff of the Saudis has taken on America of September 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1952>A explicitly Sunni variant of militant Islam was now on the march.</seg>
<seg id=1953>The fact that the United States and the Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan as well as the Sunni Iraqi regime war declared, ermutigte Sunni radicals, this new trend,.</seg>
<seg id=1954>The recently confident Sunni Arabs are Israel and the West as a threat, the only true other includes the so-called "Shi'a crescent" -- the landbogen, from Lebanon, Syria and Iraq until the Iran and extends the supposedly häretischen Shia inhabited.</seg>
<seg id=1955>As guardians of holiest sites of the Muslim faith in Mecca and Medina sense the rulers Saudi threat that perhaps the leidenschaftlichsten.</seg>
<seg id=1956>In the eyes of the Sunni, Shia, not only about the oil-rich areas in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the East, but they are also, by the actions of Hezbollah --, the role of the central "schutzherrn" the dream of all Arabs on to power, the Palestinian question.</seg>
<seg id=1957>Because the Saudi royal its legitimacy from a strict form of Islam ableitet Sunni and Shiite population his loyalty to the doubts, has the UK against Hezbollah to.</seg>
<seg id=1958>Ironically, America, long Saudi Arabia protector, the more power to the Shia allowed by it Saddam overthrown and Shiite parties in Iraq has brought to power.</seg>
<seg id=1959>The Bush Administration appears to see what it has done; while the Shiite bogen East of Arabic Muslim world, the US their aufspannt try to protect the Sunni arc, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, to the region in the West.</seg>
<seg id=1960>Israel, once the relentless enemy of Arab cause, now seems to be embedded in the midst of this verteidigungsstruktur.</seg>
<seg id=1961>But it is such a verteidigungsstellung bound by panarabischen feelings unstable.</seg>
<seg id=1962>Now kleben ordinary citizens, Saudi Al Jazeera and other Arab satellites television to the events in Gaza and Lebanon mitzuverfolgen.</seg>
<seg id=1963>They see how Arab (not schiitisches) bloodshed, and only Hezbollah, ankämpft.</seg>
<seg id=1964>In their eyes Hezbollah is a model for the heroic resistance.</seg>
<seg id=1965>This has led to the Saudi state the division between Sunnis and Shia to deepen.</seg>
<seg id=1966>After the Kingdom Hezbollah had officially censured, called the Saudi state its official wahabitischen clerics to its fatwas, the Shiite Hezbollah as breakaway häretiker and condemn.</seg>
<seg id=1967>Such condemnations can only the religious divisions within Saudi Arabia and exacerbate the region.</seg>
<seg id=1968>Will the Sunni regimes, if these deepen divisions, to believe that they reach their own Hezbollah need to in their landstrich to fight?</seg>
<seg id=1969>To conclude, if this should, they need not long to seek, because many such fighters have already been trained -- of Al Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id=1970>Europe must not forget Georgia</seg>
<seg id=1971>The time when Europe could count on that America backyard wars in Europe leads to peace and democracy, includes introduces are over.</seg>
<seg id=1972>Enlargement of the European Union, as well as in the recent Russian gas crisis to see, is not only Ukraine to this backyard, but also Georgia.</seg>
<seg id=1973>As well as in Ukraine, Georgia, democracy is now put to the test and Europe cannot afford to ignore this development.</seg>
<seg id=1974>Georgia was the first postsowjetische country where, to a "color revolution" was and where people their decision for democracy and European values with dignity and maturity demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id=1975>The flags of the European Union, since in all public buildings in Georgia wehen witnesses, from a natural with to Europe, as far as zurückreicht like the story of a country that since the time of ancient Greece a fixer part of world was then known.</seg>
<seg id=1976>Prometheus, medea, amazonen and the ark neighboring Armenia show that European Myths of here, its outcome.</seg>
<seg id=1977>With its history, its culture and traditions, to which, the critical, independent and even rebellische spirit from the days of belonging to the former Soviet Union matters, Georgia but would be the ideal candidate for a successful democratization.</seg>
<seg id=1978>So it is all the more serious, that democratization fails.</seg>
<seg id=1979>It had all so well begun.</seg>
<seg id=1980>Political reform, privatization, anti korruptionsmaßnahmen, the search for new, of links with the former regime unbelasteten spitzenpolitikern and the establishment of a pro-European policy stießen on no resistance.</seg>
<seg id=1981>But is the totalitarian attitude some leaders today, his, on the pretext of mehrheitswillen to represent, more and more power to power.</seg>
<seg id=1982>Similarly, the ancient Greek Hydra ersteht, the political elite Georgia again and again.</seg>
<seg id=1983>Precisely those people and herrschaftspraktiken that you in the "Rose Revolution" in November 2003, appear to rid now back to the schalthebeln power to use, as they are on the limits of Georgia hinausreichenden networks and their fantastic wealth and their skill in political intrigue and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id=1984>This has little to do with real democracy, not only through elections, but also by powers marked.</seg>
<seg id=1985>The government mischt, in the affairs of Parliament which, in turn, in an attempt to regierungsarbeit detail tax, in my case, the attempt to the nomination of ambassadors and whose tagesablauf to determine!</seg>
<seg id=1986>A more schwerwiegenderes problem is the lack of judicial independence, thereby undermining the rule of law, private investment is needed.</seg>
<seg id=1987>The Georgian democracy exists in the head, but not the heart: people contempt policy still as dirty. This left to those the terrain, which really should already have withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id=1988>The hope of democracy is, however, in the people, the organizations of society and in the media deeply rooted.</seg>
<seg id=1989>It is now up to Europe to ensure that this hope not erlischt.</seg>
<seg id=1990>The US has already done everything in its power to political stability in Georgia since independence.</seg>
<seg id=1991>During the term of Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister, in his presidency during the Rose Revolution lost stability, this was not always the same as democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1992>But the Americans invested generous in survival democratic ideas and whose proponenten.</seg>
<seg id=1993>Although the Rose Revolution not as of Russian nationalists claimed that the work of the financier George Soros Foundation was supported, has no doubt that the democratic foundations, reinforced encouraged and supported.</seg>
<seg id=1994>For the consolidation of democracy requires Georgia but a different kind of support that more Europe can offer.</seg>
<seg id=1995>The balance of forces, the judiciary in practice and local democracy in following European models must be the Georgian reality rather than to the Anglo-Saxon models American ausprägung.</seg>
<seg id=1996>With a rejection of Europe would challenge its fundamental responsibility to a small, flexible, Mediterranean country with old traditions betrayed, where democracy has a much greater chance of success than in the vast and still very the Soviet spirit arrested Ukraine, let alone of Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id=1997>The refusal to Georgia in its struggle for democracy would likely to support the democratic process in Ukraine, Belarus, and even in Russia even delayed.</seg>
<seg id=1998>It is therefore more and more at stake.</seg>
<seg id=1999>Although Russia and its großmachtträumen machtinstrumenten abgeschworen had never had it, with the inevitability of democracy, at least at the borders accept.</seg>
<seg id=2000>But these reluctant acceptance of some normality in relations with its neighbours was always vulnerable to the sudden wiederausbruch of Russia's famous irrational "derschawa" -- aggressive ethos that the state glorifiziert and its strength from the exploitation of the deficiencies of others.</seg>
<seg id=2001>This is the key to understanding of the recent Russian gas crisis.</seg>
<seg id=2002>What is certain is that any signs of rückzuges of democracy in Georgia and other post-Soviet states neoimperialistische Russia's ambitions be revived.</seg>
<seg id=2003>It is the responsibility of Europe to convince Russia that there is no hope of a return to the past.</seg>
<seg id=2004>Europe must assume this role, not only to the independence of its future energy supply, but also to demonstrate that European values freedom, democracy and justice between peoples, really on solid foundations.</seg>
<seg id=2005>To be successful, Europe must with the necessary rüstzeug greater: it takes a large semi-public Foundation to promote and support for political reform, a university training managers in future burgeoning democracies, as well as of judges and police forces and a heerschar justizbeamten to those models einzuhauchen life, which we want to emulate.</seg>
<seg id=2006>Above all, Europe needs belief.</seg>
<seg id=2007>When the Europe of today, not even to be that there is a fundamental interest in the future of its neighbours, who will tomorrow believe in Europe?</seg>
