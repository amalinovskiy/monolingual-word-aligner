<SEG id="3"> In the discussion, should be included within the existential assistance with the end of the cultural and social charity, so that these important institutions can enjoy protection. </SEG> 
<SEG id="4"> Some argue that can create an internal market in Europe without agreeing on values and principles that I sicos. </SEG> 
<SEG id="5"> I would like to pay tribute to the important and substantial of President Prodi. </SEG> 
<SEG id="6"> You know that this is a deliberate that took place in Amsterdam, distinguish between those two functions, the high representative, unlike the Commission, demonstrates with complete independence, but that is how mission to coordinate the policies of foreign and security policy that are within the competence of the Member States, and in this case we have to give a broad and perhaps the Intergovernmental aspect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="7"> The Presidency has requested that way in Nice the path for the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="8"> Indeed, we want more and better, but I think in all honesty that that is a good start. </SEG> 
<SEG id="9"> Accordingly, I trust that the European Council of Nice is associated with this project and decide to start specifically as project, not as a fait accompli, after having approved over the reforms that we now need. </SEG> 
<SEG id="10"> However, as I pointed out, namely that the ndonos at present cannot achieve an extremely important objectives with the Community method with which we have at present, for example, for a better in the Balkans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="11"> Only if we manage to involve Russia in the West, and the European Union, will be able to influence its policy and maintain contact and dialogue with this country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="12"> Motion for a resolution (00 / 00) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on constitutional Affairs on the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union </SEG> 
<SEG id="13"> Continues to perpetrate this genocide, and Furthermore seeks to completely eliminate the freedom of the press and the rule of law, whose existence is already precarious. </SEG> 
<SEG id="14"> Precisely in order to respond to the expectations of this pensioners which is Giuseppe Italia and lives in Cremona, and in which the gustarÃ relates to sail in the Po valley, I voted in favour of the Piecyk report on the potenciaciÃ and the development of ports, much scams, the ports of navegaciÃ internal debate and intermodal terminals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="15"> - (de) the result of the debate held in this Parliament will be impossible to achieve the goal of the directive, an objective recognised, and we have heard all the speakers and the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="16"> Signs now President, I voted in favour of the report as such as to throughout the debate prior to the Commission, because we believe that the risk capital is important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="17"> My company was Group Armonie Bordes signs the debate yesterday, incisive that only a has in the cesiÃ of Community money, and the contributions of the pensions of jubilaciÃ opposition to the risks of the employers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="18"> Consequently, the Charter servirÃ above all to confirm the cticas current practice, including retrograde, of the national States, in place of represent an advance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="19"> Signs now President, Finally have a Charter of the rights of the European citizen that contains an Article, Article 25, entirely devoted to the elderly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="20"> In principle this text can apparently anodyne, because it contains, I sicamente existing rights, but if it is incorporated into the Treaty with binding force, as it calls for the European Parliament, with the time tenderÃ relates to automÃ across the uniformizaciÃ the national rights in Europe; otorgarÃ relates to a disproportionate to the Court of justice; favorecerÃ represents a major centralizaciÃ in relation to the European institutions; limitarÃ relates to the margin of Commission autÃ and other noma of each nation. </SEG>

<SEG id="22"> Irã, to vote for another letter, participating in the manifestations of reasons, on 13 and 14 October, and in Nice on 7 December 2000. </SEG> 
<SEG id="23"> Progress towards the adhesiÃ of the 12 candidate countries </SEG> 
<SEG id="24"> In my opinion, the various States have not understood even today the existence of this connection and the tentative progress of the Intergovernmental Conference can cause damage great difficulties in the time to carry out the necessary at the time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="25"> Not only will be able to carry out in practice with carÃ system cter lasting all the issues that I have mentioned until now if the policy and leader of the candidate countries to the adhesiÃ and of the European Union - and in this sense I give the Commissioner has done, namely to the public that the enlargement of the European Union is in very beneficial. </SEG> 
<SEG id="26"> It is the other way rmula enshrined. </SEG> 
<SEG id="27"> Permã represents tanme mention now the second orientaciÃ which the Presidency wishes to make progress during this six-month period, the process of enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="28"> What I am proposing, then, is to work in this direction with the idea that we must examine, in the perspective of the year 2003, what are the applicant countries that could join in this date. </SEG> 
<SEG id="29"> I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his thorough and clear report, as well as to the system of rapporteurs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="30"> In these negotiations is not raised in the case of the ningun "if... ', but the' how 'and the' cÃºando". </SEG> 
<SEG id="31"> But what we have achieved, because the prospect of becoming Members of the European Union, provides hope in the solidarity of the European peoples and because it demands of enlargement for the lidos basics and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="32"> Several countries have been recorded, with regard to the second criterion of competitiveness in the internal market, so the advances that approach with great haste in compliance with the requirements of the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="33"> For that reason, we intend that's with the programmes of the national governments, the European Parliament and other institutions is as close as possible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="34"> In all of the adhesiÃ opposition, with muchÃ ­ schism concern the opinion that gave the Commission annually on its progress, and this goes back to be issued shortly, on 8 November. </SEG> 
<SEG id="35"> We have chosen, and rightly, the principle of the diferenciaciÃ, under which each candidate will be judged on its own merits. </SEG> 
<SEG id="36"> This debate represents another occasion for my Group to underline that the adhesiÃ States of Central and Eastern Europe, and Cyprus and Malta, is the best guarantee of future for all of us in Europe, both in the East and in the West. </SEG> 
<SEG id="37"> It is a matter of the forthcoming importance and, despite that, Interestingly, just has attracted the attention of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="38"> The people spent jokes saying that after the collapse of the Berlin wall, the Commission continues to five years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="39"> The next occasion natural it in connection with the next elections to the European Parliament from the year 2009, but want to work hard to ensure that the largest possible number of countries can join already in the year 2004. </SEG> 
<SEG id="40"> By else, are six of the points of substance which we are concerned by the method followed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="41"> In fact, we are, of course, on the model of the construction of the European Commission, that is to say: the simultÃ region of all sectors of activity, beyond the traditions or of the specific characteristics of each other, will be back in a trap. </SEG> 
<SEG id="42"> Their words have the support of the President of the Central Bank hÃºngaro: "the European Union should give the precise", otherwise, Eastern Europe sospecharÃ that Europe is not working seriously on, something that could end in a desilusiÃ dangerous about the promises of Brussels - and I quote the spokesman hÃºngaro -. </SEG> 
<SEG id="43"> But things must be clear: there cannot be a membership with reductions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="44"> This is an idea that is also a big idea: do not realise the enlargements against public opinion, and the best way to carry out enlargement with the supposed to their participation in elections, since the elections are the expression of democracy and the adhesiÃ all of the citizens of the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="45"> (de) signs now President, orÃ powers, I would like to say something briefly about the conditions of the desired stage here by several parties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="46"> I quedarÃ very surprised if not ejerciesen that pressure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="47"> But I have already pointed out that all the countries approach with the haste to maturity for. </SEG> 
<SEG id="48"> This means that the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products is already agreed, that the Polish people have the impression that it was brought down their agriculture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="49"> Have needed efforts, but, in general, the peace and trade have established strong ties between the citizens, now still more products and other lidos with monetary Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="50"> What we need is to be the result of the negotiations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="51"> The only amendment that has been tabled already covered in my report, but I am pleased that the Group of the Greens would like to underline the importance of equal treatment for the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="52"> This is not a law on the public service but also that there are opportunities for Germany and other venes employees of the Bush administration and an adequate payment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="53"> This applies both to Latvia as to the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="54"> Has the vinculaciÃ lita planned introduction of the euro in the second half of the year 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="55"> (it) now President, but Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am rapporteur, is the major and important, but, as we know, is the problemÃ the countries that are ready to join the European Union, so problemÃ that there are about its possible exclusion from the first Group of countries that entrarÃ in first place. </SEG> 
<SEG id="56"> In addition, the countries of the East, the countries that were Communists have made many promises have not fulfilled. </SEG> 
<SEG id="57"> It is a point that always arises when it comes to the Czech Republic, which is the problem of the Roma. </SEG> 
<SEG id="58"> Slovakia is not condemned to the second Group, and is there than will join as it does the Czech Republic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="59"> At the same time, I would like, Finally, to make a observaciÃ on internal policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="60"> Thirdly, and as far as agriculture is concerned, whose level of productivity is inferior to that of the European Union, it is important to ensure the total opening up of the market in agricultural policy to the capital needed for privatisation of the land, the farms and the structures of comercializaciÃ as well as for the improvement of incomes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="61"> Bulgaria is waiting with bated breath the moment of accession to the European Union and NATO. </SEG> 
<SEG id="62"> Poverty has been keen to a fundamental problem of Romania since 1990 and with the current government of the economy, at last, giving real signs of improvement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="63"> I trust that these issues are in the priorities of the new Parliament that I posesiÃ within the next few days, and the new government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="64"> But I also Alamos signs that the final, fair and permanent must fully respect the once the relevant resolutions of the security Council of the United Nations, which is neither more nor less than the current international law, and the principles which govern the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="65"> Malta has Furthermore a stable institutions that operate democratically. </SEG> 
<SEG id="66"> - (FR) four President, but Commissioner, orÃ aims, on behalf of the Committee on economic and monetary Affairs, we want to make our contribution to this debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="67"> Have also apply to the European Community law is not a law in the books, but that has to be in the applicant countries a law in action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="68"> This transformaciÃ Commission raises a tough requirements to the people in the candidate countries but, at the same time provides for its future, and the future of their children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="69"> We must devote a special - on which I agree with the previous speaker - to the border regions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="70"> In this context, we must not Let alone to the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="71"> The candidate countries want to achieve a growth, if this takes place at the expense of a policy of protection of nature previously established. </SEG> 
<SEG id="72"> We are faced with a traffic round of bad habits, many of them linked to health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="73"> . signs now President, it is imperative for the construction of a strong and United European continent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="74"> The European Parliament and its Committee on regional policy, which is competent in the domain of the transport and of the trans-European networks, is aware that it is necessary to coordinate the different sectoral Community policies in favour of a political project of ordenaciÃ's territory. </SEG> 
<SEG id="75"> But first I would like to make the observation that the transport infrastructure is going to be of Central importance to the success of enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="76"> (da) now President, I join in the chorus of those who say that the forthcoming enlargement is now the major task facing the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="77"> There has been a great pressure on the traditional social values in Central and Eastern Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="78"> The PPE-DE does not encroach on the responsibilities of the candidates in regard to the rate of, since we cannot give a date for this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="79"> The second point is the menciÃ of deadlines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="80"> In addition, there is another reason. </SEG> 
<SEG id="81"> Thirdly: the Commission and its positive prospects for the various countries and for the EU in its entirety depend - and it has shown in large measure of course which would reduce the budget deficits, and of the policy of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="82"> The populism is the epÃ represents teto 'that the tecnÃ Democrats attach to the popular will, when this is expressed in a sense that suits them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="83"> Ladies orÃ companies, have a break to eat and rest. we will continue at 9 p.m. </SEG> 
<SEG id="84"> In a longer term, a common currency at the whole continent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="85"> On these topics focus internal struggles in each of the countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="86"> The call to fight for a different Europe, of all people, who were rid of all these caracterÃ represents sticas inhumane, in which the people are dueÃ years of its chance, developing relations of peace, freedom, in our opinion, colaboraciÃ benÃ the area recÃ represents proca. </SEG> 
<SEG id="87"> Have we pÃºblicamente the work of these organisations and, in particular, in that it is based on people and other organisations Irish supported by many people, including economy or the donnell, the artist varieties irlandÃ after enlargement, that prometiÃ one of pounds sterling and recaudÃ that amount in Ireland and other parts of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="88"> The Nice Summit should bring about all clarity about whether and how we are going to act for the EU, for its part, to be in macro-economic she herself to enlarge in depth and in time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="89"> The Polish people are asking: what we pagarÃ when we espouse or will countries for categorÃ? </SEG> 
<SEG id="90"> I am sure that, with good will and with the support of the European Union, will be able to find a solution which would allow the two communities to live in and flourish as we have done for centuries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="91"> But we have dealt with the issue of the minorÃ aims, as the issue of the integration of these minorÃ companies, including the European Union lingÃ areas, is also of importance in these countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="92"> The requirement to be Commissioner, that is, the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria. </SEG> 
<SEG id="93"> We have spoken of the benefits of the enlargement, and this is one of the areas in which Lithuania shows us the way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="94"> That imagÃ represents nense if all fuÃ were as they! </SEG> 
<SEG id="95"> Signs now President, however, Commissioner, I too would like to thank and congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs, but, first of all, I should like to confine myself to Slovakia, namely, the policy of the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="96"> I urge you to that in Nice setting a date of up to ndo prevÃ also to conclude the negotiations with the candidate countries advanced - without mentioning names. </SEG> 
<SEG id="97"> The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its progress for the entry into the Union and, since then, making the planificaciÃ of that aid is still more decentralised. </SEG> 
<SEG id="98"> The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of the civil society, the government and the Parliament desempeÃ through in this regard an important role and, as we have seen, positive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="99"> We are running out precisely with the division of Europe into two, and not by creating a new division. </SEG> 
<SEG id="100"> All this is contained in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne and congratulate him very sincerely on behalf of our Group for this report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="101"> From this point of view, I believe that the subject of Cyprus is that going to assess the ability of Europe to see their caracterÃ represents sticas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="102"> I live near the sea, whose situation concerns us all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="103"> The political remains the same. </SEG> 
<SEG id="104"> Therefore, I was very Nice to listen to Mr Klaus, who spoke on behalf of the PSE Group, as have hoped that the Commission will be able to give a verdict on the actual consequences of enlargement, and also about the repercussions that to be felt in the case of not be carried out. </SEG> 
<SEG id="105"> However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, that without the terms of transiciÃ cannot operate in the interests of both sides, precisely as a Member of a border region which, as Mrs Schierhuber, possesses a farm agricultural close to the Czech border, it is very important that arise areas of common payoffs beyond the approximate without major problems and that will lead to positive results on both sides. </SEG> 
<SEG id="106"> I want to highlight three aspects as socialdemÃ and other crata. </SEG> 
<SEG id="107"> The EEA, in which included the issues of the first pillar, the accession of the economies of the candidate countries to the internal market and to the otorgarÃ from other venes and for the right to take part in the exchange programmes, but, on the other hand, we do not obligarÃ system to the EU to extend still his of agricultural subsidies to those countries in this way, the agreement on the contribuirÃ - to be able to give a positive impetus, primarily, to the economies of the candidate countries, which is in need of growth for putting their societies in conditions of their opinion - but also to the national economies of the EU, for it is estimated that, in the economic growth, could cover even two thirds of the total costs of the enlargement, and perhaps more still if we went to the model of the EEA. </SEG> 
<SEG id="108"> Secondly: say no to the idea of  consists of accepting a large Group of countries simultÃ candidates, neamente, since that is opondrÃ relates to the principle that the countries are agreed on its own merits. </SEG> 
<SEG id="109"> Thirdly, we must do everything in our power to work until the end to the European Union for the process of enlargement in the sense of the magnÃ specific intervenciÃ from the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi. </SEG> 
<SEG id="110"> In this context, I would like to refer to the relationship between Parliament and the Council and alar that Ãºltimamente the Council responds with a delay to the written questions from Members. </SEG> 
<SEG id="111"> It is worrying that this is happening in a country which is going to join the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="112"> I call upon the Commission to devoluciÃ for their cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="113"> (SV) now President, today, discussing and perhaps vote three reports dealing with this matter, both of whom are children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="114"> All those involved in the food chain is verÃ could benefit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="115"> The safe food has a cost in the whole of the food chain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="116"> Therefore, we must support to Mrs Paulsen, and to the Commission, and to adopt the principle of no-disoluciÃ, to give security to the alimentaciÃ animal and genuinely to protect European consumers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="117"> The directive of 1999 is a document well thought out and since may display algÃºn, since we have managed to reduce the burdens of demonstrable manner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="118"> But simply admit the possibility of "dilute" products is not the solution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="119"> Very quickly, that we must insist on the amendment 37, relating to the dioxin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="120"> On this point, we are in agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="121"> Therefore, the result is that, as European consumers, will continue to buying meat and milk and beef products produced in the world markets with feedingstuffs which bear no ningÃºn type of relationship with the thresholds and the values of political mite that we have established as the European Union, and with a system of production of animal feed which acquiring raw materials on the international markets, free of any principle and formulaciÃ before to sell their products in the territory of the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="122"> Before the second reading, we need to know the opinion of the Commission on how realizarÃ; the risk factors. </SEG> 
<SEG id="123"> On the contrary, it would be regrettable that they were to be adopted, for example, amendments Nos 39 and 40, since that will demonstrate that desaparecerÃ relates to the possibility of the Member States to intervene promptly in the face of the new dangers that they are found. </SEG> 
<SEG id="124"> The protection of consumers starts by the alimentaciÃ animal, by the content of feedingstuffs, his and, Finally, its administrative control. </SEG> 
<SEG id="125"> Yet President, ladies orÃ companies, the report of Mrs Paulsen on undesirable substances in animal deals with an important topic which, as all the important issues, raise many discrepancies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="126"> President, the debate about this good report of Mrs Paulsen had an emotional on a few points, and I think that, once we have completed this debate, we must proceed on the basis that the requirements demanded in the industry for the cattle fodder certainly are strict but continuation can make the quality be amended by adding components. </SEG> 
<SEG id="127"> These three proposals to address, individually and collectively, the serious deficiencies that the dioxin crisis has brought to light. </SEG> 
<SEG id="128"> Amendment no 33 to remove the possibility of reexportar the country of origin of the items not administrative. </SEG> 
<SEG id="129"> Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which aim to introduce the possibility of diluciÃ in certain conditions of raw materials for contaminated feed, are unacceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="130"> That should be sufficient, bearing in mind our commitment to establish a rapid alert system to cover the entire food chain and alimentaciÃ animal in the new proposal on the food authority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="131"> Signs now Commissioner Byrne, in the wake of this directive on the comercializaciÃ of compound feedingstuffs lies in the background of an old problem, namely, that of the open. </SEG> 
<SEG id="132"> This is already a profit that has brought the later this morning. </SEG> 
<SEG id="133"> If we do so, if so what transponemos and if we supplement quickly the procedure of codecisiÃ, no doubt, we will have gained a great deal, and I am sure that we will be able to maintain a very firm and unanimously nime before the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="134"> Signs now President, ladies and gentlemen, we can return to occur in the future, or at least it cannot be ruled out that in animal feed was introduced contaminated raw materials. </SEG> 
<SEG id="135"> The skeptical system ndalo of BSE was the example of more serious and known. </SEG> 
<SEG id="136"> Of common sense - what the rapporteur has said - would obviously have a label open, that the list of ingredients. </SEG> 
<SEG id="137"> I believe that the cualificaciÃ cooperation and competence of the Members of the Committee on agriculture to judge on the issues associated with the Commission and with the alimentaciÃ animal is unquestionable from the point of view of the pursuit of a Commission with a orientaciÃ Commission and practicable, that the farmers and consumers concerned can apply and to understand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="138"> Even the positive side. </SEG> 
<SEG id="139"> In my opinion, it is a legÃ maritime law to the information which must be met. </SEG> 
<SEG id="140"> I ask, Madam President, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on fisheries and in the country itself, or that it and the loss of the same from Parliament to the families of the victims and to the local authorities of both as of human, Galicia, which most of the victims. </SEG> 
<SEG id="141"> (Parliament adopted the resolution) </SEG> 
<SEG id="142"> There algÃºn colleague who is opposed to the presentation of this oral amendment? </SEG> 
<SEG id="143"> It is just as the rapporteur has explained things. </SEG> 
<SEG id="144"> The most of its proposed technical deserve to be supported with enthusiasm, for example those relating to food safety, the decommissioning of nuclear power plants at first, the protection of the environment, the fight against social dumping, the requisite code of conduct of business in the West when working on this, etc., the task is enormous, and also absolute priority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="145"> At the same time, to overcome the barriers are considerable, above all at the level of the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="146"> The thirteen countries not modify the geopolÃ political framework of the European Union, but also to alter its structure, because of the total is going to increase (+ 28%), but at the same time the number of disadvantaged regions ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="147"> In this context, we must bear in mind that, due to its strong and economic and social cohesion, a sector of the agricultural and food competitiveness is going to have a decisive factor for the success of the process of transformaciÃ and reestructuraciÃ of the candidate countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="148"> In this sense, I gustarÃ that ultraperifÃ peripheral regions, which have each, still feature in the Group of the 10 poorest of the EU, should benefit from the structural funds, not only on the basis of the criterion of GDP, but also on the basis of indicators geogrÃ, demogrÃ system and above all social. </SEG> 
<SEG id="149"> As we reject, for the sake of the French, cannot, in all conscience, approve its enlargement to the countries and the peoples of this, just released from the Communist dictatorship, which still cannot meet the trap tecnocrÃ and totalitarian in wishing to fall. </SEG> 
<SEG id="150"> Hubiã, semos due to be content with the national reports and, as, with a brief, but full of content. </SEG> 
<SEG id="151"> The current system, with subsidies, AIDS and quotas, should be replaced by the free trade and the adecuaciÃ opposition to the markets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="152"> The importance and the extent of the problems raised by the Commission are incompatible with the double language which she has been used within the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="153"> For me to speak of enlargement does not recognise the membership or membership of some countries to Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="154"> Our neighbouring has endeavoured with Commission during the last ten years in order to meet the criteria. </SEG> 
<SEG id="155"> Latvia has its place in this Chamber, not only because its progress globally, you are entitled to this "system of" essential to complete with the success of a debate of this kind, but, above all, and above all, because in Europe in their home. </SEG> 
<SEG id="156"> Gawronski with this report, and I think that Poland is the State, among all those who have called for the, which deserves more than other our support, given that, without the importantÃ ­ depths initiatives of Poland, not dropped Communism and today would prefer here discussing this problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="157"> It is not so evident to the Commission, which remains the most euroescÃ, ptica. </SEG> 
<SEG id="158"> I urge you to Prague to accept this signs in, this request, this request to establish a dialogue, and to respond to him and to ensure, together with this House, so that it will be possible to overcome this legacy of a nationalist era. </SEG> 
<SEG id="159"> I welcome the report on the application of adhesiÃ of Slovakia to the European Union, and I share the greater part of the conclusions to which is the rapporteur. </SEG> 
<SEG id="160"> I am very happy to take advantage of this occasion to address a very special to elderly people and pensioners of the Republic of bÃºlgara. such as it says in the report of Mr. </SEG> 
<SEG id="161"> If Romania continues to progress, and the European Union adapts his institutional structure and its policies in order to be able to cope with enlargement, I see no reason why that Romania should not be admitted in the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="162"> Anyone who is the solution that was taken regarding the settlers, and is one of the most difficult issues, along with the devoluciÃ of land on both sides, it is too hard, if we do not make a few caveats. </SEG> 
<SEG id="163"> Unfortunately, some of the comments that the Committee on foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy dumped in the draft report on the application of adhesiÃ of Cyprus to the European Union does not facilitate the things. </SEG> 
<SEG id="164"> This task will not be, if we consider the lack of willingness of the Turkish part of Cyprus and Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="165"> Stenzel report (A5-0243 / 2000) </SEG> 
<SEG id="166"> Unfortunately, sufrÃ represents a slight intoxicaciÃ food legislation in the European Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="167"> For all these reasons, I voted in favour of the enlargement of the disoluciÃ proposed in the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="168"> We must urge the countries of the third in the present resolution which should put pressure on the military regime in Burma to re-establish democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="169"> We are, in our approach and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="170"> We cannot afford to be pusilÃ system nimes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="171"> Some important aspects of the regulation are: Firstly, the burden of proof. </SEG> 
<SEG id="172"> The equality of treatment and discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="173"> That is why we need a legislation against discrimination. </SEG> 
<SEG id="174"> In part, as a result of this, we have in front of us a great number of amendments and technical dicas presumed that aim to ensure a level of equality of treatment against discrimination on grounds of race, on the one hand, and for reasons of, disability, age and sexual orientation, on the other hand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="175"> There was to make an effort to balance, moderaciÃ and good technical presumed and his report reflects, I consider these qualities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="176"> I also believe that the cases of discrimination are not as many as to merit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="177"> In the programme there are not enough funds to replace this work which is developing in the fifth framework programme and that, ojalÃ, to take follow-up in all of the system 's framework programmes, although we will have to ensure that are compatible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="178"> All over the world in accordance with which we must fight against discrimination, but the opinions varÃ could about how to do so, to what extent and with methods. </SEG> 
<SEG id="179"> I took the opportunity, in the Commission, indignarme against the fact that experts could be out of the experts and still have things to say. </SEG> 
<SEG id="180"> We are also very pleased with the provision of the directive that makes it clear that equal treatment for whom also means that, of the companies that carry out adjustments in the place of work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="181"> Only thus will fight effectively against discrimination in all areas mbitos of human coexistence in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="182"> After all, as we enseÃ designed the great democracies anglosajonas, racism and discrimination are fighting with the Liberal democracy and not with the limitaciÃ or the ongoing erosiÃ the freedom of opinion and expression, association and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="183"> We have a proposal which raises homosexuality in the same categorÃ relates to the Holy marriage. </SEG> 
<SEG id="184"> Thus it reinforces the positions of the European Union for specific situations seen by their inhabitants with regard to the Commission and to the equality of treatment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="185"> I also want to comment on the issue of the religious. </SEG> 
<SEG id="186"> There are those who has expressed its concern for the possible interpretation of the recitals relating to Article 1, which, once more, may seem unclear, but make a distinction between the sexual and behaviour. </SEG> 
<SEG id="187"> So that there is jerarquÃ powers on the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="188"> In new Caledonia preference is given on a basis of cromÃ the skin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="189"> The first positive element of the directive is the universal approach since that the treatment of discrimination, which is of particular importance if it wants to an adequate aplicaciÃ from the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="190"> So those who come here to say that Europe must not be collected in a directive the values which we all want to defend, confused. </SEG> 
<SEG id="191"> We should not interfere in these achievements that we reached with many efforts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="192"> Finally, orÃ companies, the media should play an important role in this task. </SEG> 
<SEG id="193"> Experience has shown that the promotion of legislative measures in the fight against discrimination is essential, but not enough. </SEG> 
<SEG id="194"> We must avoid transit mites burocrÃ democratic absurd, which only that conseguirÃ they will reduce Europe to a purely mercenary, ticamente correct, but devoid of meaning. </SEG> 
<SEG id="195"> I think that this Parliament has been padded out as if it were a rbol Christmas the little forward legislation that the Commission would have liked to put on the table. </SEG> 
<SEG id="196"> I would like to start by thanking both rapporteurs, Mrs Mann and Mr Cashman, this excellent report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="197"> Aceptarã, the amendments that seek to highlight the importance of preventing and fighting against discrimination. </SEG> 
<SEG id="198"> The second categorÃ Turkey has the aim to clarify the text of the proposal of the Commission and the third includes a large number of amendments which seek to adapt the present proposal to the directive on the race, adopted last June. </SEG> 
<SEG id="199"> In particular, the amendments 9, 10 and 20 proposes the of the reference to the discrimination on the grounds of racial and ethnic origin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="200"> I cannot accept the references to the Parliament on amendments Nos 21 and 34 on the people of that country and sicas presumed dicas, as well as to the unofficial groupings, because this proposal on employment is only applicable to individuals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="201"> The Commission will place tomorrow at 12 noon. </SEG> 
<SEG id="202"> We cannot wait for a public support of the operations of establishing peace, if our troops are set to die as a result of shells from weapons that we ourselves have supplied. </SEG> 
<SEG id="203"> In my own country, to have a escopeta necesitarÃ relates to a licence, but not for instalarme as seller of weapons in a cobertizo of my jardÃ represents. </SEG> 
<SEG id="204"> Another important point is the, promotion and comercializaciÃ of equipment and know-how used to inflict torture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="205"> Having said this, I would naturally like to congratulate our colleague Mr Titley on his excellent report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="206"> We must extend our examination of, on the one hand, in addition to the issues of binding force, to other aspects outside the equipment for strictly military use, such as the own disarmament and to increase the effectiveness of the body of police and customs authorities, and then, on the other hand, to the candidate countries, as has just been mentioned by Mr Wiersma. </SEG> 
<SEG id="207"> The control over the money makes it very difficult to circumvent the provisions on the arms trade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="208"> The aim of the annual report is to find possible improvements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="209"> The European Union is currently examining the possibility of the project to resume their expiraciÃ in November of this year. </SEG>

<SEG id="211"> Thank you, but Commissioner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="212"> With regard to the problems of the SMEs, naturally we have seen that in the framework programme, SMEs will have its part, as was provided in the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="213"> It is, at least, what seems to colegirse from the debate on the budget in Greece; and the fact is that many invoke the points of view of the European Union is so true?. </SEG> 
<SEG id="214"> With regard to the pluridisciplinaridad, I share your view. </SEG> 
<SEG id="215"> The first is that it has mentioned in his report, the participation of the EU in national programmes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="216"> Not as possible to speak of a European area of research if we only represent 5% of this investigation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="217"> Thank you very much, Commissioner Busquin yet. </SEG> 
<SEG id="218"> On the one hand, and the effort made to commit fully the funds at the end of the year 1999, the calls in ultimately at the beginning of this year for the financiaciÃ of new projects were necessarily very reduced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="219"> But I repeat that Portugal did the right thing in the previous period, which simply want to point out, and I give you the figures for 26 September, is that the funds actually committed on the part of Portugal and for the new period, (but I am, since a year ago) reaching a 2.6%. </SEG>

<SEG id="221"> Finally, the fijaciÃ a high level of taxation of customs and excise on mineral oils does not lead to a no-cumplimiento of Community provisions on competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="222"> In the second place, as you know, Mr MacCormick, in cases in which the Member States in favour by means of specific sector of industry, in breach of the rules on State aid, in this case the measures on State aid, which amounts to a. </SEG>

<SEG id="225"> (de) signs now President, Members of Parliament will no doubt already knows that the structural funds - and this is new - many resources allocated to cultural activities, because I have insisted, Michel Barnier, in that these are not only to invest in roads and airports, but also in the people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="226"> So that the next year the Commission will formulate new financial commitments in this regard. </SEG> 
<SEG id="227"> In relation to the specific proposal for financiaciÃ, it is not possible to adopt a common position, since it must respect the normal procedures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="228"> (SV) I intend in many alternatives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="229"> And it is a reality which we must face, because we are talking about millions of small and medium-sized enterprises in the whole of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="230"> Do the rules relating to the treatment of products, for example the elk hunting, apply also to the meat used for their own use? </SEG> 
<SEG id="231"> If these rules are applied to the meat which consume the hunters, significarÃ relates to a system of strofe burocrÃ problematic for the elk hunting. </SEG> 
<SEG id="232"> When it was concluded that report, I propose to present proposals to improve the transport of animals and the problem of the insufficient observance of the temporary hours in the coming weeks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="233"> In the celebrÃ, with which the Group of the Greens are examining this issue. </SEG>

<SEG id="240"> The elections are an important step for the population of Kosovo participate in their communities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="241"> I can tell you that the development of those elections has been, rather that the elections in our own countries, in which I took part on many occasions or have been observer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="242"> But what veÃ had as a principle and not, in any way, as the end of the process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="243"> The report calls for a better control and closed on the arms trade and a greater transparency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="244"> Now I find that every year to increase the contracts for weapons and arms components. </SEG> 
<SEG id="245"> We cannot take real decisions based on information and realities apparent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="246"> The resolution which we have maintained together in the same who should be the subject of. </SEG> 
<SEG id="247"> Although these institutions should have the option of appoint an internal auditor, is enough to impose certain requirements of auditorÃ relates to the financial controller. </SEG> 
<SEG id="248"> This proposal does not with the unanimous approval of this Parliament as well know the Commissioner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="249"> Therefore, we do not have any against the creation of a service of auditorÃ relates to internal independent, which today to give the Green light to the report by Mr van Hulten. </SEG> 
<SEG id="250"> Signs now President, Madam Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur. </SEG> 
<SEG id="251"> The administration is urgently needed in our view. </SEG> 
<SEG id="252"> A auditorÃ relates to independent, it is imperative to avoid mistakes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="253"> The money must be spent on the future of way close to the objectives and effective, and of course also must ensure that the funds are used for the purposes for which it was intended to the budgetary authority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="254"> With regard to the proposed amendments, I should like alar signs very briefly: the Commission accepts the introduction of additional recital. </SEG> 
<SEG id="255"> Consequently, I want to thank you for your proposals and their advice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="256"> I would like to sum up the proposals in this report which seem to me to be important and, in particular, viable, first, the creation of a Group of experts formed by personalities of recognised standing, appointed by the Member States, to contribute to establishing a parameters, represents nimos of protection mediÃ political minors; second, the creation of a code of autorregulaciÃ between all operators in the sector; Thirdly, the possibility of further and become accessible the filter systems for both the televisiÃ as to the Internet. </SEG> 
<SEG id="257"> Unfortunately, I cannot subscribe to the requests of the Liberals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="258"> It remains, I sicamente task of the legislation of the Member States, which does not exclude, however, the possibility of a consensual agreement at European level on certain indicative values, the dialogue with all the parties involved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="259"> Nevertheless, and equality in other circumstances, I think that it is the task of the parents to deter their children that see this type of programmes in the House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="260"> Parents need special support in this area mbito, which must include the following: common parameters for the protection of minors mediÃ democratic throughout the territory of the European Union; the instalaciÃ and the possibility of having filter systems at affordable prices; legal provisions relating to the protection of minors and the responsibility of the media, the companies and the service of the public and the private sector. </SEG> 
<SEG id="261"> So I extraÃ, and it is a euphemism, hear some claim, during the debates in Committee, that there is no proof of the influence that may have harmful to children, on the television, the violence in all its forms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="262"> With regard to the introduction of a code of autorregulaciÃ, it should be noted, particularly from the point of view, that in certain Member States have already introduced the broadcasters to other digos of adjustment for television screens which allow for parents to cut off the current. </SEG> 
<SEG id="263"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="264"> In particular, my report replaces the valuable generalisations by an international devoluciÃ, indeed, of the decisions to the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="265"> This would at least to give us that space of freedom is a fundamental right of every citizen of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="266"> There is still, Mr President, that things have not been paid since 1996. </SEG> 
<SEG id="267"> Signs now President, Madam Commissioner, ladies orÃ, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Evans and Mario, the work carried out. </SEG> 
<SEG id="268"> I recomendarÃ relates to this report to the House and recomendarÃ relates to the support for the amendments tabled by Mr Evans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="269"> Our human resources are our only future in a world where knowledge is what it is. </SEG> 
<SEG id="270"> Not resolving the problems with Green papers, White, black or red, but with a specific action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="271"> But the European Parliament, and it is the role of Parliament, the presionÃ for researchers were all included in the same text. </SEG> 
<SEG id="272"> Today we visit at a crucial time for the future of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="273"> However, we know that the process has been concluded and that its inconclusiÃ threatens their vitality. </SEG> 
<SEG id="274"> If we do not say this now, in this delicate and tumultuosa stage of European and world history, what ndo do? </SEG> 
<SEG id="275"> None of us can now claim to know exactly what ndo and with what sequence achieve these objectives. however, we all know that believe in them and I very much hope, we wanted to ndolos who half way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="276"> We must ensure that women take advantage of the jobs involved, so Let us avoid reproduce the same inequalities in the traditional sectors: jobs less specialized, a part-time sometimes not elected, contracts insecure and difficulties of access to the jobs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="277"> Is presentarÃ system to the Council a proposal of indicators to measure the progress achieved in this respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="278"> By past and said in a few words, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reaffirms the integrated approach of equality with the gender mainstreaming and specific directives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="279"> I think in particular of the violence suffered by them, one of the key points of my government action and that mobilises in particular - resolution - to their signs orÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="280"> We know that the measures of conciliation of family and professional life favour particularly women, although still fall short of studies on the current situation of the family and the role that women desempeÃ through in the same, that is no longer the traditional, since that society has changed a great deal and, in parallel, the structure of the family. </SEG> 
<SEG id="281"> Sometimes, including colleagues in this Parliament believes that there, but it is not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="282"> However, I would like to end by saying that the equal opportunities starts in the home. </SEG> 
<SEG id="283"> That seems to me embarrassing and ambiguous and deserves, I believe, reflexiÃ for projects that we are proposing, as it is not certain that with all that desemboquemos in practice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="284"> In this area there is no equality. </SEG> 
<SEG id="285"> The image of women, which is to be found throughout the period of ginas of our report, our directive, does not square with those women Danish opponents in its most to the euro. </SEG> 
<SEG id="286"> In this sense I seems significant that the report ’ s emphasis on that has to achieve a balance in the richer in all sectors of society, for example in the labour market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="287"> For this reason, it seems to me that an opportunity has been missed in this report because the marriage and the family remain completely marginalised. </SEG> 
<SEG id="288"> That is something that we worsen--could to take into consideration the Committee on women's rights and equal opportunities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="289"> We have heard that the previous Presidency of the Council, first reestructurÃ the Ministry of equality of opportunities for their country to then away. </SEG> 
<SEG id="290"> The salaries means of women is still lower, by "means, in almost a 28% of men, which helps to ensure that women are the most of the poor and makes its participation in social and political life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="291"> This is excellent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="292"> Today we see in Europe a pauperizaciÃ women employees and in France, where the 15% of them live, in the final analysis, with less 3.650 French francs per month. </SEG> 
<SEG id="293"> Not all the countries have managed to follow his example and I hope that the example of France would fructificando in other countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="294"> Of course, the history of women is very long. </SEG> 
<SEG id="295"> We must help of true to the candidates to set the level of the Community acquis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="296"> But necesitarÃ their support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="297"> It is not the case, but it is a text satisfactory and, after careful at length and in the wake of a wide debate, the Committee on legal Affairs with by not to table amendments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="298"> The Committee on legal Affairs, after a long debate, entendiÃ that was not reasonable to maintain the insecurity presumed dica for six years, that three years, which is the deadline that was established, is a term that reasonable for that, with the appropriate means and a diligence medium-sized, can come to establish whether there has been or irregularity in a. </SEG> 
<SEG id="299"> This is amendment no 10 15, relating to fraud. </SEG> 
<SEG id="300"> The aim of getting above all to a simplified but of high quality with a regulation that is sufficiently flexible, with an improvement in the procedure recaudatorio and with a major adaptaciÃ the provisions in the transit of the customs mites, responds to one of the requirements of the market and has achieved only, so that even many countries have been based on it in order to be able to participate in international trade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="301"> This, their effort and the interest with which we have worked on the redacciÃ this report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="302"> Welcome </SEG> 
<SEG id="303"> Desearã that that does not change the meaning of the vote which was expresarÃ system, but the truth is that we need to check the traducciÃ from the French. </SEG> 
<SEG id="304"> Signs now President, I voted in favour of the Evans report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="305"> It is recognised that the knowledge of foreign languages is a necessary precondition for mobility. </SEG> 
<SEG id="306"> I also believe that the Member States, by themselves, they will choose the taxes that wish to apply. </SEG> 
<SEG id="307"> I regret that the proposal so necessary to introduce a deadline of prescripciÃ which allows preserve documentation for a limited period has not received the most votes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="308"> During the negotiations of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we are pleased with the inserciÃ from Article 13 on discrimination based on sex, race or ethnic origin, the religiÃ or filosÃ convictions and other ficas not sectarian, disability, age and sexual orientation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="309"> My observaciÃ final relates to the budget of this programme, that is to say, or million, a sum that is, of course, not enough for the actions planned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="310"> The arguments put forward in this amendment is that its purpose is to intervene in the stipulations of age in force in the Member States, which are, however, perfectly justified on the grounds of development cooperation psicolÃ gico and have no repercusiÃ in working life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="311"> In my opinion, it is also especially as stipulated in the new Article 12 (a). </SEG> 
<SEG id="312"> Regarding the belief or the, the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection in this area mbito. </SEG> 
<SEG id="313"> (SV) the cristianodemÃ Democrats welcome the proposal for a directive on equality in the workplace. </SEG> 
<SEG id="314"> But it only says something of the staff of a service of auditorÃ relates to internal and nothing of the importance of financial or the usefulness of such a service. </SEG>

<SEG id="316"> The world safer without arms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="317"> With this resolution does not want a radical reduction in the sale of arms to promote a policy of disarmament, but only regulate it to ensure than the profits of industrial groups. </SEG> 
<SEG id="318"> The Commission recognises the problem but not proposes concrete measures because ofuscada on the other gica of the liberalization of the market and of competitiveness, and thus no proposal touches the harsh reality, especially for children, the unaccountability of the multinational companies, which, in their pursuit of profit, ignore the repercusiÃ their programmes and products and transferring all the responsibility to the parents, invitÃ system ndolos addition to use new products to protect their children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="319"> Like the rapporteur, I believe that the measures designed to protect the financial administration of the programmes venes violent and harmful should not be limited to the televisiÃ traditional, but to apply all of the media. </SEG> 
<SEG id="320"> With an average of three hours a day, it is the human activity important after the dream and, for adults, after the work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="321"> On the other hand, women are often placed 'flexible'; the temporary contracts or the low salaries are typical of the sectors which are most to women. </SEG>

<SEG id="333"> Unfortunately, we all want not to have to return to speak of Colombia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="334"> The Commission has already shown its to coordinate the measures of this package in the next days intends to allocate substantial resources to this end. </SEG> 
<SEG id="335"> Therefore, once more, apply two weights and two measures, and I believe that we must deploring it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="336"> The attitude adopted by the Albanian I find it particularly incomprehensible, since that refuses to accept a it intended to remedy a problem albanÃ in Macedonia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="337"> It seems to me that it is rather extraordinary that the Macedonians in their country 's reach agreements between products. </SEG> 
<SEG id="338"> However, the government, which has shown an enormous courage in seeking a solution to the problem and many other matters, needs to be clear positive signs as a strong support, otherwise, the consequences for peace in the area can be harmful. </SEG>

<SEG id="344"> We have to bear in mind that this too is a question of the credibility of the European Union. </SEG>

Madam President, and the Members of Parliament, discÃºlpenme by having arrived a little late for reasons that their signs orÃ companies well known, to make a brevÃ ­ schism declaraciÃ on the two issues that are in the order of the debate: the situation in Belgrade, and in the ex-repÃºblica of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="347"> Commissioner Verheugen is going to say, as I have done, Mr Solana, on the two issues that we dealt with this evening, that is to say the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="348"> We have to be prepared to keep this promise in this respect the will of the people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="349"> Madam President, however high representative, Commissioner, but I have taken part in this debate with reservations, because it does not querÃ that Parliament having named names; hence Ãºnicamente as a judge authorised to launch an anathema against such or which, at a time when, in the wake of the hopes so strongly encouraged here myself a month ago, we have to face the consequences of this new system dramÃ policies explosiÃ of violence in the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="350"> Madam President, my intervenciÃ today is not based on a series of analysis to distance, but in my own experiences of the last week, since by chance, I was in jerusalÃ and in the Gaza Strip as took these disturbances. </SEG> 
<SEG id="351"> Although I am against all violence, cannot be dealt with in the same way the violence and the Palestinian violence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="352"> I would like to ask Parliament, in these times of politicians, to make a statement of support to the courageous today we have stood up for freedom in the streets of Belgrade, ndose ECHO the support that we, Europeans, not so many years we give to those people in other capital also struggling for their freedom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="353"> The Europeans, Madam President, it would, without doubt very inspired if we could take up the flying the ball that we lanzÃ debate here the President of the Palestinian legislative Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="354"> The Commission jerusalÃ is the complicated in the negotiations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="355"> For years has managed to mislead the people of your country with its propagandÃ machinery and the brutal represiÃ of the media and, unfortunately, has managed to fob off many people from the Western world by creating a false picture of the reality. </SEG> 
<SEG id="356"> While the drama concludes, is this Parliament, as a United Europe and free, support to the masses around the Yugoslav Parliament and to help Mr Kostuníca to reach and play its mandate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="357"> Just its stance so hard makes us fear the worst, at the same time - and the current events show these sentences were drafted a few hours ago. </SEG> 
<SEG id="358"> I wonder whether the Commissioner is already looking at the steps that must be taken to make it clear that we consider to legÃ maritime is really as the elected representative of the Serbian people, and as the autÃ, ntico partner with whom the European Union wants to speak as of today. </SEG> 
<SEG id="359"> The European Parliament wishes to express its full solidarity in this historic moment in the tiranÃ majority wobbling and succeed democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="360"> In accordance with the directive, we shall proceed to the debate on the report (A5-0237 / 2000) by Mr seppÃ on nen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision on amending decision 2000 / 24 / EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted by the European investment Bank to the loans for projects in Croatia (COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000 / 0122 (CNS)). </SEG> 
<SEG id="361"> I welcome the new course political that abriÃ on this in the wake of the legislative and presidential elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="362"> Between the Union and for exerting its functions, among others, a Group of advisers, whose mission is to offer to Croatia its experience and support in the framework of the negotiations for the agreements of normalizaciÃ of relations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="363"> Let us not forget that, until recently, Croatia and an example of a programme of privatisations completely failed, that so only benefited a few. worsen--could supporting this process, in its entirety. </SEG> 
<SEG id="364"> The amount of EUR 250 million in the form of a loan from the EIB for the period milestone that we are debating will not be a milestone, but we should do servirÃ system of support and promotion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="365"> For it is not totally correct to speak on the report of the Commission on democratizaciÃ '. </SEG> 
<SEG id="366"> When Croatia and Slovakia managed for the first time a independence apparent, acted as servants of the regime of Hitler. </SEG> 
<SEG id="367"> He could, of course, be considered the issue of the application of guarantee and the Croatian concerned in the same context of the debate yesterday evening, and the situation in Belgrade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="368"> As it seems that people have fled the country and that the will of the people has prevailed, we trust that the actions to establish an association and a normal relationship between Serbia and this democracies should only be delayed for a few days. </SEG> 
<SEG id="369"> I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 6 October 2000. </SEG> 
<SEG id="370"> (the House rose and observed a minute 's silence) </SEG> 
<SEG id="371"> My question is the following: here the Commission is authorised to speak on behalf of the European Parliament on such a Statute? </SEG> 
<SEG id="372"> I would ask you, Madam President, that you are doing everything possible to speed up the procedure under way in the Committee on Petitions concerning a letter of protest that have arisen, in addition to social and collective and against this situation, in which blatantly has failed to comply with the Community regulation on the radioprotecciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="373"> The autopsia practised in Georgia has demonstrated clearly that tratÃ from a programming with possible torture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="374"> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the opportunity to take a big step towards our dream - who else, I do not share. </SEG> 
<SEG id="375"> This is the discrimination and the basis for any other regulations modified plants through technical. </SEG> 
<SEG id="376"> Of course, it is a blunder on the other. </SEG> 
<SEG id="377"> (the session was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.50 p.m.) </SEG> 
<SEG id="378"> In accordance with the next item is the debate on the report (A5-0291 / 2000) by Mrs van lacker, on behalf of the Committee on employment and social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council [COM (2000) 379 - 0508 / 2000 - 2000 / (COS)], the European Parliament, the economic and social Committee and the Committee of the regions on the agenda socio-polÃ policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="379"> Thirdly, a question: to emphasise the importance of this open method of coordinaciÃ does not mean that this method is going to replace the social legislation, because we have to set in Europe the social rights, we need to have the courage to draw the standards of social nimas and it is imperative that becomes a social legislation with a view to the single European market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="380"> Equally, in our support of social dialogue and the colaboraciÃ with civil society and in particular with women ’ s associations of the countries to which they are preparing its anexiÃ billion to the European family, since that there must achieve a uniform development which follow the steps and the other gica from the rest of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="381"> The areas of action mbitos listed in the communication of the Commission have also been the subject of an overall agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="382"> I remember, at this stage of my intervenciÃ, which was celebrarÃ in which a European seminar, who, on that subject the 4 and 5 December. </SEG> 
<SEG id="383"> As regards the fight against exclusion, we have progressed much to define, on 17 October, in the Council on 'employment and social policy', an appropriate objectives for the fight against poverty and social exclusion, which is the basis for national plans of action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="384"> I have heard in some rculos to do that, after having heard on the report, in accordance with the diagnÃ debate, but not with the other rmula. </SEG> 
<SEG id="385"> The development and the new methods of organizaciÃ Commission speak in favour of a Mediterranean cooperation where go by objectives and to achieve results and less for a regulation to do gida. </SEG> 
<SEG id="386"> We must seek by that side, in our opinion, the arcaÃ represents smo that they are accused those who hope that a market without obstÃ culos system is the best of all possible worlds. </SEG> 
<SEG id="387"> Certainly, it has contributed to reducing the dissatisfaction among the workers in our country and to boost the investments in the country from the outside. </SEG> 
<SEG id="388"> Instead, the method used seems debatable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="389"> If we talk of a Charter of rights and if we look favourably on a European cannot be estrÃ system bicos, but I must say that I have to give all the necessary steps, although this legislation demanding a more attentive and I do not think that Mrs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="390"> I would like to do ticamente the absence of initiatives on the new challenges in the labour market, on the participation of the workers and in labour relations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="391"> Signs now President, I also want to congratulate both the rapporteur and Mrs Palacio and the Minister, Mrs the by this presentation of the agenda of social policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="392"> As we know, the Conservatives are opposed to those points which our Group attaches particular importance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="393"> The third issue is enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="394"> The Commission will place the miÃ, rcoles at 12.30 p.m. </SEG> 
<SEG id="395"> The action of the Commission must be supplemented with studies on the individual access to health systems and to the systems of social security and pensions, about the shortcomings in the labour market and, perhaps, also on the disminuciÃ general working hours. </SEG> 
<SEG id="396"> In this way, the women sentirÃ do Europe closer, and Europe ganarÃ with the interesting and innovative ideas which should be expressed through its relationship with this programme. </SEG> 
<SEG id="397"> We hope for an annual report from the President of the Commission within the framework of a debate which is being held annually in the European Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="398"> I welcome the addition of which are also expected a rather reparticiÃ the care of children to facilitate the balance between professional life and family life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="399"> My Group will have in mind in his Commission end. </SEG> 
<SEG id="400"> (the President cut the speaker off) </SEG> 
<SEG id="401"> It seems to me very positive the new approach of the Commission, and very well considered the proposal to the programme for. </SEG> 
<SEG id="402"> I believe that the large number of amendments approved shows the administration parlance of the European Commission and the Committee on women's rights and equal opportunities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="403"> On the one hand, over the past year I have received several requests of companies which have a certain sense of powerlessness to root of certain decisions on mergers, above all connected with cases where we have had need to appeal to the Commission before the Court of first instance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="404"> I also want to take advantage of this opportunity to ask the Commissioner, on what ndo can hope for a public register, effective and efficient of State aid, and also about ndo be engaged at the table of results. </SEG> 
<SEG id="405"> Furthermore, I would like to ask the Commissioner, that it is important that in the report that a paragraph quite extensive devoted to the area of financial services. </SEG> 
<SEG id="406"> What I have said applies not only to the policy of political power, but also for the whole of the other areas mbitos. </SEG> 
<SEG id="407"> Signs now Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I also want to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work he has done on both reports which give a positive verdict on his work as about the general direction of competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="408"> I stress this because the market cannot regulate everything, and in this sense nor should exist nor can there be a competition without. </SEG> 
<SEG id="409"> Signs now President, today nobody disputes and, of course, I am not going to do, that the aid pÃºblicas alter the conditions of competition and constitute an element daÃ company ino that encourages the inefficiency of the enterprises. </SEG> 
<SEG id="410"> Where do rle deny the fact that the aid pÃºblicas have decreased during the period of the, as the Commission itself recognises that reduction, has been at least enough extraÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="411"> And, of course, but President, although my concerns the xxix report on competition policy, we cannot at the moment to look to the past, but nothing more than to learn for the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="412"> Signs now President, during the time available to me, I should like to address three points: the Community law in the field of competition, the activity developed in 1999 in relation to the rules of competition and the issue of State aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="413"> The Commission has continued to acting firm and especially against the system to rteles and the abuse of a dominant position. </SEG> 
<SEG id="414"> Signs now Rapkay, for the Commission has been very important to count on the support of the European Parliament in the pursuit of his policy of competition and I do not believe that such support is going to disappear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="415"> This mechanism can be activated or the request of a Member State or under Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, a Commission that is still in force during the third phase of economic and monetary Union for the States which, today, are the object of one, namely, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden. </SEG> 
<SEG id="416"> For the future, recourse to the capital market worsen--could to continue being the only possible option. </SEG> 
<SEG id="417"> Accordingly, I ask that the report in its versiÃ present to obtain the compliance of the House and that it can be used in the multiplicaciÃ material from the vine in the internal market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="418"> Today, its becomes necessary to take account of the evolution of the regulations and the phytosanitary scientific developments and carried out, in particular in the multiplicaciÃ resolution refers to in vitro </SEG> 
<SEG id="419"> Likewise, with this principle of precaution, I consider that refer to the possibility of amendments of policies means, for example, to reduce the use of plant protection treatments intensively. on the other hand, in the sense of the precaution going. </SEG> 
<SEG id="420"> In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, to respect the principle of precaution, both in their hope ritu as much in his letter, if unfortunately articles and amendments I have just mentioned are not removed, will do much to failure to adhere to the perception of Marianne Isler enjoy guin, and therefore the Committee on the environment, and to vote in favour of its supresiÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="421"> Signs now President, if I may: signs now Commissioner, do you could give its opinion on the amendment of the Committee on the environment, public health and consumer policy? is amendment no 1. </SEG> 
<SEG id="422"> The only point on which could be to discuss is the question of whether worsen--could I have taken note of, or not as the government I transmitiÃ the of losing the mandate of Mr Le Pen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="423"> I recall to its orÃ signs that the Commission is celebrarÃ system, at 12.30 p.m. </SEG> 
<SEG id="424"> In the field of justice and home Affairs, I am optimistic about a solution for judicial cooperation in civil matters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="425"> The preparatory Group is going to play its full role even on 19 November, the date of the forthcoming meeting at ministerial level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="426"> I bamos that climate necesitÃ exciting, as Mr Moscovici has said and as I do, at the level of the Heads of State or government, a sensaciÃ very serious of collective responsibility and historic a historic moment in the construction of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="427"> Simply will, orÃ companies, to ensure that, from now on, in regard to those issues of the qualified majority, for which we do not find more acÃ; the or the climate of reasons. </SEG> 
<SEG id="428"> That the countries not to the other rdenes of the countries of the European Union! </SEG> 
<SEG id="429"> I agradecerÃ relates to the President-in-Office of the Council that some clarification on this point. </SEG> 
<SEG id="430"> On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica was an historic event. </SEG> 
<SEG id="431"> Madam President, now President of the Council, Commissioner, but what progress has been made on closer cooperation and the vote by qualified majority, there are profound disagreements about the composition of the Commission and the ponderaciÃ the votes in the Council, as you have pointed out. </SEG> 
<SEG id="432"> It seems to me that we are going in the opposite direction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="433"> Those who remain outside of the reinforced actually enjoy the same freedom that passengers of the seats of atrÃ than a car. </SEG> 
<SEG id="434"> I am not here, as neither their signs orÃ, for ingerirme in the home Affairs Germans, but I believe that the Commission is deeply coherent and continues to be, by else, the wishes of the Commission, if I am not mistaken. </SEG> 
<SEG id="435"> We have started to exchange views on this matter, which is that all the Member States wish to the maintenance of that political mite utmost after enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="436"> I believe that it will not do so. </SEG> 
<SEG id="437"> The first: we have sometimes had the impression that in which a obsesiÃ by the debate between the States and the large. </SEG> 
<SEG id="438"> From that point of view, I believe that it is not enough to say that we must safeguard the Community method. </SEG> 
<SEG id="439"> Thus, when the applicant States accede, each Member State must be able to maintain a Commissioner or official assistant. </SEG> 
<SEG id="440"> The text of Article 94 is both dramÃ problematic as that, once the first wave of enlargement, we resultarÃ perhaps still more impossible to proceed towards the qualified majority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="441"> We need to convince the citizens of those countries of the merits of clear of any new European Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="442"> To imagine that the fears fed over generations could yield without new scares at appeasement definitive, followed by the reconciliation, would have been to ignore the workings of this crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="443"> I intranquiliza the least correspondence on the issue which calls for Parliament on the other. </SEG> 
<SEG id="444"> The guilty of this, rather than those who advocate that cause great reforms before enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="445"> On the one hand, the head of the government of Israel to freeze the peace negotiations by the violence in the area and to focus its efforts on the creation of a government of concentraciÃ with the leader of the opposition, Mr. </SEG> 
<SEG id="446"> We have heard much with muchÃ schism satisfaction of the victory of the Yugoslav people and the choice of a as President. </SEG> 
<SEG id="447"> I advise Mr Crespo that accession to its Italian colleagues that I explain why in the government in Italy with a Communist Party declaradamente and by what we are preparing to take part in the elections policies with other declaradamente Communist Party, the Communist Party of refundaciÃ debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="448"> It; on the contrary, in this area mbito would have to make progress on the issue of the procedure of codecisiÃ! </SEG> 
<SEG id="449"> The Commission, which has the possibility of adopting decisions by simple, finds itself in a favourable to give this momentum in the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="450"> The need now visionaries who have the telescope because in the year 2030, but which has need of leaders who are capable of understanding the problems that traerÃ system with the consumaciÃ Commission at a deadline of 3 to 8 years, so as to provide answers to the same. </SEG> 
<SEG id="451"> So, then, it is a piece of work, which has not dropped from above and has not been enforced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="452"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="453"> In the absence of this reference to fundamental, at best, we fail to understand each other, and in the worst, we slaughtered each other. </SEG> 
<SEG id="454"> Democracy has improved in Europe, but, for its part, the European democracy is ill. </SEG> 
<SEG id="455"> Today, on 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, the European Parliament says something simple, and it says very high: does the European Commission?, can you go,, the wish. </SEG> 
<SEG id="456"> That is to say, the same expresses the idea that the island of by a criterion is sufficient. </SEG> 
<SEG id="457"> Irã, to what is essential concentrÃ system ndome in points outstanding report from President Gil-Robles, of which dirÃ, simply that I find excellent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="458"> In the first place, a simplificaciÃ and a clarificaciÃ of the Treaties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="459"> I am not going to go further, because we are not here - in any case, I am not here -, to discuss the report of the Institute of Florence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="460"> According to the information - I am going to be, perdÃ and other nenme - which has been communicated to the Presidency, I believe that a clear majority of the versions of the lingÃ momentum, contrary to the Italian, only makes reference, for the issue of the policy, to the least favoured islands, and not to the islands in general. </SEG> 
<SEG id="461"> Signs but small, no doubt you will agree with me when I say that if there is success in Nice, not room, at least not credibility, for a debate on the future of the European Union, at least in the current framework. </SEG> 
<SEG id="462"> The common European worsen--could; to establish clearly the division of tasks between the Member States and the European Union and to incorporate the dinÃ system of the European mbitos in those areas, such as the common foreign and security policy, in which it is essential to a actuaciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="463"> They could also be required to overcome blockages persistent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="464"> It is necessary to clarify the distribution of competences and the principle of subsidiarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="465"> As is known, in the different Member States and between the various social forces there are very different opinions on the subject. </SEG> 
<SEG id="466"> Unfortunately, the final objective of a European Constitution would be exactly the opposite, and it is clear that we cannot approve it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="467"> Indeed, in the House, will be strengthened European peoples invited to the military, economic measures, sooner or later, and after the other peoples, which would be at hand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="468"> It is evident that the second versiÃ is not correct because, first, in one way or another, the structural funds, the liberalization micamente disadvantaged and, Secondly, because if this interpretation was the correct, not hablarÃ knew about the adoption of the nÂº30. </SEG> 
<SEG id="469"> Signs now President, I am going to focus my small children sixty seconds in the report of Olivier Duhamel, that it is a good report, because it dares to say the things clearly, and the fine words of our rapporteur has convinced is it a while ago. </SEG> 
<SEG id="470"> In my opinion, the unity of Europe can only be political. </SEG> 
<SEG id="471"> It seems to us that the new worsen--could to be about to enter into force for the European elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="472"> In consequence, the term "less developed" applies both to the island regions and the rest of the regions and, according to the proposal from Mr Barnier, what we have here is a modification of the Italian text of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the text. </SEG> 
<SEG id="473"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="474"> As my colleague said that it was going to vote against, that amendment lapses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="475"> Signs now President, what we are asking for is a way for other rmula chaos. </SEG> 
<SEG id="476"> I welcome with beneplÃ I quote the approval by the European Parliament of the Trakatellis report, as it was established that very high standards of quality and safety of blood and blood derivatives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="477"> If the European parliamentary immunity is, the French authorities worsen--could could have required the lifting of Mr Le Pen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="478"> I am particularly disappointed by the vote of the European Parliament on the report on the protection of the viÃ company edos. </SEG> 
<SEG id="479"> For some, alcohol is as the tobacco and drugs, a product which damages much to what they eat and to the people that their around; others, on the contrary, what we see above all as a source of employment and something that can save a great deal of money. </SEG> 
<SEG id="480"> The rapporteur welcomes in general with beneplÃ I quote the proposals of the White Paper of the Commission in this regard, but you are concerned about the possible consequences of the reform, which seeks primarily to decentralise the rules of competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="481"> (FR) although, in the debate yesterday evening, felicitÃ, to Jonathan Evans for his work, I had to express of entry my profound disagreement with the overly Liberal approach, including the ultra-liberal, on his report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="482"> The Agency for industrial development of Ireland has been reorganised its orientaciÃ to achieve half of the new jobs arising out of projects in areas in the new objective 1 in the next three years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="483"> The State intervention, funding and other incentives liberalization micos or fiscal, on occasions, come to balance out something this situation before the alarido that reconciliation of the consequences of this policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="484"> (the session was suspended at the 14.06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) </SEG> 
<SEG id="485"> The situation in October 2000, as already lack shortly to adopt a decision on the figures for the budget 2001, is the following. </SEG> 
<SEG id="486"> The Council, however, did not hesitate to reduce agricultural spending in 555 million in total. </SEG> 
<SEG id="487"> By else, also consider, as is the, which must not create a 400 additional posts, in addition to the present. </SEG> 
<SEG id="488"> I can only recommend to the Council that follow our example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="489"> The administration of this House of must, therefore, in the service of the Members of Parliament and not the other way round. </SEG> 
<SEG id="490"> The Court of Auditors is less are causing us at the moment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="491"> Finally, it is up to us to examine the Ombudsman's budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="492"> On the contrary, we believe that should be to strengthen the investigation, particularly with a view to the adhesiÃ of the candidate countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="493"> We also propose that we continue to report regularly to Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="494"> And when we are holding a concertaciÃ legislative on social Affairs, culture or the environment - the Commissioner is going to recognise that I am no we met the Commissioner for Budgets, the finance Ministers and the Members of the Committee on Budgets to pray jointly, making a nonsense of the financial. </SEG> 
<SEG id="495"> Yet President, ladies orÃ, Madam Commissioner, ladies, taxes, thank you for your welcome. </SEG> 
<SEG id="496"> By else, give rgenes of manoeuvre, especially in regard to the of the rÃºbrica 3 and of the rÃºbrica 4, the Council wants to give Parliament, ultimately able in relation to these non-compulsory expenditure, the chance to express their priorities without returning to the issue of the Council. insistirÃ, therefore, simply on the points highlighted in the Council's draft budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="497"> These are two subjects are often recurring in the discussions between Parliament and the Council and which could give guideline, if we are not careful, tensions between both branches of the budgetary authority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="498"> The situation is similar when it comes to the structural policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="499"> The result of the concertaciÃ this summer was also satisfactory, as it has already signs alado Mr Colom I Naval, namely in the sense that, in the future, ampliarÃ also at the request of Parliament in relation to the basics presumed with repercussions on the costs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="500"> Permã represents tanme to remind you that, in the financial perspective, which was adopted last year preveÃ could only be 1,850 million for the Balkans for the period until 2006. </SEG> 
<SEG id="501"> I ask you once more to examine this proposal - the Commission makes on the Bureau without preconceived viewpoints and that the judgments as well as a possibility. </SEG> 
<SEG id="502"> This material, of course, be useful for the preparation of the budget for 2001 and for the concesiÃ the unanimous approval of the gestiÃ in the year 1999. </SEG> 
<SEG id="503"> Despite the fact that, as a Member of the same, I very much appreciate the work of this Commission and despite the great respect that I in the work of the rapporteurs, in my capacity as rapporteur of the Committee on economic and monetary Affairs I should like to insist on two amendments that our commitment to re-use and now before the plenary and that still persist even have reduced the figures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="504"> With these measures we propose to achieve that judicial control back to operate fully, to restore the confidence in the safety dica presumed within the European Union and to consolidate their carÃ system cter of Community law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="505"> The supresiÃ this initiative on the part of the Commission, without replacing it with any other, was clearly contrary to the will of the Lisbon Summit and the priorities of this House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="506"> It was a remarkable and many of us had the impression that this importantÃ represents simo programme had to become merely a ball of fÃºtbol on a Party between the Committee on Budgets and the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="507"> The third issue is the European agricultural policy such as now figure in the budget proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="508"> If the employment is the priority policy, fisheries, as an economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="509"> I am particularly pleased that there may be guaranteed financiaciÃ programmes, juventd Socrates and culture 2000, which finalizaban at the end of last year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="510"> For example, our aid to the countries with a delay which affects the Budgets of many years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="511"> Signs now President, in the debates of previous years hablÃ, on behalf of the Committee on culture, youth, education, the media and sport, which has represented by Mrs Iivari said this evening. </SEG> 
<SEG id="512"> But I would like to say to Parliament this evening that we must not lose sight of the fact that the EU spent so only 1% of GDP and the administration of a large part of running at the expense of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="513"> Permã represents taseme pass to the overall strategy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="514"> This brings me to the strategy of our Group, because the essence of our concepciÃ is the desire that the Fund will have an adequate return to the European citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="515"> On the contrary, we must work for a Parliament which does information in favour of transparency, efficiency and the effective control of the European institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="516"> As this is the case we have to give some thought to how we can resolve this problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="517"> We want to encourage the processes of democratisation and we want to maintain a balanced relationship between the traditional field of foreign policy that now we must attend. </SEG> 
<SEG id="518"> The major problems in the preliminary draft Budgets connected with external actions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="519"> Since then, a debate is needed gestiÃ rigorous; we need the support and not try to apply it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="520"> It is also extremely exceptional, above all at first reading, and is a thankless initiative, since we cannot, in the current context, to obtain a majority of votes against. </SEG> 
<SEG id="521"> Having said that, the importance of the dotaciÃ for Kosovo does not fail to raise some problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="522"> The budgetary needs to deal with which the citizen to do and in European politics. </SEG> 
<SEG id="523"> All the measures designed to strengthen the small and medium-sized enterprises would, Consequently, deserve our support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="524"> The level of ejecuciÃ budgetary; </SEG> 
<SEG id="525"> To preserve that line estratÃ, gica in the approach to the budget for this year and next, the European Parliament is fully their space in the budgetary process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="526"> With the transfer of 175 million euros, we have estimated approximately EUR 25 million more than esperÃ system bamos. </SEG> 
<SEG id="527"> As far as MEDA is concerned, the Council said that the commitments were not a problem, in view of the eight years of delays in payments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="528"> I believe that Mr Duff was present this morning when we mention the European Council in Biarritz. </SEG> 
<SEG id="529"> My reply will be very simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="530"> Ramiro Zapata has been the last of the 25 human rights activists have been murdered, and, more recently, the Colombian press has denounced the defenders of 'of the paramilitary groups to kill a hundred defenders of human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="531"> Today, I feel a little more satisfied that in July with the attitude of the Council, because, as many times in situations of crisis, the European Union always seems the authority in getting to the international stage and make its voice to hear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="532"> The question, however, and I will end here, is whether there is a way rmula and other pressure greater than the proposed by the President in his and if the aid that we are going to give will be quite different from that of the United States, that is to say, addressed not to the fumigaciÃ of the crops, but to the sustituciÃ of crops and the social aspects and not to the military. </SEG> 
<SEG id="533"> The questions that other Members and I have put forward relate in particular to the situation in Colombia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="534"> As they deal with the same subject, questions Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 contestarÃ do jointly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="535"> Subject: tax on financial transactions of the reivindicaciÃ in favour of a tax of the speculative capital has been gaining ground in the last few months, with the cooperation of the association of the tax on financial transactions in the lÂ on Europe, in France and in Europe, and the amendments tabled in the French national Assembly and in the Senate in the same country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="536"> Likewise, I gustarÃ relates to respond to the question of its influence over the volatility of the foreign exchange markets and, in particular, of the effect of a tax by the thousand billion over the speculators waiting devaluation of the order of 20 to 50%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="537"> On the other hand, it calls in paragraph 6, the establishment of a organizaciÃ international arbitration to cancel the debt of the countries of the South. </SEG> 
<SEG id="538"> By else, is what is in the case of the euro on the scale of a year, since it is willing to regret this either. </SEG> 
<SEG id="539"> The next adirÃ, to what you said a moment ago, in cooperation with the countries of the South, which some estimates, formulated by specialists, give interesting figures: for example, a range of 50 to 250, 000 million trillion, which could recover from a Tobin type of tax, and the people, for their part, the figure on an amount of EUR 40 million trillion dollars per year, an amount that could be enough to give living conditions, do nimas to hundreds of millions of people who are all in the countries of the third world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="540"> The disease has been identified during the past months, for example, in different places of France. </SEG> 
<SEG id="541"> Your here a representative of the French Presidency, I would like to ask: what is abonarÃ; these killings of beef from the funds from the budget of the EU or the pagarÃ do you from the national Budgets, and considers that you indicated that it would be paid from the EU budget? </SEG> 
<SEG id="542"> I call indulgence to hear the response, please. </SEG> 
<SEG id="543"> Therefore, the action of the two governments concerned is bound by this international law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="544"> It seems to me a mystery which the Commission can say in February and the Council in July how it is needed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="545"> By acting in this way, in the name of subsidiarity, in reality, the abdica of one of its tasks as has occurred in these weeks both in the North of Italy as in Spain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="546"> As a Member of the European Parliament interested in that most, how can endorse the cost of 500 million of taxpayers in the United Kingdom, that is to say, our current contribution annum - when account with a broad approval? </SEG> 
<SEG id="547"> With a common approach on the part of the Council, to reach an agreement at second reading to close the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="548"> If someone is not still convinced, to examine a testing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="549"> Mr Joan Colom I Naval, the Vice-President responsible for buildings, has already introduced such a strategy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="550"> The messages in the budget for this year are - as the Commissioner has said but schreyer- many of the common agricultural policy, the new structural programmes, to ensure a better ejecuciÃ the structural policy, following the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit and to the creation of an EU stronger and more competitive and to the fight against social exclusion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="551"> The war of the NATO has made many havoc and has caused much misery. </SEG> 
<SEG id="552"> Despite what acordÃ, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to achieve that aim with the current budgetary constraints, undermine the agricultural budget needed for a sector of sustainable development in the current Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="553"> And I say so clear and: is the need to give an opportunity, and I hope that in the coming weeks or months to put in place a amnistÃ, but in the meantime, do want to level and procedure was to put conditions on the ejecuciÃ these two new budget, that is to say, the and the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="554"> The Yugoslav elections have demonstrated two things: at last, the people have hastiado the dictator Milosevic and at the same time on the teacher is. </SEG> 
<SEG id="555"> Furthermore, I am sure that the prisoners Albanians will soon in freedom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="556"> Not to do so, caÃ inevitably do them in the "ingenierÃ relates to the financial," in the redistribution and cuts in the overall costs of Mrs either in the social and environmental costs of either in the Commission, but the fact is that, in spite of that, the appropriations for the Balkans will remain inadequate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="557"> In this context, the efforts to solve the major social problems such as, for example, unemployment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="558"> There is a subject which is, of course, of great importance: we have begun by focusing the four, but has not entirely clear whether we have been able to give a solution, because the Council refuses to contribute in clear ideas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="559"> In all budget work are important priorities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="560"> It is not very serious on the horizon, next to the expiraciÃ Treaty, but we should do much to resultarÃ worrying if the framework postceca retain the possibility of extending a practice cticas alike. </SEG> 
<SEG id="561"> And that brings me to my third comment, the challenge before us now. </SEG> 
<SEG id="562"> The new financial agreement not stated nothing about this, and I have seen that the European citizens desconfÃ represents an increasingly politicians. </SEG> 
<SEG id="563"> I pay tribute to them for it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="564"> The availability in dialogue of all the institutions involved has given rise to a colaboraciÃ exemplary cooperation that we will, I hope, to arrive at a consensus at first reading. </SEG> 
<SEG id="565"> Those who represent the European values in a skeptical ptico in the EU are now a new argument in favour of the Union, that is, a better protection of personal integrity, something that is important to the citizens in modern society. </SEG> 
<SEG id="566"> In my own country reformarÃ the law of personal data, plundering the parliamentarians of power on the decisions of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="567"> Many other points pose problems and also deserve the judgment of the practice to be insured. </SEG> 
<SEG id="568"> The Commission desearÃ in first place the compromise that we have all been adopted with the citizens of guaranteeing the protection of personal data processed by the institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="569"> With this, the Commission accepts that the field of aplicaciÃ the regulation be restricted exclusively to the activities of the first pillar. </SEG> 
<SEG id="570"> With a view to honour the agreement that has been concluded with the Council and with the rapporteur to enable the unanimous approval at first reading, the Commission rejects any other amendment that does not form part of the Paciotti report adopted by the parliamentary Committee on citizens' freedoms and rights, except for amendment no 69 amending the amendment 43. </SEG> 
<SEG id="571"> Thus, it is urgent that the staff of the inter-service Group will be reinforced in the heart of the Secretary-General of the Commission, with the aim of all the actions proposed general scope can be acompaÃ company ados, during its examination by the College, in accordance with the 2Âº Article 299, by a detailed impact statement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="572"> From the point of view of the Committee on legal Affairs and the internal market, I want to stress is that, in fact, nothing can be treated as what is the same. </SEG> 
<SEG id="573"> Given the importance of the fishing for the most remote regions, I cannot help but feel sorrow about this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="574"> Even today, since that under the Presidency and the setting-up of an inter-service Group for the ultraperifÃ peripheral regions, we have travelled a long and fructÃ represents fero path and who has presided that Group I must express the deep gratitude of the Europeans ultraperifÃ the wealthy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="575"> Indeed even before the Treaty of Rome was made reference to the French overseas departments, it was necessary to wait until 1989 and the programmes of specific actions linked to remoteness and insularity, the well-known POSEI programmes, so that the European Union Finally admitted that the permanence and combination of the structural problems of the regions ultraperifÃ peripheral justified a specific treatment with regard to the demÃ than regions of the Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="576"> I have no doubt that the proposals of the Commission in the Council, the hallmark of these qualities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="577"> This issue is becoming more and more important as we move towards the enlargement of the EU towards the East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="578"> And the other tese that right to difference is that a emanaciÃ from the principle of equality, which demands that are treated differently what is different. </SEG> 
<SEG id="579"> It is a document that my team, and I consider it rich in ideas and that does not shirk any of the issues of concern to the outermost regions of the Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="580"> Your report, Mrs Sudre, does hincapiÃ, with the Commission on the need to act in a few moments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="581"> With regard to the revival of the economy, we have made progress in several areas mbitos essential. </SEG> 
<SEG id="582"> It is important now that we are present in the framework of the but a great number of projects, but, in parallel to this action on the ground, we have to think hard about the needs of access, every one of those regions ultraperifÃ weather in this partnership. </SEG> 
<SEG id="583"> Approval of the Minutes of the previous </SEG> 
<SEG id="584"> Naturally informarÃ, to the President of his. </SEG> 
<SEG id="585"> I am concerned about the possibility of a breakdown of numerous provisions of the Commission, what pondrÃ relates to undermine the decisions taken by the House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="586"> Therefore this food authority as the legislative proposals that we propose, intended to guarantee food safety, going to count on the support of this Parliament, but Commissioner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="587"> Its main task is to provide scientific advice, since the debate about food safety has to be worthy of credit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="588"> Signs now President, to conclude I would like to thank the rapporteur for his aportaciÃ constructive and its to take account of the opinion of the demÃ than commissions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="589"> When we are confronted with a possible risk is important to apply the principle of caution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="590"> On the issue of the nde still controversial debate worsen--could could arrive in regard to allow that to examine the nutriciÃ, and even that the present recommendations and be consulted by those whose main task is the gestiÃ risk, we have said that in the field of security, the issues worsen--could could at least be subject to the public and the advice of this food safety authority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="591"> A Central idea is to ensure the continuity of the rich heritage of traditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="592"> Are the laws or regulations which form the basis for this respectability, but the integrity, the high quality, the economic, the independence, the sense of responsibility, transparency and comprehensibility. </SEG> 
<SEG id="593"> Certainly, it is essential to proceed on the basis of a good knowledge, to evaluate the risks linked to the food chain, from farm to table. </SEG> 
<SEG id="594"> Signs now President, it is clear that there is a considerable enthusiasm for the creation of a European food safety Agency, as our rapporteur prefers denominarla. </SEG> 
<SEG id="595"> Given that the programme of the world continues to continue with the funds and the support needed, is that there is no need whatsoever of another Agency, especially a with a scope as limited as they are to the 15 Member States of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="596"> Food safety is the precondition of essential for the consumer as consumers want to eat healthily and it is what we have to deal with us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="597"> If we do not get a new framework directive many aspects related to the safety of the food only will remain a dead letter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="598"> Accordingly, we need to modify the Treaty of the European Union in such a way that gives the Commission the power to impose sanctions in the field of food, in the same way that is currently being done in the field of competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="599"> I support all those who support the strategy "foods for all" and that work on the political, administrative or other either. </SEG> 
<SEG id="600"> I do not share these words, since we know that the man is not Ãºnicamente body. </SEG> 
<SEG id="601"> This should represent the real nÃºcleo of coordinaciÃ the network of national agencies which, in turn, they set in motion and coordinate a network of centres of excellence of food safety at regional level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="602"> I believe, therefore, that his amendment no 11 and amendment no 17 are perfectly compatible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="603"> The reform of the food laws of the European Union will be conducted at the level of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="604"> His report contains many proposals for modification, but that is limited to emphasise certain issues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="605"> It is very clearly stated in the report, and I welcome that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="606"> Nevertheless, the creation of a European food safety authority is very positive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="607"> It is to be hoped that fulfilled all these criteria for the good of the citizens of the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="608"> I believe that imposing establish beyond temporary rgenes determined in which worsen--could be informed by the European Commission in the cases of unrest justified. </SEG> 
<SEG id="609"> The EU must count on the levels of higher possible of food security for its citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="610"> The Commission now proposes the creation of a European food authority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="611"> I fear that Europe run the risk of afford a bloated machinery of officials which will be unable to act. </SEG> 
<SEG id="612"> When we create new levels of bureaucracy and used more funds, is increasingly less what we get in return. </SEG> 
<SEG id="613"> To prevent similar jobs or parallel in the various institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="614"> However, we must ensure that, within the context of the debate on the White Paper, to increase in the public the fear of a Europe that burocrÃ democratic influence on the quality of the products without punishing effectively the costs that threaten the health of consumers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="615"> As you know, the Commission attaches the utmost priority to meeting its strategy on food safety. </SEG> 
<SEG id="616"> The Commission has adopted a proposal for a regulation that established the principles and objectives of the global food legislation, which proporcionarÃ the framework for future measures of protection of health in food. </SEG> 
<SEG id="617"> Thank you very much, but Commissioner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="618"> Turning now to our report, I welcome the proposal of the Commission, and I have to say that the committees on foreign Affairs and on development have worked hard to improve it, if possible, particularly on some points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="619"> As has been said, in very clear and Mrs Bonino, with the proposal for a regulation from the Commission has been given a new step forward. </SEG> 
<SEG id="620"> The proposal for a regulation from the Commission seems to us to be too vague. </SEG> 
<SEG id="621"> It is necessary that the dotaciÃ for the of the mines are organised in a reasonable way and to promote jobs of investigation for work of detecciÃ and eliminaciÃ, instruments that can be used in a simple in situ to provide a support precisely in the developing countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="622"> Over the past eight years, have contributed with more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget, to the fight against landmines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="623"> But we cannot punish the people who have a bad governance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="624"> In the first place, as I have already mentioned, I believe that it would be a mistake, well intended, but counterproductive, to impose the adhesiÃ opposition to the Ottawa Convention as a prerequisite for Community assistance to the antiminas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="625"> I can accept amendment no 19. </SEG> 
<SEG id="626"> Secondly, the international Community must improve's their efforts at global level, and in particular, in the countries affected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="627"> Signs now President, the Socialist Group shares the pride that just under Mr van Orden with regard to the role desempeÃ by the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="628"> So I think the toy bombs was in Afghanistan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="629"> Thank you for a good report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="630"> Signs now President, the Cambodians call to the mines sentinels recurring. </SEG> 
<SEG id="631"> In the face of the uniformed people have a distrust justified that was built up over many years of war. </SEG> 
<SEG id="632"> Signs now President, I am glad that there is at last a European legislation, in the form of a regulation, on the anti-personnel mines and today that we have a good report from Mrs Bonino on him. </SEG> 
<SEG id="633"> Signs now President, but Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a subject very sad. </SEG> 
<SEG id="634"> It is not by chance that the mines are, primarily, in areas in crisis, that is to say, in areas in which could have taken another type of initiatives in order to overcome this crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="635"> Two kilometres of a village of Bosnia, in 1999, in a field of a warning of the existence of mines, which does not prevent the presence of a child in this place. </SEG> 
<SEG id="636"> It is because I than is the civil population who suffer because of the stupidity of their leaders. </SEG> 
<SEG id="637"> Permã tanme much success, and, given the welcome on behalf of our institution, with which their country maintains privileged relations in the framework of our project parlance of construction of an area of prosperity, security and peace in the Mediterranean basin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="638"> All the mines stockpiled. </SEG> 
<SEG id="639"> Signs now President, as I agree with almost everything that has been said before of my colleagues, I shall not repeat. I waive my time to intervenciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="640"> The concepciÃ that you have the open is falling into the institutional framework which is dominated by the officials of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="641"> We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, that is to say, that decisions should be taken as close as possible to the people to whom will. </SEG> 
<SEG id="642"> But as essential amendments from the Group of the European people's Party just get a significant majority, I voted in favour of the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="643"> Signs now President, I abstained from voting on the resolution on the results of the informal European Council, for two reasons: first, because I had the opportunity of voting by roll call, apart, paragraphs 2 and 5, which has allowed me to express my opposition to both head-on. </SEG> 
<SEG id="644"> In other words, around the table of the European House, some comerÃ restored to the letter and others the menÃº minimum. </SEG> 
<SEG id="645"> And the control must not lacking. however, we are not antojaba that the enumeraciÃ these rights and its inclusion in the Treaties, it was the priority of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="646"> There has been talk of referendums, and the amendments tabled to this report relating to these referendums. </SEG> 
<SEG id="647"> In the 1999 the European Parliament participated only 40% of the electorate, without considering the countries in which there is the mandatory vote or to those in which it was carried out simultÃ system neamente national elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="648"> In order to achieve the desirable objective of a European Constitution, it is unwise to impose models and metodologÃ aims to do gidos, that impedirÃ could consecuciÃ inevitably the desired objective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="649"> A real common social worsen--could levelling up the best of the achievements of the world of work, of women, immigrants and the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="650"> Even without denying a Commission praiseworthy strengthening, aclaraciÃ and profundizaciÃ enlargement of the European Union, as well as a of the texts needed for the proximity of its performance in relation to the citizens, I voted in favour. </SEG> 
<SEG id="651"> The distribution of competences and responsibilities </SEG> 
<SEG id="652"> I believe that it is essential that the Charter of human rights from the EU to the signature of the human rights of the European Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="653"> As I support, since it proposes that for certain subjects, sectors and matters of some Member States of the European Union to agree on a joint action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="654"> Let the decisions on ever greater number of subjects - was adopted by qualified conflicts with the standards of democratic fundamental policies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="655"> Today seeks to prevent the flexibilizaciÃ of closer cooperation, and acabarÃ by starting to lose the, in this case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="656"> The present report aims to establish the decision-making in this sense of our Parliament (resolution of 13 April 2000). </SEG> 
<SEG id="657"> (SV) in general, our attitude towards the integration of the Mediterranean is favourable. </SEG>

<SEG id="659"> These islands must be active part of the European Union that I hope that will become a indeed do so for tourists and in a sense do so for its inhabitants. </SEG> 
<SEG id="660"> In the Middle ages of these regions and their inhabitants to Europe. pertenecÃ could not even now as regards genuinely European. </SEG> 
<SEG id="661"> In effect, the specific characteristics of those regions, in general, due to the islands and the remoteness from the continent of Europe, but also to their credit and other nica dependence of a production or only a few, require specific measures designed to overcome those limitations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="662"> Signs now President, I apologise for delay to the Presidency and to the interests of rpretes listening to my last explanation of vote and, in particular, I wish to express my solidarity with the translators our explanations of vote, in which concerns me. </SEG> 
<SEG id="663"> We can make it clear that the aim of the Agency is to channel the powers of national defence, or of paralizarlos, for them in the service of the objectives of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="664"> That does not mean that the Commission and Parliament denominen this Agency 'authority', denominaciÃ entirely contrary to the filosofÃ on which it is based. </SEG> 
<SEG id="665"> This is not what we are proposing the Bowis report, which gives the impression that the food safety is regarded as a fundamentally new pretext for feeding the known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission, to the detriment of the other rganos national and the other rganos protecting the safety of the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="666"> For this reason, I believe that this will enable me to condemn these acts unspeakable on behalf of our European Parliament that has always advocated by respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all their communities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="667"> Madam President, I understand the objections raised by the rapporteur, but on the basis of the amendments tabled by the Committee on agriculture and rural development would not only be votarÃ about issues of money, but that is votarÃ also on a orientaciÃ Commission assessed the issue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="668"> I should like to ask your support for that introduce the necessary adjustments in the budget line, relating to the acquisition of property, depending on what amendments are adopted, with the object of that traspasemos our own political mite 20% of the whole of the costs. </SEG>

<SEG id="701"> Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for the support that aportarÃ anticipated, to my report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="702"> If it is giving to this policy at European level, must then be given more opportunities to the regions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="703"> Smes are the main source of employment creation, in both quality and quantity. desempeÃ designed a pivotal role for the Commission and for the ordenaciÃ's territory. </SEG> 
<SEG id="704"> The caution with which made the study and the proposals concertaciÃ that has been pursued with many interested parties have been a triumph for better define and optimising the instauraciÃ of this programme. </SEG> 
<SEG id="705"> Thirdly, we must look at the next European adido value. </SEG> 
<SEG id="706"> It follows that the small and medium-sized enterprises can only function well if the rate of unemployment is reduced and the administrations pÃºblicas of all levels of debt and not have sufficient resources to send to the Budgets of investment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="707"> Businesses need clarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="708"> In particular, if an individual entrepreneur or a company with 250 employees account with a project, cannot be the only means of receiving financiaciÃ opposition to the guarantees of 120%, but that it should be possible to receive financiaciÃ for that has only a good idea. </SEG> 
<SEG id="709"> The national States, and even the regional or local authorities are already behaving as real financial bombs, that drenan taxpayers' money, i.e. sums which are held to the majority of the population, including the most disadvantaged, and what bombean by large companies and Consequently by their owners and shareholders. </SEG> 
<SEG id="710"> The breeding ground for the small and medium-sized enterprises includes thousands of fragile attempts which feed of human potential and ideas to the large enterprises. </SEG> 
<SEG id="711"> The measures that we have proposed here, that I gustarÃ that address the Commissioner is to facilitate and speed up the access to aid and for the people that addresses these companies can use them efficiently. </SEG> 
<SEG id="712"> All of them ocuparÃ a special place in the multiannual programme. </SEG> 
<SEG id="713"> Finally, I welcome the idea of a quotation we work to carry out an annual assessment of the instauraciÃ programme. </SEG> 
<SEG id="714"> The recent incidents at the expense of the Greek himarÃ and made more urgent need to encourage measures, strengthening of the institutions and respect for the human rights situation in Albania. </SEG> 
<SEG id="715"> A considerable number of Albanians to abandon their land by the uncertainty that prevails in their country, by the social problems, by their social structures and relatives premodernas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="716"> We need to have preventive measures, particularly designed to Albania that contribute to the construction or physical, with the object of make possible a dignified life in the region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="717"> It is a body like going to the other documents and the European Commission, for example, refuses to make public the report on, among others, the), drawn up by Albanians. </SEG> 
<SEG id="718"> We are seeing the true such as it is. </SEG> 
<SEG id="719"> Mrs Karamanou, congratulations on the point of view of the broad and comprehensive that evidence of his report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="720"> It is a matter of the greatest importance, created under the influence of factors historical, social, political and economic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="721"> We will never know the actual number of dead. </SEG> 
<SEG id="722"> The commercial activities and involves the people of a form pacÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="723"> What, on the contrary, I find unacceptable in this report, and I say this quite frankly, that the effect will be confused with the cause, that is to say, for the process of expediciÃ Commission balanced of visas and, Consequently, the possibility of emigrate, with the cause of illegal immigration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="724"> The great institutional reforms arising from the Treaty of Amsterdam have influenced in the gestiÃ the issues of asylum, political and inmigraciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="725"> Third and last, the plan of action and its ways of hardheaded must be assessed by areas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="726"> But, as other gicamente, this request is also requires us to us not go overboard in the volume of adoption of Community rules. </SEG> 
<SEG id="727"> Just now has to be emphasised is the strength of the Community. </SEG> 
<SEG id="728"> I, myself, by which of the amendments of the proposals on codificaciÃ the legislation in force efectÃºen via the inclusion of amendments in the directive or regulations in force. </SEG> 
<SEG id="729"> Understanding with ownership, the principle of subsidiarity aims in two directions: the taking of decisions at the level of lower possible, and the recognition that the level of lower may be possible, in fact, a very high level, when there is general assets at stake that perderÃ they at least to be protected in the same terms on all sides. </SEG> 
<SEG id="730"> The report is a model of draft clear and concise and I hope colleagues will take with the seriousness it deserves. </SEG> 
<SEG id="731"> The report of the Committee on legal Affairs and the internal market not with the enthusiasm of its Members. </SEG> 
<SEG id="732"> To that I was in the report about the SLIM project, because the Community, and the signs the commitment we have just tested with the reading of one of the articles of the Treaty, is understandable, including for the experts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="733"> Therefore, to me some aspects of the report I produced little enthusiasm, because I would have liked to have seen a report than "comunitarizante" in the internal market, and above all, on this point, of course, are not the winds blowing through the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="734"> What is important for the institutions of the EU is that we have a strong commitment to raise the quality of the legislation, especially with relationship to the principle of subsidiarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="735"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="736"> The maintenance of this could have a negative effect on the Commission and on the perception of the citizens about the euro. </SEG> 
<SEG id="737"> Signs now President, in the Committee on citizens' freedoms and rights, justice and home Affairs prepared carefully the Karamanou report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="738"> However, as chairman of the Committee on fisheries, I would like to take advantage of our oral question and this debate to express on both sides - both addresses our motion for a resolution no, and I would like to do so with great composure, some of the considerations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="739"> The peoples of the Union that we represent so far demand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="740"> But, we already have a lot of water under the bridge, the agreement has prescribed and has not been replaced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="741"> I can understand the reasons for the Commissioner, but I cannot understand the director general. </SEG> 
<SEG id="742"> We could say that, eleven months after the mooring services, we are still paying the previous agreement and the former earlier. </SEG> 
<SEG id="743"> Signs now President, a year ago we had a similar debate and the fact that it has had to spend a year to pass from the negotiations highlights the difficulty of fishing grounds for the huge fleets of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="744"> In the second line, things were very clear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="745"> But we must understand that nothing is eternal, but perhaps even fishery resources. </SEG> 
<SEG id="746"> I am therefore particularly concerned to make it clear that if something has highlighted the PPE-DE Group is not only in support, to defend and promote the fisheries agreements, but to promote decidedly its extension. </SEG> 
<SEG id="747"> In the third place, since that is interrumpiÃ the fishing agreement, has continued to the waters of the Sahara by Community and non-Community fleets that are not subject to the control of neither the Commission nor the Member States: it talks about all of a fleet to the Netherlands. </SEG> 
<SEG id="748"> As I understand it, since those fishing activities represented a source of income and work for a poor in relation to the rest of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="749"> Another aspect that I would like to highlight is that at the end of the month concludes the temporary aid paid to the fishermen and shipowners to compensate for this year of unemployed: it is an untenable, given that all prefer to work to the aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="750"> This parliamentary Andalucista carries a year of negotiations and proposing initiatives by the corridors, by the offices, in the Committee on fisheries and in the hearings with the Commissioner for that take into account the especialÃ ­ schism character of the Andalusian fishing fleet which fishes in Morocco. </SEG> 
<SEG id="751"> Spain has been an outstanding way the difficult neighbourhood relationship which has been repeatedly raised in the history of between Europe and North Africa, between Spain and Morocco. </SEG> 
<SEG id="752"> As a Member of Parliament and an Andalusian, maintain the right of thousands of families Andalusian and Spain waves to maintain and defend, and to defend from this Parliament, their jobs, which are in danger for almost a year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="753"> Is procederÃ now to the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="754"> A history of almost twelve years full of consuelos since the cancillerÃ, who I cticas delaying, expectations, need staff, only for the affected, the persistent of old rights in relation to the citizens who were looking for another thing that their rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="755"> As you know, the issue is highly complex and affects a 700 people who work in more than 25 Italian universities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="756"> If reform and to modify the system dico presumed Italian, as has happened for personnel, not be thought that the Commission can intervene since the time in which all European citizens enjoy equal access to all the categorÃ professional companies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="757"> The injustice lies in which two people who carry out the same work, work hand in hand, it will, however, with different salaries and under different conditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="758"> Worst of all, in my opinion, is to have to inform you that a decision which may not be that some of the words reassuring and not going to assume real change in their lives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="759"> I would remind the Commission that I hope will respond to what the judgment of the Court, in the case of the following, expressed in the following way: by the present dictates that is contrary to Article 48 (2) of the Treaty of the regulation that the legislation of a Member State, in any case the duraciÃ the joint work of the assistants of foreign languages in one year, with the possibility of renovaciÃ, if not in principle applies that political mite to other teachers'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="760"> Well, I believe that these issues are at the heart of the fundamental principles of freedom associated with European law, in particular the freedom of movement, and we cannot make exceptions to these principles. </SEG> 
<SEG id="761"> Have made today, as has been seen in this debate, too many exceptions, many obstÃ system for this internal market, and not only in this case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="762"> The debate has been concluded. </SEG> 
<SEG id="763"> (the President cut the speaker off) </SEG> 
<SEG id="764"> And I would like to propose a minute of respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="765"> Are there any observaciÃ? </SEG> 
<SEG id="766"> I support the proposal put forward by Mr Ceyhun, and I would be very grateful if you could tell us that the Council has real intentions to present a new proposal on this issue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="767"> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our Group regards as important this event that we believe that recibirÃ relates to an appropriate treatment in the form of a matter of urgency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="768"> Solidarity is just described and I have the impression that you adhere to those reasons, but if not, if entendÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="769"> Madam President, now, while we are discussing in this Parliament on the issue of sanctions on Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="770"> It is urgent that we hold a debate before introducing the modification proposed by the authorities, and that the Commission signs ALE quite clearly what is the rules which must be respected in this respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="771"> (A5-0314 / 2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on citizens' freedoms and rights, justice and home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the adoption of a Convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, in particular in the fight against organised crime, the laundering of the products of infringements and crime in financial terms (10213 / 2000 - C5-0394 / 2000 - 2000 / 0815 (CNS)). </SEG> 
<SEG id="772"> The statements they must be followed by concrete measures for the following, however, incautaciÃ and confiscation of the proceeds of crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="773"> The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot continue to remain in the hands of a specialised Agency, only subject to the control of the national governments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="774"> On the other hand, Article 8 of the draft Convention Ãºnicamente confined to interests of major reasons of denegaciÃ of assistance which could invoke the State is required. </SEG> 
<SEG id="775"> To begin with, I would like to congratulate Mr Marinho, for the work that has been carried out, and I would like to say that, actually, attempts to combat organised crime must be given support and attention. </SEG> 
<SEG id="776"> Located, pursuing, condemn the laundering of dirty money from the terrorists and the trafficking of arms and drugs, that means that food producers! </SEG> 
<SEG id="777"> Our mission is to proceed in follow-up, however, incautaciÃ and confiscation of the proceeds from organised crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="778"> All these considerations they contained in the amendments and, to judge by the debate held in the Commission, I trust that Parliament fully in the aprobarÃ; these amendments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="779"> In my judgment, the establishment of these initiatives is a way forward that can ignore the protection provided for in Article 6 of the European Convention of human rights and fundamental freedoms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="780"> However, in reality, all this is not so simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="781"> By past, but President, the Group of the European people's Party supports the amendment of transacciÃ at which we have arrived with Mrs Roure on the activities of the lawyers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="782"> The second measure, the second instrument, it is to the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="783"> This is a Portuguese initiative that has already been praised several previous speakers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="784"> And that was the object of the joint meeting of the justice and home Affairs Council and the Ecofin Council of the past, on 17 October. </SEG> 
<SEG id="785"> The best way to strengthen the control of parliamentary and judicial control of Europol is the full of the Europol Convention, in the framework of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="786"> A step in the right direction in which the European Parliament seeks to give since time is the creation of a provisional unit of judicial cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="787"> This is the meaning of the guarantees, that is to say, to make progress in this aspect of the freedoms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="788"> The European Parliament is a supranational body of Community held to establish this relationship, and with this I propose therefore that support that right to support our rapporteur </SEG> 
<SEG id="789"> Only when the institutional model and the rules that regirÃ the European area of justice are resolved, it will be possible for the citizens and for Parliament to give its opinion on each of the measures proposed by the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="790"> For this reason, Europol is a step in the process of enlargement gico to give the citizens a high level of safety in an area of freedom, security and justice, through the strengthening of the fight against organised crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="791"> Signs now President, but Commissioner, orÃ, Mrs Gebhardt deserves a felicitaciÃ for the excellent report that arises, in line with the decisions taken at the Tampere Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="792"> But given that with Eurojust, raises's of prosecutors and judges the fight against all forms of serious crime - and in that I agree with the approach of the rapporteur - was broad concept, we are no longer talking only of cooperation for the crimes purely transnational, it also of cooperation for the of the criminal activities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="793"> We will have the opportunity, as of 1 January 2001, we go in that interim unit, but the Commission wants to hold a debate on what should be the definitive Eurojust unit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="794"> Each part had truly its common position, so I believe, without falling in fighting the producers gidos. </SEG> 
<SEG id="795"> The problems encountered with the costs of not care too much to the Committee on fisheries, although much provided attention to other matters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="796"> It is totally unacceptable that we do not have clear objectives or we can measure the results, something that does not ocurrirÃ in any other instituciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="797"> Second point: in the ambit of the in the power of ordenaciÃ of payments has been arrived at intersections unacceptable, but Commissioner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="798"> I want that to highlight that the positive role for a certain number of problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="799"> It is obvious that work on consortium does not create any duality in the joint financial responsibility. </SEG> 
<SEG id="800"> Consequently, we have really acted to recover those 3.4 million, and I can say that what we have achieved in more of a 90%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="801"> Are there any observaciÃ? </SEG> 
<SEG id="802"> Madam President, ladies orÃ, after nine months of work and lengthy wrangling in search of a consensus, we now have on the table a draft Charter of fundamental rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="803"> I trust that, even today, to give their approval to this letter, this House are going to leave indubitablemente clear in the weeks that calls on the Council to the letter and that this also includes the possibility of recourse to the European Court of justice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="804"> This is a, as you know, to the position adopted by the Heads of State and government in the European Council, in which they themselves adopted unanimously and without reservations, the Charter and, therefore, I can only invite you, on behalf of the Council, to follow this, but haciÃ, ndoles some of the arguments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="805"> But above all it is the strength of its content by the Charter, I am sure, will in time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="806"> For its part, the European trade Union Confederation has failed to condemn what it considers gaps, such as the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum wage, for example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="807"> However, various personalities, and in particular the Members of the European Parliament, have proposed that includes a reference explÃ ­ quotation on the Charter of fundamental rights, in Article 6 of the Treaty of the Union, which already makes reference to the Convention of human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="808"> Our Group unanimously supports the Charter with the single exception of the delegation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="809"> The European people's Party calls in its entirety and to protect nime unanimously by the Charter of fundamental rights to be incorporated as soon as possible to the Treaties, with the aim of which have the force of law directly to the inhabitants of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="810"> They have shown that it is possible to address the concerns of Europe a new and exemplary, a much better than the Intergovernmental Conference, given their labour and open, with great transparency and which provides for the participation of the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="811"> The right to health care, social security, housing, at least, are non-existent or Ãºnicamente the order of solidarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="812"> Fourthly, the letter - and it seems to me particularly important part of the principle of the indivisibility of human rights of citizenship and of carÃ system cter and the fundamental rights of social order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="813"> Madam President, yet President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, but orÃ economies, I believe that this Charter is simply the following schism demostraciÃ capacity of the Union and of our Member States to increase the number of texts ending instead with lame, the declarations of intent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="814"> The representative of the Commission in the Torino attributed significaciÃ Commission presumed dica document. </SEG> 
<SEG id="815"> The hour of the market, the hour of the Europe of the rights of perhaps has arrived, the concept of citizenship in the European Union is a relatively new concept. </SEG> 
<SEG id="816"> The Charter is drafted, in effect, as a text which may have a binding. </SEG> 
<SEG id="817"> He can check with great pride that a representative of my parliamentary Group in my country, important role, had an important role in the resolution of this Charter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="818"> As I said last night, and will also to say that today, in all of this there are many deficiencies in this regard and, sometimes, with our eagerness to develop the judicial and police, overlook the importance of ensuring that the innocent victims, are not passive serious side of a war against crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="819"> Madam President, the draft resolution of the European Parliament on the Charter of fundamental rights is based on the same ambiguity that the work of the House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="820"> The Italian prevÃ of, for example, the good conduct; the prevÃ, the rights of the opposition, of the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="821"> Signs now President, today in the Commission of the 12 we will conclude a process that iniciÃ in 1984, when this Parliament approved the draft Treaty of the European Union, where aparecÃ already the request of a statement of rights, a process that we continue in 1989 with the de Gucht. </SEG> 
<SEG id="822"> The Charter will have effects. the is going to have also or not in the Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="823"> Must be welcomed with beneplÃ I quote and not with fear, as seems to think of Mr <. </SEG> 
<SEG id="824"> It seems that the century that war, with all their struggle by the emancipaciÃ the disadvantaged social classes, has not inÃºtilmente and has nothing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="825"> The Charter full a vacuum in Community law and will strengthen the protection of individuals with regard to the atrocities of the policÃ European, of the authorities that combating fraud and the authorities that are responsible for competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="826"> I do not understand the disensiÃ from whom the appropriate because the Charter does not everything that querrÃ relates to see included. </SEG> 
<SEG id="827"> Signs now President, will, where the quedÃ Mr Gahrton. </SEG> 
<SEG id="828"> The third observaciÃ that I want to make relates to the rights of the citizens of third countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="829"> The Council of Europe, with the Court of human rights, with a great deal of experience in similar forms of control, we can take advantage of. </SEG> 
<SEG id="830"> In the view of the text of the letter that today we are going to approve - and I hope that a large majority of a-, it is obvious that with our Charter are going to achieve a protection of the broader and more up to date of the Charter of fundamental rights which would of course adhesiÃ to the European Convention for the protection of human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="831"> For this reason it is necessary to proceed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="832"> I think it is important to bear this in mind if we want to achieve the necessary support from the citizens of Europe to the letter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="833"> After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of fundamental rights will be my que from analysis for this report and even where my personal media and intellectuals and the media in regard to colleagues that I will enable me to enable it, in a right by right, country by country of respect for the Charter in the fifteen countries of the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="834"> (FR) yet President, yet Minister, and the Members of Parliament, the Commission would like, in the first place, to adhere to the propÃ and other sitos well, and the President of the Commission, that the Members of the European Parliament have contributed to the debate, to the Commission, in particular the role which the rapporteur Mr ways of Vigo has in the Praesidium of the Convention for the redacciÃ of the Charter of fundamental rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="835"> I referirÃ, than to some of the points highlighted in this debate: Firstly, Mr. </SEG> 
<SEG id="836"> The Commission has decided to include fundamental rights inspired in the different instruments of the Council of Europe, in the Treaties, in the constitutions of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="837"> In accordance with the order of the day, the next item is the joint debate on the following reports: </SEG> 
<SEG id="838"> In the current State of things, it is also our Parliament to tell the Turkish people that at the moment there are three conditions for its. </SEG> 
<SEG id="839"> At root of it, the European investment Bank is one of the ports of refuge from the banking activities in the world. ahÃ do not salpican waves of social debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="840"> Why is it that I have taken good note of the suggestions put forward by Mr Morillon in relation to the conditions of the adhesiÃ prior to accession and deserve the most. </SEG> 
<SEG id="841"> I have the satisfaction of able to announce that the Turkish government has accepted among both this association as the basis for our future colaboraciÃ, so that we can hope justified that we shall achieve exactly the intended aim, which is to support with our policy to the reformadoras forces in Turkey, to give a new impetus to the process of reform and make progress with a view to the desired adhesiÃ enlargement of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="842"> What is more important is that on the basis of who has been initiated in Turkey, between the Turkish public opinion, a debate on the conditions for the adhesiÃ accession to the EU, a debate which gives support to the reformadoras forces of the country and its further development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="843"> This text is the hopes of its opinion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="844"> What is now aims is to give an impetus necessary in the stage of a future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="845"> Nevertheless, I instarÃ relates to urge Turkey to - and which will be the result of the voting no to that will be taken seriously in this matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="846"> The European Parliament desempeÃ company arÃ his role in the promotion of relations with the parties, the NGOs and the press, in addition to develop their delicate and sometimes tirante with the grand national Assembly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="847"> Yet the signs, her report is, in my view, perfectly realistic and responsible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="848"> On the occasion of your visit to Turkey in March last at least mencionÃ by its name to the problem of the Kurdish population, as it has done today. </SEG> 
<SEG id="849"> Considering that the Europeans will lead to the Turks, and I quote, "to a radical change of their customs and their mentality" reveals at the same time a great naivety and a great adequacy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="850"> Yet President, ladies orÃ companies, the report we are debating today fills me with concern. </SEG> 
<SEG id="851"> Recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on constitutional Affairs, on the draft Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union (the / 1 / 00 / 1 / 2000 - 2000 / 2000 (AVC)) </SEG> 
<SEG id="852"> Thus, and especially on the occasions on which we are going to discuss the power or, we will realise that there is a need for a wider and, therefore, garantizador of the person. </SEG> 
<SEG id="853"> Recommendation Duff / Voggenhuber (A5-0325 / 2000) </SEG> 
<SEG id="854"> Signs Alamos Furthermore: </SEG> 
<SEG id="855"> The rights already by the Charter already form part of the national constitutions and defended by the national parliaments, require the peoples and their cultures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="856"> For example, the Article Article, which mentions that: "collective expulsions are prohibited," does not specify that this prohibiciÃ can be suspended in the event of war or serious disturbances of public order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="857"> We are going to give a brief explanation of these three objections by me. </SEG> 
<SEG id="858"> The right of a government to leave aside arbitrarily his is the caracterÃ represents stica defining a tiranÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="859"> But, I repeat today, we have every reason to be proud of the conditions in which we have completed this important stage for Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="860"> A society which is known, not only rights and duties, becomes a society selfish. </SEG> 
<SEG id="861"> It is our absolute afirmaciÃ fighter for the protection of fundamental rights is practised in elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="862"> Despite the fact that the method of the Convention is interesting and fruitful for establishing a basic text, seeking a broad compromise, nothing justifies that, at the European Parliament, which represents the people of Europe, the ability to amend, improve the text. </SEG> 
<SEG id="863"> This Charter must be improved, and our Parliament should propose a strategy that will enable its actualizaciÃ and its enrichment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="864"> Therefore, the Charter should not be to decide and proclaimed at the Nice Council, rather than in this Summit should be to promote a European debate on the same. </SEG> 
<SEG id="865"> Fortunately, the prevailing tendency of the national governments seem to indicate the path of common sense, that is to say, the acceptance of the Charter with a scope merely and not binding. </SEG> 
<SEG id="866"> Created as "Parliament" at the Cologne Summit, autoproclamÃ other 'Convention', a number which recalls unfortunately in 1793, and to the implications of the terrorists of the French fulfilled by another Convention. </SEG> 
<SEG id="867"> In return, the method employed, exclusions proclaimed and the ambiguity surrounding the very nature of this text shine a light quite blunt about the new efervescencias totalitarian that in the very heart of the process of European integration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="868"> Fortunately, the European Parliament still has not in this field than a funciÃ Commission consultative, pending an overall of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but that the way to exercise it in the wrong direction, slowing down the right decisions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="869"> Instead, there are discrepancies in regard to the procedure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="870"> A century ago was and, to achieve that would be rolled back somewhat, is now in force. </SEG> 
<SEG id="871"> What we want is that the latter market,  nico allow criminals to enter the market,  nico by the back door and without being seen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="872"> And we also support the future creation of a Convention which will facilitate the fight against organised crime and money laundering, as well as the different measures proposed in order to achieve these ends. </SEG> 
<SEG id="873"> In effect, it creates a provisional unit, to by a representative of the judges or the policÃ powers exercised by a judge in our fifteen Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="874"> Signs now President, in my capacity as a Member of the parliamentary ue-turquÃ, spend a close to the project of adhesiÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="875"> Nor is it acceptable to the role of Turkey in Cyprus. </SEG> 
<SEG id="876"> However, we support the criticism of the rapporteur in regard to which needs an in relation to the concesiÃ from the stamos from the EIB and that there are deficiencies in matters of transparency and control in the Bank 's activities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="877"> Turkey, with all its diferenciaciÃ, always has been and continues to be an integral part of the reality of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="878"> The adhesiÃ accession to the European Union has developed than ever on a subject to the order of the day. </SEG> 
<SEG id="879"> Mr Morillon says that Turkey should be careful not to see the European Union as a Christian club exclusive "which wants to exclude it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="880"> Turkey will be a fully democratic when learn to live with its past, as the German democratic aprendiÃ opposition to live with the support and we call on it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="881"> With regard to the authorities in Ankara have understood that the status quo is unacceptable for Europe and for the rest of the world, will be able to make substantial progress: the island will be reunited and tomorrow is aportarÃ a reglamentaciÃ global fair, lasting and comply with international law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="882"> In truth, why not include all of this in the report of the European Commission? </SEG> 
<SEG id="883"> This is the framework in which we will resume balanced resolutely with our actuaciÃ for favouring the rapprochement between the Union and Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="884"> If we look at the matter of Armenia in the context of the adhesiÃ enlargement of the EU - and I would ask you to listen to what they say: if we address the matter of Armenia in the context of the adhesiÃ enlargement - the project that we are discussing today is not to root out; so simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="885"> By else, is the reason for our insistence on which my assessment of the first five years of ejecuciÃ from the Barcelona process, so that in Marseilles, precisely, are in a position to establish the necessary guidelines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="886"> However, we have managed to maintain the dialogue, and sometimes on sensitive issues: stability, terrorism, the emigraciÃ, human rights, for example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="887"> Furthermore, the Council has made an effort, in particular since 1995, by providing the 'means more jobs, to the measure of the challenges of the partnership. </SEG> 
<SEG id="888"> This is, in fact, a matter of extraordinary importance, and I say this also in my capacity of Central European. </SEG> 
<SEG id="889"> Signs now President, as you know, in saying that, when the star does not appear in a funciÃ, as a jawlinkski Hamlet without first enterrador. </SEG> 
<SEG id="890"> We want to see a mancomunaciÃ of policies on the issues relating to the market,  nico and agree to introduce the origin together with the regional free trade agreements so that all the partners that free trade relations between security and adopt the harmonised Protocol on rules of origin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="891"> We have heard with satisfaction that the Commission is willing to give a new impetus to the Barcelona process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="892"> I have highlighted these aspects because they are seeking the key to relaunch the process, and to all that there is that next adir enlargement of the political agenda of Barcelona. </SEG> 
<SEG id="893"> Therefore, it has to be our priority to secure the peace and security of the European Union in the 'and we have to make every possible effort for the sake of this cooperation and for which the funds committed to be applied effectively, in funciÃ of so much digamos- selfish generosity of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="894"> These are important issues and that I gustarÃ relates to paragraph, and I would like to thank Mr Brok that has allowed this debate just before that the Presidency and the Commission to discuss these issues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="895"> The world is moving towards a globalization unstoppable and in this context it is necessary to organise itself in large blocs that actÃºen as protagonists in the great stage of global competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="896"> It is disappointing that the countries have requested so only just a quarter of the 700 million appropriated for the MEDA I programme, which expirÃ in 1999. </SEG> 
<SEG id="897"> It is positive for the proposal for a new impetus which has made the Commission and we agree entirely with the two priorities which has marked the Mr Patten in its actions and reiterated this evening. </SEG> 
<SEG id="898"> It is a touch of attention for the European desempeÃ company and a much more active role in the Mediterranean area that historic and culturally enriqueciÃ and engrandeciÃ enlargement of our European continent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="899"> However, much more serious, at the same time in this Chamber exchanged calmly sometimes divergent points of view, continue to kill more Palestinians. </SEG> 
<SEG id="900"> Aid to the joint </SEG> 
<SEG id="901"> If, however, we do not in December the means for implementing this regulation, today we have held a debate devoid of content. </SEG> 
<SEG id="902"> It is complicated procedures, but nor should we neither want to close our eyes, and I hope that the Member States do not either, on the role that have been in it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="903"> The media in that region have been responsible for many times of the tragedy that has experienced and are needed a completely free media and that actÃºen pursuant to rules which prevail in our democracies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="904"> Thus, I am lucky because I believe that Parliament has had at achieving back to a situation that was originally it was not so good, because that has maintained a continuous pressure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="905"> I repeat once more: it is absolutely essential to avoid unnecessary costs in meetings of unnecessary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="906"> However, we must not look only in Kosovo. </SEG> 
<SEG id="907"> It is unfortunate that a series of programmes have been put in the so-called reserve of actuaciÃ, "opfÃ ¸ rselsreserven". </SEG> 
<SEG id="908"> In Feira, reconociÃ the quality of potential candidates for the adhesiÃ enlargement to the countries participating in the process of stabilisation and association. </SEG> 
<SEG id="909"> I would like to reiterate the main priorities assigned the cards programme: the institutional reinforcement in the sense of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and the joint; the regional cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="910"> The European Union was right to react positively to the access of the President kostuniÃ on to power. </SEG> 
<SEG id="911"> On 6 November was llevÃ opposition to hold a first examination. </SEG> 
<SEG id="912"> What initiatives does it intend to adopt the Presidency of the Council, such as solicitÃ to the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, to play an active role with the aim of guaranteeing the total and absolute the of the UN peace plan? </SEG> 
<SEG id="913"> How will give new impetus to achieve this without the resolution of this conflict? are known the narrow victims nculos that exist between the European Union and Morocco, and especially between France and Morocco. </SEG> 
<SEG id="914"> I can simply signs alarle that France and Germany -aquÃ do not expressly for me as President of the Council spoke about these issues in the course of a bilateral Summit in, and, last week, and that is decidiÃ other established a working Group in order to remedy the problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="915"> At the same time, the Commission continues to provide material support to these two countries, through the intermediary of its various programmes, in particular. </SEG> 
<SEG id="916"> The question of signs now disappointed, then, to have the chance to dispel certain confusion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="917"> Next precisiÃ ado and an extra billion: it is particularly, on these two texts, the strengthening of the penal framework to fight against organised networks of smugglers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="918"> In the report that the Council of Ministers and approved the 21 September as a programme of reform, are on the part of the legislative amendments several projects: inscribe in the civil code that effective measures to strengthen the equality of men and women in the areas mbitos socioeducativos; to fight against violence rather familiar; rather they condemn violence through the creation of specialist judges in the past, the family and, by banning the possibility of a reduction of death by crime of honour. </SEG> 
<SEG id="919"> Therefore, the Presidency has not by what I give an answer on this point. </SEG> 
<SEG id="920"> The next week, there will be a meeting of the European Conference, to invitaciÃ decision, in France, that is to say with the applicant countries. I announced that the paints. </SEG> 
<SEG id="921"> Do you think that the model that has been pursued in the case of Austria, that is, the adoption of decisions majority agreements, to use in the future as an instrument for adopting decisions at the margin of the European institutions and to create a new instituciÃ or a new Group, in order to be able to get round the unanimity rule in the Council? </SEG> 
<SEG id="922"> . the terms of this answer was reported to the whole of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="923"> President-in-office of the Council, Mr moscovici- that right to proceed in the economy with the European Union, it is not possible to take into account the issue of Cyprus? </SEG> 
<SEG id="924"> We must bear in mind that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than a simple fishing agreement and which, as he knows, if not reached this agreement, bearing in mind what it means, this fact could hide a deterioration of the relations between the European Union and Morocco. </SEG> 
<SEG id="925"> Therefore, I have to express my scepticism about the outcome. </SEG> 
<SEG id="926"> Tratã healing the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that this principle should allow the strengthening of the cooperation of the Member States, but also the protection of the rights of the people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="927"> The supplementary questions have to be other Members. </SEG> 
<SEG id="928"> On the other hand, the Commission, in which the Commission approved on 4 October 2000 on the supply of oil from the European Union, points which wants to submit, at the European Council in Gothenburg, a plan of saving power, and diversificaciÃ from sources that worsen--could to contribute to strengthening the effectiveness of political power, particularly in the buildings and tourism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="929"> With this, we, on the occasion of the Commission of the resolution on the embargo, in the framework of the third Committee of the general Assembly of the United Nations, on 9 November, an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with the international bodies which defend human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="930"> It is therefore up to the planning to take the measures it considers necessary for not being able to take place. </SEG> 
<SEG id="931"> (the session was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.) </SEG> 
<SEG id="932"> When one is offered money is unquestionably the privilege to establish clear objectives, and that is what has been done to the Commissioner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="933"> This presence cannot give a perspective to the political project that follow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="934"> If we see the Commission as a virtual powers of political cometeremos a mistake. </SEG> 
<SEG id="935"> Parliament must be consulted and informed on a regular basis, and this is the second request to formulate the rapporteurs and that we all have to support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="936"> The Heads of government have confirmed the Commission of the support that process with support and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="937"> It was Parliament that apoyÃ the proposal of the Commission to create the European Agency for the joint debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="938"> As the House knows, we believe it is necessary to make a reference explÃ ­ quotation to this in the regulation. despite the eloquence of Mr. </SEG> 
<SEG id="939"> The Commission will place the miÃ, rcoles at 11.30 a.m. </SEG> 
<SEG id="940"> The leaders agreed a framework may be extended and updated of cooperation between Asia and Europe that constitute the programme of work for the forthcoming. </SEG> 
<SEG id="941"> In my opinion these issues remind us of the important role that represent Europe in Asia, not only in terms of economic and trade, although it has to be said that one of the reasons for the Commission: it is that we have kept our word to maintain open our markets to the exports of this during the past two years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="942"> I believe that we have made an excellent declaraciÃ political, but still remain to be resolved some of the problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="943"> We know that the Commission takes very seriously the concerns and we fully support this at what it concerns. </SEG> 
<SEG id="944"> It is necessary to improve the existing mechanism in the transposiciÃ from Community law, to increase the safety presumed and overcome their slowness present. </SEG> 
<SEG id="945"> For it worsen--could to encourage the creation of new regional organisations, beginning there already exists where Community presence, as is the case of the pacÃ specific democratic and pacÃ scientific South. </SEG> 
<SEG id="946"> It contribuirÃ really to which the pesquerÃ companies are sustainable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="947"> I believe that the future of the pesquerÃ in international waters depends on these organisations and all the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, are now fewer. to defend the position of the United Nations, both in the new as in new York, to which reference has been made here, we must have a very active presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="948"> This is the reason why I believe that the Commission has a role importantÃ represents simo to encourage fishermen to catch up front, to cooperate with it and to propose a solution with which we are all in agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="949"> In addition to this, the Commission must take charge of all kinds of tasks in connection with the negotiations that have to be carried out in the context of the regional fisheries organisations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="950"> Signs now President, have the same problem that still, but in my case is even more serious. </SEG> 
<SEG id="951"> However, Commissioner, ladies orÃ, these are the solutions recommended by the Committee on agriculture and rural development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="952"> At times we have come to ask to what extent the own crises clica market is caused by the action of the above the speculative business structures, thus ensuring that are beyond the control of the sector in funciÃ their interests. </SEG> 
<SEG id="953"> The extra support Community raised in the report by Mr Garot is, to my mind, contrary to all sanity in these years, when the agenda 2000 and the forthcoming enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe we need to reform our common agricultural policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="954"> We intend to introduce a regime of safe and it is clear that is based on criteria, in my opinion, the rapporteur has done an excellent job which demonstrates that the Commission gives much stake when pursuing a clearly defined, as is the case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="955"> On the one hand, the producers important, or those who are integrated with the firms of production, not participarÃ in this mechanism, preferring the systems that already have: individual savings, the stamos banking, in-depth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="956"> Signs now President, but Commissioner, ladies and permÃ much success, tanme who say beforehand that in principle I welcome the proposal of the Commission to create a Fund of regulation, also in the framework of the Commission austrÃ represents aca. </SEG> 
<SEG id="957"> I gustarÃ much to thank the rapporteur for his report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="958"> I understand that you want to have a organizaciÃ enlargement of the market for the intensive farming and the collapse of the agricultural policy as it is linked to the ground, when it is a question of an extensive production. </SEG> 
<SEG id="959"> There is already a organizaciÃ of markets and could not make the mistake of questioning the existence of markets, since in general terms has the desired effect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="960"> In view of the Commission is totally justified that only require greater rigour to the farmers who participate in the background of regulation, since after all these receive a stable incomes to change, in both those that they do not get any. </SEG> 
<SEG id="961"> (the session was closed 11.10 p.m.) </SEG> 
<SEG id="962"> The appeal from the tax on the value of the next adido representÃ the 36%, and the traditional own resources amounted to 15% of the total. </SEG> 
<SEG id="963"> Another element of the reform which corresponds fully with one of the fundamental priorities identified by the Court of justice is the convenience of giving greater importance to the mediciÃ the results and the actuaciÃ within a framework of resources which is consistent with the priorities and the predetermined objectives that are clearly defined and can be measured. </SEG> 
<SEG id="964"> It is good that so much is and I want to thank sincerely, in Russia, as the Members of the Court of Auditors and its services, the support given to the reform of the Commission with its report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="965"> In this context and given its proximity, I would like to recall that, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we have proposed a modification of the Treaty that will enable us to create a European fiscalÃ responsible for pursuing the fraud against the financial interests of the Community, and I sincerely hope that the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice will not be permitted to take note of the proposal or to delete them without, but that this was discussed seriously. </SEG> 
<SEG id="966"> The reality, such as the describes the annual report, it is rather disappointing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="967"> The number of errors identified is too high in order to be able to provide that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="968"> The amount intended to activities of planificaciÃ has remained cuts in EUR 240 million. </SEG> 
<SEG id="969"> He assumed that the report of the Court of Auditors a little easier to use, and that in some of the recommendations of the darÃ could be clear, for example, one or two recommendations clear by. </SEG> 
<SEG id="970"> In 1995 was approved a Convention on the protection of the interests of micos liberalization of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="971"> The Commission and the Member States worsen--could were taken in this area ngulo and use the results of the report as a tool to improve its actuaciÃ in the gestiÃ the finances of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="972"> I know that this report and the resolution on which we are preparing to engage the Parliament in the context of the approval of the Commission gestiÃ contribuirÃ do to boost the vigilance with regard to the Community expenditure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="973"> And on this point, Madam President, I gustarÃ relates to deny and hope that someone from the Council to come here. </SEG> 
<SEG id="974"> The Court, as in other years, has not signs alado precisely the other nde have produced the faults. </SEG> 
<SEG id="975"> Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union is about and the report of the Court of Auditors makes it clear that still must carry out a hard work in the applicant countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="976"> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, recently come to an agreement with the Court of Auditors for the that could receive information from the Court of Auditors in advance with carÃ system cter perfectly confidential and agree that the mantendrÃ could effectively in silence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="977"> I would also like to address to the Council and to ask why not advances in regard to Article 24 of the financial regulation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="978"> It may be that some sense of the European Union to contribute to the resolution of the problem and to set up to George Bush in the place of the history that deserves - that his dustbin! </SEG> 
<SEG id="979"> We must not look for scapegoats, nor in our institutions and in our States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="980"> Firstly, with regard to the procedure for the presentation of the annual report to the Parliament and to the Committee on budgetary control, I am pleased to hear the reassurances from their signs orÃ companies in the sense that the situation this year is more successful than in previous years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="981"> But we will have the opportunity to address about all that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="982"> When it is important, from the point of view of the fiscalizaciÃ, to mention everything that needs to be mentioned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="983"> Ladies orÃ companies, as it should be noted, the final part of the President of the Court of Auditors has suffered the consequences of the intromisiÃ an awful between between his speech and this House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="984"> Some of the amendments, such as amendments Nos 1 and 18, which have to do with issues that ataÃ into fundamentally in the United Kingdom, and I have to say that all of the groups of the United Kingdom, are Socialists, Greens, the popular or have defended with great vehemence and have been approved in the Committee on the environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="985"> Signs now President, in March of this year we adopted the directive on the tramways intended for the transport of persons. </SEG> 
<SEG id="986"> We believe that it should be borne by the manufacturer's trade obligations laid down in the legislation relating to the safety of the products. </SEG> 
<SEG id="987"> We have heard the arguments in favour of the same and also to repeat the arguments of the sector that since we heard in the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="988"> Worsen--could enough with the seller report the buyer on the nature of the products and the insufficient information available on the same. </SEG> 
<SEG id="989"> For, a question addressed to the European Commission in relation to Article 4 with regard to European standards and to the issue of whether these rules must be made. </SEG> 
<SEG id="990"> I am pleased with the exceptions that amendments to the settlements of institutions and charitable organisations without the high-minded of profit, and for the items that are marketed as items of second hand in car boot sales or on the part of individuals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="991"> Confidence in the safety of the products and welfare as well as sales are a plusvalÃ easier for the European label in a particularly difficult and decisive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="992"> When in another context, we call on the Commission to present a proposal relating to the safety of services, it is incomprehensible that now we want to regulate jointly the aspects relating to the services, instead of waiting for the Commission to present its proposal, in effect, it is already possible to envisage that surgirÃ Afghanistan problems of delimitaciÃ integration mbito of aplicaciÃ the different standards and the uncertainty dica presumed to be incrementarÃ with time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="993"> I would like to say a few words to present the main aspects of this proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="994"> Likewise, we have provided the possibility of opening the system to third countries, in particular, to the candidate countries: the procedures to introduce emergency measures at Community level, so that we can intervene with haste to root the opinion of a Committee of reglamentaciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="995"> This new requirement, not through any substantial additional responsibility in the case of this type of shops. </SEG> 
<SEG id="996"> To replace the word "leading provider" by "," as proposed in amendment no 11, crearÃ easier confusiÃ that clarity, since there is no definiciÃ of service providers in the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="997"> Although the Commission is in favour of the creation of a network as soon as possible, to this end worsen--could system to be agreed between the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="998"> Such a certificate can always used to provide evidence, but it cannot be considered in as a litmus test. </SEG> 
<SEG id="999"> Having explained in detail the reasons why the Commission cannot accept amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 to 30, 32, 33, 36 to 34, and part of amendment no 7, the second part of amendment no 21, and the first part of amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission can accept amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31 and 35 and part of amendment no 7, the first part of amendment no 21, and the second part of amendments Nos 27 and 34, because they constitute an improvement and a clarificaciÃ the proposal of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1000"> Of course, Mr Barón if it is a Socialist Italian can form part of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1001"> I believe that there is no conflict between amendment no 12 and amendment no 37. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1002"> With regard to the order of the Commission, I leave it to the President, and alo which, in any case, I am against the three amendments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1003"> The countries outside the Community face, there is no doubt, particularly serious problems linked to economic development. regional inequalities are acrecientan endlessly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1004"> With regard to respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, in the name of a harmonised European policy in the field of immigration, in addition to the instruments presumed to ensure their fair treatment, which create instruments of financial aid in favour of all of these and other venes that, having completed a cycle of studies or be higher in the European States, wish to return to their countries of origin to start to exercise a professional activity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1005"> I would like to highlight a factor, which is frankly deciding on this issue; the lack of equality in the field of labour. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1006"> Although tardÃ represents amente, the programme relating to the Community framework strategy on equality between men and women (2001-2005), which differs markedly from the former and, in particular, of the fourth programme of action which expires at the end of this year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1007"> On the one hand, because we have taken into account various proposals for improvements tabled by my Group on the other, because it insists on the need to examine the situation of women in the national labour markets and the lack of access to social security systems on the basis of estadÃ represents sticas drawn up on the basis of data representative and broken down according to gender. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1008"> My Party has serious reservations regarding to apply Community legislation on the sale of consumer products, as well as on the refusal to implement the concept of mutual recognition of standards. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1009"> Now I understand and labour to offer the guarantee that these shops permanecerÃ Afghanistan intact and not exempt from the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1010"> Finally, amendment no 15 with a free hand to the Commission with regard to the lingÃ have to do stico of the Agency, which we consider very worrying. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1011"> The decision-making procedures, the foundations of the decentralised (not only in the economy, where stina has acquired the significance of their separaciÃ Yugoslavia), the treatment of the dual structure between the Council of administration and the Commission, can prove positive movements in the face of the great burocrÃ inadequacy of the European Agency for the joint debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1012"> We are therefore voting against both of the proposal of the Commission and of Parliament's report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1013"> For all of these reasons, it seems justified to adapt the existing Community legislation on the matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1014"> Likewise, the Fund offers the possibility that the administrations to grant aid more or less hidden in the form of cofinanciaciÃ opposition on the part of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1015"> (El) despite its serious deficiencies, the Morillon report is, without doubt, made the proposal of the Commission with regard to the European Union - the  urquÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1016"> We have voted against. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1017"> Like the rapporteur, we must admit that Turkey has made progress in some areas, and that there are positive signs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1018"> Since 1987, our Assembly he initiated the victims to the recognition, and the unanimous approval of the present amendment demonstrating the consistency of Parliament in this debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1019"> The Union must make proposals and to consider the enlargement as a strategy of geopolitical indispensable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1020"> These ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and disgraceful. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1021"> Since several years ago, as a Member of the delegation for relations with canadÃ system, I have noted the functioning of one of these regional organisations, the organizaciÃ fishing in the north-west), in the participating States in this region, among them canadÃ system, as well as all those who use in this place in traditional fishing, including France, Spain and other European countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1022"> Not contentarÃ up its fleet of caÃ company oneras, by flying the flags of the 'ring of stars ", monitor the implementation of its policies on fisheries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1023"> What is important is not, then, to comply with the will of hegemonÃ relates to the Commission and to weaken the position of Europe, which would be in contradicciÃ with a proper aplicaciÃ from the principle of subsidiarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1024"> Finally, following difficult negotiations at a result that is worth defending. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1025"> Thus, the objective of this proposal, which seeks to replace three directives on the incineration of waste is to improve the quality of the air, water, soil, the health of the people, reducing the emissions of polluting substances connected with the activities of and coincineraciÃ, and above all, of dioxins and furans of heavy metals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1026"> However, I think it is important to highlight how innovation which is now no longer be dealt Ãºnicamente emissions to the but also of emissions in the water and the soil. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1027"> The proposal has been improved during its elaboraciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1028"> The introduction of the mites do far more stringent NOx emissions for the new coincineraciÃ facilities, such as the cement works, is another step forward which system of incentive for the reduction of emissions, despite the fact that the proposed rules do not reflect the best technical available. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1029"> (in) now President, orÃ aims, I apologise - especially to Mr Blokland - by having arrived a few Minutes late. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1030"> To conclude, the present directive is a major contribution to the reduction of the adverse effects on the environment and the risks that these represent for human health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1031"> The European Parliament honrarÃ system, in the name of discrimination and the fight against exclusion and in respect of the responsibilities of each one, to give a strong impetus to the creation of a mechanism that will exist, namely that the essential principle of solidarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1032"> There is, however, large differences between the various countries of the Union, and there is a lack of data estadÃ much detailed sticos comparable in order to be able to see what is it credible way, which is in force in each country, is - and the other nde- what works best, what are the points of biles, etcÃ, or by the Commission, precisely, in my opinion, drawn up on behalf of the policy of economic and monetary Union, it highlights the need to legislate, before the Community rules on the supplementary insurance schemes of disease, that the Commission draw up a Green Paper which collect and sistematice all of these data now dispersed and all the information on this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1033"> Until now, this matter has been considered tabÃº in some measure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1034"> There is the danger that due to the presence of serious risks of the citizens with health problems and elderly people as only a limited can employ of private insurance, which is incompatible with the social dimension. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1035"> The second point of view illustrated by the Commission and the rapporteur is shared by many colleagues consists in promoting the regulations and the other to digos action needed to establish, between insurers, forms of mutualizaciÃ the costs - guaranteeing to all the prestaciÃ a good quality health care - and to avoid the risk of developing, I cticas discriminatory, as well as a found the risks and customers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1036"> I believe that it is absolutely errÃ other neo that the money will be the deciding factor to come first in the queue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1037"> The new proposal of the Committee on employment and social Affairs is right: first we draw up a report on a Green Paper and then decide whether we need a directive or a recommendation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1038"> At present, in the Netherlands is producing a debate about the introduction of structural changes in the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1039"> This is the basis of which we have to work on the basis of the Commission to draw up an initiative and creating specific benchmarks that may develop in neas guidelines for the health systems of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1040"> Therefore, it is unlikely that the answer is an absolute only and for all the safe for dicos. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1041"> For that reason, I believe that we must support the content of the report by Mr Rocard, in that it, which calls on the Commission to the prestaciÃ a service, a Green Paper that we will meet the current State of the safe in the Member States and also to define the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1042"> Both are developing on a model of three pillars: the State, the business and the private. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1043"> With regard to the supplementary pensions, the European Union has already produced a series of standards, and it has made to the redacciÃ a Green Paper which follows a draft directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1044"> (in) now, Mr President, I would like to express my thanks and congratulations to Mr Rocard for his report, and to congratulate Mr. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1045"> This study will constitute the basis for a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament to propose initiatives or measures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1046"> In relation to the amendments of the Committee on Budgets, I can State with alegrÃ that have all been incorporated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1047"> We have supported the caracterÃ represents sticos features of the programme, as are the treatment of other fenÃ multidimensional meno, the measures on health, education, housing, consistency and complementarity with other partners, as well as the participation of non-governmental organisations, and the people affected by the social exclusion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1048"> This means that we need to take advantage of the cycle of the bottom-up to bring the situation to a balance or a. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1049"> In this respect I would simply that the Ecofin Council has requested of the Commission that, as from next year, is already included in the stability programmes precisely this aspect of long term of the finances relating to the ageing of the population. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1050"> One of the positive of the programme of the Netherlands is the special attention paid to that - as I said earlier, the impact of the ageing of the population in the public finance over the next few years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1051"> For that reason, the resulting from the budget for the year 2000, in the case of the German system, a system of superÃ without a point and means of gross domestic product. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1052"> If we add to this the evolution of the exchange rate of the euro with regard to the reduction of inflation, we have had a clear negative impact in terms of inflation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1053"> Going in the sense of do with a system of public deal with private systems of capitalizaciÃ and, of course, are compatible with backing for the investment Fund that can get tax advantages in the long term and that can help to deal with the problem of ageing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1054"> The third principle that we que, then, is the principle of caution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1055"> We must remember that is currently being discussed various proposals administrative, which will help to strengthen the effectiveness and the relevance of the Community mechanism and, Consequently - so I hope -, the confidence of consumers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1056"> Nevertheless, this relatively low incidence is no reason to be satisfied. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1057"> Frankly, I decepcionÃ than in the statement made yesterday that Prime Minister Jospin had not ningÃºn recognition of the role so positive that has the Community over the last few years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1058"> There is a clear need to find explanations of the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France, but also in other Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1059"> The food and veterinary office of the Commission gives absolute priority to the control of the Member States in relation to measures against BSE. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1060"> With regard to its security, permÃ represents tanme to repeat that there is already a wide range of controls in place to ensure that the animal meal does not represent a threat of BSE. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1061"> And so, although may prove difficult to believe, were needed four years to adopt a measure that I consider essential to the protection of public health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1062"> Signs now President of the Council, I would like to demand specifically that the Council will, at last, its opinion about the rules of procedure on the subject. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1063"> In this situation, the only way to break the much rculo of transmission of BSE is the total prohibiciÃ from using animal meal in feedingstuffs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1064"> In this matter, I would like to say that the Liberal Group has tabled an amendment which I hope will be approved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1065"> The policies must be to change this State of Affairs so that the real culprits of this crisis are penalised and for which specific decisions to give a first step in order to put an end to this crisis dramÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1066"> It would, then, that revised. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1067"> The labelling of beef which has been approved, that labelling is a minimum and entered into force will only two and a half months, does not make it possible to trace the origin of the animal adequately and have banned very tardÃ represents amente specific risk materials. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1068"> The public must be fully informed of the of the tests that I refer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1069"> At that time, however, the President of the Council, did not do anything, or almost nothing, as its homÃ other logos nor did nothing to the subject of the consequences of Chernobyl, nothing in the way of the AIDS epidemic, nothing in the way of the contaminated blood, provided for the same reason: not trigger the in public opinion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1070"> The French ocasionarÃ an enormous increase in demand, but the existence of this products are limited. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1071"> Consumers have lost confidence, and to contain this it is necessary to extend the evidence of BSE in cattle and sheep. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1072"> In the sense of the proposal of the Commission is now much important work for the animal meal to respond to the require safety criteria. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1073"> By else, I fully agree, for once, and without that I shall have said with regard to the ladies Ainardi, presently and Grossetête. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1074"> Well, accepted by the Council and the Commission, have a financial basis enough to carry out a policy of solid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1075"> We must tackle it. Mr. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1076"> Madam President, now President, but Commissioner, I am delighted to hear here, in this Chamber, that, whatever the cost, it is necessary to change the CAP. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1077"> We had denounced in its time, this same, with Jimmy Goldsmith. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1078"> Food must be a safe food for human beings. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1079"> I consider very exemplary that France has been quick to take this step. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1080"> But, that those they were not help! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1081"> For this reason, I am surprised that in these circumstances we are able to use or processed corpses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1082"> It was recently published in the United Kingdom has the report on BSE. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1083"> I would suggest that the European Union applies the principle of caution with regard to beef from France. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1084"> Today we must know, since we are still in the dark, what are the data, what are the measures that should be taken. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1085"> On the other hand, I have heard all of these proposals; I am not insensitive to them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1086"> If the representatives of the Member States to come and tell me that the legislation has not been implemented in their entirety, perhaps we should rethink the subject, but we will not do so because of the scientific we say that it is necessary, but because there are gaps in the implementation of the law in the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1087"> The best way of not or do not invite us. rnos is in any case, Mr. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1088"> The Commission considers that the aclaraciÃ and of those policies of the agreements of readmisiÃ Commission desempeÃ designed an important role and at the moment they are in the process of negociaciÃ Commission of the first Community agreements of readmisiÃ with Russia, Sri Lanka, the pakistÃ and Morocco. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1089"> What proposals does the Commission on this matter on the basis of Article 31 of the Union? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1090"> (the President cut the speaker off) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1091"> The aim during this period has been cut the budget deficit for achieving a monetary policy than acomodante, lower interest rates and a major growth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1092"> I say all that the euro is not introducirÃ the 1 January 2002, the euro is already in our pocket; what we have with coins fraccionarias different, but we already have in the pocket. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1093"> The values will require laid down by the directive 92 / 72 was not exceeded in the city of Athens, although it should be noted that it was not carried out measurements in the Middle of the summer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1094"> Subject: aid pÃºblicas the audiovisual sector in a seminar of the French Presidency on the industries connected with the culture, a representative of the general direction of the competences of the European afirmÃ that the legal obligations of investment imposed on the lines of televisiÃ Commission constitute State aid by the fact that these investments are imposed with carÃ system cter mandatory by the legislator. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1095"> They will be respected and protected ’. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1096"> However, it is not self-evident, since the new growth is very truly unequal and can be acompaÃ company ado, as we have seen in the United States for around ten years, by fenÃ and other less persistent of insecurity, of exclusion, poverty, ghettizaciÃ urban debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1097"> The governments of the Member States do not accept this definiciÃ, which is true is something simple and cheap. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1098"> In the atmosphere hostile that creates, are many of those who remain in the road and who are refused. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1099"> Signs now President, in this plenary is monitoring very frequently, as a song, the exaltaciÃ the European social model, the social market economy that is playing with pride - many think - the wild model of the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1100"> (failing in cnico) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1101"> This is a huge number. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1102"> Furthermore, we need to incorporate all levels. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1103"> I agree on the need for a better understanding of the causes of poverty, support the preventive action against exclusion as a result of mergers, industrial change, transfers of undertakings, desertizaciÃ cooperation, on the Commission hiperconcentraciÃ urban, innovative and concrete actions that a company in the participation of the social partners, local and national administrations and the joint action of the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1104"> There has been a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and the role of the social and structural reforms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1105"> It is a problem of carÃ system cter presumed, since, under the terms of the Treaty, is the reference to the social exclusion and poverty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1106"> In my opinion, these proposals are a pragmÃ political response to her question. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1107"> But I agree with the strategy does not necessarily mean agreeing on the details. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1108"> If we defined a clear and binding for the Member States, the various systems that have to meet such requirements must have a period of proof. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1109"> The renewables will not be a panacea for solving this problem, but there is no doubt that, in large part, can help to improve the situation and to diversify the sources of energy and to reduce our dependence on oil, on the other hand we do not vendrÃ nothing wrong. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1110"> I am going to repeat three of our demands. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1111"> The establishment of realistic objectives servirÃ, no doubt for increasing the confidence of the citizen in the political power and that applies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1112"> I believe that a policy of following in the field of renewables is a symbol for the Europe of tomorrow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1113"> By, these agreements should enable the European countries to fulfil its contribution to achieving the objectives set in Kyoto. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1114"> It is unfortunate that excludes any categorÃ that can contribute to the consecuciÃ objective general regain power from waste - whether they are projects to small scale as if it is a part of the line. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1115"> The complying biomass of peat in its fotosÃ represents ntesis and production of vegetable waste is similar to that of the demÃ than plant biomass. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1116"> I would like to inform Mr Chichester that off the coast of my people are setting up quickly, in the sea, a project which, without a doubt, is going to go on working in very little time, so I gustarÃ relates to invite you to see it when we have already set in motion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1117"> The economic policies and on the abandonment of nuclear energy, for example in Sweden and in Germany, has shown that if we do not exist on the horizon, policies and other alternative power ecolÃ gicas that are feasible to a price competitiveness, the debate is doomed to failure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1118"> For this reason, the Member States should have binding targets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1119"> Therefore, I am optimistic about the potential future of renewables, provided that the necessary incentives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1120"> I believe that we need a great deal of courage to lay continuously to renewables in the place they deserve. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1121"> A rise fortÃ ­ schism the price of oil, admittedly, we sitÃºa with major brutality on the problems associated with our dependence on the political power of the sources of power. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1122"> We cannot, therefore, accept amendment no 28. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1123"> However, in doing so, the Commission is very well aware that the terms used not prejudge its right of initiative and must not be incompatible with the market only of electricity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1124"> In the Commission for the tayikistÃ, where there are 25 000 widows, as only one of the 26 delegates was a woman. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1125"> Despite the fact that the Commission has been confined to women, there are studies which show that the participation of women in the peacekeeping forces of the UN improvement in relations with the local population and the general public. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1126"> The report report goes into this in detail and very specific field carries repeating that we, as the Group of the European people ’ s Party and the European Democrats call be drawn in the sense of an official document. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1127"> From the point of view, I believe that the amendment that can act as a defeat, practice or a step atrÃ technical system ctico instead of a real commitment, which is not worthy of the cause of the woman. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1128"> Were maintained by. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1129"> Also of Portugal, where women do not even have access to the diplomacy of the "revoluciÃ resolution of April 1974", has demonstrated recently, with the case of East Timor and our Ambassador in Indonesia, in Indonesia, that the role of a woman and its sensitivity to the problems and the suffering of a people that afrontÃ at alone a fight of 25 years by the freedom can be respects all over the world and, in particular, here, in the European Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1130"> To date, there are quite a few Member States that what we have done. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1131"> Therefore, it is necessary to take into account this dimensiÃ in tracing the policies of the European Union in the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1132"> Unfortunately, it does not come to define the concepts and make distinctions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1133"> Broadcasts, please, to the Council our protest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1134"> Are people with different experiences; experiences required in the way in which the political, especially in the gestiÃ resolution of the conflicts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1135"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1136"> That brings me to the second point, but if it wishes to regulate the sector, be they look at several points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1137"> The past few weeks, I have known that there is a great deal of interest on the part of the international trade Union rculos to do as some of the national trade unions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1138"> Alegaciã in against two. should then they agree with a wage for housewives? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1139"> It makes life easier for many families and that equality of opportunities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1140"> Often, in this project have been linked to two or three families to put together a person. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1141"> It bamos gathered in the plenary of this first plenary part-session of the month of October, while the debate was held on the situation in Yugoslavia, as we knew of the courageous of the Serbian people, and immediately, as would, dear colleagues, we call for the lifting of the international sanctions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1142"> With it, Europe has shown the vitality of its civilisation, within the framework of the history of the world, and its ability to imaginaciÃ political creative for its future development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1143"> It is clear that the issue of the situation in Kosovo is a problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1144"> On the other hand, we gustarÃ producers to have the opportunity to demonstrate to Europe that we are capable of developing the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro in Yugoslavia by our own media, the recognition of the autÃ, nticos principles of democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1145"> I must say that, listening to you, I impresionÃ and, by the way in which you owned a so difficult, and at the same time by its determination. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1146"> Is arreglarÃ in the Minutes, but Watson. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1147"> Access to documents and information on the activities of the institutions enables the citizens of control to the other rganos of government of the EU and encourages greater efficiency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1148"> I consider that a fifth amendment important is the annual report should especially to examine the documents which have to be kept secret or which, at least, are kept secret. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1149"> This issue is ambiguous, and it is possible that we are and will remain in force more restrictive rules, which we have tabled amendments on this point, among others. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1150"> The Committee on foreign Affairs rejects the idea of excluding the transparency, automÃ system ticamente and Group, to the documents relating to foreign Affairs and security. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1151"> If we want the rights of the citizens to be truly effective, we need to those places of new creation of staff specifically drawn which will lead to the citizens who are seeking information to the complicated maze of the institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1152"> These are important in order to be able to reach an internal advertising. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1153"> I welcome the fact that Parliament has managed to create a broad majority in favour of greater openness. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1154"> Signs now, Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for this excellent work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1155"> Signs now President, access and transparency in the European Union do not enjoy good reputation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1156"> To be so, committed an error, since it is a question of the credibility and reliability that has the European Union for the citizen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1157"> Documents are many things, and we gustarÃ relates to ensure that an accession as wide as possible to many different types of documents of the various forms of possible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1158"> Signs now President, the position of the Commission with regard to public access to the documents can be seen in the internal manual, which was referred to the 11 October to the employees of the Commission to inform you of how we are to handle applications for access to the documents presented by the Members of the European Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1159"> This must be eliminated or, at least, extended so that it includes the consideration of evaluating the interest of the applicant. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1160"> The normal way in which developing cooperation in the world with the rules of the game and applications of diplomacy, that is to say, that everything is carried out with the red reductions, not acting in the modern cooperation which has developed in the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1161"> There is that conflating it with the role of the European Parliament or with the future interinstitutional agreements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1162"> I believe that we have taken a step forward towards the exercise of the right of the citizen to information and knowledge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1163"> However, he is not the only to whom I thank, thank you not also Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen of the PPE-DE Group, which has been the author of the motion by virtue of the more stringent the Hughes procedure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1164"> Transparency must establish itself as the pillar system sico of all the activities of the Union, but the right of access to documents is not still sufuciente of by for the consumaciÃ of transparency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1165"> The European Parliament calls for, then, that the common European security and defence policy to be introduced in the future in the structures of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1166"> When dirigiÃ debate in Parliament, on 3 October last, President Prodi was refiriÃ the triÃ ngulo institutional system and evocÃ that in a European system based on checks and balances, the smooth functioning of each instituciÃ Commission contributes to the public interest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1167"> I recognise that the big challenge in this regulation is the precise of what are the documents. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1168"> I would like to stress that, in its time,, the Commission could accept all of the amendments, such as amendment no 9, 18, 21, 23, 25 in part, the 26.1), 28, 35, 38, the 40.1, the 40.6, 41.1, 42, the 43.1, 47, 49 and 52. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1169"> I would like to vote on occasions in favour of the proposals formulated by the Commission, and it is indeed necessary that Members have the list of amendments which the Commission can support, and the list of those who do not want to support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1170"> The funds of the credit institutions </SEG> 
<SEG id="1171"> By, and most controversial, the Commission made a firm appeal on behalf of the utilizaciÃ a procedure of so much to accession for implementing this legislation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1172"> These amendments replaced a number of other proposals in the report which probably will be rejected in the Commission, and then they will be replaced by these new amendments arising out of this consensus. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1173"> Mr President, in view of the excellent vote of support to this report, and given the response of the Commission this morning, it is obvious - if we can all parts on which we have voted - that, on the basis of Article 69 (2) of the rules of procedure, we had to postpone the debate on the draft legislative resolution in order to be able to initiate negotiations fructÃ represents feras with the Commission and the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1174"> Signs now President, I am sorry if I said that the PPE-DE Group also had to request a postponement of the Commission, but its coordinating acercÃ me and told me that they also querÃ could postpone the issue until the November II part-session, in place of voting now. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1175"> The reason why sugerirÃ that aplazÃ; we want the signs is that - as has alado Mr Goebbels - this is a very important issue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1176"> It is not, how much it costs the Commission, but it is no doubt of hundreds of thousands of frank, or Belgian francs, of our budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1177"> I know that in France have sacrificed entire herds and it seems that that is the best way to proceed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1178"> To eliminate the animal meal from the alimentaciÃ all animals, not only of the cattle and sheep farming, but also of the pigmeat, poultry and fish, </SEG> 
<SEG id="1179"> This is not acceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1180"> It with, as stas as consumers tranquilizarÃ and the farmers oirÃ the message of solidarity that we wish to give them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1181"> It is necessary and urgent to go further: promoting a change of the common agricultural policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1182"> The use of animal meal in cattle is not that the first step in this direction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1183"> I greatly regret, however, that the amendments tabled by our Group were not adopted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1184"> I believe that it would be sensible to reduce the working hours of the people working in companies that polluting. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1185"> I will end by insisting once again on the fact that the generalizaciÃ from the exploitation of hazardous waste should not lead us to adapt to the production of such waste. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1186"> In effect, if, for example, to have more than enough to live on pensions, less poor. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1187"> The report raises an appropriation of EUR 100 million over five years to reduce poverty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1188"> I therefore give my unreserved support to the proposal to set in motion a process of Luxembourg (a) in the social economy, which includes the neas guidelines and national action plans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1189"> Indeed, the report requests that fixed qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1190"> The present its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission is complying with the request of the Council present "for June 2000" a "initiative for cooperation in this field. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1191"> Signs now President, I have abstained for a very specific reason: this report, in my opinion, has not carried out, from the point of view, these developments that I expected and auguraba. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1192"> I trust that this system is extended to all the cities of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1193"> Some of the proposals of the European Parliament are not realistic and can count on my support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1194"> He must be able to get better in a future which are easier pÃºblicamente known to the good. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1195"> The people who have higher incomes and are aware of the environment have the freedom to choose a more cleaning within a free market, while the rest remains to be able to choose. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1196"> In accordance with the directive, in the first place is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution: </SEG> 
<SEG id="1197"> These three reasons are the following: first, because there are in the process of democracy and in the profundizaciÃ from the requirement of the respect of human rights, particularly in relation to the populations is much genas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1198"> Signs now President, in this debate, as we want to express very well what has been said by other colleagues who have spoken before me in the use of the word, the solidarity and support of our instituciÃ the Central American Parliament at a time when we are fighting for that keeping the priority in the external relations of the European Union with the countries of iberoamÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1199"> I have the reservations that have been able to express our company Ero and dear friend, the chairman of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, Mr Seguro, with regard to the issue of human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1200"> For, in the political dialogue with the authorities centroamericanas, the Commission by reiterating the importance that should be given to the process of regional integration as an instrument to strengthen and development in the area. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1201"> To hold on to power has not hesitated to take the obsessive debate on the "marfilidad", causing a wave of xenophobia: hatred in another, abroad, originally from Burkina or the Malian and, however, there are many working and living in the territory of Côte d ’ Ivoire since long years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1202"> The instauraciÃ a real democracy in the ivory coast will not be possible without the creation of a Committee of inquiry independent of the victims committed and without the official commitment to ensure that human rights are respected and the civil peace. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1203"> Some believe that the importance of democracy is when it comes to Africa, which are complex procedures, which is to be given time at the time, but I do not think there is any possible compromise with the democracy and the issue that is raised today for the ivory coast is the same as that which was raised for example to Guinea, when we know that there are people currently in prisiÃ and that there is a system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1204"> I will end with the following: the dictatorships exist, but President, because there are people who are suffering from poverty, which do not have access to information, which do not have access to knowledge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1205"> Not ilÃ than the European celebraciÃ required today the new presidential elections in which could participate, this time, all the candidates. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1206"> It is taken in many parts of Africa with the various mixtures of religious and tnicas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1207"> These elections must allow the national parties that were excluded in the presidential and compensate, though, is only partially, the imperfections of this first choice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1208"> On the situation in Burma </SEG> 
<SEG id="1209"> They are carrying out a great offensive against the Karen people and against the people, and, as the rapporteur has stated, the UN does not exist in any signs of dialogue between the SPDC and the national League for democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1210"> For that reason, we reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and of the Council on this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1211"> I hope that in giving priority to this matter as urgent, this Parliament will send a clear message to the people of Burma that its pressing is not forgotten and that we acknowledge that the situation in Burma is getting worse rather than better, and we are determined to try to do something about this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1212"> It has been a long time coming. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1213"> In this it gives the danger that the reforms and the desacoplen is, of that there can be economic progress and liberalization without liberalization in the political and strengthening the rule of law, although I am of the opinion that without a constitutional State that functions, trade, aid and investment will not be lost in the long term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1214"> Signs now President, I agree with my predecessors on the floor with many essential points of what you have said today, as much of what is happening in Vietnam is not acceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1215"> Yet, we now say human rights watch, which made reference to Mr Swoboda, that Vietnam has resulted in the last time some steps to improve the situation in relation to human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1216"> These highly secret documents we provide a extraÃ company to look behind the scenes of the policy of the Vietnamese administration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1217"> The Commission is still convinced, however, that can only be a lasting solution to the current situation through a dialogue between the military regime, the democratically elected ticamente and the representatives of the minorÃ companies, tnicas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1218"> There are also clear pressures of the Vietnamese authorities to their own press has a regime of self-censorship. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1219"> In accordance with the directive, come now to the debate on the following motions for resolution: </SEG> 
<SEG id="1220"> Also we demand that the EU should provide support and assistance, not only in the south-west, but in all the areas that have been affected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1221"> I would ask you all to support our resolution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1222"> It is urgent that the Commission does not confine itself to deploy actions of carÃ system cter extraordinary when the aims of strofes has already occurred. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1223"> The Commission has taken two initiatives in this respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1224"> Signs now President, there has been a mistake merely lingÃ have to do stico at introducing one of the amendments in the resolution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1225"> The Commission on its postergaciÃ Commission means put the request to the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1226"> (Parliament adopted the resolution) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1227"> The report on the part of the constataciÃ that an increasing part of the insurance in Europe is covered by insurance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1228"> It seems to me odd that will now maniatar to the Commission for a proposal for a directive, but that at the same time I ask a Green Paper on the current State of the voluntary associations and the safe for dicos complementary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1229"> In a time in which the ages of spectacular manner, it is crucial that we try to improve the health system for the people of Europe as a whole. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1230"> Not could contribute to it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1231"> Signs now President, there are strong arguments in favour of the victims to accession when it comes to implementing the results of the Basel Committee on banking adecuaciÃ capital. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1232"> In these conditions, an initiative so too, rather the reverse effect the expected imposing additional obligations of our banking sectors without guarantees. despite the demands of this House, the Commission does not have any ningÃºn means to ensure that the banks of the European dejarÃ system to be subject to discriminatory treatment by the American authorities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1233"> We have to take care that Basel, Furthermore, do not produce that banks, have a second burden a demand higher own funds. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1234"> Indeed this first comment, I gustarÃ relates to alar signs that I believe that the operators will also consider satisfactory the approach that has been given to these regulations on the capital which tighten up the issues concerned are at risk. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1235"> Those are the first thoughts of how we could come to achieve a legislative process to be pragmatic and efficient control within the current regulations of the Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1236"> And, indeed, the time has come to admit that the 'European Ombudsman' is sufficiently developed and has already given sufficient evidence of maturity to have a budget of its own. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1237"> The clarified / ed Group supports the position of the Committee on constitutional Affairs that the mandate of the European Ombudsman worsen--could could be extended, and the sooner the better, especially in regard to the powers of investigation of the Ombudsman as laid down in Article 3 of the 1994. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1238"> An Ombudsman is obviously limited by the rules that govern the secret documentary, but rather that the citizens know that he or she, as the Ombudsman, can have access to documents to which they themselves have not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1239"> The starting point of this report is the recommendation of the ombudsmann to the Commission, in cooperation with the former, which make it possible for the candidates to have access to their structural menes already corrected regarding the procedure organised by the same. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1240"> We believe that the institutions of the Community worsen--could could carry out its procedures of contrataciÃ Commission staff, and, indeed, all its procedures, with the forthcoming openness and transparency in order to avoid the allegations of bias, injustice and administrative incompetence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1241"> I refer here to an amendment concerning the requirement of the test incontrovertible proof of the development of a resolution, for example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1242"> Our colleague, Mr Bösch, has already set out briefly here the amendments that have been made in this report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1243"> After having formulated related questions to the Commission about the and the organisation of the internal opposition, recibÃ represents concrete and detailed answers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1244"> So we are starting to open the process of government and to make it transparent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1245"> First, on the structural menes system that was made on the part of the Commission, the corrections are always form of analysis and other nima. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1246"> Of course I was speaking of July 2000. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1247"> Votes </SEG> 
<SEG id="1248"> (Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the debate) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1249"> To review the directive on own resources of the institutes of credit must be carefully balanced the various interests that ahÃ do come into conflict. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1250"> So surgiÃ the idea of a European Academy of policÃ for the Member States of the European Union and for the applicant countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1251"> This is the common position also championed by the rapporteur and that of the European people's Party shares. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1252"> The social situation in most of the Member States of the European Union is of such a nature that, indeed, there is great need of colaboraciÃ between the different bodies of policÃ relates to beyond the borders of their own country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1253"> It seems that the majority of those who have spoken so far it considers that it is essential that the school has a permanent headquarters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1254"> The following schism interim decision but not precarious, a regalito that the Council is usually do in this Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1255"> The rapporteur wishes to that and to kick-start the prevention of crime, the prestaciÃ provision of services, the area and the cross-border surveillance and itself wants to change the internal security so that include the maintenance of law and order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1256"> Here, llos were the ideals that we proponÃ could and he was the type of State by the working. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1257"> I welcome the possibility of the level of some Member States of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1258"> Since the first thoughts on this issue that was made at the European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission comprometiÃ opposition from the Member States to make progress on an action intended to develop what we could consider a European police culture rooted with the high standards of deontologÃ, respect for the rights and freedoms of the citizens and effectiveness in the fight against crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1259"> This aims to which the Academy of policÃ relates to develop above all from a perspective of Intergovernmental cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1260"> For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1261"> - (SV) I have voted against the report on the creation of the European school of temporary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1262"> Doubtless many of our courts are very slow and ponderosos, and it is very difficult to make swift action on these issues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1263"> Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, since that connects with the regulation "Brussels II ', which includes the children whose parents they are separated, as well as to the children outside marriage. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1264"> My own mother sufriÃ and other similar type of separaciÃ and abduction does 85 years old, and still talking about it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1265"> Therefore, what I would like to say that Parliament is on the programme of action on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions in civil matters - whose approval we hope here at the end of this o-, the Commission proposes that the first and give priority to the forthcoming enlargement of the area of mbito of aplicaciÃ from the Brussels II regulation and, Consequently, of this regulation on the right to visit, covering without discrimination to the children of married couples and of partnerships. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1266"> We are going to proceed to the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1267"> Nowadays, sport, and we should say is closely linked to other sectors, such as, for example, the industries of the audiovisual sector or in the promotion and sale of sporting goods. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1268"> What we need is an intelligent and flexible way to interpret the current rules. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1269"> It is, strictly speaking, an attack on democracy, however much we see things in that light. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1270"> That is why the Commission this to wait to receive in for a response to your request of detailed information on the measures planned by the government of the United Kingdom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1271"> This proposal was submitted by the Minister for the economy in a pre-presupuestaria conducted six months before the presentation of the whole project of the 2001 budget in spring. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1272"> Again, I believe that what has been said by Mr Simpson has been of great assistance to reassure us on the likely intentions of the government of the United Kingdom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1273"> Traffic jams are not only a loss of time, not only of generating high costs, but for the environment are all a problem, and that is why I believe, if the government genuinely credible money to solve these problems, then all recibirÃ rather it, in particular all the citizens of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1274"> We are, of cticamente the producer of concentration of the European Union and in spite of this, we have the prices high petrol, diesel prices high in comparison with any other country of Europe - in Britain to pay 1,20 pounds sterling per litre of diesel. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1275"> This point of order relates to the debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1276"> The European Parliament must make to know that their side, and I propose that, once again, that we express with a minute ’ s silence our solidarity and our emociÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1277"> Madam President, is to support fully, since I am one of those who have asked the inserciÃ this point. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1278"> We managed to make some progress. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1279"> The EU profundizarÃ their relations with all the groups - and also to be in contact with the new government of the USA as soon as possible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1280"> Had on the compromise that he himself had been produced, how it is that not what Mrs Voynet, but also, I believe, the majority of the system of European environment Ministers - and this is my last question to the Commissioner rejected it? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1281"> It is to be feared that it has lost the momentum and the American negotiators to change and in may have to start afresh. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1282"> Forests have constituted this time the great obstÃ spectacle. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1283"> A part of the soil of the countries of the European Union will in the sea or desert as a result of the continuing global warming to which they are subjected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1284"> The level of prosperity is high and the price of products petrolÃ represents feros under. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1285"> I congratulate the Commissioner Wallström provided for by their efforts in the Hague and wish you more success. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1286"> No doubt it was better not to reach an agreement which have a bad agreement, and in this case the American position was a stance of rebates, totally unacceptable for Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1287"> The changes have major consequences in the developing countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1288"> I want to repeat in carbon sinks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1289"> Not only will that the credibility of the European Union to adopt the common position and in the COP VI "B" in Bonn. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1290"> We are going to have to make our own evaluaciÃ what happen--is and prepare the documents to be in contact with the different parts and, naturally, with "the Group of jawlinkski vast". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1291"> Naturally, the follow-up of the forthcoming COP or the continuation of the importance the ratificaciÃ an agreement within the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1292"> Before the European Council, Pierre Moscovici and I myself will be the next Sunday, a ministerial nclave at which I invited to Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, as well as a later of the IGC, on Monday on the occasion of the general Affairs Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1293"> The minimum number of Member States that went to participate is going to limit to eight, and the representatives of usula of apelaciÃ to the European Council, which is currently a true right of veto, sustituirÃ by a right of knowledge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1294"> Cabrã relates to regret this, but I am obliged to do this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1295"> The European Council also debatirÃ the progress of the negotiations, and therefore of the enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1296"> The Lisbon European Council had approved guidelines to promote a European innovative and competitive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1297"> The consumer is a growing of Europeans, for obvious reasons which do not require greater. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1298"> We must prepare for this unprecedented enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1299"> Unfortunately, the actual text of the Conference is very complicated, very ambiguous and very long, with two protocols: however, despite this given to this complicaciÃ, is also very, we facilitates the simple answer that we serve the simple problem that we have for a long time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1300"> (Applause) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1301"> One consistÃ in the candidate Member States themselves debÃ adopt and implement the acquis communautaire; that is the task that shared with us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1302"> I deeply appreciate the Charter of fundamental rights and we do not want to confine ourselves to declamarla. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1303"> It is true that its text was able to be better, and will be improved and put forward after Nice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1304"> I find it unacceptable that the various governments have refused to consider the possibility of including a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1305"> You do not even want to introduce it in the Treaty and it in proof that this document, this year was had to leave to one side. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1306"> We shall be discussing with a single and unrewarding vote in the WTO. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1307"> In view of the dubious prospects of success, I do not think it is fair to the Intergovernmental Conference with another issue extremely complex and controversial. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1308"> I would make an urgent appeal to the French Presidency in order to do its utmost to eliminate this rejection, since it is extremely destructive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1309"> In the field of trade policy, the Commission has drawn up a proposal which must be examined carefully. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1310"> Even in the previous Treaty was made some progress on that and other rmula, aportÃ the absurd and other rmula of codecisiÃ decision as to the issues relating to the citizenship, social security, the rights of the workers on their own account and cultural policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1311"> The simple approach to this issue is, by alone, clearly demostrativo from the failure of a policy of strengthening the links of mutual confidence between the countries of the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1312"> This is the situation in which we have enfrascado for months in this Intergovernmental Conference, and cause in which nobody giving their toys. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1313"> The experience of this year we are forced to say that the momentum that we must give to the process of constitucionalizaciÃ the following Nice, and looking to the future of Europe must not be left to the method, already exhausted, of the reserved between the representatives of the governments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1314"> As very well just signs alar Mr Prodi, if it is not adopted a rule on the, the decision-making obstruct irremediably. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1315"> In our debate today has not said anything about this aspect of the principle of subsidiarity, but it is very important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1316"> So what did, pasÃ the enlargement of 1995, the Group of reflexiÃ that presidiÃ with great wisdom still wensterdorp, wine, and now we are going to have to follow in Nice and practice cticamente equal, Mr President: giving way to the institutional issues, to find solutions that will enable us to give way to a ambiciosÃ ­ schism task, which is that of enlargement to 27. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1317"> Not Adamos next to the decepciÃ that provocarÃ the Nice Summit, if it is Nice, clear, proves unsuccessful, the decepciÃ Commission brought to the peoples by our Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1318"> In the past demonstrated that this objective was achieved, and, as a representative of a Member State which has benefited from a planned to the, I hope with the positive attitude of the consecuciÃ of an enlarged Europe and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1319"> But we must understand that, if you have the right of veto, we only have the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1320"> But he will make a first transiciÃ for Parliament which will be elected in 2004, because at least some Member States adherirÃ do before the new Parliament chooses in 2004 or during its term of office until 2009. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1321"> The President of the Council has addressed the issue of closer cooperation and has said that we are moving towards a consensus in this regard. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1322"> Signs now President, at first sight, Nice is the necessary adjustments and the issues still to be resolved with a view to the enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1323"> If tuviÃ want something of this mentality, if hiciÃ were less hincapiÃ, in what is wrong in this part of the world and pusiÃ were more emphasis on what goes well, it could do something lucky that we are at the moment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1324"> The decisions by that was adopted in the Council should not only apply to the goods, but also to other areas are related mbitos as services, investment, intellectual property and competition, paragraph 1 of Article 133 has to be amended in this respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1325"> The right of initiative of the European Parliament abrirÃ relates to the way in which the arbitrariness of the parties ended invading likewise this mbito highly sensitive areas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1326"> Therefore, as decÃ relates to one of you, by referring to the American wishful thinking and to the way in which the Americans talk of themselves, which emphasise also what works and what progress. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1327"> Desearã relates to say also that I do not believe that there is a problem between large and small children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1328"> We have worked very hard, but we are facing this old problem, and I do not believe that it can be an evolution by the action of a single country, because we face, once more, twelve of the fifteen Member States, to a reality - national, political, democratic - very important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1329"> By last, President of the drine, you have shown a tense and has spoken and also certain pessimism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1330"> Do you shall, in general, measures to enhance the safety of forms of suitable for that not to happen again something similar? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1331"> In my opinion, we need to adopt the appropriate precautions - something that still have not done - for which the guests of this Parliament can be like, without having that they fear of the potential threats to this end, we must create the necessary conditions for technical, both from the point of view of the Commission and from the point of view of safety. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1332"> Here, hospitality;, hospitality and respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1333"> I would like to thank you for your contribution, however Tajani. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1334"> The best tribute to his memory and to his memory the respect its message -diÃ leg, in catalÃ point: what can we offer all that opportunity, the Basque people? </SEG>

<SEG id="1337"> When I speak of organizaciÃ Commission I should also like to say that, in view of the huge efforts undertaken by the European Union, it is the other than it is also the responsibility of the same. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1338"> In the second place, you comprobarÃ at the clear will of Parliament to base the policy of security and defence or on two pillars: the gestiÃ civilian crisis management and, in the case of failure, the gestiÃ military, since both pillars are complementary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1339"> - (FR) four President, bearing in mind the delay which take and also my duties, tratarÃ, to shorten the that had been drawn up. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1340"> These relations are plasmarÃ system, namely in the Council meetings between the North and the and and in meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European countries candidates or allies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1341"> Consider, for example, what has happened in the Balkans, where we can say that everyone has totally its. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1342"> In this period we have kept fully informed of developments in the United States in terms of course to do tulo of the European security and defence policy, which is a sine qua non for the same develop in, as is happening at the moment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1343"> In the European Parliament presentÃ the second annual report of the European Convention on human rights. organizarÃ 13 December, in a forum devoted to human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1344"> This policy, told you, not by ambiciÃ Commission competing with the Atlantic Alliance, which today continues to be the basis of the collective defence of its Members, or to create a European army is. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1345"> On the other hand, although I have mentioned the figure of 100 000 military, that does not mean that ambicionemos exceed the objective laid down in Helsinki, but that we have a reservation on qualifications and in different specialities, which makes it possible to ensure that the deficit could 60 000 men which correspond to the objective of the Council, beyond the conditions of its operational utilizaciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1346"> Permã ­ tame, but President, and the Members of Parliament, to touch on a few words the sense of political deep, approved by a large part of our opinions, this new task, by means of which Europe is becoming a tool of influence that I was lacking. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1347"> Now we are facing the problem of ensuring that, when we talk about democracy in Europe, we refer to all the European continent, because that is the enlargement and the process of enlargement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1348"> We have three tracks etc. should integrate into a coherent whole: policies of the Community, national, including the ESDP, and national measures of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1349"> Even with our laborious procedures of the Commission, we do not need a force of 60 000 soldiers to carry out our objectives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1350"> Therefore, it is necessary to establish with all urgency for a humanitarian aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1351"> Although it is true that I do not agree with the different political nicos which say that Europe is achieved with it a new set of unworkable, it is true that the Commissioner might not have resultarÃ all-round in many situations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1352"> The EU should not develop a system of defence own with regular troops. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1353"> Finally, I would like to express the concern of my Group for the worsening situation in Afghanistan and to urge the Commission and the Council so that we can do in order to reach a solution and to help the population, especially now the entry of the winter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1354"> To put it simply: in other nde, and how we should act in the European intervenciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1355"> Let you understand the balance of these two months of 270 ":", dead, the Palestinians, and about 10 000 injured, often baldados for life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1356"> Of ahÃ represents that its ongoing effort to create an arsenal of weapons of mass eliminaciÃ highly lÃºgubre. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1357"> In the second place, contrary to what has been said by the previous speaker, I should, if possible, or desirable that the European Union is to become more than it does on the conflict and the escalation of violence that has been produced in the Middle East, especially now, in the period that they are in the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1358"> Signs now President, I am going to focus this decision relates to address the report of Mrs re trade, which, in my opinion, well prepared and expresses with clarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1359"> There is a concept and actually still does not have a foreign policy and security. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1360"> The EU has only a problem, namely, which up to now have not known to awaken the interest of the public by such measures, in spite of the fact that are much more sustainable and effective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1361"> Signs now President, continuation comes, of course, to the budget; how this should be distributed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1362"> And I say this, in spite of the huge number of apparent guarantees that on this issue have arisen miraculously in the last days. </SEG>

<SEG id="1365"> It has been so historic first presence of a Minister of defence in our Assembly that I have reserved the night to which the Commission is too strong for our Members. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1366"> For all of them, a gestiÃ civilian crisis prevention is a better means that the military solutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1367"> Who wishes to Russia, in the long term, to participate in a policy with a not democratically? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1368"> Therefore, Europe is not going to be a new Alliance, as seems to have heard mention in a argumentaciÃ Commission informed way incomplete. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1369"> I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Article 42 (5) of the rules of procedure, to wind up this debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1370"> In the face of the scale of the task, encomendÃ at four Commissioners and estableciÃ a procedure and, with four reports in parallel. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1371"> The whole of the measures proposed in the White Paper must agree to modernise and make more effective the whole functioning of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1372"> Therefore, it would be appropriate if the reform was the occasion of confining his on the mbitos that does not entail costs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1373"> The differences of apreciaciÃ that arose were not only of nature, but that reflected still cultural differences between the fifteen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1374"> The new service of auditorÃ relates to internal, under the direct responsibility of you, however,, the Vice-President responsible for reform, as the main task of the functions and the internal control systems that exist within the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1375"> It has been a pleasure to work together, and I believe that the process of tackling a fundamental reform of the Commission, which is essential for the future of the European Union, has had an in-depth and a wealth next Adidas thanks to the four of us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1376"> May have expectations of transfer to other European institutions, hardheaded commissions services in the national administrations or to work in the private sector. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1377"> In this way, our Committee on constitutional adhesiÃ recalls its commitment to a strong executive, independent, efficient, transparent and responsible ticamente. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1378"> As Budgets we consider that the establishment of the budget we will cause problems for the lack of visibility of expenditure and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1379"> That marcarÃ is, of course, the good will of this Parliament to carry forward this reform with the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1380"> Signs now President, first of all, I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for the good work he has done. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1381"> It is shameful, if we take into account that the EU itself is the first supporter of the life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1382"> Signs now President, despite the efforts of the rapporteurs, to support the work of the Commission, is that the recommendations of the Committee of independent experts does not give a global and coherent response with a view to a policy of government and not only to a better administration of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1383"> This change of attitude worsen--could to result in the transparency of the Bush administration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1384"> From my point of view, in the world there is a framework which magazine a larger and fundamental: the fifteen Member States and in the future of twenty or more, an entire continent; the part of the globe currently most industrialised late in the Union and, through it, the Commission through its structures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1385"> The change is never easy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1386"> In so doing, however, from the Socialist Group, we believe that the current functioning of the European public is quite effective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1387"> The result is known, has stated that the dedicaciÃ and the competence of the numerous Members of the Commission and its administration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1388"> Many thousands of applications of projects carried out for more than a year of waiting for an evaluation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1389"> The debate, as we have seen, is not so much of principles, objectives or the opportunity of the reform, as procedures, pace, need, possible malfunctions or unintended consequences of its. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1390"> I gustarÃ relates to begin by explaining to the House that in its meeting of this morning, as has alado signs before Mr van Hulten, the College has adopted a draft interinstitutional agreement for the establishment of an advisory Group on standards in public life, I sicas, according to what we spend on 1 of the programme of action of the White Paper. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1391"> Furthermore, these changes, it is evident that only one possible with a modification of the Treaties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1392"> The main objective is to achieve a, to raise the transparency and strengthen the budgetary principles, that is to say, in particular but regulations, unless special regulations, incomprehensible and raise the efficiency and effectiveness in the budgetary procedure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1393"> It is very antieconÃ economic simply for the Commission that the contracts to high costs for were to take that to reimburse a 20%, to high costs and a 30% and it is often together and check the evidence of sums very. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1394"> In accordance with the directive, we shall proceed to the debate on the report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo between the European, on behalf of the Committee on development and cooperation, on the effectiveness of the relations of the European Union with the developing countries and the impact of the reform of the Commission in those relations (2000 / ((INI)). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1395"> These last affect aspects in particular to the NGOs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1396"> Clearly, this is not enough, but with all must go to respond the cartoons about the shortage of our development aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1397"> We come back to this now, since it provides a good framework in itself. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1398"> Signs now President, have become today is that of Mozambique, where the European Union has been responsible for a brilliant humanitarian aid after the disaster of the floods, but, once more, the draft joint resolution, to those who have already earmarked money, are behind the hopes of the firms in Brussels. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1399"> Before these realities, the need for a greater involvement and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is inevitable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1400"> We now have a harmonised scheme for drawing up reports of strategy and indicative programmes of cooperation in all developing countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1401"> Furthermore, the creation of the proporcionÃ not a solution to the ongoing disparity between 8 fat administrative resources. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1402"> (FR) Madam President, and the Members of Parliament, Madam Commissioner, the reason that I had a very special interest to be with you today in this debate about the first package of maritime in the European Parliament, is that you are going to examine three important texts, which constitute an essential first step on a subject that recent events have situated, unfortunately, on the first page of the present. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1403"> From the point of view of the Presidency of the Council, this could afford, on the other hand, to discuss with the Member States an agreement on funciÃ the proposals tabled by you, and to adopt the text at first reading, with a qualified majority, if necessary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1404"> The treatment of specialist and which has had resulting in the two Erika packages and six proposals has created an enormous boost. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1405"> The lesson that this Parliament must retain this morning is, undoubtedly, the legislation was legitimate that throughout the world in a State of indefiniciÃ and we have to start the process of putting in order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1406"> We must give a clear signs at that in the waters and ports in Europe are not going to tolerate vessels that do not meet the standards. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1407"> For the ships, we adopted a compromise between the of the 5 000 tonnes, raised by the IMO, and of the 600, raised by the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1408"> These data worsen--could be made provision of the European authorities, and port State, as well as the public interest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1409"> The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that the an area can affect a major, is bound to lead to the need for a Community framework for cooperation in the field of the accidental. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1410"> In the debate on the premises have been included in the organisations for the protection of nature. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1411"> To amend the directive in the sense of a greater rigour in their aplicaciÃ, a harmonisation of the legislation, particularly in relation to the Commission submitted to the vessels and the areas mbito of aplicaciÃ of the different types of inspecciÃ, is clearly positive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1412"> I would like to point out once again that there is no urgency, in which you persist. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1413"> I believe that in the case of Lebanon mite of the responsibility of the societies of clasificaciÃ, irrespective of what is decided today, it is important that the Council and Parliament are returning to reflect together on this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1414"> The black box, a black list and everything else we seem excellent ideas and we are fully agree with them, but, I gustarÃ relates to highlight some of the points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1415"> In the face of this situation catastrÃ debate and analysis of the rquica of maritime transport, Europe has accepted the challenge and, eleven months after the Erika, the European Union in provision to announce that jamÃ beyond any procedure has worked so quickly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1416"> It is clear to what extent the opinion of the Liberal gica objects, in fact, to a high degree of safety, legitimate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1417"> To conclude, irrespective of the measures that are taken, one of the major sources of uncertainty that will not be reequilibre, in the area of the English channel and the North, the exponential growth of traffic resulting from the strangulation of the North sea ports. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1418"> I honrarÃ relates to the current President of the Council that ordenara the situation in their own country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1419"> Signs now President, since the sinking of the oil tanker Erika have presented under pressures a range of measures with the aim of enhancing the safety of ships in the sea. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1420"> Some of the Greek collapsed without, however, ladies, without which had storms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1421"> In the third place, when we talk of this kind of information, it seems to me that it is becoming clear that links the relationship between, on the one hand, the supply of oil and, on the other, the fact that we are still using fuel origin and other American. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1422"> Therefore, we have at the end of the valentÃ policy of our ambitions ecolÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1423"> This means that, in this field than in any other, our responsibility is large, and that we must, in my view, silence any sign of institutional self-respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1424"> For example, Finland is of paramount importance that Russia can sign these agreements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1425"> It is the strengthening of the requirements for the construction of ships tankers, improving the rules for port controls and greater severity of the rules for the organisations of and peritaje of vessels, which is a consequence of this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1426"> Signs now President, today we are debating the safety of legitimate, ndonos in three reports whose rapporteurs sincerely congratulate her. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1427"> With regard to these three new proposals relating to safety, legitimate, I can do no more than to congratulate the three rapporteurs who have shown in extremely short deadlines which the Parliament is very decided to adopt new measures to enhance safety at sea, the controls, the standards of construction, and it is intolerable that similar accidents are returning to produce. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1428"> Madam President, in the recent past several accidents sailors of considerable consequences, in particular those on the oil tankers which were involved, have shaken our continent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1429"> Yet 80% of accidents they are linked with human error, but there are reasons for the human error, which are social order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1430"> A parliamentary or parliamentarians have used the term 'traceability'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1431"> The directive on port State control is to monitor compliance with international requirements and not to introduce new standards. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1432"> The amendment that introduces the port State control set in relation to the rest of the seamen, although the provisions relating to working hours of the seamen already is fully covered by the directive 99 / 95. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1433"> I am pleased to see that the rapporteur has introduced in the amendment, a reference to the evaluaciÃ the conditions and we agree with the prospect of proposal, however, it is necessary that the redacciÃ adjustment in order to make clear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1434"> Amendment no 4 and part of the 18 on the point "" "are not acceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1435"> I can assure you that if a shipowner intends to include a vessel in those registers, in the wake of our proposal, and I worsen--could rselo twice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1436"> The Commissioner has spoken for 18 Minutes, and during that time, has mentioned dozens and dozens of items, and has rejected the position of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1437"> Proposed decision of the European Parliament and of the Council in a set of actions relating to the trans-European network of recopilaciÃ, creation and difusiÃ the estadÃ represents sticas on the challenges of goods intra-European and extra-comunitarios (EDICOM) (COM (2000) 0458 - C5-0401 / 2000 - 2000 / 0201 (COD)) (Committee on economic and monetary Union) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1438"> However, the phase of the resolution, I express the convicciÃ that, with a view to the Nice Council, our Parliament would have done better to hear his voice engaging in a specific and differently to the subjects as important and difficult to the Intergovernmental Conference, in place of treating them in the of a single resolution which includes also, after all the items on the agenda of the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1439"> (given that have arisen more than twelve Members, the oral amendment was rejected) (Parliament adopted the resolution) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1440"> Report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo between the European, on behalf of the Committee on development and cooperation, on the effectiveness of the relations between the European Union and the developing countries, and the impact of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000 / ((INI)) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1441"> I have voted against, to express my protest by the fact that the European Union does not achieve is to intervene as worsen--could in this matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1442"> Despite the fact that neither the proposal amending the existing directive on the control of ships or the report and respond to the real needs, as certain passages in the positive sense, and for that reason the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have voted in favour of the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1443"> Thus, we regret that the proposal of the Commission has not taken up the idea of the creation of a true European monitoring body, following the model of the. "in the United States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1444"> (El) condiciÃ Commission needed for the safety of ships, for the protection of life at sea and the protection of the environment is the fight against the immunity which we enjoy the shipowners, the adoption of measures to fight for the monitoring of the situation of the vessels and the of stringent penalties to the shipping companies which violate the safety standards; also, to improve the working conditions of the workers of the merchant navy, and provide the appropriate, so as to ensure that nicas orgÃ constructions which respond to the growing needs of the vessels. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1445"> The rapporteur Hatzidakis, unfortunately, has done exactly the opposite. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1446"> The wreck of the Erika, in December 1999, is at the origin of the emergence of the safety legitimate political agenda in the Community, and it was under pressure from the European Parliament and the Commission proposed the texts that we have voted on the today, almost a year after this sinister shipwreck. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1447"> The current Commission compensaciÃ funds have not been adequately equipped and it has to be made clear in the case of the Braer disaster in the Shetland islands fishing industry has not been adequately compensated for their loss of rdidas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1448"> Madam President, I have already said that a few years ago I had the occasion of sail. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1449"> The rapporteur's proposals relating to the harmonisation at European level is entirely positive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1450"> This is an important point because it refers to the societies of clasificaciÃ of vessels. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1451"> It would be rather a great success, for the Europe that we need, in speras victims, is not a Europe of much gida, jerarquizada, further, but a flexible Europe, and closer to the people, by both based on respect for the national democracies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1452"> The struggle more open for power between many Member States muddies the possibilities to achieve algÃºn commitment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1453"> The task of Nice is to ensure that the EU should have efficient institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1454"> In a week of the Summit, I personally have expectations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1455"> I am not in favour of automÃ relating, ticamente the Commission by qualified majority and codecision and also think that any initiative to extend the powers must be taken on a case by case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1456"> The amending Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe ampliarÃ relates to the vote by qualified majority, currently in force in the Council for the trade in products, in other areas mbitos as public services, intellectual property, the health or education. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1457"> In this way Parliament do not do the right to influence, guardian of silence as a tribute to the partidismos, to the fidelidades and to the national governments and sometimes their obligations towards the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1458"> I have also voted against a text which calls for the integration of the Charter of fundamental rights in the future Treaty, which was adopted at Nice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1459"> It is a mistake to split in two groups, and that is why I cannot support the idea of a third of the Member States to go to the top. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1460"> Its new role has put an end to the neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1461"> In this report there are many things that the Group of the consevadores britÃ system nicos can support, in particular the emphasis that the enlargement of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1462"> The socialdemÃ Democrats Democrats in the European Parliament have supported the report relating to the creation of a common European policy in the field of security and defence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1463"> But we are also against the peoples of the European Union who finance, in any case, the new armament spending which is proposed in the report and that will guarantee that the military forces are not used a against them ourselves, in the name of the 'policing'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1464"> Equally serious is the pretensiÃ that a State which does not wish to participate in a mission will be obliged to pay a financial contribution that repartirÃ the participating States in that war. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1465"> However, with military means of were not getting no, because not removed the cause of conflict or change. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1466"> It is that the military operations should be funded with a Community budget and that the Member States will have to contribute with funds, even if we do not wish to participate in the operations (express what grafos 49 and 50). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1467"> Instead, the EU, vendrÃ well that would invest the priorities of the Petersberg tasks and to come back to the two options for humanitarian and reconciliation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1468"> I support this report by my colleague Maj-Britt Theorin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1469"> But there is no mention of the needs of this than to give way to the demand for a deducibilidad measures of the services and of a "adaptaciÃ of prices and of the costs to the financial resources of the individuals'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1470"> In reality, it is extraordinary that in the 21st century we have to recommend that the Member States worsen--could could guarantee employees the right to social security and a jubilaciÃ adequate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1471"> For many, and other venes, its first contact with the labour market can be a black economy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1472"> What is more serious when it is women from countries which have been taken further, this type of work by need and who have no other possibility of earning a living in the long term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1473"> The reform of the Commission will be judged by the facts, ahÃ represents the need for regular monitoring that presentarÃ system throughout the period of duraciÃ programme and the importance of the comprehensive expected to December 2002. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1474"> In the recent past, different skeptical system ndalos and malfunctions concluded, in March 1999, with the resignation of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1475"> To conclude, I think it is essential to remember that throughout this reform, which is essential for the future, we hope, at the same time more rigour and transparency on the part of the Commission in its gestiÃ daily, but also a greater sense of responsibility for its part, in the framework of its competences. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1476"> The Conservatives would endorse the statement contained in the system of grafo 7 of the report which should be to ensure the control and which allows operating the system of the three pillars. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1477"> (the session was suspended at 1.15 p.m.) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1478"> We have received the information - and I want adir next, which can creerla, at all - that the President of the Council and head of the French State is going to appear here tomorrow only 30 Minutes to speak. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1479"> Consequently, it seems to me that we should exclude that may have a well-considered position and argued. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1480"> Whatever we do, we will vote, and I am in favour of a resolution as suggested by Mr Poettering, Mr. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1481"> Throughout the night has worked in both these texts as in the figures relating to the distribution of votes in the Council and the distribution of the escaÃ years in Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1482"> Madam President, I would like to urge that the directive will not be withdrawn - to this report from Mr de Roo, since, in addition to being very well prepared, in the environment Council of the French Presidency, which will place on Monday and Tuesday of the next week, it is intended to prepare a common position on this matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1483"> Thank you, but Parish. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1484"> In the meetings of the Committee on foreign Affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy, in its condiciÃ Commission President, sitting there and actually smoked. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1485"> The fundamental political is clear: to harmonise the market with a high level of public health and protection of consumers of healing in both the existing rules and on the evolution of the scientific knowledge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1486"> What is at stake and concept of their quality of life, in which the protection of the health and acquiring a very relevant. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1487"> This rule can also be applied to all of the drugs of diversiÃ but dangerous, if anyone that the consumer can be affected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1488"> Recently in the United States have gained judgments against the tobacco multinationals by poisoning and lying on the absence of toxicity of the products. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1489"> We believe that the only possible and consistent is that end with the exportaciÃ of cigarettes banned in the Union for health reasons. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1490"> Instead of drawing lessons from the failure of recorded in Luxembourg on 9 October, we insist on a position presumed dicamente indefensible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1491"> I have looked carefully at what the Commissioner said to my colleague Mr Hume: "may not be rdidas massive loss of jobs in this sector. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1492"> Are the Parliament and the Council have to approve this proposal for a directive and to examine, among other things, the legal base, for it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1493"> Mr Maaten and others will s-, there is a danger that, if this Parliament and the Council to accept the restrictive interpretation which aim to the leader of the European people's Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and the Community institutions as a whole would mean tying our hands to the legislative development of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1494"> The point of bil of this proposal is that it puts a lot of emphasis on the promotion of free competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1495"> In conclusion, since the signing of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has powers of coordinaciÃ on environmental issues and protection to the consumer, and colaborarÃ system closely, clear, with the Council and the Commission on this matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1496"> In fact it has nothing to do with the tobacco, but that the judgment of the European Court of justice to have been dictated equally to prohibit the advertising of alcohol or the advertising of chocolate, then, of course, sugar regime can be harmful to health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1497"> I simply do not understand that a majority of this Parliament will propose relax the rules relating to the exportaciÃ decision of what we propose to the governments of the Member countries, the governments which represents to the many industries referred to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1498"> It is a proven fact that 80% of smokers want to be, but in the sector and tobacco-related production further very few policies to help people to stop smoking. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1499"> If we say to the system of countries levels of public health must set extending to the exports of our reasonable proposals for the internal market, we will be in danger of all the good work carried out by Mr Maaten. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1500"> We are in favour of a method of testing recognised in all the countries of the EU, to carry out in a determined in a laboratory tests recognised. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1501"> Today, Turkey is openly acknowledge the health effects of tobacco consumption, and therefore the legislators as the public share the opinion that the time has come to adopt strict rules and regulations in this matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1502"> In consequence, the Community rules encajarÃ they would in future international agreements, avoiding the risk of the obstacles to trade and at the same time to strengthen the protection of consumers and guaranteeing a high level of protection of health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1503"> It would be better to wait until he has addressed the issue of the additives in its entirety in the first report of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1504"> With regard to the laboratory tests, the amendment relating to the evidence is superfluous, since another item prevÃ, since the goods that they comply with the provisions of the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1505"> ) Madam President, this report is not complications: at present, the directives on the timetable of the summer but they are five years in force, and then have to return to Parliament for its renovaciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1506"> Madam President, ladies orÃ companies, the proposal for a directive relating to the provisions on the summer time, that we are examining, there is a good proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1507"> Consequently, I believe that we in this House should not decided to take too long on this subject, as the Member States, as well as the, have already accepted in great measure the summer time, and this has been recognised as part of our annual rate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1508"> In my judgment, it is appropriate that the issues connected with the slots and with the regulations of the summer time should be established, according to the proposal, on the decision of the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1509"> It would be more appropriate for the time and terminase at the end of September, some six months of its beginning. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1510"> And can accept the presentation of appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report from 2007 to which refers to Article 5. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1511"> It is clear that we cannot accept the interventions in the human germ line. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1512"> Indeed, I believe that one of the policy, in which working people who does that work as profesiÃ main, I cannot grant a term rather long, but about the authorities should be to exert some pressure of time to implement quickly at work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1513"> These groups should be maintained in the field of aplicaciÃ from the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1514"> But I am glad that we have managed to take a cerrojazo according to the agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1515"> I would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on his report and thank him for his effort to reconcile the opposing positions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1516"> These programmes are linked with the fight against, with the prevention of AIDS, the prevention of drug dependence and the promotion of health; and its interrupciÃ Commission significarÃ following the end of the projects and the work of the networks that was created to this end. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1517"> It is something very good able to pave the way to a priori, so that, in the case of that it is necessary to carry out a second reading, be very close to the point at which the decisions are taken. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1518"> Furthermore, we must take into account that both the Commission and as the regulations are going to be increasingly important and, therefore, to provide them with more Budgets and to give more importance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1519"> Madam President, on the occasion of the Trakatellis report on the rroga of the existing European programmes in the health, I would like to express my concern about how and in what sense of stability of European policy in the field of health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1520"> I understand that the Council has given its consent in principle. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1521"> In the European Union is currently the paradox that the abolition of the internal borders for the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must coexist with the maintenance of 15 borders in the area of police and judicial mbitos criminal, that the Member States put difficulties in phase. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1522"> To conclude, the initiative is an important step forward in the creation of a European criminal justice system, albeit partial and limited, but responds to the real needs of a vast mass of European citizens that, until now, have been practice cticamente helpless when they have been victims of a crime outside the territory of their normal residence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1523"> What we have called for this Group of people? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1524"> At the same time, we must guarantee a formaciÃ special professionals to which its duties in direct contact with the victims. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1525"> The victims should not turn into people doubly penalised, first because of a crime and continuation by the fault of the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1526"> Also, in this context, it is important that the report of a quiet and essential to the relatives, that is, to the relatives of the victims, of the facts if so what we want, and that they can count on the support needed so that we do not need to hear all the press. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1527"> It is worth independently of the crime which was committed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1528"> Jamã, in the Member States or in the Community, we must abandon the principle that I sico that individuals should always bear the responsibility for their actions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1529"> In other cases it to get the information which is needed in a language that is not our own. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1530"> I very much welcome the positive response from Parliament before the first text on an issue as important, so that the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building single-hull can offer to our fellow citizens support in situations that it is sometimes difficult to bear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1531"> On the request for urgent procedure </SEG> 
<SEG id="1532"> (Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1533"> In this way, on the night of 23 to 24 November we have agreed with the Council on the main points of a budget which is not as well and it is reasonable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1534"> Therefore, the Commission proposed a by EUR 300 million to what was opposed with uÃ campaigns and teeth the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1535"> But, for the discussions that it is much more difficult to formulate a common position of the Council, to obtain a mandate for negotiation and to achieve the egoÃ relates purely national smos culminate in a pan-European more or less reasonable and acceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1536"> I hope that the work for a recruitment office, as it says in the modern German, that is to say an authority of recruitment, actually ahead so that we can overcome together the problems that are going to raise in the next years to all the institutions - the Council, like the Commission, Parliament and the demÃ than institutions -, that is to say, the need for staff of the next few years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1537"> The Council refuses to make this revision - which now already worsen--could could have - and I want to prevent: to use the flexibility instrument two years in a row, two years running - in fact, in less than fifteen months and the first of them at least six months of the unanimous approval of the perspectivas- it financially undermine the flexibility instrument because it prevents its reposiciÃ and its possible acumulaciÃ, which is due to a high-level 600 million. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1538"> This amount so important, which responds to the existence of needs very high in 2001, will be financed mainly thanks to the instrument of flexibility to the value of EUR 200 million. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1539"> In the light of this new element, the Council has voted at second reading a budget increased in a 2.5%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1540"> By you, before we proceed to the final adoption of this budget, I wish to underline the empeÃ year in respect of the Council any budgetary rules, in the field of implementation of the ditos in reserve, the legal basis and clasificaciÃ the costs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1541"> And on the contrary that in Nice, I believe that the three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission whereby they are very satisfied with the overall result. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1542"> Ladies orÃ companies, the new apariciÃ of sick cows of BSE was also need to act immediately in the financial sector, in particular for the sake of public health, the protection of the consumer and for aid to the farmers affected by this situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1543"> Furthermore, the Council has set for the framework programme of aid to the country in the Western Balkans, a multiannual indicative, of course, that it is compatible with the financial perspective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1544"> With muchÃ represents simo effort, received a couple of millions of euros. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1545"> I should like to thank Mrs Haug. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1546"> Pensarã system so that this 1% of the budget of the European Union is very well spent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1547"> You said, if I have understood correctly, that we must use the reserve, because it was a contravenciÃ protection standards. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1548"> I believe that we have seen things very positive by many others that I am not going to mention now due to the pressure of time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1549"> Despite the fact that the expenditure on agriculture, which represent almost half of the total budget, are increasing, and taken into account the letter of amendment, at a 5%, the overall increase in the budget is only 3.5%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1550"> We see the great danger of that in the next years to increase the confrontation between the projects of countries ribereÃ years of 'and the Balkans, in spite of the fact that we all know that there is urgently need the money. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1551"> Satisfied to have overcome the difficulties that did so close look towards the objective pursued to meeting the commitments made in Helsinki with the candidate countries without undermining the Union, to enable the Europe of tomorrow that continÃºe working effectively. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1552"> These are real, although it does not go as far as the Presidency - which has given evidence, and I stress, who represents tulo national, a great transparency, what we would have wished. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1553"> Has provided a basis for the new status of the political parties and the European Parliament are accorded the status of complainant institutional provided in Article 230 of the Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1554"> These past few weeks have achieved three important achievements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1555"> This is the meaning of the adopted in Nice and the reflexiÃ Commission initiated to coordinate at European level in the fight against doping. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1556"> Among the threats, is, as you all know, the overheating climÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1557"> Furthermore, in Nice, the European Union has established the same necessary to define and to conduct a common foreign policy and security: a political and security Committee, a war and a major European State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1558"> For this, for their support and for their welcome, Madam President, and the Members of the European Parliament, the French Presidency, gives the thanks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1559"> In these areas mbitos, in fact, the Conference has failed due to the intransigence of certain Member States in the way of this, I feel a deep decepciÃ not only by the consequences in the short term, but by the minimum cerrazÃ, closure, incomprensiÃ that the emergence of this stance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1560"> We must pay tribute to a sense of the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Guy Verhofstadt has fought so the background for the sake of a fairer presence of the applicant States to the adhesiÃ and to become less unreasonable, despite the fact that continues being too high, the threshold of the qualified majority; in this way, has confirmed the great historic role of Belgium in the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1561"> We now need to examine carefully the text in the Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1562"> Ladies alo, incidentally, now President of the European Council, that the costs of the taxpayers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1563"> And I see in it a failure not only in relation to the proclaimed the European Union to change the institutions to be able to welcome properly to the new Member States to improve the effectiveness of the European Union, but it is also a failure in relation to other important objective, which perhaps has mentioned very little, the approach of the European Union and the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1564"> The good questions are for us and which has made the impressive human tide that, since the whole of Europe, have converged in Nice the eve of the Summit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1565"> In the first place, the fifteen have signed hastily and with lacrimÃ gases and other genos the Charter of fundamental rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1566"> (Applause) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1567"> My Group is disappointed by this Treaty and concerned for the future that we depararÃ system, so that we will oppose it with all our strength. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1568"> Signs now President, you have the floor. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1569"> Finally, I dirÃ relates to Mr Hager that the instrument of closer cooperation is, in my opinion, a tool to enable Europe to take a and that alumbre the way, as decÃ relates to a while ago, I believe, Mr. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1570"> Signs now President, I gustarÃ relates to know if the competences of the European Parliament over the summer time is a new conquest of Nice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1571"> That desmoralizados until now by the complexity of the trials, laboratories will perhaps find, in the will expressed by both the Member States and by our Assembly, the value of developing the medicinal products market pediÃ system tricos, although it does not have the size or enough to allow the recovery of investment! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1572"> It is necessary to amend the. instead of summer time, that quedÃ other fixed during the oil crisis, with the aim of saving energy, and that he has been extended until 2001? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1573"> We do not always the situation of victims in criminal proceedings is due. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1574"> As a result, many passengers and tourists will be of this European initiative. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1575"> Ladies intervendrÃ yet President, alone, to salute Mr President of the Commission, which is here, and to the Presidency of the Council that is looming, and to underline that, probably, has never been expressed in this Parliament a unanimity as this on the results of a Summit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1576"> The work is that, in six months, under the leadership of the French Presidency, has ended, I believe, in spite of everything, his work over six capÃ represents tulos essential. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1577"> However, my greatest fear is that Britain, France and Germany may now subvert the delicate balance created between States of different size and between the institutions over several decades. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1578"> It is difficult to understand how the decisions of Nice could facilitate the enlargement of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1579"> Signs now President, ladies and gentlemen, today I can be very brief. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1580"> For all that, I can draw the consequence of that when we vote on the Treaty of Nice, I am going to vote against. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1581"> Signs now President, the most important result of Nice was, in spite of everything, that is firmÃ a Treaty, so that it is now possible to give space to the candidate countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1582"> The real winners of this Conference, Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, the signs of "no" of Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1583"> So, Let us not forget Nice, fijÃ, monkeys in what comes after, and permÃ do you tanme sparking off my hope that with the project of great agreement forward by Belgium for its Presidency, because it is established, we must make borrÃ and we need new, there needs to be a change of method, we must speed up the story: because it is too late, too far, it is too dangerous. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1584"> Instead, the Nice has been to wonder how it can block, how can intergubernamentalizar, how you can say to one at home as a defender of the national interests in place of work for the European Union to really work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1585"> After Amsterdam and Nice we find a Europe 's princes, a Europe of national administrations and not the Europe of the policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1586"> We cannot continue to enfrentÃ system ndonos to the lack of decision-making by qualified majority in the essential issues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1587"> It is true - parafrasearÃ, Mr Bayrou look - that this escaÃ year since this morning; in principle, acompaÃ playing to the President of the Republic, and later, in terms of personnel, and do tulo pursued, which, in my view, are moderate, friendly, but which, however, have yet to be created. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1588"> Indeed, we must not forget that it is the first time, since 1957, that reform, which is the model. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1589"> We are within the constitutional systems, and the powers may not be confused. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1590"> Thank you very much, Minister yet. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1591"> But nor has been incorporated into the Treaties and there has been a reference to the Charter in paragraph 2 of Article 6 of the Treaty of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1592"> For, there are some positive aspects: the new versiÃ from Article 7 of the Treaty; the Article relating to the parties and its Statute; the right of this Parliament to demand to the other institutions before the Court of justice: it is also an important factor of control; the new and other rmula for the European Commission, to include the so-called 'lex Prodi "in the Treaty, to strengthen the President and the new composiciÃ from the Commission: transacciÃ Commission reasonable that and would agree with the time; and, as has alado signs of my colleague Mr Tsatsos, constitute the real economy by which to proceed in the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1593"> Signs now President, have already made an rigorous of what happened in Nice, but we should remember that the Nice Summit comenzÃ with an order of the very limited. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1594"> Let us look at things: has not been included in the work of the Treaty the letter, or even a. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1595"> We want to demonstrate to the Heads of government that what we do better. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1596"> In spite of the blows of heart which the government has given this morning, the IGC, frankly, has not been concluded. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1597"> Signs now President, it is not easy to criticise the French Presidency during this debate, as it is not present. understand that the President Chirac, Mr. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1598"> Signs now President, the Nice Summit has shown that the Intergovernmental Conference has remained obsolete. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1599"> 2001 budget (continuation) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1600"> However, this does not mean that it was not to have done something more and more, I would like to divide the two mbitos. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1601"> This meeting will force the Commission to establish priorities within a limited budget, we should make all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1602"> With the Commission that this debate will end the long and complex process of approval of the budget of the Union of Europe for 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1603"> That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis through recourse to Article 272; we have maintained the financial perspectives, despite having used the flexibility instrument. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1604"> Permã represents taseme simply say to the Council that, with regard to this Party, we have been left without footballs and this team proposes to continue playing until we get the result of it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1605"> We do not want the Commission to debate a proposal for revision to the next year, because we want to wait for the valoraciÃ from the world Bank, but I share his criticism of this way of resolving the financial insufficiency in which distorts the carÃ multiannual cter; the great objectives of the Union and the definiciÃ financial perspectives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1606"> For this to be possible, which establish priorities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1607"> But so be dedicarÃ correct and adequately the money which our fellow citizens are put at our disposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1608"> If we estimate the supplementary budget, which we hope will then almost 8% as that in all the fields - is in addition to the policy of formaciÃ, the internal policy, including, foreign policy, the aid to the preadhesiÃ resolution no experience in total a rate of growth of 1.1%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1609"> And as the Commission is so positive, in the supplementary budget, for in January, we will have the opportunity to proseguirla. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1610"> We criticise the interests not regulated relations between Russia and the States that have lticos. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1611"> We are following with great interest the evolution of society and of the Russian domestic policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1612"> Signs now President, ladies and gentlemen, the strategy for Russia represents the first strategy in the history of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1613"> Even though the President Putin we guarantee the development of his country, he is not automÃ system ticamente a guarantor of a stable and democratic Russia. the order is still not a reality lived in Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1614"> We must not be insidious on our part, but that we must build the Europe of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1615"> With regard to the left, Mr van Orden has quite. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1616"> Who really to Russia from outside and views outlying country and Russian partners runs the risk of State selectively it as the reality of the country that is precisely in its image of Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1617"> In the field of, the strategy for Russia proposes to engage in a dialogue on on political and security and to create a permanent mechanism for it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1618"> I would like to underline the seriousness of Russia as a political Union with belarÃºs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1619"> Do you have the support of this project, but Commissioner Patten? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1620"> In that regard, in the last Summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi, as Parliament will know, lanzÃ a dialogue on energy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1621"> I am very hopeful personally to visit Kaliningrad in the first part of next year, and not only because Immanuel Kant were all his life in that city. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1622"> I congratulate his signs orÃ once more for his excellent report on a very important issue, to which we require in the years to come back again and again, I am sure, in this Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1623"> You sitÃºa in a very difficult situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1624"> Signs now President, I want to say that this debate is very necessary because of the BSE crisis has huge repercussions on feedingstuffs, about the cultivation and importaciÃ of feedingstuffs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1625"> The Council has expressed its concern in many meetings with Russia, at all levels, in particular to make it think again make excessive use of force and to avoid a possible extension of the conflict, for which appropriate to independent inquiries and effective on the violations of human rights, to support at the OSCE assistance Group in the fulfilment of its past, and, for that will ensure the transport of humanitarian aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1626"> Signs now President, a directive, it is customary in this House that the questions that cannot respond orally so ample respond later in writing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1627"> (interruption from Mr Posselt) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1628"> This directive is of 1992. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1629"> In this sense will work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1630"> These groups are evidently left on the sidelines of this new proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1631"> (FR) the Presidency and several Member States have already received letters from the European Committee of the azÃºcar concerning the proposal from the Commission, which will take into account in its deliberations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1632"> Question 10, the (H-0886 / 00): </SEG> 
<SEG id="1633"> First of all, I must say that, in my opinion, the President-in-Office of the Council has still not replied to the question of the signs now Korakas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1634"> However, we have to establish that authority and I believe that the European authorities are also very concienciadas and that will continue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1635"> More specifically, who has joined the representative of the Presidency, in this case the French Ambassador in Algeria, with Mr. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1636"> We welcome the proposals in this respect by the preparatory Committee and elected by the general Assembly on the way to acreditaciÃ the non-governmental organisations, the preparatory process and to the special of September 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1637"> The resolution includes a number of references to the European Convention on human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1638"> As already highlighted the Council to its signs orÃ in his answer to the previous question, the process of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters will best protect the rights of the people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1639"> I would like to push him a little. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1640"> In particular, guaranteeing the control and the leadership of a military operation of gestiÃ of crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1641"> I should simply like to remind you that the system of the Treaty establishes a difference in treatment between the rates and the indirect taxation, whose harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market -artÃ Article 94 - and the Commission, as provided in Article 94, in that they relate directly on the establishment or the functioning of the market, between those who are those relating to direct taxation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1642"> We are seeing a few words in these three sectors. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1643"> If we keep the model of behaviour that in case of doubt all fight against all, it could do to jump for the protection of the stability Pact for south-eastern Europe that is based on regional cooperation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1644"> At the end of the day, we need the cooperation with Yugoslavia, a cooperation by both parties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1645"> Signs now President, our Group supports the work carried out by the signs of commitment in relation to the report on the viability of the agreements and association with the Republic of Croatia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1646"> Signs now President, over the years in which the President of the parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I had the opportunity to acompaÃ damage to many Croats in its efforts towards freedom and prosperity that they, like other peoples of our continent, identified with their integration in the European institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1647"> On the basis of the results obtained by Croatia this year, I have to say that I trust that we will be able to achieve a rate of pragmatic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1648"> That is, of course, our criteria and the speed with which we have brought our policy with Croatia in the months to come. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1649"> We have for with Croatia to give its government and its people of all kind of aid in the next years and we are deeply grateful for their signs orÃ companies his wise advice with a view to ensuring that follow that path. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1650"> It is incomprehensible in this respect that the Laskar Jihad I had the opportunity to go to the Moluccas this spring with thousands of supporters to exacerbate the conflict. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1651"> In Timor, the militias are blocking the return of the refugees and the people who provide the help find asediadas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1652"> On behalf of the Committee on industry, I will confine myself to three questions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1653"> Signs now President, but Commissioner, orÃ powers, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen for the excellent work that has been carried out. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1654"> It is not the only country in which this happens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1655"> The continuing violence in the Moluccas, in Aceh in Irian Jaya causes great pain to the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1656"> Tomorrow, we celebrate the ceremony of the award of the Sakharov sajÃ system rov. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1657"> According to the most recent news arrived from archipiÃ the Indonesian Lake urgent, itself, the question of whether the situation does not seem to be still more serious,, more precarious, for the President Wahid and helps to the enemies of which the rapporteur analyses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1658"> If we want to help Indonesia, we must now act with money and facts and not just words. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1659"> I believe that the report is extremely valuable in order to shed light on what has been happening. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1660"> It is clear that the difficulties of Indonesia would not do night in the morning. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1661"> Protection of the financial interests of the communities </SEG> 
<SEG id="1662"> We must at last to abolish the independent for its activity, in particular in the recruitment of staff and in its estructuraciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1663"> Therefore, the Commission must abide by order through a process of internal reforms its announcement that it will not tolerate the costs and that every one of them will be pursued consistently. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1664"> I believe that this must be precisely the result also of Nice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1665"> We gustarÃ relates to the Member States to open up negotiations with a view to having a matter of line legislation in the field of criminal law, however, we do not want to submit our countries to a fiscalÃ relates to Community requires. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1666"> I would also like to know why retrasÃ debate until yesterday, from danÃ on the euro, the document from the Commission on this issue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1667"> I have tabled an amendment to mention the names of those countries, because it is time that so much to be done to shame them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1668"> I am sure that OLAF has in shaping so that the legislation governing pictures of the top. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1669"> However, we in the European Parliament must be careful not to see the beam in our eye for being so focused on seeing the Mote in the other: that of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1670"> We are trying to put out a fire and asfixiÃ system ndonos with the smoke. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1671"> And nobody can understand, I either. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1672"> With a view to reaching overall that subject, I would like to highlight four questions which I consider to be fundamental in the work of the Committee on budgetary control. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1673"> The Treaty is a problem for Parliament itself. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1674"> Madam Commissioner, it is worrying that there is much citamente explÃ which to draw the attention of the Commission on the respect for the rights of Members being as it is the guardian of the Treaties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1675"> It refers to a number of guidelines for which the Committee on budgetary control can continue when it meets problems in different areas, including those to recommend to the Committee on Budgets that freeze or reduce the amount of appropriations earmarked for the items in question in the budget for the coming financial year; not to authorise transfers of appropriations which, into the increase of the items affected for certain period until we have completed the internal investigations; even further to ask the President of the Commission that the publication of any Commissioner affected by the serious problems involved: something as a cesÃ area of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1676"> The report requires that make detailed inventories of operational activities, an in-depth checks of the budget and the irregularities as an internal results on the part of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1677"> Madam Commissioner, the starting point of the transmission of information to the European Parliament is the Treaty and the interinstitutional agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1678"> But the result of this would be, if not regulation, which in the end is not only not had an equal arms in regard to America, but even within Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1679"> Why not and should not be achieved in the present case, as has been achieved for all the demÃ than directives, to arrive at the end of a compromise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1680"> It is a proposal which has had a long, and I fear that stormy, way to overcome some of the difficulties that exist. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1681"> The first amendment relates to Article 4, which was established which has to be the competent authority for the proposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1682"> We now have a proposal which provocarÃ relates to the challenges of the Court, bÃºsqueda favourable, possible disputes at a delicate moment of an agreement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1683"> In the United Kingdom the reglamentaciÃ proposals pÃºblicas of adquisiciÃ through the voluntary code of practice cticas administered by the Group, that of the proposals pÃºblicas of adquisiciÃ has produced very good results: a good example here of an approach pragmÃ democratic of a highly complex in which legislation would be less appropriate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1684"> But, more than that, it is better that we can put forward the Lisbon agenda of a competitive European economy and dinÃ system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1685"> In the European Parliament, what we must do is to regulate a form of nima much more in the field of the European powers which cause tensions in the right of acquisitions, for example, have opposed to shareholders, large shareholders in the face of small children or firms facing capital market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1686"> Some of the amendments proposed by Parliament is to improve the text of the common position of the Council, your points. due to it to focus on issues that could give rise to difficulties in the interpretation and that one ’ s accession to the transformaciÃ from the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1687"> After all, it is not proven of ningÃºn so that the proposal a fair price is better than any other, since the different definitions that are used in this moment in the Member States are all very well. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1688"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1689"> Furthermore, it recognises the artist a right of the public to be informed of their rights in a period of up to three years before the traders professionals of cultural objects, what is reasonable, since these have to bear the finance of purchases and sales. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1690"> Accordingly, we must address the legislator austrÃ represents aco and not to attack the European legislator creates the framework conditions that nothing positive to artists and auction houses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1691"> Furthermore, on the subject which we are dealing with, the need for a common position is all the greater given that a common position will enable the European Union to exert influence at international level, so that we can defend the interest of the decision-makers at world level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1692"> I trust in the sabidurÃ and vision of this House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1693"> In Germany, for example, of the 7 artists that transferred their rights in 1998, but, in reality, obtained any money for it and 40% of the right of which was intended to cover the costs to charge the sum. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1694"> In short, it is not necessary to make a harmonisation of this type in that sector. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1695"> It had been rejected at first reading a similar amendment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1696"> Have thought that the translations could continue to regret this timetable quite tighter and more difficult. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1697"> However, we have reached a point on which, unfortunately, we can no longer postpone beyond this issue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1698"> Our Committee proposes that this forward a year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1699"> This Parliament is, of course, in favour of those values and will continue to defendiÃ, ndolos. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1700"> The technology and the evolution of the markets acarrearÃ the change in any case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1701"> There is no legal base which will allow us to exclude competition in those cases. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1702"> A reduction of the universal services - the very essence of the sector of the postal service - even 50 grammes pondrÃ in grave danger of the capacity of the national postal servants to provide a universal service at a reasonable rate for all, regardless of the place in which they are resident. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1703"> I would point out to my colleagues of the Conservatives or in which ran into the United Kingdom when it tried to privatise the postal service britÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1704"> We have developed the network of safety for the users of the postal services in a hamaca where they sit big business of postal services to continue with what we have always done. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1705"> I am very pleased because this special services pretendÃ relates to put new technologies outside the scope of the universal service, will pass the reserved sector of the economy of scale mite 50 grs. proposed to our grs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1706"> We cannot tolerate, Madam President, but Commissioner, and we will not tolerate a situation such as this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1707"> For this reason, the European Commission has not proposed the total liberalisation of the postal services in the second phase. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1708"> This is something that I wish to the other European countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1709"> In the Dutch, the echÃ now, in the face of recently in the French its stance anti-liberal, or at least not so much in the holder of a periÃ debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1710"> In this sense, to say something on which has created such a Fund, and has been the same, and it to speak of the random basics presumed that shows the background, the virtual criteria with regard to its and the guarantees of its discretionary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1711"> Tomorrow, and I hope that we will vote in favour of the amendment of the signs now Atkins or the signs now Sterckx because otherwise I verÃ, obliged to vote against this report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1712"> Royal mail in the competition and spread the letters in in Sweden. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1713"> Madam President, Commissioner, but what we has the debate, or rather the policies and economic raised by Commissioner Bolkestein in its bÃºsqueda a liberalization of the postal services in the absence of any assessment of the first stage and in violation of rules laid down by this directive? that using the terms of a progressive and value, such as modernizaciÃ,, acompaÃ company amiento of development, falling into a from the social quality. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1714"> The expected of the universal services via a background of compensaciÃ that to use the proceeds to a private services cannot be permanent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1715"> These same political mites and delays have contributed to a debate in which it is often confused the end with the instruments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1716"> Madam President, to address this issue, we are talking about economic and social policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1717"> Madam President, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur permÃ ­ tame signs now Ferber because, since then, it has made a complicated work,, where we have had to try to seek a balance between proposals, attitudes and points of departure and arrival quite different. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1718"> I am afraid that the effect will be that the current monopoly will strengthen still beyond its position at the expense of the taxpayers and that will rejoin the listÃ for new applicants. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1719"> Also, I am pleased to see that our Liberal friends of the continent is given, the Liberals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1720"> We certainly recognise that the concept of liberalization per se has nothing wrong and that can be beneficial to consumers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1721"> Justified, since it is included in the resolution gica of the founding Treaties of the European Union, which put the culminaciÃ internal market for the free movement of goods and services in an environment of competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1722"> The universal service is the cornerstone of the Community policy in this area mbito and all we do is intended to create the conditions to other neas for its improvement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1723"> The special services are one of the mbitos of great importance which must be promoted in the area and the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1724"> He said that the opening up to competition of the whole of the postal market seems inevitable before the end of the decade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1725"> I am in favour of guarantees and other lidas that always be (the obligations of the universal service. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1726"> That is why we cannot remain silent and not permanecerÃ in silence as the future of the sector is threatened by the failure to overcome due to all the challenges that we set in Lisbon. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1727"> Many thanks, ladies, however. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1728"> However, I must recall that this organizaciÃ debate of markets has as its objective, the guarantee of access to the Community market for their products. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1729"> It is absolutely necessary to find, in excess of the tariff preference of 300 million, a means to enable the effective access to the quota C and evaluate the impact of the system of subsequent way in these producers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1730"> For example, we cannot fail to express our concern for the banana production in certain countries, the ACP countries producers from the West Indies and in some countries of Africa, which has been traditional providers of the market, tano with the commitments that we must not forget that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1731"> Therefore, I ask that this report be supported in its entirety on the part of the Members of this House, as it was in the Committee on agriculture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1732"> While the United States first in the period odos benchmarking, and now we are defending their own odos reference period. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1733"> There are powerful interests, especially those of the Americans, which are not directly to the farmers, tanos, but who have invested in the Central American commercial companies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1734"> Sometimes seems as if the Commission, in the proposals of desreglamentaciÃ in trade and agricultural policy at international level, were even further than the Cairns Group. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1735"> It is a stima system that the Commission and the Council to persist in a solution which can undertake seriously that production, in particular after 2006. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1736"> The successive dictÃ menes system of the WTO does not say that we cannot grant preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1737"> Thus, the period of transiciÃ be almost fifteen years and ever less than ten and compensatory aid must include the incomes of Community producers and the departure of the production of the ultraperifÃ peripheral regions, which should include an aid to companies which sell the Constitution; there tanos produced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1738"> I hope that today to listen to our arguments, since this system proposed by the Commission, this tariff preference, albeit of 300 million, may be seen as quite inÃºtil on the facts for the ACP producers to be verÃ they laminados by the system called 'by order of arrival ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1739"> Votes </SEG> 
<SEG id="1740"> (Parliament approved the Commission proposal) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1741"> The Commission rejects the remaining amendments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1742"> Before the Commission: </SEG> 
<SEG id="1743"> (Parliament adopted the oral amendment) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1744"> Report (A5-0376 / 2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on budgetary control, on the reform of the procedures and monitoring procedure (2000 / 2008 (INI)) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1745"> The people do not know all the risks or bears all the costs of their choice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1746"> During the for 35 years of my long parliamentary life I have always adhered to this rule. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1747"> I fear that their expectations in vain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1748"> This is our last desperate attempt to set up on the packets labels and imÃ of genes which reflect the autÃ, ntico cost of tobacco consumption. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1749"> Lehne report (A5-0368 / 2000) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1750"> I believe that this judgment is still correct and relevant and, in consequence, I have voted against the report in its entirety. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1751"> With good criterion, the Committee on legal Affairs, in refusing to a mechanism and a minimum percentage of less than 7%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1752"> In voting against this directive, my Group wishes to give a warning policy so that in Europe we are establishing unnecessary rules. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1753"> If it is right to condemn the dictatorship of Stalin of will, how can grant a much more nima confidence in signs now Putin, torturer of the Chechen people, something of the various mafias, that empeÃ company to settle all kinds of, the civil society (unions, parties), to strengthen his personal power? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1754"> Certain that Indonesia does not merecerÃ relates to this intensificaciÃ of relations, since in the last years of the leaders of this should not have distinguished precisely or by a great democracy or by great merits; however, we must be concerned by the Indonesian citizens and by this, I welcome the intensificaciÃ of relations and these AIDS. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1755"> Only the unit should deal with the crimes committed by the EU employees. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1756"> The Theato report on the fight against fraud allowed to discover that the European Central Bank, without doubt for testing better his famous independence, has not seen fit to support the agreement on the European anti-fraud office (OLAF). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1757"> That concludes the explanations of vote. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1758"> Either we belong to a club or do not belong, and it is particularly important that we recognise this principle. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1759"> Ladies and gentlemen, does not help us at the change of name. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1760"> The tariff only is, however, an important element, which guarantees the balance of the proposal of the Commission and constitutes an important basis in order to be able to achieve algÃºn progress in the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1761"> The national and regional programmes for the promotion of rural development also include measures to support the comercializaciÃ Commission said. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1762"> Europe and the United States are working in close colaboraciÃ in defence of the values we share. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1763"> We hope that hablarÃ system on a further round of the WTO, as well as about the consequences which this round to the wide range of new bilateral trade initiatives that are being discussed in the us hemisphere. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1764"> As has rightly said, the relations have intensified greatly in the last ten years; above all, it is true, on the part of the United States, thanks to President Clinton, but I believe that the history of contarÃ that these new relations has contributed to Europe, which has played a key role in its development, the transatlÃ system ntica in 1990 and the new agenda under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1765"> In short, it will be important to achieve a change of direction, and to draw up a real agenda for the year 2001. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1766"> To conclude, I referirÃ in the Dominican Republic, which says that suponÃ relates to the WTO debÃ to develop in an even-handed rbitro of common rules, in which the countries could learn to act according to the rules. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1767"> In the second place, although we can congratulate ourselves on the back of the Communist, the collapse of the dejÃ a single superpower, the United States of America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1768"> I know that the Commissioner is a good and very constructive dialogue with Parliament and with the committees involved with these issues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1769"> In accordance with the order of the day, the next item is the joint debate on the following reports: </SEG> 
<SEG id="1770"> These objectives, the major and minor, will be the litmus test with those who have to judge the concrete proposals presented by the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1771"> It is known that a '-instalaciÃ in a single country' s ability to provide services in all the States could make an avalanche in those countries with imposiciÃ decision falls. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1772"> Thus, in 1992 was consiguiÃ an agreement, then considered a harmonisation, according to which the normal rate of VAT is not to be less than 15% and the Member States had the power to apply a or not lower rates to 5%, in this case with derogations set. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1773"> We have asked the European Commission to ensure that there are no distortions of the market and that this report on the results of the Council and Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1774"> In short, the aim of this proposal is correct, but the method is unreasonable and if we really want to promote the e-economÃ relates to Europe, a proper would set a zero rate of VAT for our companies that operate throughout the network, instead of trying to impose our problems in the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1775"> In order to be able to comply with the requirements of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, we will adopt a whole range of measures to restrict it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1776"> The only case in which until now have not been ningÃºn VAT tax is the benefits that are carried out in the European Union from a third country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1777"> The positive of transport and the defendant has to end. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1778"> The firms of other countries, from outside the Community, not to pay taxes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1779"> The mascara containers are not so archaic and it would be necessary to impose a tax, while the programmes which are circulating on the Internet quedarÃ stretch out a rate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1780"> However, the solution proposed is intended to be, cnicamente unworkable and to set limits to the promotion of the transactions on the Internet in the Union, just as we all hope its expansiÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1781"> Yet President, ladies orÃ companies, the tax systems of the Union are losing edge and ability to recaudaciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1782"> Worsen--could could be seeking means to promote the trade and not to devise new forms of gravarlo. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1783"> The Liberals we are told that it is necessary to the least been possible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1784"> The Primarolo Group has drawn up a simpler rules that it is necessary to apply. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1785"> As objeciÃ, the Group that I represent in this House is of the opinion that should be to amend the fact that, while the enjoy normally of reduced VAT rates, this is not of aplicaciÃ opposition to the by so much to electrÃ debate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1786"> The introduction of kerosene but can introduce, therefore, by means of an international agreement that will guarantee equal competitive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1787"> I welcome with particular satisfaction is the fact that the report should one of the key arguments that presentÃ, in my report on behalf of the Committee on regional policy, transport and tourism and which was submitted to the Commission in this Parliament a few months ago, namely, that they realise that it is without doubt ticamente difficult to reach an international agreement on the tributaciÃ the aviaciÃ, at least in the short term, to seek alternative tools for achieving the same effect, including a rate for emissions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1788"> In reality, the industry pay 100% of the costs of infrastructure of the rates of monitoring of transit traffic and the defendant and airport in 1998, which amounted to a total of EUR 4 million trillion uses; to that of other means of transport, such as rail and road, which are still heavily subsidised. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1789"> The current situation is not favourable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1790"> In this context it has to be said, unfortunately, that the emissions from traffic and the defendant constitute a problem which, although in percentage terms is not too large, are increasing, and, therefore, not desdeÃ company could arlo. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1791"> The plan will be detrimental to the development of SMEs, both within and outside the Union, especially in view of the proposal to reduce the threshold of exemption prohibitively low level of facturaciÃ of 40 000 euros per year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1792"> If we are too greedy for tackling the issue before us, we will be putting at risk the future of the really important trade in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1793"> The starting point of the suppliers of outside the Community feeding to customers in the Community but must be registered in a place cannot assume a transfer of the tax revenue among the Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1794"> Bearing in mind that the debate within the Council still continues and the willingness of the Commission to settle in an appropriate manner, the issue of VAT and the trade in the short term, I think that the best thing at the moment is not, formally the proposals for modification of the Parliament, but to make them a reality as far as possible throughout the negotiations within the Council. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1795"> For this reason, I cannot accept the proposed amendments. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1796"> Thank you, Commissioner, but for all the files to the who has referred to this week. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1797"> For its part, only three months after the accident, the Commission asumiÃ its responsibilities and have a first package of measures, which the European Parliament refrendÃ other totally on 30 November last year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1798"> In effect, with more than fifteen directives or regulations in force, there is an urgent need for harmonising the practice cticas and exercise a greater control over the Community rules, in order to avoid major differences and unacceptable in the safety of the legitimate that could take place within the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1799"> Signs now President, I thank the Commissioner for his continuing commitment to the safety of the legitimate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1800"> I want to remind you, ladies orÃ powers in the area of security and the compensation that apply in the European and the American, does not amount to the same amounts that implemented in other countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1801"> In the second place, I dirÃ of their signs orÃ that who could have the capacity to confiscate or to freeze the assets of a specific to compensate for a serious or demÃ, is the French law, which could establish responsibilities beyond the due according to objective criteria which raises the current reglamentaciÃ international on contaminaciÃ by hydrocarbons. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1802"> The Commission considers that these provisions are going in the right direction towards the establishment of systems of tarificaciÃ decision just, which Furthermore gives incentives for a more rational and efficient use of the road network. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1803"> At root the received, particularly in Ireland and France, the measure and now the Minister of finance britÃ system nico has given you a draft differently: now arises as a right of use for everyone, including the drivers of lorries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1804"> I am committed to ensuring that the food that is available to the consumers, whether they come from within or outside the European Union, to meet the standards of more stringent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1805"> I certainly understand the concern of its signs orÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1806"> I regret to say, however, that I am not interested in its response. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1807"> The issue raised by the signs orÃ is important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1808"> In Nigeria, Chevron have been accused by the gena by independent producers of instigate violence against it and even to pay to the Nigerian soldiers to which caused against the demonstrators in the Naval base of warri. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1809"> In his report, which was adopted on 15 November, the Commission at the conclusion of the aid to the Commission, on the basis of the rules of procedure the have not allowed to solve the problem of the surcoreanas prices. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1810"> I believe that the whole of intentions is hugely reassuring, but the fact is that, in the meantime, our shipyards they are closing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1811"> Question 10 only by (H-0868 / 00): </SEG> 
<SEG id="1812"> Signs now Commissioner, I understand that you do not wish to modify its despite the fact that ten countries Members are opposed to this tariff. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1813"> This initiative is based on a Council regulation, which amends the regulation which defines the egp. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1814"> I represent some producers and therefore feel a deep concern. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1815"> We are working on it in Committee, we have not taken up this week in, week and absent for a trip to the Balkans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1816"> We are working on the points I usula of safeguarding and if Mr Clegg needs arguments to talk with its producers of beet, have at their disposal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1817"> I want to thank Mr Liikanen for his very positive and brilliant response. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1818"> Tratarã on this matter with my services, once we know the budgetary resources available for the next year. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1819"> On this point, the efforts of my services and the mine particular focus on limiting the distance between the parties and the future of the Court of justice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1820"> In the same way that the courts will have specialized, Munich and other cities in Germany have specialised in the patent law, and there are specialised courts in 1998, a Community Court that reÃºna and evaluating cases relating to the Community patent worsen--could system to be highly specialised. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1821"> To avoid this situation to acquire a temporary carÃ system cter because, on 13 July 1999, on 13 July of last year, the Commission recordÃ in a letter addressed to the Member States for its commitment to appoint courts to Community trade marks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1822"> As you well know the honourable Member of this House, the presentation of a complaint is not by itself in advance of the project. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1823"> Question no 47 by 10 (H-0877 / 00): </SEG> 
<SEG id="1824"> This means, therefore, that the Commission will do so only use the action of the dicas presumed that sets such and as stated in the rules of procedure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1825"> The question is, and other nde must address these students to understand that when we pursue this cycle of studies and succeed in Britain are entitled to get results. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1826"> The King be elected for a fixed period of between the Finnish Members of the European Parliament more valuable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1827"> It is also to be seen as an issue which affects the competition, since that will continue to sell duty-free in the southern part of the banking system ltico, on the route between Stockholm and Helsinki, that that is not possible in the route between umeÃ ¥and Vaasa. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1828"> What we must do is to correct this situation to the promotion of the contents of multilingÃ is, because it is a prerequisite for the success of the content industry. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1829"> The problem that concerns me is that businesses do not always have sufficient guarantees and a path which offer commercial tested the investor. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1830"> To carry out "the development of an ambitious European programme e-contenidos is necessary to simplify and consolidate from the point of view of safety procedures deemed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1831"> For that reason, the aim of the measures pÃºblicas of support for the promotion of the content industry of the EU has to be the consecuciÃ a high level of culture and the Commission itself. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1832"> On the other hand, are the networks, which need to fill the contents of its space virtual, and that the subordinaciÃ obvious regarding the content, their purchase, its utilizaciÃ without special attention to the rules of production. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1833"> Signs now President, I welcome with great satisfaction the programme relating to the digital content and I would like to highlight two points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1834"> That is why I support the amendments that call for the specific actions in the new technologies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1835"> First, on the social and cultural digital content, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament does hincapiÃ, in the social and cultural, of the digital content. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1836"> Evaluaciã and gestiÃ environmental noise </SEG> 
<SEG id="1837"> Indeed, I am grateful for the support that the Christian Democrats and, by the way, is also a part of the Liberal Group, have brought to this amendment in particular to limit noise from aircraft. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1838"> But this year, six years later the dates mentioned above, and under strong pressure from the government, the Commission has submitted a proposal to establish harmonised noise indicators. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1839"> This proposal is, in fact, quite moderate, if we bear in mind that the Scandinavian countries already have stricter standards than that which we propose for the year 2012. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1840"> Orly, Schiphol, Barcelona and other airports comply with strict measures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1841"> Another important point which we propose to insert and that is going to be essential in the context of the problematic of aircraft noise is the other supplementary noise indicators, which has alado signs the rapporteur. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1842"> By lack of common standards in the European Union, we have seen situations of glaring distorsiÃ of competition between airports and lack of fairness between the citizens of the various Member States. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1843"> For the amendments of my colleague, Bernd Lange, seem to me to be so important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1844"> Signs now President, first of all, I must say that I welcome the present report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1845"> This was the background to the purpose of amendment no 36, although I believe that the idea of still has not developed to the Fund. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1846"> Worsen--could could look at this aspect and adopt later in both areas mbitos a combined approach, setting up by one side a values of political mite to the various sources of noise emisiÃ enlargement and, on the other hand, quality standards for emissions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1847"> We need time and I regret that we have not had, although in general, I support the framework directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1848"> Once the Member States have provided information study, the Commission estudiarÃ the issue of introducing values of political Community mite and other measures to reduce the number of people who are affected by the noise, and presentarÃ a report to the Council and to Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1849"> Food additives other than colours and sweeteners </SEG> 
<SEG id="1850"> These are the three criteria. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1851"> Thank you, Mr Seguro, I sympathise with you, because, if you have the throat as a estropajo, I have as a bayeta, as we say in North Rhine; the fact is that it seems that the influenza is hanging over here. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1852"> If the problems of diet being made in other nicos increases, Furthermore, the risk of contracting. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1853"> Then, also comprobÃ that the Commission carecÃ relates to the instruments necessary to act appropriately. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1854"> Tomorrow we have in the programme to another stage, then I tocarÃ the shift to our colleague, Mrs Paulsen, the Liberal Group, who will have the opportunity to make even more of the directive that is before us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1855"> The Member States and the Commission now have a better instrument to ensure the full implementation of the Community in alimentaciÃ animal and, in the case of emergency situations in third countries, can adopt measures without loss of time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1856"> We know that the greater part of the Europeans live in cities, and even now these questions have remained in embryonic stage in regard to the cities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1857"> The process of planificaciÃ must be applied in a fair manner and innovative. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1858"> The multiannual programme 'for sustainable development in the urban environment is an instrument, to this end, as well as the issue of the agenda 21 is an excellent means of and development actions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1859"> To achieve that change the threat climÃ problematic is necessary to reduce the speedy and abandon the fuels in the works. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1860"> There have been many of those who have suggested that the budget is too small. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1861"> The intention is that the main partners in this context are the Commission and the networks of local authorities, which have the legal responsibility for developing and implementing the policies of sustainable development in the urban environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1862"> The Court of justice of the European communities and even the protection of rganos solution of conflicts of the WTO said that on occasions the precautionary principle applies in environmental terms or in the field of public health, and even sometimes against Europeans, as it shows the unresolved issue of cheese drawn up with fresh milk. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1863"> The aim has to be the limitaciÃ or indemnizaciÃ the serious, but that the primary goal must be to avoid the serious against the health or the assets of the people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1864"> In 1996, the European Parliament saliÃ in favour of a prohibiciÃ use of animal meal in the whole of the European Union, in accordance with the principle of caution; although only by that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1865"> It has never existed, and never existirÃ, an area of absolute scientific certainty about the new substances or on the new products. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1866"> For, if we want the principle of caution is effective and, is fundamental to the participation of all the interested parties, including the representatives of civil society, in the decisions that surrounding its aplicaciÃ Commission </SEG> 
<SEG id="1867"> And, last, that public health and the environment should take precedence over other considerations, above all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1868"> A vital for the principle of precaution is that to the Commission by the possible harmful effects will provide a basis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1869"> Yesterday, in Lisbon, at first hand, an American Professor the teacher, to whom the food and drugs administration has relied on the seven years a study on the effects of radiation on human health, revelÃ that there is the risk that the utilizaciÃ the telÃ, fonos range of tiles strengthens the brain tumours, Alzheimer's disease and injuries in the skin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1870"> Signs now President, the environment and public health are as one with a quina complicated, of functions that monitoring and control in order to be able to intervene and thus not estropee. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1871"> The issue of this principle must be avoided at all cost containing the area and the activity, create timidity and inactivity social, become a means to discourage competition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1872"> As Parliament will be observed, the Commission is in keeping with the most of the issues raised in your motion for a resolution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1873"> The Commission will place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1874"> Its Article 2 of the right to life, and on every occasion on which in Spain to terrorism kills a person, throughout the Union is affected on what constitutes one of its principles more essential. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1875"> We do not want to replace the institutions legÃ represents timamente established, but urgirlas to protect our rights and our freedoms without concessions to terror. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1876"> Votes </SEG> 
<SEG id="1877"> Likewise, the debate in the Council on the clasificaciÃ the budget relative to the project of retirement and on the administrative costs of the fisheries agreements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1878"> (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1879"> That is to say, is no longer present. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1880"> The 23.428 licence obtained the parecerÃ do fewer, but on the other hand, will be happy to be offered and so that they can grow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1881"> The consequence of that supresiÃ, which comenzÃ legislation to be applied in the Middle of last year, it was, as we had planned, a dramÃ political pace of approval of projects and ejecuciÃ of payments, with what the ejecuciÃ annual authorisations from that background, at the end of June of next year 2000, was cut by one percentage point. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1882"> The text is a Charter on target ideal to a close in the practice of the Secretariat-General of the European Parliament in Luxembourg. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1883"> Before my journey, they told me: "it is Christmas, and in rgamo we celebrate Christmas and businesses. lucÃ do what Mr. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1884"> Furthermore, we oppose the sobreproducciÃ of agricultural products and the use of resources for the information to be sold. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1885"> Signs now President, I voted in favour of the report and which relates to the contribution on the tax of trade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1886"> However procurarÃ President, ladies and enmendarme before the year 2004 with some explanation of vote in favour of Malta. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1887"> However, what I say with certain solemnity: is it which can accept a Europe, in my judgment, that too Liberal! </SEG> 
<SEG id="1888"> The existence of a deadline incentivarÃ relates to the postal sector, to develop and to modernise their services, while at the same time that will be the planificaciÃ and investments in the markets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1889"> Will they exert pressure. consolidate its position with the money that gain with the distribution of - years more than 150 grammes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1890"> The liberalization of the postal services, as was proposed by the Commission, is not adequate nor consistent, for which I voted in favour of the report and all the amendments tabled which expressed that same orientaciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1891"> De Roo report (A5-0378 / 2000) </SEG> 
<SEG id="1892"> I also have reservations about amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31, not being convinced that are compatible with the WTO. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1893"> The proposal of the Commission is unacceptable in the State in which it finds itself, as it represents a capitulaciÃ without conditions on the dictatorship that this us! capitulaciÃ is unworthy of our European project and of the social model and but that we want to build. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1894"> It goes against the respect of national identity, as stipulated in paragraph 3 of Article 6 of the Treaty of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1895"> It must be pointed out that the minorÃ companies have lingÃ momentum, instead of being engullidas by the globalization of the Internet, have to meet in this means a new opening of cultural and economic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1896"> Signs now President, lack of other results, the debate which took place in Nice made clear the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1897"> In this respect the tone of the debate is far too simplistic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1898"> The slowdown of the conclusions of the written - not officially available at the moment, four days rather than late - demonstrates the difficulty of drafting clearly decisions taken in the confusiÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1899"> The only means of avoiding conflicts dangerous in the future, is to maintain the concepciÃ traditional according to which Europe is based on mutual respect of national communities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1900"> The Nice Summit concluyÃ next Sunday with an agreement that worsen--could to give rise to a draft Treaty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1901"> The resolution on Nice, voted on today, do not reflect this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1902"> For, a reference to the social policy, for which France had to gamble on the presentation of his Presidency, but which, in the end, quedÃ on one hand full of very little thing, apart from the declarations of intent and the producers tulos documents of content very vague and clearly insufficient at the existing problems and the enormous dissatisfaction, of which the manifestaciÃ the workers at Nice was important expresiÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1903"> On the really important issues as taxes, taxes, social policy, asylum and emigraciÃ, everything is as before. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1904"> What strikes me in the debate on Nice is the Commission at the end of which the Treaty has not father or mother or is son of one: the French Presidency desdoblÃ in apologise, on time, clearly the results of the IGC and their reasons; the groups which correspond to the governments of the Member States multiplied the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1905"> On the contrary, diminishing the influence of national democracies limitaciÃ via the Commission the right to veto, and to give more power to the European Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1906"> If these consequences have failed to be calculated in my next year of birth, in 1944, concluded the agreement of that, possibly not would have agreed an exemption for the fuel taxation and other products of aviaciÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1907"> Given that zero risk does not exist, the scientific or, at least, must be to apply the criterion of proportionality, to judge the risks uncertain and assume their responsibilities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1908"> But this Parliament luchÃ legislation for which this reduction of the resources for the year were compensated for using the flexibility instrument laid down in a of the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1909"> We all have a part to play in this important field because, in the truly global market in which we find ourselves, the new ideas - with adequate resources, and with a strong support and realistic - will do that in Europe we can maintain our place in the vanguard of development in the new industries and on the technology of the communications in particular. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1910"> In the precedent since pushed hard words against the Budgets, and it is that EUR 400 million is actually the financiaciÃ Commission, so, in the second part of the exercise should be to take advantage of the possibilities of financiaciÃ extra protection which offers the flexibility instrument, as has been alado signs in the report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1911"> According to my opinion, it acompaÃ company arÃ system automÃ, and not as a disminuciÃ concludes the report, the value of the European adido next. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1912"> As we all know, in the European Union, unemployment is concentrated in the territories of economic and gicamente less developed, in particular in the 10 of objective 1, that there is a need for innovative actions not only a simple carÃ cter system, but that inspired by a willingness to explÃ ­ quotation of economic growth and employment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1913"> When I come back to my own region, the East of England, and I find that not a single administration and has used that money in this last period, I doubt that we would have been all the more effective that have to be in the future to welcome these new communities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1914"> Signs now President, my first words are to Helmut Markov to thank and congratulate him on the constructive, highly competent and serious project of the Commission relating to the innovative actions of the ERDF for the period 2000-2006. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1915"> The effectiveness of the political power and the aspects of the policy but have not been forgotten in these guidelines. can give rise to innovative actions to a third subject, which concerns the regional identity and sustainable development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1916"> Nevertheless, we hope that the projects will be elected in the regional, as, by else, has understood this well Mr Berend in his. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1917"> The debate is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1918"> That is why we call in this report and in the three amendments which have adido that the next Commission to redouble its efforts to give a conciliation before the WTO. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1919"> I believe that the Commissioner should demonstrate to the industry that they are doing everything we can in this sense to do in the face of this threat in our industry. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1920"> For, of course, we hope that, since the 18 December, was taken at the meeting of 6 of the OECD agreement "navÃ challenges". </SEG> 
<SEG id="1921"> However, all the indications are that the final goal of moving again and again, so that we never manage to achieve this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1922"> As you all know, the simple tramitaciÃ this procedure to go beyond six months. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1923"> For the large corporations, and for their lawyers, claim that it is less State means that the State and its finances must be to its exclusive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1924"> But to achieve this, so that the process can strengthen the shipbuilding industry, jobs and give reassurance to the families that depend on it, it is still necessary to support the 31 December 2000, because the market is not equal, but of disloyalty and applied. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1925"> The Commission encourages the improvement of the competitiveness of the shipbuilding industry in the EU, but in the face of the massive cuts in the price of the Korean shipyards, the increase in productivity can be achieved is not enough. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1926"> The Council did hincapiÃ, in which such a support mechanism must not distort competition within the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1927"> The presence of the nuclear submarine exploded in the waters of the bahÃ relates to Algeciras has developed since, unfortunately, in a conflict between a diplomÃ democratic potential nuclear war and colonial and a Member State of the second categorÃ, according to the clasificaciÃ Nice, which makes their rights and doblega on explanations of children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1928"> When, on the part of people that bounced into the country in which the dueÃ lives a year - which is, in the press britÃ system nica-, perutz that the disease was serious, instead of changing this centre I have changed the calificaciÃ the centre. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1929"> And, since then, we await with interest the reply of the Commission to check whether the objective has been achieved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1930"> Signs now President, I would like my first words of sympathy with the families of the town councillor murdered and with the company Eros the Partido popular, and reject this barbaric practice of fascist crimes and the groups that they amparando. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1931"> I also believe that it would be appropriate to take the submarine tireless in Britain for its repair, as soon as possible, as soon as the conditions climatolÃ and other gicas appropriate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1932"> Their signs orÃ companies have asked whether the Commission considers that the directive 89 / 618 / Euratom, on information to the Commission in case of emergency radiolÃ, and the directive 96 / 29 / Euratom, on safety standards, are aplicaciÃ the submarine and what measures have been taken in consequence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1933"> In accordance with the usual procedure for the complaints, we cannot make public this answer, although we can say to outline what we say. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1934"> One aspect of the Euratom Treaty is the transport of radioactive waste between Member States; but, of course, and is part of the United Kingdom and all contaminated waste go from one part of the United Kingdom to another part of the United Kingdom, without spending by Member State of the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1935"> All we need to do is to win the confidence of the people living in the bedrock. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1936"> However, we see here a Member State which seeks to the public of another Member State as it will do much to with any other State in the world, as if, in the background, had not ningÃºn affectio societatis fifty years after the start of the European company, as if the European solidarity had not progressed in as minimum. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1937"> It is a fact that in a moment given that the submarine operating in waters britÃ system nicas was a submarine German. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1938"> There are discussing but the citizens, based on their knowledge or in its intuiciÃ, to manage its attention to the European institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1939"> The lack of spending in new military equipment due to the cuts in the area of defence of the labour government britÃ system nico darÃ what place in the future, without doubt, to episodes more frequent of military equipment that was defective withdrawn to carry out repairs essential. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1940"> The competence of the Community, that some people wish to another thing, does not cover the clasificaciÃ the ports to carry out work of repair in submarines, or matters of safety of nuclear reactors or technical requirements for a submarine is withdrawn for its repair in another place. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1941"> It would be necessary to provide still support, to call on the Community institutions to strengthen the financial means, human and material from the UNHCR had. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1942"> I call on the Commission to increase this aid and that appoint all the UNHCR as other rgano coordinator in all the contracts concluded with the NGOs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1943"> Therefore, must be able to have access to the populations and their equipment on the way worsen--could were able to move with all safety and have the necessary resources to fulfil its mission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1944"> On 22 November the Commission adopted a communication on a parlance of asylum procedure and a uniform status for here, llos to those who are granted asylum system Lido, throughout the Union, which was the final objective laid down in Tampere for the asylum system European parlance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1945"> For, I gustarÃ relates to pay tribute to all the work that has been carried out by Mrs Ogata for the UNHCR, and to wish Mr. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1946"> We think it is important that we are encouraging a amnistÃ policy in Yugoslavia to that of the Commission that I mentioned, but we think it is very important that we condemn without any doubt the reapariciÃ the incursions and terrorist activities on the borders between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo, because it reminds us of way is it which occurred during the Kosovo conflict, where it has been the responsibilities of the Western powers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1947"> In paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of our compromise talking very clear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1948"> I urge the President Kostunica to clarify what has happened with people like Mr Ukshin Hoti, of whose fate we have discussed this on several occasions and whose whereabouts do not know nothing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1949"> I also see it as the which becomes an appeal to the KFOR to that disrupt any act of violence in the Presevo valley. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1950"> I welcome the measures which it has already adopted the KFOR to tackle the problem and I am claiming moderaciÃ opposition to all parties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1951"> B5-0916 / 2000 by Mr Crespo and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists; </SEG> 
<SEG id="1952"> This was agreed upon in the report of the currency in March 1990, and what conditions well because I had the privilege of being there in the act of takeover of the President of the Commission, after the referendum on the ponÃ relates to end the regime of general Pinochet. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1953"> Yet President, ladies orÃ powers, I would like to speak about the debate on which, of course, vote in favour of. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1954"> It is important that the international Community to exercise its right of the political, not as interference in the internal Affairs of an independent country, but as a procedure, precaution and pro-active. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1955"> The situation in the different rceles system and in the police headquarters, with torture and ill-treatment, is totally unacceptable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1956"> This is exactly the same treatment that we see in Western Europe and, from the protests, the Minister and the Minister has postponed the transfer to get a consensus and opinion on the reform of the prisons in Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1957"> It is urgent, and it decided to include this point in the order of the day. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1958"> He procesarÃ; the 8 January was accused of having taken part in a meeting of opponents Tunisians in France, which, on the other hand, he refuses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1959"> When the militant and responsible for these associations like to join the of the anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights, the policÃ relates to surrounding their houses and attending this meeting are hurt in the street by men clothes of measures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1960"> The second problem is, in fact, only a part of a set of harassment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1961"> My Group, like this Parliament, is particularly sensitive to the situation of human rights in Tunisia and in the rest of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1962"> Yet President, ladies orÃ companies, to show a little restraint, please. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1963"> The negotiations marched very well and I am pleased that those negotiations is also gaining speed, which I hope will place the to that referÃ their signs orÃ. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1964"> Several Members have referred to the situation of the prisoners in Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1965"> B5-0912 / 2000 by Mr van Hecke, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group; </SEG> 
<SEG id="1966"> We could not, in my judgement, but President, but Commissioner, retractarnos regarding this attitude. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1967"> In this context, the decision of the power of the military that, as always, contribuyÃ opposition to worsen the situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1968"> This attitude fits in well with the continuation of the policy of French imperialism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1969"> The Commission is very worried about the recent violence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1970"> The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1971"> The unfair competition helps destroy good housing for the shipbuilding, the loss of knowing make (know-how) and of jobs in the long term and may lead to situations of monopoly, which will in world trade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1972"> Approval of the Minutes of the previous </SEG> 
<SEG id="1973"> For this reason, I would like to thank all colleagues for the aportaciÃ that have resulted in the transit mite of presentation of amendments and technical of the Commission because they have been an extremely valuable elements for a successful conclusion to the resolution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1974"> The adoption of the social agenda for the European Council in Nice we meet in particular, and I hope that Members will take advantage of this opportunity to encourage the development and the social security systems and care for the elderly, and promote other measures, such as, for example, the learning throughout life, which will guarantee its reintegraciÃ the active life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1975"> The promotion of the continued throughout the whole life - something that has already been mentioned by another speaker - is another issue that we support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1976"> Naturally, the people of more than 70%, inflation is still years can do many things, but it is a mistake to do that, to their age, their income are dependent on their work. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1977"> Already, in its monthly report of July 2000, the European Central Bank emitÃ relates to warnings very serious in this respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1978"> As far as the economy is concerned, the Member States can confront this problem much better they themselves by means of their own legislation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1979"> With its proposals for an active life during the age, the importance to society as a whole. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1980"> We must keep the promises about pensions, but the pensions must be guaranteed with the own resources of these countries, without the need to go to the policy of the EU to make financial parlance effective its payment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1981"> In the past, or ten years we have witnessed the major revoluciÃ social, which has more than doubled the life expectancy of the people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1982"> It is what gives meaning to the prolongaciÃ Commission matemÃ political life, that the progress of the dico has allowed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1983"> They gained compensation - society was, therefore, afectada-, older workers leave employment, but not contratÃ protection to workers from other venes and were many jobs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1984"> The result of the policy of family and measures should be rather than men and women with family responsibilities can choose freely if we wish to develop an industrial activity or not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1985"> My brother and I met with him. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1986"> Other initiatives in the future of public health aimed above all the issues connected with the health and care of the elderly and the promotion of an ageing healthy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1987"> (it) now President, have accepted the amendments 2 and 3 tabled by Mr Pronk, on which holds that we need to amend the text and insist on the concept of development demogrÃ traffic in the face of the ageing demogrÃ traffic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1988"> It is not a question of double the operations of advertising or the promotion of the operators of each sector or of the authorities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1989"> Signs now President, the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, in principle, in favour of the proposal of the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1990"> For this reason it is very important to offer a compensaciÃ and this can establish very adequately through measures of promotion and advertising. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1991"> I believe that in the context of the comercializaciÃ and selling would have to grant a place much more Central to the permanent within the programmes of formaciÃ, since the new technologies, the gestiÃ the promotion, offer new opportunities for quite a logÃ represents stica modern. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1992"> First of all, I want to congratulate Mr Dary, for her excellent report. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1993"> My next observaciÃ debate relates to the question of exports and the Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1994"> We should not have to pay for certain products which are not demand, or make propaganda. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1995"> Everyone has sufficient food, so that if a product promocionamos evidently do so against the consumption of another. </SEG>

<SEG id="1997"> Here, as the rapporteur, that is to say, as a man, and Mr Markus Ferber like the rapporteur, that is to say, as a woman. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1998"> This illustrates how small companies with amendments can achieve greater effects in practice. </SEG>
