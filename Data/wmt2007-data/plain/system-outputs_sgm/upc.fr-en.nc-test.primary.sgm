Racial divided house of Europe
The extreme right is characterised by racism and its use of the issue of immigration as a political difference.
The Lega Nord in Italy, the Vlaams Blok Holland, supporters of the National Front of Le Pen in France, are all examples of parties or movements trained issue on the aversion to immigrants and the promotion of simplistic policies for control.
While as individuals and Jorg Haidar Jean-Marie Le Pen can go and (early enough) come, racial question never disappear in European policy in future.
An ageing population and the borders increasingly open imply a growing racial fragmentation in the European countries.
The mainstream parties of the centre left and centre right have addressed this perspective applying head in the sand, hoping against all expectations that the problem disappear.
It will not be the case, as clearly demonstrates the history of racial America.
The racial relations in the US have monopolised decades - and always monopolise - the political scene, to the point that racial divisions occupy an important place income, if not more, as determining factors of preferences and political attitudes.
The first step to address the issue of racial policy is to understand the origin and the consequences of racial animosity, even if it means the discovery of unpleasant truths to hear.
That is precisely the purpose in large part by research teams in economics, sociology, psychology and political science in the US.
This research shows that the representatives of different races are much less confidence with each other; whites are less inclined to support the welfare expenditure which, according to them, promote minorities; more fragmented communities racialement have less efficient governments, corruption and trafficking of influence, higher rates of higher crime and less productive public goods by imposed dollar.
This does not mean eliminating the heterogeneity and create communities racialement uniform, but it is necessary to recognise the reality of these problems to begin to develop sound public policies of racial relations.
Of course, the Americans dispute the methods used.
Some pronounce themselves in favour of action programmes affirmatifs offering minorities preferences in the allocation of employment, the admission to university and public contracts.
These policies are regarded as a means of offering reparations for the injustices of the past and, more importantly, creating models of role and to overcome the remaining discrimination and perhaps unintentionally.
Other protesting against affirmative action and support a policy which are not concerned with race, combined with the free market policies and pro family values, enough to create jobs for minorities and help not separate black families.
This last point is crucial in any political because one of the most important causes of poverty in the US is the spread of lone parents (understand unmarried mother) in the black community.
Whatever the right answer, the question is that the determination of the measures concerning race represents a dominant problem in American politics.
Of course, minorities have progressed towards more integration and economic success.
In the 1950s, blacks could sit in buses nowadays, two of the main players in the US foreign policy are black.
We cannot deny that the American politicians right-wing continue to deploy the race card 'as a tool tactics.
Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, the former assistant to Nixon and Reagan brought presidential candidate independent during the last election.
It has recently published a book entitled 'success' Death of "West How: right-to-die peoples and Immigrant Invasion Imperil Our Country and Civilization '.
But for every book such, there are ten other contain a serious analysis of racial issue in America.
The analysis and political debates on racial relations have a considerable delay in Europe.
At the most, the question is closely examined in terms of immigration quotas and restrictions of borders, not in terms of opportunities and social problems created by a Europe increasingly racialement mixed.
Of course, a clear policy on immigration is needed to prevent the accumulation of immigrants illegally.
But we should not remain: border controls Mexico does not mean the end of the US policy on the internal problems of race!
Europe is rich and its population is ageing quickly: Europeans, strengthened by aid programmes generous social, are no longer prepared to accept "dirty jobs' in, say, agriculture and leather industry.
This attitude makes inevitable increased immigration.
Europeans are nevertheless quick to criticise the US for the failures of their policy towards minorities and for any manifestation of racism from the other side of the Atlantic.
The reading of the European press often shown a complex superiority towards the US on racial questions: they (the Americans) have problems with racism; we are unaffected against him, with the exception of mad skinheads neo-Nazis and their similar.
What happened in recent weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, shows that the racial problem in Europe is more profound and, as in the US, because the sad truth that racial relations are inherently difficult and that confidence and a cooperative behaviour not travelling on racial lines.
If mainstream parties in Europe do not engage more seriously to understand racial tensions in their countries and to put 'race to the center of their priorities, individuals such as Le Pen always try to try to fill the gap with their message of hatred.
Combating French exception
The attention of Europe today is directed and on towards enlargement and the constitution currently under negotiation between the Member States.
However, the outcome of several taken tooth Gallic with the European Commission not least to determine the fate of the new enlarged Europe.
France has unilaterally chosen to ignore the Stability and Growth Pact leaving run its public deficit beyond the limit of 3% of GDP.
The French like to talk about the rational rigour of their thought, but where budgets are concerned, Descartes is no longer and confusion entry.
France did among the main criticism of Ireland when, in 2000, the Irish Government undercut its budget surplus, which was to 4%, a mere 0.5%.
Other countries have not respected the Stability Pact, but France is the first country to do with a small smile openly satisfied contemptuous.
None of this should not surprise.
France only apply to European regulations usual very well grounded to consider its own culture as an exception.
Thus, France systematically vetoed reform of the common agricultural policy of the European Union.
As everyone knows, the CAP is a fine gift offered to rich European farmers (particularly French farmers) which do not deserve the expense of farmers in difficulty in developing countries and of European consumers.
France is also trying to return to the old political bailing out private companies in deficit and to collapse in public reinforcement of money.
The European Commissioner for competition, Mario Monti, cannot lose this battle: it needs the support of those who have faith in the markets and equal treatment for all.
The story is simple.
The French Government provides bail Alstom, a company which has developed hi-tech products, the TGV high-speed French, but recently bankrupt.
The French government proclaims that he never abandon its rescue plan for Alstom, a plan which has all the usual dirigiste motivations: maintaining employment, protection of investors, etc.
Moreover, as Alstom is a company of high technology, the French Government plays the map of research and development, arguing that investment in R&D is beneficial to growth.
Saving Alstom by nationalising the company is obviously a mistake.
The company is formed different units, some beneficial, others bankrupt: it is obvious that we must dismantle.
The profitable units, such as the TGV, easily find buyer; the deficit units must be closed.
The money French will be better spent in the temporary conversion costs of employees rather than to keep them alive a company which is not profitable.
It is important that the European Commission not to France to tailor laws for itself in the policies on competition, as it seems to be doing with the budget deficits.
The Commission must condemn the public financing of private companies in France as it condemns the subsidies in other European Member State.
The Commission has already achieved some success in this area, particularly by forcing Germany to cancel the government guarantees of public banks.
In particular, the Alstom and France in general should not make exceptions and must meet the same standards.
If the Commission is not responding, the European Union still more like a playground for the French officials.
France has already taken the lead in the foreign policy of the European Union with its Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dominique de Villepin, which is and increasingly resembles a Minister for Foreign Affairs of Europe.
At the same time, France ignores the essential regulations of common economic policy and government support for private companies.
The European Commission lose little credibility still finally resemble a Paris rounding-off of lesser importance?
Losing of Alstom would have serious repercussions in Europe and not just for policies on competition.
The war for oil
For decades, Republicans that both Democrats pursue the same objectives in the field of oil: maintaining both to the stability oil prices, gently reduce domestic consumption, reduce the dependence imports and diversify sources of supply Foreign.
Despite appearances, these objectives are always the same today, under the Bush administration.
Many observers believe that the invasion of Iraq, Bush has chosen a different route.
A significant increase in the production Iraq probably increase the US oil dependency.
The price of a barrel of oil undoubtedly decline with the emergence of a new source of supply, where increased dependence of the USA, especially vis-à-vis the Middle East.
It is ironic that the US exerted more control over the Iraqi oil in the programme food "against" oil from the UN before the war - it was the UN and not Saddam Hussein who established the level of Iraqi exports) that they can only do so in the context of a future Iraqi democratic state.
If the Bush administration sought oil supplies stable, secure diversified and cheap, it sufficient to lift the embargo against Libya, Iran, Iraq and Sudan and to sink oil.
But America's interest for Iraqi oil is not dictated by the economy or by energy policy.
The Bush administration has acknowledged that the Iraqi oil is primarily a geopolitical asset.
Who controls Iraqi oil control, Iraq.
Saddam has had its power controlled the Second World oil reserve.
It knew perfectly well what it should black gold.
Faced with the possibility of the invasion and the defeat, it has threatened to fire Iraqi oil fields.
The pillages and the plundering of Iraqi oil installations and pipelines shows that almost everyone has understood that control oil is control of the country.
During the preparation of the invasion by the US, the securing of oil fields was a priority.
The aim was not an increase in supply or a fall in prices on the American market, but the overthrow of Saddam and its replacement by a new government.
The future of Iraq is linked to the oil production in the country.
But given the vagaries of the oil market, particularly in an unstable situation, we cannot see how the Bush administration will manage to achieve its objectives in the coming years.
The problem is simple.
The US must use oil revenues to alleviate the burden of change of Iraqi regime based on the American taxpayers.
In the long term, reconstruction plan depends on the ability of Iraq to export volumes of oil.
If Iraq does not oil, President Bush cannot keep the promises he made to the Iraqi people, the American people and the international community.
Before the invasion, Iraq had a production capacity of three million barrels of oil per day.
But it cannot return to this level of production in time for establishing an Iraqi government.
An increase in the production requires the development of oil installations, which requires major investments, a government in place and political stability.
Nobody, not even the Bush administration, expects that these conditions are met shortly.
The political stability is the first condition for increasing production capacity.
The experience of Iran, Kuwait, Russia and even Iraq, shows that it must around three years of political stability before production capacity can significantly increase and sustainable.
It will take years to Iraq to develop a new constitution, establish a democratic government, negotiate the distribution of oil revenues between the various regions, regulate investment and make the economy attractive to foreign investors.
It will take time to negotiate with the multinational oil companies and neighbouring countries achieving feasibility studies and the necessary technical studies, and reconstruction, rehabilitation and exploration of its oil fields.
Thus, even a period of three years seems optimistic, because this implies that during this time constantly occupation, the Iraqis are putting up their own government and put an end to the political instability.
The reality is likely to be another.
Important tensions can survive over the years.
And it is not surprising that the production of Iraqi oil suddenly halt, even with a democratic government.
History shows that strikes and social unrest that could disrupt the oil production more easily occur in a democratic context that under a dictatorship.
If Iraq is unable to increase its oil production in the few coming years, this will be a thorn in the foot, both for foreign policy and energy policy of the USA.
How can they be allowed long-term finance the reconstruction of Iraq?
Who pays for the maintenance of a fragile democracy in Iraq?
The US able to maintain their occupation without ensuring feeding the Iraqi people, medical care and other basic services?
These are difficult issues, and we cannot respond before a democratic regime control and guarantee the Iraqi oil production.
Allowing murderous human rights
If it were not so sad, this would be the Millennium grim joke: Libya was elected to chair the United Nations Commission on Human Rights!
When Caligula has appointed his horse the Senate, the horse, at least not blood on its hooves.
Of course, the procedure was perfectly legal: the presidency changes every year in a region of the world to another.
This year, it was the turn of Africa to appoint the President and it has appointed Libya.
Only the US and Canada have voted against.
In their infinite shame, the European countries abstained.
This long said on the moral bankruptcy of the UN that this decision comes at a delicate moment for this organisation.
President Bush has challenged the UN to express their serious about their own binding decisions concerning Iraq: otherwise, they know the same fate despicable that the League of Nations, which has proved powerless in the 1930 when it was facing the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany and the Fascist Italy.
The election of Libya to chair a UN body of upholding human rights currently contributes nothing to support the legitimacy or the moral authority of the world body.
Remember that Libya is a totalitarian tyranny; its leader, Muammar Ghaddafi behaviour combines sometimes changing political extremists in supporting dictators throughout the world.
It leads one of the most tyrannical regimes in the world, where no sham election and where the contrary opinions are suppressed instantly.
Under his reign, Libya has supported terrorist organisations throughout the world, the IRA to many Palestinian extremist groups.
It always has the United Nations sanctions for the role in the attack against a flight Pan Am above Lockerbie in Scotland, ten years ago.
Over the last decade, the position of the United Nations as a symbol of the ideals of a peaceful world community has regularly been undermined.
They have proved completely unable to stop the war in the Balkans and at least one case, Srebrenica, Dutch forces of the UN peacekeeping remained and attended the worst massacre in post-war Europe while the Bosnian Serbs slaughtered around 6 000 Muslims defenceless.
A Dutch committee of inquiry has admitted later that the Dutch battalion of the UN was, in fact, complicit in this war crime.
In Rwanda, when the genocide has started, the representative of the UN responsible for peacekeeping ordered the evacuation of the United Nations forces in the country, leaving the door to genocide the bloodiest since the Second World War.
The name of this representative of the UN is Kofi Annan.
This is a depressing past and pathetic that the UN, probably trying in vain, to buy appearing in the Iraq crisis, as the voice of reason and the international legitimacy.
But at a time when the UN inspections in Iraq resemble the sending of the Hailing Army to remove a bunch of criminals, it may be that the election of Libya at the head of the Commission on Human Rights remains an historic date, the definitive failure of an organisation whose creation had raised an immense hope.
The organisations not usually die, and certainly there is too much to state not to ensure that the UN continue to obstacle.
But they will be mere shadow of what they should and could be.
The UN today give the hypocrisy a bad reputation.
As supporters of the authority
Last Thursday, the central court judges in Jakarta in Indonesia have condemned to a year in prison.
I am guilty, on editor of Tempo Newsmagazine Weekly, according to the Court, slander Tomy Winata tycoon of business, for having implied its possible involvement in a fire market textiles to Southeast Asia in Jakarta and instigating the riots in disseminating lies.
My case and other similar cases présagent-ils once more the end of a short democratic experiment in Indonesia?
The 'riots that I instigated occurred in March last year, when nearly 200 thugs calling Winata attacked Tempo offices, threatening to inflaming the building, pressing staff and injuring a journalist.
To try to resolve the situation peacefully, I was persuaded to negotiate central police office in Jakarta and découvris horrified that the leaders of the clique took power as police.
I was struck of foot and blows up while the police valise do.
Fortunately, many journalists came to our rescue with magnétophones and cameras for registering these events.
The spread of these images prompted the public outrage forced and the parliament to open a public enquiry.
Those responsible for the national police and police in Jakarta were called and strong pressure from public opinion, the leaders of this clique were charged.
However, Winata itself échappa to the police investigation simply by saying publicly that its supporters way--assisted without informing and without its agreement.
It complaint himself later, against Ahmad Taufik, the author of Article Teuku Iskandar Ali, the editor and myself.
The hearings of the trial durèrent a year were marked by a series of suspects developments all in favour Winata.
Firstly, the issue highlighted by the police and the prosecutor contained documents so clearly falsified that the police inculpa two officers.
But the Court rejected our request for suspension of hearings until the clarification of the legality of the issue of prosecutor.
The issue against officers involved seems to lead nowhere.
On the contrary, one of them has been promoted at the head of the new anti-terrorist unit in Jakarta that has been created (and is funded by the US).
The other, they say, been referred to school of police to receive a specialist training.
Then, after six months of hearings, the main judge the panel of the three judges suddenly was promoted to the head of a local court at a time in Jakarta.
One of my lawyers noted that 35 years of practice in court, he had never seen a judge main be replaced ongoing affair.
In fact, despite its promotion, the judge presiding continued to another matter in the same building.
A judge who in the past had ruled against Tempo during the civilian trial by Winata came replaced.
Finally, Winata, during her testimony, submitted a false testimony denying have been interviewed by Tempo.
A registration of the telephone was distributed during the hearings, the journalist having achieved the maintenance and the two draftsmen assistèrent témoignèrent under oath, the telephone company began the official documents attesting to this telephone call as proof of its existence of experts and attestèrent that the voice of registration was Tomy Winata.
However, the judges rejected the Tempo request the arrest of Winata to be judged for false evidence and conseillèrent to complain to the police, something that we made.
The judges have rejected our request for postponement of the decision of the Court until the matter of false testimony of Mr Winata tried.
Given all these defects of form, my condemnation and prison are hardly surprising.
But I trusts to win in when the appeal of Tempo be brought before higher bodies.
The Indonesian higher courts are more respectful of ethics and the director of the Supreme Court is a defender of democracy and freedom of expression. about Tempo could become a decisive step for our democracy, like the famous Supreme Court decision of the US in the case of New York Times against 'Sullivan.
By having raised the tolerance threshold in the charges against defamation, this decision has enabled the American press to claim those responsible to account of public affairs.
No country knows better than Indonesia that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are the indicators tested democratic development and the criminalisation of journalists is one of the first symptoms of authoritarianism.
Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the 1950s, before the gagging of the press by President Sukarno, helped the military junta in 1956.
Any criticism was stifled, the consolidation of power without against power was easy, and in July 1959, Sukarno answer declare the beginning of the "Democracy" enlightened.
For the first few years which followed the fall of Sukarno in 1966, all the benefits of real democracy, including the freedom of the press, were restored (except for the Communists).
However, the regime of President Suharto also began in the gagging of the press in the early 1970s, by suspending various newspapers and by imprisoning many journalists.
The press gagged and other political rights were violated quickly and the Indonesian democracy disparut again.
Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the first democratic Muslim community of history.
free, fair and peaceful elections were held twice for the election of parliament and the direct election of the President, including the last elections Présidentiel, demonstrating the possible co-existence between Islam and democracy.
The enemies of democracy never, however, are based.
Islamic extremist groups started bomb attacks without distinction, while the groups authoritarian tendencies uttered a breakthrough in close circles of President Megawati.
But Mrs Megawati has just lost the recent elections Présidentielles.
Susilo, the new President elected, continue to persecute journalists?
My condemnation, and the trials and condemnations of other journalists, marquera-t-elle the beginning of the end of the third Indonesian democracy won so badly?
The answer lies in the support that the Indonesian democrats activists will generate domestically and internationally.
Losing Indonesia, potential beacon of hope for all democrats activists in the Muslim world community, would be a terrible defeat.
The moral of the death penalty
It is often accused the US their refusal to abolish the death penalty.
Many today to pretend that the abolition of the death penalty is a necessary condition for establishing a civilised system of criminal law.
The Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker is not this view.
The European governments are resolutely opposed to the death penalty -- the European Union completely banned, and some Europeans consider that its use the US is part of barbarism.
In fact, many European intellectuals believe that the death penalty, and any penalty in general, not deterring criminals.
But, while Europeans, with crime rates well below those in the United States during the last half-century, have long afford a certain "soft" for the majority of crimes, have seen their crime rate increase brutal during the last twenty years.
On the contrary, the American rates have fallen in part due to the increased use of retribution.
The death penalty in part.
I am for the implementation of certain persons accused of murder because, and for this reason alone, I believe that it prevents other murders.
If I do not, I would be opposed to the death penalty, because revenge and other possible incentives should not serve basis of public policy.
The serious empirical research on capital punishment in the US began with a study of Isaac Ehrlich, published in 1975 in the American Economic Review.
Some studies that have followed sometimes have discovered a power of deterrence weaker, other much more powerful.
However, the available information are quite limited, it must therefore not its conclusions based solely on the econometric evidence.
Clearly, the public policy for retribution cannot evidence perfect.
But even with the limited quantitative evidence available, good reasons to believe in deterrent power of the death penalty are sufficient.
Most people, and the murderers in particular, fear of death, especially when it follows promptly and almost inexorably perpetration of murder.
As David Hume said about the suicide, "no man has never rejected the life until it worth experienced.
That is our horror of natural death 'Schopenhauer believed that "when the horrors of life reach the point where they exceed the horrors of death, a man puts an end to his life.
But the terrors of death resisting a considerable resistance... "
Opponents of the death penalty often proclaim that the state has no right, morally, to take the lives of anyone, even the most murderous reprehensible.
But it is an entirely wrong conclusion to draw for that the death penalty is deterrent.
To see why, read that for every murderer executed, instead, say, sentenced to prison for life) the number of murders should be reduced to three, which is less than the figure of Ehrlich and other estimates of the effect of deterrence.
This means that for every murderer not yet implemented, three victims are going to die.
In fact, the government would 'indirectly many lives if he did not use of the death penalty.
Saving three innocent lives for each person executed seems a very attractive market, and two lives saved by implementation seems a cost/benefit ratio persuasive in favour of the death penalty.
But agree that the argument in favour of the death penalty becomes less clear-cut when the number of lives saved every execution fall.
But even if one lives were saved every execution, the market can still be desirable if the life saved is much better than life abolished, which is usually the case.
Many protesting to compare the qualities of life saved and is deleted.
Yet I do not see how to avoid such a comparison.
Take the case of a criminal wheel career and killing a victim who led a proper life and leaves several children and a partner behind it.
There that it is possible to save the life of an innocent victim executing a criminal of this kind.
It seems obvious to me that save the lives of such a victim must have more influence that take the criminal.
Obviously, all the cases are not as clear, but a comparison of the qualities of the individual lives must be part of any reasonable social policy.
This is also why the death penalty should be used for the murders and not for less serious crimes.
When it comes to choose between take lives and, for example, reducing flights of private goods, the theory of the soft punishment is much more powerful.
Although serious aggression, including some appalling rape, sometimes approaching murders in their seriousness, and could call the death penalty, I am not for its use in this type of case.
One of the main arguments to reserve the death penalty murder 'marginal deterrence. "
If the attacks were punished by the death penalty, pushing the aggressors to kill their victims not be discovered (which is a major reason for the severity of punishment is proportionate to the seriousness of the crime).
The complications could be a deadly fight with more offensive to avoid being caught, which could provoke more deaths.
But, although the marginal deterrence is important, I believe that the murderous resistance to their catches, sometimes to the detriment of their own lives, really is an indirect evidence that criminals fear the death penalty.
Naturally, the risk of implementing innocent worries me.
My support for the death penalty faiblirait much if the rate of implementation of innocent people was as much claim.
However, I believe that the appeal the US offer an enormous protection, not so much against unfair sentences against unfair executions, so that there is very little or no to executed people proved that they were innocent.
And this situation has been immensely consolidated by the development of the identification by the DNA.
I once again that the debate around the death penalty is a debate on the power of deterrence (which can be reduced by too much appeals).
I can understand that some remain sceptical before the existing evidence, although I think they are wrong to and on the question of good sense of the problem.
It is very disturbing to take the lives of someone, even a murderer, but sometimes extremely disagreeable acts are needed to prevent even worse behaviour causing the deaths of innocent victims.
The people against Putin
I contributed to the choice of Vladimir Putin to succeed the first democratically elected president, Boris Yeltsin.
Given that such structures lead the KGB and the Mafia Russia today and manipulate the judicial system, it is accepted that Yeltsin wanted to choose his successor to avoid prosecution.
But we, who have chosen, Putin were responsible for finding a successor suited to continue the reforms initiated by Yeltsin, and not someone who protect him and his family.
Yeltsin was afraid of nothing and not thought to its own survival, but the survival of the democratic idea that he introduced in Russia.
This idea is now threatened by the successor that we have chosen.
I am not seeking to deny the responsibility of my support Putin.
We were not intimate friends, but and myself have worked together in critical situations, and I have never doubted his sincerity.
Putin is under its convictions.
The problem is that its convictions, including the belief that Russia cannot flourish if it is headed by a single source of power, are wrong.
And this great mistake is Russia to ruin its policy.
Clearly, nobody can take a post high responsibilities without committing misconceptions, even fundamental mistakes, and it is particularly true when times are confused.
Yeltsin no exception, but he acknowledged its mistakes.
When he withdrew on 31 December 1999, he apologized for triggered the war in Chechnya.
Putin, however, seems unable to acknowledge and to admit mistakes, and persists in a political long after its failure becomes apparent in the eyes of the world.
One of the errors of Yeltsin was its failure to put moral priorities at the top of its programme of reforms.
Russia should repent of Stalinism and the system of gulags.
The whole nation, without exception, should repent, as the Germans have done since 1945.
This failure account, because it has allowed the unconditional faith of Putin in the central authority leads to a new capture of the state by the security services.
Indeed, a direct consequences of national repentance should be alienated the Communist Party and the disqualification of political office of those who have worked for the KGB.
Even if such tris policies are not simple post-communist societies, where victims and collaborators were so many, and the border between the two sometimes so vague, a viable solution would have been found, as in the Czech Republic.
The choice to do nothing has left the Russian security structures of unscathed and able to make their return on the political scene, what they have received today.
The political resurrection of KGB structures under Putin, and their efforts to silence the dissidences, have again transformed Russia in a country transfuges.
It is impossible to silence the politicians and the independent media without stifling independent financial sources, which explains that the Kremlin to Putin focused its attacks on the so-called "oligarchs'.
The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his trial have been orchestrated precisely for this reason.
By abolishing independent financial sources, the security services which dominate the Kremlin hoped destroy the independent political life in Russia.
Without bases of independent thought, is a climate of fear that is practised.
But the fear is not only degrading, it does not govern.
Yeltsin intuitively understood that fear and centralised decision-making and top-down cannot be the way to lead a modern country, and it was therefore pressed for reforming the relations between the citizens and the state.
Putin still does not understand that a centralized political system is also unable to understand and correcting today than it was in the Soviet era.
Lacking a sound education, Putin is sincere about Russia towards the same disintegration that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet state.
The people beginning to realize.
He notes that Putin's desire to create a modern state solid and effective can achieve, because a modern state is governed not above, but by informed citizens forcing their leaders to recognise and correct their mistakes.
Putin, too, seems accuse the powerlessness of his regime.
This is one of the reasons that have made Russia if aggressive with its neighbours, Ukraine and Georgia, and the push to maintain a military presence in places like Transdniestria, the secessionist region of Moldova.
By imposing in neighbouring regions of Russia, the Kremlin thinks it can persuade the Russians to his omnipotence.
Given that the debates in Russia are châtrés and that the Kremlin is able to manipulate the elections, a change of regime is the only solution that it remains to preserve the idea of democracy.
It is pointless to cling to illusions.
Those who oppose Putin must decide what they want and announce that if the regime fails to enforce the constitution, they have the right to force through.
Today, the question of power in Russia can no longer decide to the polls.
As in Ukraine, Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan, it will decide in the streets.
Imposez and use (SVP)
Excessive taxation can dampen the encouragement and hinder the growth.
But insufficient taxation can also produce the same effects.
The governments with a feeble tax revenue cannot provide the essential public goods.
Worse still, low tax revenue in poor countries often result of inherent defects systems of tax collection (rather than low rates of taxation) which encourage also productivity.
India illustrates the importance of a fiscal system designed.
In Bangalore, companies of high technology have built class campuses international extant grasslands flawless and communication networks of high-speed data.
Outside these campuses, however, extend open sewers, not collected rubbish and roads in a state of advanced decay.
While the technology companies pass instantly of data téraoctets distant continents, local transport advance almost medieval pace.
Consequently, companies to Bangalore exploit their own bus services, contracting-out with private providers for drinking water, and install generators to protect themselves against power failures.
The state cannot compensate for this disaster because it is bankrupt.
The government debt of India exceeds 70% of GNP for more than half of its tax devoted to the reimbursement of interests.
But the debt is not excessive expenditure in the past.
The government expenditures in India represent around 15% of GNP, against an average of around 40% of the GNP of the OECD.
The financial difficulties in India rather cause for a tax system ill-conceived and badly handled.
The rates and rules for income tax of individuals and businesses seem reasonable by international standards.
Nevertheless, the Government of India receives income tax representative only around 3.7% of GNP, or approximately half of the South Korea and other Asian tigers.
Agriculture in India approximately one quarter of GNP, but even the rich farmers do not pay taxes.
The exporting companies in the software industry and other industries enjoy a temporary exemption on their profits, although their employees pay taxes on their personal income.
Despite reasonable rates, tax fraud is commonplace.
Fraud is explained by the fact that the government has not invested in the staff or systems to discover the intractable taxpayers, who are rarely in prison and which can often out of business paying bribes when they are taken.
More subtly still escape direct taxes' income and benefits reflects disorder inherent in the system of "indirect" taxes on the production and consumption.
The excise duties represent more than 60% of indirect taxes in India, which in turn represent the same proportion of its total tax revenues.
The excise duty base has been set at 16% of the value of the production of a company.
Suivent then various cuts, exemptions and arable.
For example, a 'rate of law of for "8% is deducted from categories such as food products, spirits, cotton sons and computers.
A "special excise duty" additional 8% is deducted from products which include filaments polyester, cars, air conditioners and tyres.
A "additional excise duty" (not confused with the 'special excise duty ") is deducted from" products of special importance. "
The exemptions from excise duties are many and complex, including the companies with the total annual incomes below 10 million rupees and companies in certain areas or turbulent backward.
In general, exemptions fall into 70 broad categories, sous-divisées themselves 259 entries, 52 conditions and 7 lists, each containing many elements.
The exemptions incite abuse.
To a certain sum, officials located at the bottom of the hierarchy, which shows an exemplary discretion in the application of conditions, can be encouraged to give favourable interpretations.
The products imposed high rates (for example, the polite boulder) are sold as products taxed at lower levels, such as not polite boulder).
Fraud on excise duty is more infectious than tax evasion on income and profits.
If a company fraud excise duty and high rates of taxation on profit before taxes in the industry, its competitors must also cheat simply to survive.
While fraud increases, the governments of collecting rights "additional" or "special" who encourage greater fraud.
The perceptions of direct taxes also suffer.
The bribe paid the man of excise duty for a favourable classification, the difference between the value of granite polite and not polite, and the omission of registration of real income create money "black 'which cannot be declared on forms of declaration of income.
In addition to weaken the ability of the state to provide essential public goods, systems to escape the indirect taxes discourage companies to adopt technologies more productive, which requires technology involving deploying large scale.
But as indirect taxes can be more easily circumvented by deploying many small units instead of one great unity, it is impossible to achieve economies of scale.
It is important to note that in the software industry, where all units are exempt indirect taxes, Indian companies operate on a scale effective.
India could imitate the example of China, a country in which the rationalisation of indirect taxes in 1994 has prepared the ground for a great boom?
Or the coalition governments in a vigorous democracy are incapable of such a reform?
Last year, the government led by the BJP India enacted legislation authorising considerable cuts in the budget deficit.
It was then appointed a working party to make the necessary changes to policies of public spending and tax policies.
In July, the working group has proposed to raise taxes (rather than to reduce expenditure) by removing the majority of exemptions of indirect taxes, among other things.
The new government led by Congress in India is also promote these proposals.
If the Congress and the opposition parties, they follow much help to support the country's economic growth and to dispel the idea that democracies cannot take the necessary measures to encourage the development.
What is the problem with Turkey?
On 16 December, Orhan Pamuk, one of the most notorious Turkish authors, will have to face a court in Istanbul, but must respond to the charge of "insult to national identity" in favour of an open discussion on the genocide by the Turks of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and vintage.
Pamuk prepared three years in prison.
Turkey's efforts to impose fines and sentences to those who go beyond the official framework convince me that I had reason to oppose the opening of negotiations on the accession of this country to the European Union.
In December 1999, the European Council has given Turkey candidate status of the EU, which meant that Turkey would come in the Union to a future date not yet.
The Council then asked the European Commission to decide before October 2004 if Turkey fulfilled the political criteria for accession, which include democracy, the rule of law and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities.
This decision was one of the last taken by the Commission of Romano Prodi, which I was a member.
Among his 30 members, 29 have stated that Turkey fulfilled in sufficient criteria to continue.
I was the only dissident.
It is the same report from the Commission on Turkey, prepared by Günter Verheugen, then to the enlargement of the EU, which led my decision.
This report mentioned in 2003, approximately 21 870 Turks have asked for asylum in the EU, including 2 127 have been accepted.
In other words, the EU governments themselves have recognised in 2003 that the Turkish Government had persecuted more than 2 000 of its own citizens.
In the meantime, the Commission has published a progress report on Turkey believing that the reforms pursued, although at a slower rate, under the government orientation moderately Islamic Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
This report was nevertheless serious doubts: violations of human rights, including torture, continued military influence retained too scale; freedom of expression was not universally observed; non-Islamic religious minorities and cultural were victims of discrimination and violence against women do not meet sufficiently strong opposition.
The situation has not changed much since the talks on accession have started in October.
Beyond the persecution which Pamuk is currently the victim, the unacceptable behaviour abound.
In March 2005, the police violently intervened in a demonstration celebrating International Women's Day.
In May, the largest teacher union has been banned for having supported the education of 14 million Kurds in Turkey in their own language.
It is undeniable that intolerance reached summits of the Turkish Government.
The Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül has recently brutal cancelled a press conference in Copenhagen when he detect a Kurdish journalist in the public that the Danes have refused to get.
Such acts and such attitudes justify my disagreement largely in October 2004.
But even if these shortcomings were corrected, Turkey should not be permitted in the EU, because this is not a European country.
Christianity, the feudality, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, democracy and the industrialisation that we Europeans, but they were not Turks what they are.
I am not convinced that reforms in Turkey, implemented due to the insistence of the European Commission, would be continued after accession.
I suspect that there would be re-offending.
Furthermore, the accession of Turkey would certainly to Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and perhaps Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia.
These first three countries are certainly more European than Turkey.
By leaving aside the three Caucasus republics but including the successor states to Yugoslavia, it would give an EU of approximately 35 members.
What kind of Union even?
The EU is not simply a club of friends.
It is based on the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people.
The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties of the European Union, must protect these four basic freedoms, which means that it must persuade sometimes and, if necessary, forcing the member states to change their laws.
The policies on alcohol, loi-Volkswagen in Germany and discrimination against funds of foreign investment in France are examples of cases which have made the Commission unpopular.
But they were necessary.
At the time when I left the Commission, I back me a pile of 1 500 irregularities findings of this style.
In short, the EU means accepting incisive measures which profoundly affect the internal affairs of a state.
This prove impossible with members as disparate.
The EU fall victim of the historian Paul Kennedy called "imperial surextension."
It dilute an unacceptable way.
It is for this reason that the former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing feared that Turkey does at the end of the EU, and that is why the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: 'Turkey would be more than the EU could withstand. "
But the greater reason to oppose the accession of Turkey is a question of democracy: the majority of the population of the EU is simply not.
The Crisis Bolivian failure, Latin America
Bolivia is not a typical countries in Latin America, far from there.
And if it were Haitian unrest, it would be the poorest country in the Western hemisphere: it is even less stable that Haiti as shows its history and its two hundred coups since its independence.
In a region in the past indigenous strong, but now dispersed and isolated, Bolivia is perhaps with Guatemala, the only country in Latin America, where indigenous peoples represent the majority of the population.
Its topography and its distribution ethnic generate autonomous forces and secessionist which threaten national unity of most provocative manner everywhere.
It is, of course, with Paraguay, the only country in the subcontinent denied access to the sea.
Thus, it would be prudent to extrapolate the current crisis Bolivia to Latin America.
The generalisation would be far too simplistic: elsewhere, the institutions are stronger, poverty, and particularly the misery, has been reduced and the struggles of ownership of natural resources have been generally resolved.
Even in countries such as Venezuela, which has enormous reserves of oil and which has a nationalist government with traditional, the status quo maintained has enabled the preservation of foreign investment during the almost eight years of government of President Hugo Chavez.
Even if the existence of indigenous movement is a reality in many countries, since the Chiapas to 'Araucania', the Amazon until Ayacucho, they have never asked any real threat to national integrity in any country in Latin America.
Thus, Bolivia is not experiencing a crisis an omen, nor the eternal 'domino theory', which Lyndon Jonhson and Guevarra Che both believed in the case of Bolivia, seems valid or even partially reasonable.
However, the current crisis in Bolivia shows the finger "democratic deficit" afflicting Latin America.
The elected leaders are put into failure somehow in Bolivia, Ecuador and in Haiti.
Democracy is failing or absent in Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua and is threatened pure reason or another in Colombia and Venezuela.
None of these cases is like to another and they include all different degrees of danger, destruction and reconciliation.
The question is what can be done against this problem, which severely contrasts with the encouraging prospects that have prevailed until in recent years.
At the last meeting of the Organisation of American States held in Fort Lauderdale in Florida, the US delegation has borrowed a good idea provided by others and simply enshrined in its support.
History has started two years earlier when Caputo Dante, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Argentina and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) were responsible for preparing a report on democracy in Latin America.
Their conclusions indicated that an early-warning system of democratic crises in the region help to generate certain actions before any loss of control, as is the case with Bolivia today.
Mr Caputo and the UNDP team had then convinced the Chilean President Ricardo Lagos, to deal with the initiative and to promote with many of his colleagues.
What he has done without the initiative goes very far.
In fact, the UNDP report on democracy in Latin America, published in 2004, barely mentioned.
The US and the new Secretary-General of the OAS, Jose Miguel Insulza relaunched at the meeting of the OAS in Florida, but it was killed by reasonable fears of Latin Americans believe that this action against Venezuela, associated with anachronistic fears of Latin Americans on the violation of the sacrosanct principle of not intervention.
Despite the impossibility for the continent to agree on the principle, the idea of an early-warning system deserves to be studied.
Today, the Latin American community has probably little possibility of intervention on the Bolivian situation, and yet it is dangerous for everyone.
Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and growers of coca leaf, is perhaps an honest democratic leader, somewhat unwise, but its supporters are all available authoritarian will?
Hugo Chavez may not finance Mr Morales and other dissidents Bolivia, but Venezuela and Cuba are not tempted to meddle in the affairs of this country where Guevarra Che died at the head of the guerillas almost 40 years earlier?
The business community of Santa Cruz in Bolivia may not give following its threats of secession, but préfèreront-ils share the reserves of oil and natural gas in their region with indigenous peoples from highland rather than industrial Brazilian of São Paulo?
Before the events reach extreme, it would perhaps be a good that the OAS (and not the United States) interfering.
The region continues to need this participation, in terms of time, message and proper democratic platform, separate from the traditional American intervention and the usual indifference of Latin America.
The decline in France?
The French are notoriously sensitive, not to say on the defensive, about the scale of France abroad.
The French state devotes a significant amount to the spread of the French language and culture, but the French are painfully aware that the global position of their country is no longer what it was.
In this context, it is not surprising that during the last presidential elections, the publication of a report by the European Commission stating that the economic status of France among the European countries was 3
The OECD and Eurostat, the European body to unite these data, thought put a stop to this aspect of the debate in demonstrating that France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain were all levels of life almost identical per.
But the controversy on a larger scale has not gone away.
Concern rumours on the French 'decline' reappearance of protest marches which took place this year against pension reform, the growing differences on fiscal policy with the European Commission and the squabbling with America on the war in Iraq.
The book romancé not win a great success in France at the moment is an argument written by Nicolas Baverez, France which falls.
The Baverez book is full of quotations Gaulle of Napoleon.
According to the author, the latest achievements of France go back to the 1970s, with the rapid train, the TGV, and the Airbus.
It severely critical Mitterrand and Chirac gathered by a common 'talent to win the elections and make France a loser. "
The success of the book is in itself a sign of 'malaise.
But what?
The evidence of degeneration made by Baverez are not convincing it wants to believe.
For example, it cites the exhaustion of industrial jobs as the most flagrant evidence of the decline in France.
But the deindustrialisation reality is a common to all advanced countries.
Indeed, France gets better results than most of its competitors rich neighbours and, unlike Germany, the UK or the US, it has maintained the same global market in the industrial sector as it owned in the early 1970s.
Moreover, according to a more precise measure of competitiveness and foreign investment, France has achieved excellent results in these areas.
According to a recent report published by the Council of economic analysis, direct investment in France went EUR 60 billion in 2001, almost twice that Germany.
The French competitiveness of costs is also improved (20%) in the last three decades, higher productivity counteracting the rapid growth of wages.
But the heart of economic problems in the long term France lies precisely in the fear of losing the industrial jobs.
France remains a strong industrial power in traditional sectors such as the automobile and the aerospace, but it is lagging behind in innovative markets in which smaller businesses disseminate new technologies.
France, for example, spends only 30 billion dollars per year in research and development of advanced technologies, against 51 billion dollars for Germany, 98 billion dollars for Japan and 265 billion dollars for the US.
In short, the analysis of Baverez in the wrong direction.
France has several extremely important reforms on the last two decades: the financial and economic liberalisation, the elimination of controls of prices and exchange, the end of credit restrictions, European liberalisation, the reduction of inflationary and trade deficits, the advent of the euro and the forced globalisation of businesses in the country.
The French malaise has certainly not been caused by these reforms.
The problem of France has just what it has failed to recognise the new world it is already part.
The French capitalism is dead and France does not accept its disappearance.
France must be the only country in which a prime minister, Lionel Jospin, felt obliged to apologise after having said on the television that "the state is not all-powerful '.
There are several reasons for this schizophrenia French, but the most important of them concerns the political game of the past 20 years.
Until in 1981, France was clearly divided between left and right.
Since this period, Chirac and Mitterand administrations have blunt their ideological side in order to implement the difficult process of adapting to Europe and globalisation.
A "Shock therapy" Mrs. Thatcher two decades ago could have forge a new political awareness.
But the slow and consensual passage of reforms has enabled the French to live in a world and to think in another.
This matter explained largely political upheaval which has exploded during the last presidential campaign, when the leader of the extreme right Jean-Marie Le Pen has reached the second round of the presidential elections before the outgoing prime minister, Lionel Jospin.
The rise of the extreme Left, which has brought 10% of the vote during this presidential campaign, also testifies to the political failure.
France needs a political revolution much more than an economic revolution if it wants to come to accept the reality, especially the French 'decline' is a fear created by the French people.
The value of European values
European leaders have incorporated the constitutional discussions which had expired in December following a dispute about voting rights.
These debates must of course lead to compromises, which cannot delay.
It remains to be clear what are the objectives of the supposed constitution.
Two fundamental principles prevailed in European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity.
These two principles occur at the crossroads of the philosophy, politics, the economy, and the sociology of law.
For years, they were part of the legal and institutional structure of the European Union, in the treaties, in the Charter of Rights Fondamentaux (which quote in its preamble) and in the recent draft Constitution.
To summarise, they are enshrined in the history and the ideals of the EU.
But what is the real significance of these two principles?
Take solidarity, which is prepared to two interpretations at least: the static solidarity, which only concerns the distribution of income and wealth, and the broader concept of solidarity dynamic, which relates to the production of income and wealth.
In the post-war history of European integration, the dynamic solidarity shown strongly during the first period, the European Coal and Steel Community, both in its economic development strategy) reconstruction in the Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome.
This does not mean that the dynamic solidarity was subsequently deleted: the European Monetary Union, perfectly expresses this principle.
Thus, although some countries have not immediately benefited from the euro, they have nevertheless accepted because they were convinced that he would have positive effects on the long term.
In other words, the dynamic solidarity means encouraging policies that encourage investment, innovation, economic growth and employment.
However, as indicates the growth of GDP in the EU, the dynamic solidarity has been shaken during the last decade.
The discrepancy between research and development is a particularly worrying.
The implementation of the so-called Lisbon strategy of the EU, adopted in 2000 with the promise of creating the most competitive economy in the world, is threatened by the growing importance attached to the static solidarity, which is reflected in the high costs of social assistance and high taxes needed to its financing.
The primacy of static solidarity is due to an ageing population which, together with a sluggish growth, has resulted in tax structural imbalances.
One of the greatest challenges posed to become the EU is to address the predominance of the current static solidarity, which is orientated towards the elderly, at the expense of the dynamic solidarity, which favours the young.
After all, the Union cannot allow the current consumption continues to prevail over the investment needed for the future prosperity.
Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity that her interpretation is twofold: the vertical subsidiarity and the horizontal subsidiarity.
The vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of powers between the various levels of government and sovereignty: the EU, national states, regions and municipalities.
The most application known of this principle is federalism.
The European Treaties clearly this vertical subsidiarity.
But is it enough to include the institutional framework and constitutional emerging of the Union?
The horizontal subsidiarity concerns the responsibility and the freedom of human beings and on the social and economic powers.
It covers relations between the state, society and the market.
But society and the market have their own rights and their own sovereignty which are not granted by the state.
Surgit then the following problem: how to guarantee the autonomy of each kingdom?
Examples of horizontal subsidiarity the European internal market, which has created a new type of economic freedom and has increased competition between companies eliminating the protection that national governments offer them.
The horizontal subsidiarity means that in society and in the economic sphere, the state cannot violate individual freedom and responsibility, which must be respected at the highest possible level.
It also means that a higher "power" must support whenever the individual freedom and responsibility are not enough to achieve the objectives required to human dignity.
This support must be required to methods which promote natural potential of individuals, society and the market.
But this is possible only if the role of the horizontal subsidiarity is clear, which has not been the case in the European treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights or the work of the European Convention.
To summarise, the solidarity now involves a redistribution rather than growth (as the current generation expresses the solidarity with future generations), while the subsidiarity concerns the distribution of political power rather than a prudent definition of borders between the state, civil society and the market.
At present, these two values are defined in such a way as to facilitate the state.
Indeed, the emphasis on growth geared towards the market has often been identified with the values of America semi-étrangères.
But these values are deeply ingrained in Europe and they must be uprooted again.
The EU must restore its economic vitality in pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity more balanced in favour of the market and of society, which reduce the socio-economic impact of the state.
The public institutions must produce public assets (such as defence, justice and monetary and fiscal policy), society must offer social goods (such as culture, education and aid to the needy) and the market must produce economic goods (linked to profits, growth and employment).
In the 21st century, Europe must review the value of these two principles (solidarity and subsidiarity) if it is to achieve the historic objective of integration: freedom and prosperity required to overcome the differences and political divisions that have brought tragedies in the 20th century.
That is the spirit in which must be developed the European Constitution.
The policy of values
The debate on the US elections has still not wavered.
How President George W. Bush been able to three million votes that Senator John Kerry, and offer a Republican majority two chambers of Congress?
It gives little on the answers, but are two recurring themes in many explanations.
One of these issues is keen to his personality.
In our era full of uncertainty and threat, the citizens have placed their trust in a president they knew rather than a candidate have not yet delivered.
The second is that of values.
The citizens have voted for a set of values rather than for specific policies.
Indeed, some (told) agree with the policies of Kerry yet made their voices to Mr Bush because they felt "comfortable" with all its attitude.
It is clear that the United States are now deeply divided into electoral terms.
A ark states blue) democrats in the east, the North and the West is spreading around a huge area red) Republican centre and the south.
Beyond the geographical division, the divisions recur at local level.
The electoral gerrymandering, this practice of retraçage electoral borders to promote a political party at the expense of another, is no longer necessary.
The voters tend to moved in areas where the majority of people share their values, whether republican or democrats.
What are these values exactly?
These are the values which deal with, we are told, "god, arms and gays."
Religion plays a role, particularly with the truths within the Bible in the creation.
The possession of a weapon is the ultimate test of the individualism and the use of weapons of war is not odious.
The gay and other practices modern 'are rejected, because navel-gazing.
As the political scientist Andrew Hacker said recently, "the candidature of Mr Bush has been built to forming a majority in giving 60 million voters the chance to feel good in themselves."
All this phenomenon is therefore an American or there are other trends elsewhere?
A answers wants as American phenomenon, the policy of values can collate a majority today but in no case general.
Europe and other regions of the world are divided in the same way.
The personality account without doubt, and under the obvious political differences are also questions of values which have not yet been highlighted.
However, the traditional political differences based on the disagreement on fundamental values play an increasingly important role in the elections.
Prime Minister Tony Blair, for example, another leader facing an election in his country, plays the map of the personality and speaks of policies, but above all represents a set of values of middle class.
When he speaks of 'modernising' or 'to enter the twenty-first century', it manages to suggest a strange mixture but attractive for change and stability.
This leaves the conservative opposition without any effective response.
Even the issues of tax cuts and asylum stricter fail to fly on the ropes tune of values that the Republican Party has managed to get the USA.
The situation is the same in Germany, where the influence of the obvious political values is even less.
The debate in Germany, still remains in its most political debate.
When the opposition offers the government to negotiate the reform of social protection or, more recently, to combat unemployment, the underlying challenge is not in terms of values but competence.
However, in the fields of traditional battles of the political debate English or German, or elsewhere in Europe, clashs values threaten.
The parties fighting for those who "can feel comfortable in their own place ', but they may not understand very well that this is only partly a question of policy.
Religion will never be an important factor in European policy: opinion polls show that religious practice remains one of the few main differences between Americans and Europeans.
The weapons also occupy a different place in European minds: it is their absence that Europeans regard as important.
Europe also live without doubt a possible course of peaceful values.
And the question of political correctness (gays') also plays a lesser role so far in Europe.
Above all, Europe itself divides Europeans, because the "national question 'is present in all the European states.
It is a question of values inspired by fear.
The citizens want to know where they stand and, in the wake, go against the US and towards Europe or against Europe and towards their own countries.
In all ways, then we leave the kingdom of policies and of politics and enter the field wetlands symbols and myths.
This, in any case, represents the greatest danger which democracies must face, because the politics of values is a dangerous development.
It reintroduces the fundamental divisions of a society in which the greatest democratic success was precisely to banish the fundamentalism of political life.
A Informed public debate must be a discussion on the policies contained by a community of values.
It is therefore essential to insist on this objective of the policy of freedom.
The advent of the interest
A swallow does not make the spring and one month of normal growth of employment and price increase in the US does not mean that the Federal Reserve fear a malaise and economic deflation.
But the time will come when the global interest rates begin to increase as the central bankers are preparing to resist the wave of rising inflation.
When the time will come, this autumn, in 2005 or 2006, or in 2007, America and the world economy will face financial vulnerabilities which reflect the success of the past three years of monetary stimulation arresting the decline of production and curbing unemployment.
The short-term interest rates are surprisingly low: only 2% in the euro zone, just 1% in the US and Japan zero.
The expansionary monetary policy has proved to be a success, but only after having brought interest rates low levels and historical investors convinced that borrowing costs remain at their current levels long.
The monetary stimulus was mainly to increase asset prices: everything which produces a profit, dividends or rent becomes much more attractive, and therefore much more valuable in financial terms, when interest rates are very low and should remain.
This explains the huge differences between the current home prices in the US, ordinary actions in New York, London and Frankfurt, and obligations in the long term throughout the world and what should be conventionally, their fundamental values.
What when the central banks begin to increase their interest rates?
In 1994, the rise in interest rates in the short term has led to an increase in the rate in the long term - and a reduction in the price of obligations in the long term) at least double foreseen by the standard models this year.
The interest rate of peripheral developing economies have also increased rates of major advanced industrial countries.
The first danger for 2005 and for the years to come, when the global interest rates rise, as is very likely, is another wave of financial crises in emerging markets.
For countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the record of the 1990s shows that the differences of interest rates can grow and capital flows reversed remarkably quickly, whatever the degree of goodwill with which the representatives of the IMF and analyses carried out by the big banks regard the policies of a country.
The differences of interest rates emerging markets are currently abnormally low.
The international monetary flows, capital inflows exception in the US, levels are not yet associated with a "irrational exuberance", but chances to happen before interest rates begin to climb.
This prospect is alarming if there is a lesson of the 1990s, is that nobody should overestimate the stability of international financial flows.
The second danger of higher values comes from the active in the advanced industrial countries.
The dominant thinking within the Federal Reserve, which I fully endorse, maintains that the revolution of information technology continues, that the US potential production still very rapidly growing and that the output gap is thus relatively high.
This means that interest rates will certainly remain low for a relatively long time.
In addition, confidence in the Federal Reserve is large and the last remnants of the premium the risk of inflation in the 1970s contain no more interest rates.
Consequently, even after the levels of production are income levels to their potential, remain low interest rates according to the standards of the 1980s and 1990s.
All this is, of course, good news for all those who hold assets such as obligations in the long term, actions and property.
Indeed, the increase in the price of active in the long term was precisely what sought lower interest rates: to make the bond, and especially property owners, richer after all give a boost to expenditure.
But the bad news is that even if interest rates are expected to remain low for some time, they will not as low indefinitely.
The important thing is that when interest rates amount, the values of the active fall.
It is during these periods, especially when the values of the active considerably and rapidly falling, we discover fully the degree of competence of our central bankers in their main task: to reduce the financial volatility and promote economic stability.
It is also during these periods that we discover how individuals who hold obligations in the long term, property or actions hold not because they believe that the current prices are interesting of basic prices, but because their prices have increased over recent years.
It is a crucial issue for the political decision-makers because individuals who have bought active in the long term because the price seemed increase indefinitely are also those who sell as soon as the trend look reversed.
In particular, the US trade deficit indicate a massive instability in cases where asset prices in the long term should fall considerably.
It is true that the challenges ahead to decision-making economic policies of the world in the coming years diffèreront and they have since the collapse of the NASDAQ illusion.
The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those generated by a fall in production and the threat of deflation.
But, as we learned during the 1990s, that does not mean that the challenges ahead will be easier to resolve.
The Avenirs against America
I recently discovered a interesting: the American economists who deal with international finance and American macro dealing with the domestic economy have very different points of view -- indeed, opposed -- on the possible consequences of the huge US deficit.
Economists of international finance consider that a financial crisis is possible, followed by a painful recession and perhaps extended to the United States.
The macro which deal with domestic economy instead see next fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis but as an opportunity to accelerate growth.
The examine macro domestic economy generally consider the situation as follows: at a given time in the future, foreign central banks will be less inclined to pursue their purchases of massive dollar securities to support the Green ticket.
When they will end their programmes to buy dollar large scale, the value of the dollar will fall, and it will drop sharply.
And from this point of view, if the value of the dollar declining, American exports become more attractive for foreign markets and the labour market resume US labor being redirigée towards the new export sectors in full boom.
The situation will be comparable to that of Britain when it turned indexation of its exchange rates and gave the pound depreciate in the German mark, or what occurred in the US in the late 1980s when the dollar déprécia on the pound, and the mark -- particularly -- over the Japanese yen.
Economists of international finance describe a more gloomy future.
They consider that the end of programmes to buy dollar large scale by the central banks will lead not only the decline in the dollar, but also to a soaring rates of US long-term interests, which will immediately falling consumption and regulate investment expenditure after a short space of time.
Certainly, the economists of international finance also consider that the American exports benefit from the fall in the dollar but the imbalances calls are such that the outbreak of exports will be one or two years after the decline in consumption and investment expenditure.
Eight ten million people must go on services and the construction of the import-export sector of goods, which means that structural unemployment will increase.
In addition, perhaps attending financial panic: the large financial institutions with obligations short-term and long-term assets encounter difficulties to bear a sharp increase in long-term interest rates denominated in dollars.
This factor of inequality may some tension and financial bankruptcy as easily as those caused by the Mexican crisis and East Asia in the 1990s or the Argentine crisis of this decade for active in local currency and obligations dollar held that banks.
When the economists of international finance highlight this scenario, the macro specialised in the domestic economy meet their that resembles a case of incompetence in matters of monetary policy.
Why should the Federal Reserve allow the rise in long-term interest rates when foreign central banks their programmes cease to buy dollar?
Not should then intervene and take the baton by the purchase of the US Treasury obligation to long term, thus maintaining long-term interest rates at a satisfactory level to encourage full employment?
Economists of international finance usually meet that the Federal Reserve has the ability to do so.
Obligée to choose between full employment and price stability, according to them, the Federal Reserve choose the stability of prices, because its institutional memory of the 1970s and the escalation of inflation remains very powerful.
Thus, since the fall in the value of the dollar boosts import prices and functions as a negative impact on the supply side in the economic sector, the Federal Reserve will increase rather than reduce interest rates and therefore sell rather than buy the Treasury bonds.
Economists seriousness that I greatly respect find themselves to decide in opposing camps in this debate.
I am not wise enough to give some reason or other, but I certainly know what side see I hope.
The bad pupils of Europe
In the US, states which pursue fiscal policies misguided are penalised.
Their obligations sell watered-down compared with those of other states managed better.
The debt servicing more they must pay, serves to a degree of disciplinary measure against the temptation to spend today and to pay later.
Naturally, the discipline of the market is not perfect: the bond market does' not really passive implicit future (payments as promised pensions).
However, the application of this fiscal discipline, coupled with internal budgetary processes of each state, has prevented the occurrence of fiscal crisis in large the US since the Great Depression.
Consider the case of Europe.
Before the advent of the euro, many countries of Southern Europe suffering tax crises, producing high inflationary vague.
But with the introduction of the single currency, the road to resolve a fiscal crisis by inflation has been closed, since the European Central Bank (ECB) monitors monetary policy.
However, even if the nations can no longer rely on inflation to solve the imbalance of their finances, the single currency enables them to use the capacity for indebtedness which belongs to other members of the European Union to expand their madness wasteful and repel their political responsibility during periods of let the good time rolled 1] [sic].
It is to prevent this possibility that the EU has created the Stability and Growth Pact: the government budget deficit must not exceed 3% of GDP.
Last week, the German Government, once the European countries more cautious and disciplined fiscal, has breached the rules of the pact for the fifth year running, without really present (much) excuses.
The Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck has indicated that it expected that the European Commission apply sanctions against Germany: the credibility of the Pact, he says, would be jeopardised if there was any gesture.
Thus, Germany would not obstacle to sanctions this time, as was the case two and a half years ago.
But Steinbrueck has also expressed clearly that it expects a purely symbolic punishment in response to the budget deficit representative 3.4% of GDP, and not to penalties which would have a real cost for his government or its economy.
The Stability and Growth Pact is not, or not yet, on the road to operate in originally planned.
What about the discipline of the market?
The willingness of the German Government to increase its debt and digging its deficits Is limited by the fact that the market recognises and penalises nations which leave their fiscal position weaken?
In a word, not.
The interest rates on the sovereign debt in the twelve euro governments in the euro zone are very similar.
The market is not care that countries have different potential to generate exports funding the financial flows necessary to repay debts, or differents deficit ratios/GDP or projected present.
Willem Buiter, of the University of Amsterdam and Anne Sibert, the University of London, believe that it is the acceptance of the ECB's deficit in the euro zone as a guarantee which has undermined the market to become the controller of the tax moderation.
Until the marginal part of the German debt is used as a guarantee for a loan short-term or central pivot of an operation of pension fought to acquire liquidity, its value is much more likely to be determined by the terms under which the ECB accepts as guaranteed by its fundamental.
The treatment by the ECB debt of this as important source of liquidity reserve now false differential analysis of sovereign risk long term.
This is dangerous long term.
It is necessary to have a market discipline and sound fiscal management for a reasonable chance of price stability in the long term.
Omettez to punish today by the market behaviour which can become casse-cou or to activate the institutional levers which give a voice to future generations, and you exposing suffer serious consequences -- perhaps not today or tomorrow, but one day, and for the rest of your life.
As time passes, the arrival of the single currency and the euro was established generate unease.
The policy of the euro zone in general is too deflationary.
The transfers needed to make the current currency acceptable to regions which slow or are already in recession when the ECB applies tougher policy are not facts.
The institutional foundations of a stable fiscal policy in the long term are in full erosion.
Now, Buiter and Sibert convince us that the ECB gives the market less opportunity to reward more economical and penalising extravagant it should.
The earth still does not move, and it does n't happen before a moment.
But the soil under the euro could well become slippery outside if things do not change.
Milosevic and Hussein: even trial, even farce
The trial of war criminals were once serious business.
Remember the photographs of Herman and Goering Rudolf Hess, claims on the dock in Nuremberg.
Some Nazi leaders have even been hanged after relatively short trials, but fair.
Nowadays, the trial of the most despicable leaders of the world have become sham.
The trial of Saddam Hussein and his friends Ba'ath are a series of uninterrupted troublesome times.
The defendants try singerie after another and Hussein shown all forms of contempt possible. The only thing that it has not yet made is to show its backside the judge.
It is difficult to expect something which might appear quite legitimate to Iraqis or the world.
Meanwhile, the trial of Slobodan Milosevic has changed funeral after boring four years of evidence and 200 million dollars spent unnecessarily.
In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government have procrastinated for almost ten years to how bring the Khmer Rouge personalities surviving before the courts.
The mass murderers who took power twentieth century were sentenced to be killed in popular revolts or trial for their crimes -- at least, if they do not dying during their mandate.
Who can feel proud that the last communist leader in Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, was shot with his wife without even the appearance of a fair trial?
The formal pitfalls of a genuine Court always seem preferable to instant justice, even if the final result is also the death.
Today there are two plausible ways to a tyrant deposed.
A nation can send its former leaders before the courts, as Argentines in the 1980s with the general responsible for the disappearance of more than 5 000 of their citizens.
At international level, the Nuremberg model remains valid as an example to other trial, although under the ambiguous conditions required by the victorious powers after sometimes accounts for certain crimes, such as' crimes against humanity ', which are not properly defined when they are committed.
There was a time when we could see the advantages of trials both national and international.
The trial on the territory enabled the local community to give vent to his sorrow closely involved in the procedure.
As judges and sworn defendants compatriots could also provide greater sensitivity to the estimate of guilt because they could assess the harsh conditions under which a dictator deposed takes its decisions.
The trial of general Argentina was a ritual successful in the painful transition of the military junta to democracy, but this experience ended in a larmoyante called into question.
Even after their condemnation, the generals were strong enough to demand a denunciation of their trials can an amnesty for the next president.
The Argentine policy is still enchevêtrée in the legal consequences of these trial twenty years ago.
At international level, the decision of the UN Security Council for the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has also been welcomed with great confidence.
The ICTY has taken several decisions founding under the leadership of Antonio Cassese.
But the judges had the misfortune to achieve their dream more: judge the selfsame wretched leader, Slobodan Milosevic.
We cannot make a clear idea of how the Serbs would have considered Milosevic for a local trial.
Many would have been dependent on the political party which would controlled the Court.
At international level, the fears were not on an excess of political but on an excess of law.
The trial of Milosevic should be fairer, it should be the emblem of the justice of the UN.
So Milosevic has been allowed to defend itself -- serious mistake in terms of the length and efficiency of the trial.
There was no limits to the number of people that the charge has called to testify on the same appalling the Serbian and brutal aggression.
It will take many months to determine the problem and know why this scandal a trial of four years.
My intuition is that the officials well-intentioned court too influenced by the Commission of truth and reconciliation, South African model sold in schools of law as an alternative to the desirable fairness.
In the South African trial, the most important question was not the future of warned but the past victims.
Every victim was encouraged to tell its history and warned listening.
In the case of massacres the twentieth century, such narratives can take decades.
Encouraging victims to speak can give warned the right to monopolise the floor and block the trial in praising its merits of political leader are the ingredients of a never-ending session.
One of the lessons we have learned from the trial of Milosevic and Hussein is that it should not judge men or women to lose their charismatic appeal.
They overturn the trial, particularly if they are allowed to defend themselves, and use the courtroom to justify their journey.
The tyrants should be judged after having been clearly defeated.
By an ironic twist of history, the Nuremberg tribunal has been inspired by representatives of the victors and powerful was an advantage.
They were a constant reminder, Goering Hess and their cronies that the Allies commandaient, that the Nazis were irreparably vanquished.
Punishing guilty, rather than forming the story would be written, has always been the clear objective of the trial.
The tragedy of the trial of Milosevic and Hussein is that the points on "i" of history are still missing and that history itself is in the dock.
The consistent hesitation responsible has given rise to procedures, both national and international, who have facilitated the ghosts of justification and return.
In the case of Saddam Hussein, this fantasy could still happen.
The Line of sharing of the Iraqi economy
All those who analyse Iraq is a divided nation between communities in the Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds.
But there is another division as fundamental, a division which contributes equally to the insurgency continues sectarian conflict and opposition to the military occupation led by the Americans, the growing gap which separate the rich and the poor in Iraq.
When Iraq was released, the people, particularly poor people, are taken to hope that a charismatic leader save the harsh realities of everyday life.
Élevés fear, they had no idea about the way in which democracy could apply to them or how groups of human rights and other organisations in civil rights can help to shape their future.
Iraq was quickly confronted with a new line of social share.
On one side were those who understand how operate in a democracy, come to power and to own ambitions.
They have learned to speak the language of democracy, simultaneously money and influence, and to ensure the support of the independent organisations to defend their rights and their privileges.
On the other hand, however, is a vast population of Iraqis without power, particularly widows, divorced women or left without person to do, they and their children.
For them, democracy and human rights does not mean much.
They are uncultivated, poor and sick.
Victims of an education system which collapsed more than ten years ago, they are little trained to find employment in the Iraqi economy withering away.
Under the yoke of Saddam, no effort was done to raise the standard of living of the have-nots.
I visited the Iraqi big slums and discovered families living in houses barely covered a roof of insects infested everywhere, with open sewers lag in their doors.
harmful and day, they live in the dark.
Since we have need nothing less than food, decent housing and employment opportunities, these families are waiting death, terrified by the cries of their starving children.
When I met the women who live in these houses, they have bombarded with issues: democracy allait-elle give food and homes?
Democracy empêcherait-elle men of their wives fight?
Democracy place citizenship to their children?
Their donnerait-elle the right to divorce spouses who would have abandoned?
In all these issues, I replied 'Yes'.
Yes, democracy will give you the right to live in a decent home, the right to learn and work, and it will give citizenship to children and equality between men and women.
But you must work hard and make every effort to demand these rights.
What they replied: 'Saddam has taught us to be unemployed, fearful and silent for 35 years.
What can we do now? '
In these indigent areas where the majority of living Iraqis, people are prey to bitter temptations.
Many are not the scope of government or political leaders.
They easily fall into violence, theft and sabotage.
Poverty led some to accept money in exchange of terrorist acts, accomplices made by the promise of a false heroism they could not exploit during the long reign of Saddam.
Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of the violent history of wars and atrocities of Iraq, which has annihilated people's sensitivity towards the murder.
Although the livelihoods in Iraq today lead many young men towards violence, I am convinced that it simply for jobs and decent housing for the rescue.
The jobs, help young people to forge new lives through serious jobs.
We must not use de facto jobs to disguise the army of unemployed.
We must give people jobs for their positive contribution to the reconstruction of the country.
By nature, each individual seeks to be useful for its own society.
But culture that Saddam has created the Iraqis convinced that the political connections are the only way to acquire authority, money and knowledge.
Overcoming such sentiments will take time and require a vibrant economy, which means that the new Iraqi government must possess limited powers in order to facilitate the growth of private sector while encouraging the widespread understanding of democracy and human rights.
The religious groups are prepared to participate in this process.
We can also rehabilitate technocrats who served under Saddam, so that they have a chance to serve their country.
Last and not least, we must provide loans to poor families to help build a respectable life.
The government must above all make every effort to convince the Iraqi poor in the value of democracy and freedom and the importance of the constitution in the achievement of their aspirations for a better life.
That will not be easy to achieve in a country where many consider that break the law is an act of heroism.
We have, however, we, the Iraqis, learned that power must not be concentrated in the hands of a minority, and that the implementation of Justice needs to combat corruption in all its forms.
If the constitution must operate as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, the have-nots Iraqis must learn to this fight.
The Islamic identity
Where dirigiez that your eyes today, Islam is used (misused and) as a political force.
Some Muslims serve as an incentive to action; many Muslims in the West (and other countries) perceive as another 'containment and another' stringent exclusion.
As a Turk, I feel directly these two sides of the debate.
The reason why Islam resembles a religion of "the other" of the West is that the West has witnessed a systematic de-institutionalisation of religion.
This is not the religion that has disappeared from the modern Western life, of course, but rather the claims that religious institutions can make individual behaviour.
The religion in the modern world is more than ever a personal experience and spiritual.
However, a process of de-institutionalisation of the religious experience is also happening within Islam.
The politicization of Islam circumvents the authority of religious classes of Islam, ulema.
As in the West, the Islamic religious experience becomes more personal.
The interpretation of religious texts by individual Muslims, including the political activists, intellectuals and women, is a consequence among many.
One popularise religious knowledge, lessons from the Koran being harassed and emerged from their context to support political objectives.
Who decides now what is legitimate and what is illegal in Islam?
Who has sufficient authority to interpret the texts religious?
Who can make a fatwa or declare the jihad '?
Nowadays, the activism and terrorism offer, or rather, impose a source of legitimacy.
That is how the uninitiated decide what means or does not mean Islam, without the authority of religious schools and without specialist training.
Indeed, Islam today is essentially interpreted by political actors and cultural movements, and not by religious institutions.
This de-institutionalisation has enabled Islam to the status of local and national social link to creator of imaginary links between all Muslims around the world who feel oppressed or displaced.
The Islamism and can unite the accession which were deeply divided: Muslims Sufis intellectuals and Muslims saints Shariat of origin; the Shia and Sunni Muslims; the conservative Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran.
Islam is also dynamic, its believers leaving rural areas for cities, including the western cities.
Many regard as negative movement and emphasise that these individuals are socially uprooted and falling later in the alienation and, for some, terrorism.
But social mobility is also a precondition for creating a modern perspective.
Of course, migration causes a feeling of distance Muslims, if not a breach, with their social origins.
Their experience religious new private, Community or public institutions theological.
The religious experience rather becomes a form of social imagination in which they rebuild a sense of belonging to Islam in an environment of both new and strange.
This is not the distance of modern life, but the proximity this life which triggers a return to the religious identity.
Indeed, the vast majority of radicalism is evident in groups which, by their experience of mobility and travel, are familiar with secular western modes of political thinking and urban life.
Désorientés by an unknown environment, these individuals are clinging to Islam which becomes their sole support.
But for that support works, Islam must release its attitude traditionally sycophantically, docile and passive in the face of modernity.
In concerning a veil or a beard, claiming the right of obtaining work prayer or school and requiring special food, Muslims identify openly as Muslims.
They inform the world that they are more zealous and more meticulous in their religious observance that individuals who border their religiosity privacy.
For example, not Muslims generally regard of the veil as a sign of the degradation and Muslim women inferiority.
shame, however, it became for Muslims a sign of their positive statement of Islamic identity.
The young Muslim women of Europe illustrate the perfection of this transformation.
The young girls who adopt the headscarf in the French and German schools are closer, in many respects (i.e., the culture of young people, awareness of fashion and language), their comrades class that their mothers of uneducated who are forced to stay at home.
By adopting the headscarf for the European public sphere, these young girls change without the symbol and the role of Muslim women.
This trend goes well beyond simple headscarves.
All the Western Muslims have a dual sense of belonging, a dual cultural capital.
They are defined by their religiosity, but they also have acquired universal secular knowledge.
From that they have this dual cultural capital, they can move freely relatively between the various activities and spaces (home, school, young houses and space for urban leisure).
To be Muslim and Islamiste are two different things.
We are witnessing today to change a Muslim identity for an Islamic identity.
The me religious for individual Muslims passes kingdom of private public realm.
The question that remains for everyone is whether this quest for identity can be satisfied with scarves and with a public acceptance of broad religious practice Islamist or whether a positive statement of Islam requires a more fundamental renunciation of modernity.
A new era for science Islamic?
For hundreds of years, while science and mathematics undergoing a period of great inventiveness, a region of the world differed from others.
The masters of these disciplines were révérés medicine, large hyped and people wondering about the functioning of nature.
Nothing surprising that this region was globally respected.
In the other half of the world known, scientists were punished, even killed.
The mathematics, as irréligieuses and foreign, were outlawed, and later were subjugated religion.
The standard of living was low.
The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, whereas Europe remained ignorant poor.
The two regions were governed religiously (historians does not agree on the role and the nature of religions in this context), but science épanouissait in one of them.
Today, obviously, the roles of the Islamic Middle East and West are reversed.
Since the Second World War, the US is the world leaders no-one in the field of science.
Throughout this period, the most brilliant students have been enticed outside their country of origin by the prospect of better opportunities for career and research.
Until recently, more than half of graduates of higher mathematics, science and engineering in the US was born abroad.
Many of these young talent remained of graduation, and both the industrial world that the government have benefited.
Meanwhile, the Islamic culture enters a historic stage in which science was equated with the influence of the West, and flee for that reason.
Even in countries where oil revenues could sustain a significant proportion of research, Arab leaders have not encouraged such investment, and the consequence is that their societies have not prospered as much as they could.
Recently, a desire for greater respect policy has pushed the Islamic nations to invest in technological sector, which is particularly visible in Pakistan and Iran's nuclear ambitions.
But that such weapons have a political weight, science on which they are based is trivial and old.
Respect from considered visions, rather than born of past discoveries, is much more significant.
Imagine the influence would have an institute Pakistani top global research on cancer.
And the political rhetoric changerait-elle if researchers Oman discover a way to AIDS disappear?
This opportunity does not for the moment.
But there is another, which is not limited to the Islamic societies.
The United States have committed serious blunder recently.
"issues of faith 'substituted for science within the government, from the presidency.
eminent researchers have seen their reports modified by members of Staff policy when the facts contradicted the official version.
Encouraged by an administration influenced by religion, school systems are divert their teaching of science towards the "values".
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, which slows down the flow of young talent to American universities.
Large scientific organisations have protested without results.
At the same time, tax laws have been revised to make the richest investors, short-term discouraging long-term investment in research.
A dollars demi-billion was devoted to the war in Iraq, a sum almost equal to the financing of basic research thousand years.
Even if the US avoid a dark age of fundamentalism, they clearly lose their world domination in terms of research.
Japan has recognised the link between political weight and science in the 1980s.
The main Japanese industry, Akio Morita CEO of Sony, and the right-wing politician Shintaro Ishihara, have made a number of speeches which have been compiled and published in 1986 under the Japan 'that Can Say No [Japan can say no].
They have outlined a national strategy in which global influence Accordingly scientific power.
The main idea is that the military power could be made obsolete if the "food chain" of military technology was controlled by the other nations.
The title of the book refers to Japan project to say 'no' to the American military influence once Japan master the military technology.
Building a knowledge-based economy through wealth derived from oil is perfectly possible.
The Texas, such as the majority of the southern states of the United States, was once economically poor and decline.
Even with oil revenues, the flow of dollars in the economy, in itself, is not enough to boost prosperity as much as we could believe.
The Texas has therefore decided to devote the oil money allocation for education.
Today, this provision is roughly equal to that of Harvard University, and it extends to 15 universities.
It has had a staggering: the aerospace industry has almost disappeared from California, but it explodes Texas.
The research centres and telecommunications consortia rush in Texas, until the Canadian giant telecommunications Nortel.
Although the industry experiencing a crisis in the United States, Texas has a stronger industrial economies in the world.
There is no reason that the same results can only be achieved in the Middle East.
But above all, the Islamic world must rediscover and reconciled with its proud legacy.
Debate Iranian on Iraq
No country in the Middle East following the events of the post-war Iraq as closely as Iran.
The geographical proximity, a violent and intense history of war with Iraq of Saddam Hussein, religious and emotional connections with the Shiites in Iraq, some concern about the United States and their policy in the region: these are the son which unite Iran to its neighbour Western.
Given the endless tensions with America, Iran is particularly affected by the possibility of an American presence continues among its neighbour, and by America's dominant role in the construction of the future post-Saddam Iraq.
The foreign observers find difficult to follow the Iranian internal debates, yet they exist, they are intense, even if they are not always visible to the public international in general.
We can three general approaches in the Iranian debate evolving on post-Saddam Iraq.
Iranian pragmatists support that Iran will inevitably cooperate with the United States in post-Saddam Iraq, even if only to ensure that the rights of the Shiite population in Iraq are respected.
For this reason, Iran should win the assurance that the new Iraqi leader is not hostile and seek to gain bilateral friendships.
Other key considerations for the pragmatists concern the preservation of Iraq's territorial integrity and the repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.
These are moderates who believe that the Iranian Government should urge the United States for the extradition of the organisation of Moudjahidins Khalq) MKO based in Iraq, as the complete dismantling of the organisation.
In exchange, the Iranian Government should offer its support for ensuring peace, stability and security in Iraq.
In sum, the pragmatists would like limit US-Iran relations, focusing on a programme which greatly reflects the concerns of internal Iran.
In general, the conservative forces in Iran support this approach.
Another approach proposes a more active role and cooperative for Iran in the reconstruction of Iraq.
Advocates of this position support that Iran is well placed to facilitate the reconstruction of its well-established infrastructure of personal and institutional links with Iraq.
Finally, intended, the United States and the international community recognise the value of the Iranian cooperation.
The Iranian cooperation should be rewarded by the dismantling of infrastructure MKO in Iraq, perhaps in exchange for an Iranian promise to tackle the activities of Al Qaeda, and to expel members of Al Qaeda Iran.
Above all, Iran should invite the Americans to respond to its cooperation with the assurance of a guarantee in return that Iran is not in the future the target of US military actions.
In short, the defenders of the cooperation of their are calling for an open market and explicit: the support of Iran to ensure stability during the current transitional phase and its commitment to maintain relations of cooperation with permanent government which emerge in Iraq in exchange for the improvement of regional and international position of Iran.
This position is widely shared within the reformers movements in Iran, within and outside the government, as well as by the technocratic class and business more international orientation.
Finally, the Iranian radicals, the possibility of cooperation with the US remains pure fantasy.
They are convinced that America is merely seeking to undermine the Iranian security and to jeopardise its national interests.
According to the radicals, the US seek as to impose significant changes to the Iranian foreign policy.
At worst, they say, America seek to impose a change of regime in Iran actively.
It advocate enthusiastically against the acquisition of knowledge and nuclear energy by Iran and could even try to weaken the military capacity to Iran in its entirety.
The radicals perceive the American invasion of Iraq as a reflection of the American desire to seal Iran.
In return, they believe that Iran must adopt an aggressive stance in defence of its own interests, by forming strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers and use the Iranian influence in Iraq to prevent the formation of a government pro-American and anti-iranien in Baghdad.
The hard-liners of all persuasions support this approach.
The overthrow of Saddam and his regime was the most easy to the Iraqi crisis.
Now the hardest remains to be done: to establish peace and security, win the war against terrorism and convince the Muslim masses that America has no intention to occupy Iraq siphonner all its oil resources and redesign the Middle East to its image.
Meanwhile, the opposition against the US, under the expression of suicide bombing or other forms of terrorism, probably will only grow.
Iran is intended to keep its decisive position in the region through its political dynamism and its Muslim identity echo resonance throughout the Muslim world.
What happens in Iraq has major implications in Iran and the US would do well to find a way to recognise this matter.
The US threats, or the discussions on another war, feed the fire of resentment in Iran and frustration, strengthening the most radical movements.
If the US wish to avoid such effects, they must agree to limit their influence of its own radicals, assuming that American interests in Iraq are best defended through cooperation with Iran.
A outcome for Iraq
The situation in Iraq came to the point where everybody wants ostensibly the same thing: the departure of the coalition forces.
The recent disclosure of confidential note of the British Department of Defense on the withdrawal of troops underlining this aspiration.
The only question is how satisfied.
Until the forces of the Coalition remain, violence will only increase.
However, if they are based, the escalation of violence will take place anyway, and even more quickly.
The real question is how to achieve Iraq to organise an army and police can rely to respect the law and order.
It is still a long way to attain this goal.
Despite the courage of many Iraqis who join the ranks of the police or the army, no surprise that some incentives have less pure.
In northern Iraq, rule of old accounts and ethnic segregation is introduced in certain areas traditionally mixed, as Irbil.
In other regions, the Sharia is imposed.
How Iraq create bodies likely to enforce the law with efficiency and impartiality, regardless of race, religion or gender?
The traditional response is to recruit and train instil good "values".
But insufficient time.
We must find other ways.
In the absence of a system of deep-rooted value, Iraq needs associations embedded in civil society, which the police and the army will render accounts.
They could take various forms, but the most important thing is that they be extended at local level, and that they have the support of the authorities of district, the region and the country when they indicate abuse.
If a local monitoring is put in place, supplemented and recognised at national level, then the majority of members of the military and police forces undoubtedly behave properly, and otherwise, it will be easier to identify and manage.
Such measures may arise disproportionately optimistic, and yet, in Afghanistan, a country which resembles Iraq under many aspects, many groups and work.
The heart Peace and Cooperation CPAU Unity) provides a model of how to operate.
In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, the priority of ordinary people was to reduce violence.
The CPAU has worked throughout the country over the past three years to establish peace Committees of districts, supported by satellite Councils of peace in the villages.
This initiative addresses a culture in which violence is so deeply rooted children, in a time, arithmetic learned counting the Soviet soldiers dead.
The Committees have tried to gather all the groups in the community, including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, the police, judges and businessmen, in order to devise ways to resolve conflicts without violence.
Even if the Committees not officially played a supervisory role hitherto (planned for the future), the mere fact that the police, the military, and justice in part brings into contact with the rest of the Community, allows feedback and contributes to the establishment of trust.
Some are noteworthy results.
In a workshops, local military commander has move few hours by courtesy, and ultimately remain the week.
It is Party excused his past violent and is committed to disarm its private army of 2 000 men.
It now regular visits to the Committee offices.
In Iraq, projects such as the Humanitarian link Center of Kirkuk begin to fulfil a surveillance by offering the people in the various ethnic groups the opportunity to set out its complaints and for aid to resolve its problems.
However, all too often, even in the case of a trial, the judgment is not applied because the victims succumb to the threat.
The US and British forces have already worked to strengthen civil society.
However, we do not talk workshops emancipation of women, or the success of the organisation of local elections small-scale in the country.
Mobilising civil society represents an enormous challenge, especially when, as in Iraq, it must be done quickly and large scale.
The military forces are still needed, but like the encouragement to disarmament, which can take the form of prospects for more fruitful economic opportunities that crime and theft.
Fortunately, such an organisation of civil society is expensive too low.
The association Humanitarian link Center deals Kirkuk for an annual cost of 75 000 · US.
With 10 million dollars, we could put in place a hundred centres of the same type, and remain of the currency.
It is now to engage in this direction, support without neglecting the brave people who fall within the challenge to ask accounts in power.
Otherwise, the Iraqi people will not know the security desperately needs after so many years of suffering.
Democracy Nile?
The surprise decision of the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to propose a constitutional amendment allowing the holding of direct presidential elections and competitive could well be a quantum leap for democracy in Egypt and in the Arab world.
The West accustomed to a pluralist democracy can be difficult to understand how potentially significant change this decision will result in a country used to military prevails for more than 50 years.
Under the current system, the Egyptian citizens can only express the day of a presidential referendum every six years to say yes or no to the single name on the presidential elections.
This explains why a person as Mubarak has always received more than 90% of the vote, albeit in the middle of a indifferent participation.
The strong men and Syrian Iraqis have even better with this system, probably because they have demanded that the names and addresses the voters are placed at the bottom of each election.
Several people support for a long time that the democratisation in the Middle East cannot progress as Egypt does not fully involved in the process.
Egypt could not really embark on a path of democratization without first amending its constitution, in order to reduce the phenomenal powers of its chairman and limiting the length of his mandate.
Mubarak, after all, is already at its 24ème year as President.
Thus, his announcement of competitive presidential elections is a first step.
The regime can assume that he will be able to use the process to its advantage, but the events could be more difficult to monitor than expected once the citizens start to feel responsibility.
The democratic engineering is out of the bottle.
In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this troubled region to embark on the path to democracy.
Turkey from one side of the Middle East and Morocco on the other are already engaged in this process.
The real tidal wave seems this time result from the time proximity and positive results of recent election in Iraq, in Palestine and, to a lesser degree, Saudi Arabia.
The unprecedented protests against the occupation of Lebanon by Syria following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, do not seem to be alleviated.
The Egyptian opposition groups have also held marches increasingly courageous and other forms of civil disobedience in recent weeks.
The catalyst for their anger was the arrest and imprisonment of opposition ill, Ayman Nour, the end of January.
The arbitrary government has reinvigorated the national movement Kifaya (which means' Enough), which has demanded the regime of Mubarak.
Suddenly, the conventional wisdom that Egyptians are passive and have afraid to act has not appeared to be happening.
An alliance of local, regional and international forces unites against the continuing tyranny on the shores of the Nile.
The recent wave of popular pressure seems to have rocked the regime.
Only one month before, Muybarak disrupted the demands of constitutional reform by taxing futile '.
But, whatever the combination of events which led this about-turn, the initiative on elections must be welcomed.
It is a first necessary step, although insufficient, to rewrite the stagnant political system in Egypt.
The Egyptians distrust already symbolic reforms to the Tunisian, where President Zine El Abidin Bin Ali, which occupies his office long ago, has created a caricature of constitutional amendment which was open the way to competitive presidential elections, but which subsequently led a mockery of competition with some 'opponents handpicked.
During the previous presidential Tunisian referenda, Bin Ali systematically récoltait 99% of votes; it has now achieved 96%.
Let Mubarak more serious about the electoral reform.
To demonstrate his sincerity, it must instruct the immediate release of Ayman Nour and take steps to put an end to the state of emergency 24 years, which prevents successfully the organisation of political campaigns.
Mubarak must also adopt a limit of two successive mandates for five years for every president.
Just as necessary, measures to win the confidence of the citizens, particularly open and equal access to the media, which are currently controlled by the state.
I announced that I intended to argue this forthcoming presidential elections in order to open the debate on these essential reforms.
But I go home with pleasure in my life of private citizen when I have the assurance of a free and open election next autumn.
If they are seriously implemented, these steps transform the legacy of Mubarak.
With the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine, they could well inaugurate an Arab spring of freedom, long overdue strong.
historic elections for Egypt?
The Egyptians will go to the polls on 7 September to elect a president among 10 candidate, Hosni Mubarak in power for 24 years.
If little doubt that it will be re-elected to the outcome of the election, many steps must follow with passion.
Around 6 000 national election observers were trained for the opportunity, and hundreds of international observers will come in the country this week.
Although all the trappings of a real electoral competition are put in place, it is striking that several signs of authenticity lack the appeal.
Despite the promises to the contrary, the conditions of game are far from fair.
Mubarak enjoys a disproportionate number of benefits: the recognition of the name, a near-monopoly electronic state-controlled media and nothing less than 85% of print media.
A week before the election, some opposition candidates have not yet had the opportunity to disseminate one campaign to the Egyptian television.
All the members of the presidential election committee are appointed by Mubarak, and the new electoral rules eliminated all independent competitors.
Since 2000, a decision by the Supreme Court states that the 8 000 Egyptian judges must supervise the elections and certify the results.
It is a major step towards fairer election, because the professional union of judges remained relatively independent the last half-century of stranglehold on the executive.
The Mubarak regime has therefore had to use various tricks to neutralise the union of judges.
One was long, drawn-out definition of judicial 'to include thousands of employees graduates in law, without experience in the court but loyal to the government, but little room for real judges, because if they are protesting in boycotting their work of observation, the task will return once again to the police in the infamous Ministry of the Interior.
Thus, in the past, the union of judges has performed, with predictable results.
During the parliamentary elections in 2000, while the party in power of Mubarak has received that approximately 38% of the vote in the areas monitored by the real judges, the results have managed to culminate to 86% when the presque-juges were responsible for the observation.
This year promises to be very different.
In spring, the judges have held an assembly of national scale and resolved that unless the government gives complete independence and the exclusive monitoring of the process of elections, they checking the presidential elections (or parliamentary) to come.
The 2 September, they have explained their ultimate demand: the regime must allow civilian groups to observe the elections, stop to change the definition of legitimate judges in an electoral purpose, and accept that no box leaves the presence of a judge legitimate and its content is short, certified and postponed.
For the moment it seems that the situation is hopeless, because the presidential election committee has publicly announced in the Egyptian television that he refused by the citizens observation of elections.
Among the exciting developments, on the eve of the elections, appears a heated public debate about whether boycott the election or go vote?
Many opposition parties have called their members to abstain in protest against restrictive electoral rules which promote strongly Mubarak.
Moreover, the Muslim Brotherhood, as forming the only group of opposition with weight in Egypt, push their supporters to vote according to their conscience, but do not support any "governing despotic and corrupt."
This is an implicit but clear repudiation of Mubarak, only Head of State for 24 years.
Some 34 civil society organisations prepare thousands of young Egyptians to monitor the elections despite repeated governmental objections.
These groups argue that if the regime has no intention of rigging elections, then the presence of national and international observers should not pose problems.
The response of the regime is to say that any external monitoring is interference in the Egyptian sovereignty, and that national observers constitute an affront to the integrity of judges.
This last argument fell quickly when the union of judges came out in favour of observers of civil society.
What Mubarak's regime frightens voices within and outside the incentive to hold free and fair elections, or that it is simply unable to eliminate cheating within the Party as it became inherent in its operation, the current signs EAS nothing good in the elections next Wednesday.
Meanwhile, for the first time the Egyptians are exciting experience of the challenge to tyranny, and benefit from a new area of freedom.
The envy European dollar
The currencies can play a vital role not only in commercial transactions, but also in diplomatic and political wrangling.
When this happens, the commercial transactions are becoming more difficult and subject to greater uncertainty.
The politicization of money during the interwar depression proved economically devastating.
But violent wars of currencies were more recently.
In the 1960s, the international monetary order has become the subject of political tug-of-war.
Every leader had theories and markedly different explanations regarding the situation.
The Europeans, and especially the French, complained that the General Charles de Gaulle described 'extraordinary privilege of the US dollar.
The general and monetary guru, Jacques Rueff argued that the US used the status of the dollar as a reserve currency major the system of fixed exchange rate of Bretton Woods to manage deficits and pay their military adventurism abroad (then Vietnam).
France has responded by calling for a monetary reform which end the special role of the dollar and has tried to revive the gold standard largely discredited.
The Europeans have begun a long discussion on the advantages of monetary union, whose implementation would allow them to compete with the dollar.
But the US point of view, the international role of the dollar was a trap.
Other countries could change their exchange rates and could maintain greater competition at the level of exports.
The US Government has proved powerless to an undervalued yen, fueling the belief that the rest of the world used the dollar to attack the basis of manufacture of America.
The Nixon administration has concluded that the only way to save the American economy was to engage in a monetary unilateralism (monetary expansion so spectacular that other countries would be forced to adjust their exchange rates).
These battles long forgotten suddenly seem very present again.
The world has a system of fixed exchange rate, but the dollar remains the motto of major reservation, a sort of Bretton Woods floating.
For the Americans, the role of the dollar reserves constitutes a potential threat while not Americans, it would rather another example of US néo-impériale quest for hegemony.
In this decade, China has taken Japan's place in the 1960, preventing its exchange rate climb to push the growth of exports.
This makes it the target of American gripes about unfair competition and efforts to impose an adjustment of exchange rates to deter the Americans to buy toys, equipment and Chinese garments.
The American manufacturers have felt that bras manufactured in China threatened the American way of life.
Meanwhile, the Europeans (and especially the French) complain about huge US deficits and the argument of Gaulle stating that the rest of the world pays for the wars of America is back in fashion.
Some Europeans suggest that Asian central banks should hold a greater share of their euro reserves, an echo of the unsuccessful attempt by the general to capitulate America by selling dollars for gold.
The 1960s have ended in a collapse of the system 'and by a major financial turmoil, accompanied by an inflationary wave of prices of goods.
Everyone has been affected and America's role on the world stage has been undermined.
A similar collapse at the moment should have a slightly different.
The system of rates floating present is more stable and the adjustment costs distributed differently.
The majority of Americans do not suffer much marked the dollar because sellers foreigners need to adjustments in prices for the American market.
The Asian economies vigorously development and their central banks their rely on the US.
They should pursue this policy is not to see their export sectors suffer a sudden failure on the American market capital.
The US will thus more time to treat a deficit of current accounts which does not prove viable in the long term.
The economically dynamic regions of the world (North America and Asia) and are linked by a pact which will ensure the continuity of the centrality of the US dollar.
The Americans will continue to accumulate debts because Asians encourage.
The repeal of the Pact would be contrary to the interests of both parties.
It is not an American unilateralism because the Pact involves cooperation with Asia.
But for Europeans, who are excluded from the Pact, resembles an economic and monetary unilateralism.
Meanwhile, the supremacy of the euro on the dollar suffer the European industrial exporters.
Europe is not able to alleviate.
Europe will represent the greatest victim of new currency confrontations.
The answers pronostiquées in the 1960s (restoration of the gold standard or invention of a common European currency) no longer seem very useful.
A single currency failed to provide a substantial protection.
The old version of the European response (what psychologists call "the envy of the dollar 'only become more pervasive.
The European Central Bank will be invited to extend the monetary base, as if the imitation of the dollar was the answer to all manufacturers, structural and demographic problems which are invading Europe.
But we should remember that the problems of Europe do not come from the manipulation of currencies.
The protests against the new version of monetary extraordinary privilege of America must be seen for what they are: a means of compensating real European powerlessness.
The desire of the dollar is ready to disappear and enhanced international, the value of the dollar disappear without causing clearly adverse effects on the people who print and use.
A outbreak of policy
The Americans, as the citizens of all the countries of the world, came to accept the fact that the policy plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public representatives.
Few of us are surprised (although some can be disappointed) when a federal judge or a diplomat senior is appointed because it has a crucial test of fidelity to an important principle in the eyes of the chairman of the party or prime minister.
But the science, in the view of all, occupies a place and on this point, the US begin to serve example of warning for the rest of the world.
The scientific appointments must be based on objective criteria of training, competence and performance.
Obviously, it is legitimate to interrogate a future Secretary of Health and human services) SSH on its views on abortion.
But it is completely wrong to submit candidates selected to sit in advisory scientific committees tests of political loyalty.
Similarly, membership of organisms examining the scientific proposals, a fundamental process for scientific progress, should undoubtedly be without all the barriers which are unrelated professional qualifications.
Unfortunately, the scientists in the US encounter increasingly these barriers.
During last autumn, the journal Science published several reports on the issue.
One of these reports was on the massive replacement of members of the advisory committee of the National Centre for environmental health, which is part of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), without prior consultation of the director of the centre.
Similar cases have also been observed in the Committee Advisory Lead Poisoning and Prevention CDC, the Committee Advisory National Human Research and Protections Committee Advisory Genetic Testing.
The current epidemic of ideology, in which the advisory committees are dissolved then retrained with new members, and where applicants are subject to tests of loyalty, seems outdated some observers.
The representatives of the SSH spoke as a "fairly common practice."
It is not a widespread practice in America, or at least not until today.
In any case, the fact that the Bush Administration to tests to be candidates in key positions in order to determine their compatibility with its values' is not really worrying.
The most alarming development concerns the degree of importance of ideological investigations, which interfere in areas previously unaffected against this kind of manipulation.
Indeed, the most revealing cases in this epidemic growing policy has perhaps affected the revision of belonging to the section study of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, which evaluates subsidies to the study of injuries occurred at work.
The advisory committees could be vulnerable to an occasional overhaul of this kind in the past.
After all, they have recommended the policies that the politicians or not consideration.
But the sections study?
In October 2002, Science published an editorial David Michaels and many of his colleagues.
Several of them were former distinguished officials who have contributed to some of the relevant committees and they have made a valuable views on the issue, based on their personal experience.
Their article was a case in itself, but the consequences he held were even more interesting.
It has triggered a stolen letters in which scientific touched upon similar experiences.
A candidate Muscular Dystrophy Research Coordinating Committee of the National Institute of Health told that an inquiry was carried out by a member of the White House.
After having been invited to raise his views on the various policies of the Bush administration, which none of it was in connection with the work of the Committee, it had to indicate whether it supported the President on embryonic stem cells.
Another person to be shown, a distinguished professor in psychiatry and psychology has recounted have received an appeal from the White House on his appointment National Council Abuse Drug.
Its partner has declared that it should make an investigation in order to determine "if its views could bother President."
Under the teacher, a series of questions ensuivie, the representative of the White House taking a fiche rating.
Example: "You secured two three; the president is opposed to the exchange of needles [for intravenous drug users] on moral grounds, whatever the result."
Then the conversation has taken a turn even more alarming.
The representative has asked the candidate had voted for Bush and, after having received an answer, he asked: 'Why did you not support the President? "
This attitude amounts to a dictatorship, and not a democracy.
The objective of the advisory scientific committees is to provide impartial advice and consider the political process.
There is nothing to be gained, and much to lose, when a political desired result is put forward.
That is why the determination of research projects to support has always been a matter to be considered objectively by peers, and not by politicians.
In fact, the law that applies here - the law on federal advisory committees, the Federal Advisory Committee Act) explicitly requires that the committees are impartial and ‘no inappropriately influenced by the authority detaining the power to appoint. "
The US Secretary of Health and human services Tommy Thompson and the office of the staff of the White House should show an example to the rest of the world.
They can achieve easily: respecting the law.
Murder in Moscow
It is time to put an end to fiction that the "dictatorship of law" Vladimir Putin has made post-communist Russia as a little more itself law-abiding.
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, the journalists among the best and most courageous in Russia, a woman who dared to update the brutal killings committed by Russian soldiers in Chechnya, is the ultimate proof that President Putin runs a trivial dictatorship showing the ordinary disregard for the law.
It is time for the world to recognise, particularly for Europe.
The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs preparing a policy on relations between Russia and Germany, which should ratify the indifference to the lack of respect for the law shown by Putin as national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.
But the indifference becomes the conciliation when it encourages Putin to continue on this path in the international arena, as demonstrates its current campaign to strangle economically Georgia.
The murder of Politkovskaya has a sinister taste of déjà vu: as with glory days, KBG in Putin's Russia People disappear, simply.
The murder of Politkovskaya is the third murder apparently policy in three week.
Enver Ziganshin chief engineer BP, Russia was killed by ball Irkoutsk 30 September last.
Andrei Kozlov, Vice-Governor of the Central Bank of Russia pursuing a campaign against financial fraud, was murdered on 14 September.
The fact that the Prosecutor General Russia Yuri Tchaïka take the investigation into the murder of Politkovskaya in hand, as it did of Kozlov, is not a source of hope, as would be the case in a real democracy if a high official is implied in an investigation.
In fact, the involvement of the highest levels of government in Russia is virtually an assurance that the murderous will never be found.
The murder of Politkovskaya is a particularly bodes sinister when we consider issuing fierce criticism place in the Russian president.
In its articles for one of the few still independent newspapers in Moscow, Novaïa Gazeta, and in its books "Putin's Russia: life in a failing democracy" and "A dirty war: a Russian journalist in Chechnya 'Politkovskaya commenting on the abolition of freedoms which sign of Putin's presidency.
As shows the fate of old business exiles Boris Berezovski and Vladimir Gusinki, and the oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky imprisoned, the fate of the enemies of Putin may take three forms: exile, the prison or the grave.
I am not currently accuse the government of Putin ordered the killing of Politkovskaya.
After all, as the investigative journalist campaign, it has infuriated many other people also Putin, including the current Prime Minister Chechen Ramzan Kadyrov is not least, it has accused to pursue a policy of abductions against ransoms.
But even if associated Vladimir Putin had nothing to do with the murder of Politkovskaya bullet in a lift its building in the centre of Moscow, its disregard for the law has created a climate in which has been committed murder.
In the image of the murder of Thomas Beckett's Canterbury cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed with the clear conviction that the King would be satisfied.
Given that this was Politkovskaya -- prevailing the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies -- prevailing government should ensure that it happen nothing.
Putin's Russia has already lost 12 distinguished journalists murdered during the past six years.
None of these crimes has been cleared up, which would not be the case if the "dictatorship of law" Putin was something other than a mere public relations strategy.
The six years since the arrival of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin were characterised by deeply contradictory signals.
On one side, the world sees a young leader qualified commitment to modernize Russia, and particularly to align the law and legal practices on international standards.
Furthermore, the President is content to stand and watch while say that his former colleagues of Russian security services of the FSB (the former KGB) does not protect those who are murdered, and even launch a series of cases of espionage notorious against journalists, scientists and environmental activists.
Among these 'néo-espions appear the journalist Gregori Pasko, the expert arms control, the diplomat Igor Soutiagine Moiseïev Valentin, physicist Valentin Danilov and many others.
The supposedly civilising influence means to be a partner, Western chairing a G8 summit in St. Petersburg, seems to count for nothing in the Kremlin cabal Putin.
Once again, contact with the values of the West has led to a different Potemkin village; Russia presents a facade of democratic rules and laws, but behind this scene cut-out the same butes arbitrary as the law.
At a global level, the danger is that the non-respect of laws expressed by Putin exports.
Nearly Russian borders, a form of diplomacy criminalised is rooted.
Think of how Putin has tried to rig the elections in Ukraine, and without accusations and cesses withdrawn against the opposition Yulia Timoshenko.
Consider the secessionist regions playing the here‒what in Moldova and Georgia, who only exist because they have the support of the Kremlin.
Look as the Kremlin seeks to sing its neighbours threatening their energy supplies.
All policemen know that when ignoring the behaviour of criminals, they become more audacious.
It is more than time for the world to recognise Vladimir Putin for what it is: a man who Russia back to the country shadows.
The world must now consider this old Latin maxim tacet consentere videtur: no mention is making, and whether it is really wise to agree to the construction quietly by Putin of energy superpower where the law does not.
A pipeline to strengthen the empire of Russia
Gerhard Schröder, less than a month ago, was still German Chancellor has agreed to become President of the company responsible for building d “shall a pipeline linking Russia to Germany in the Baltic Sea and Western Europe.
In many countries, Schröder would easily accused of crime of conflict of interest.
Its apparent failure morality is amplified by the fact that at the same time, Russia threatens to stop gas supplies to Ukraine if it is not yielding to the requirements of tariff Gazprom, the gas giant state property of the Kremlin.
The strategic goal of Russia is obvious. Currently, no longer distribute gas to Ukraine also means that a good part of Europe will no longer nitrate, because most of the major pipelines cross Ukraine.
Bypassing Ukraine, Poland and, of course, the Baltic States, the new pipeline strengthen the influence of the Kremlin again seeks to impose in the region.
President Vladimir Putin and his government of the former KGB clones will no longer care reactions of Western Europe when they decide how vigorously to exert pressure on the postcommunist neighbors of Russia.
Europe really should provide Putin such a weapon imperialist?
Worse still, Russia should use this weapon for the EU to boot its energy?
Whether a former German Chancellor takes the enterprise which will provide Russia the means to manipulate the European economy testifies to the dangerous sufficiency of Europe in the face of Putin neo-imperial ambitions.
Of course, the Russian media are aware of the growing dependence of Europe compared to Russia's energy resources.
They will until délecter. Russian editorialists wrote "When we integrated and extended our energy trade with Europe, it must keep silent on the issue of human rights'.
Putin expresses this position of indirect communitarization committing to what he calls a 'political independence'.
Thus, simply meant that Russia should remain independent 'concerns of Western democracies on ethics and human rights.
It may be that some European leaders truly believe that the maintenance of soft prosperity in the EU justifies silent on human rights and other issues niggling the Kremlin.
Of course, we must speak briefly on the 'commercial issues', as the expropriation of Yukos, and if the Kremlin were to cash our values or our minds critically -- such as Chechnya bloodstained -- it seems that Europeans would rather hide to tackle a potential increase in energy prices or even a blockade, such as that which Ukraine is facing.
Although Putin reorganize its court, by putting the Duma to its willingness, the hopes of the EU about Russia become increasingly ‘European 'should be abandoned.
Russia that Putin is building is gradually transformed. It has neglected its hopes of freedom post-Soviet to become a bulwark oil and gas for the new elite of the former KGB.
Indeed, Matthias Warnig, the director of the consortium of pipeline chaired by Schröder, is a longstanding friend Putin.
An earlier in the year, the Wall Street Journal has revealed that Warnig, the director of the Russian arm of the Bank Versicherung ex-officier Stasi, the former secret police in East Germany, and it has met Putin in the late 1980s when the Russian President was KGB spy in GDR.
Whether the Russians accept a government formed by former KGB men, for whom the lack of compassion and the rejection of dissent are the rule, reflects their exhaustion towards the uproar the last twenty years.
Now, the Kremlin thinks that what is good for the Russians basis for the citizens of independent nations. None mercy will be granted to small weaker once Russia retains the means to intimidate, isolate and threaten energy blockade.
As a former head of state of the new independent Lithuania, I have often had to such threats.
The European Union has signed many agreements with Russia, including a 'common area of freedom and justice.
The Kremlin is very strong pretend for such a idealism.
His control on Eastern Europe has always been imposed on the basis of treaties so-called friendship and the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were 'fraternal missions.
But look how Putin flouts this' common area: a barbaric treatment of Chechens, the imprisonment of business Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the harassment of foreign NGOs and Yuliya Tymoshenko accusation, égéries of the Orange Revolution, by Russian military judges completely invented burdens.
If Europeans sincerely believe in their common area of human rights and freedoms, they must nevertheless acknowledge that these values are not shared by the henchmen calculating Putin.
It is with regard Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.
Is it really conceivable that the homeland of the 'Red Terror, countless unpunished crimes of the Soviet era and even dirty hands of blood Lithuanians the Caucasians can actually help combat global threat wielded by Iran and North Korea?
It seems more likely that minds cold Kremlin only receiving to exploit every crisis to increase their power of destruction and their influence.
For decades, the region of Europe from which I come has been left at the mercy of evil.
That is why I cannot remain silent when Europe trébuche blindly in a new appeasement.
We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have learnt in our history that behind every diplomatic act of Russia hides a imperialist ambitions.
Western Europeans, who have forgotten this history, should take account of our warnings.
The dependence on Russia -- even if it takes the face of so-called charismatic Gerhard Schröder "-- can only lead law in the wall.
Iraq: bullets against the ballots
When the war in Iraq has started in 2003, the Bush administration caressait ambitious projects: the image of Germany and Japan post-1945, a long and peaceful occupation was envisaged, during which the increase in oil production guarantee a growing prosperity with the democratic structures would be built up piece by piece.
The basis should be a liberal constitution, even post-modern premium the guarantee of 25% of parliamentary seats insured women.
The current Iraq does or peace or prosperity.
The constitution must be voted on 15 October next includes the 25% rule, but nothing has liberal.
The disposition-clé (Article 2) stating that no law cannot contradict "undisputed laws of Islam 'violates basic principles of the Parliamentary sovereignty, and prevent the legislation correspond to international standards.
For example, the age of consent to sexual relations for girls can be high over nine years, because Mohammed itself a wife of nine years.
That means that girls of nine years are also adults in view of the criminal law, and reasonable of the death penalty, for example, conversion to other religion.
The Shia can use this clause to put their ayatollahs above the elected parliament, as in Iran, because alone are allowed to determine the 'laws of Islam.
The foreigners and Iraqi liberal some particularly concerned about this Islamic clause, but the opposition to the Constitution, widely among Sunnis, seeks other provisions: the exclusion of "saddamiste Ba'ath party" of political life and the government, and the federalist clauses which give the autonomy to the Iraqi 18 provinces and enable them to join in regional governments.
The law of exclusion is a personal problem for Sunni elites, which include thousands of businessmen, liberals, artists, few exceptions, were all members of the Ba'ath.
In theory, the constitutional ban might not be retroactive.
In practice, the administrative laws are now implemented to exclude the Ba'ath so-called 'high-ranking any form of employment in government, which concerns thousands of people.
The Sunnis probably accept the federalists provisions if they applied the Kurds.
They know that the alternative is not a return to centralism, but the secession of three provinces of Kurdish majority, Dahuk Arbil and As Sulaymaniyah to form an independent Kurdistan, with its own Ministry of Finance, its army (Pesh Merga), and its oil production in Kirkuk, the second largest reserve of Iraq.
The Sunnis reject this federalism for the Shia because they consider Arab compatriots who have always accepted the Sunni law in the past and will again, unless they have their own government.
That is what would the new constitution, because the southern provinces - who have the main Iraqi oil reserves - Shiite majority could form their own regional government.
In the usual style of the Middle East, Sunni leadership disappointed and dissatisfied with the constitution now threatening to use violence.
But federalism is not the only reason why the supporters of the Sunni supremacy and Islamist launch lethal attacks.
Their opposition is more fundamental: they do not accept the principle of democratic government by the majority.
Instead, they seek to restore the reign of the Sunni minority.
For the Islamists, all the Shia deserve the death anyway, as apostates.
A Shi'ite leader, Moqtada Sadrists, also opposed vehemently to federalism.
His followers, largely illiterate, are the poorest and most violent Shiite slums in Baghdad and beyond, whose "mahdi" militia has fought the US troops in 2004, when the Americans protected Shiite Sunni attacks.
As a young priest draws its authority of his father, a deceased Ayatollah populist itself, Sadrists must confront the opposition of living Iraqi ayatollahs, which despise ignorance and its violence.
Sadr cannot compete with them in terms of religious authority, it chooses to take a party arabe-nationaliste against them, often recalling that the highest Shiite cleric Ayatollah Sistani, is not Arab but perse.
Similarly, it reminds its supporters El Hakim, who lead the Supreme Council of the Islamic revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) and 'Badr militia were exiles subsidised in Iran, many fought the Iranian side during the long and bitter Iran-Iraq war, until the Americans' mere ".
Sadr opposes the federalism because a regional government Shiite adhere to its enemies, Sistani and SCIRI, ‘seem fall under Iran.
To highlight its message Sadrists men combat the Badr militia, successfully in Baghdad, where many mahdis, but not in Najaf, where Sadrists weak-willed after the destruction caused last year until his men are massacred by the Americans.
This was difficult enough Sadrists to confront the villain, now a political calculation simply suggests that it will probably the main character to the vote of October.
To reject the constitution and cause new elections in a constitutional assembly, opponents need a two-thirds majority at least three provinces.
The Sunnis are likely to win in two provinces, but if Sadrists instructing his supporters of Baghdad slums not vote with local Sunni, it will probably fall the capital of the opponents of the constitution and ensure his defeat.
As rogue policy, Sadrists is naturally to sell.
Last year it was sought for murder.
Today it seeks a recognition as a man of state, he wants money, and, at least implicitly, Sistani of humiliation and SCIRI.
It may well receive proposals, and the negotiations have perhaps already begun.
But some of the Shiites attack with words and bullets thousands of armed men at their disposal and for them, it deserves bullets in return.
The end of secrecy
Transparency is not always an easy in the new democracies of Eastern Europe. That discovered the Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, when a registration in which he had lies in his government has caused riots.
As Hungary, Romania post-communist has endeavoured to encourage openness and honesty in a society which possessed once among the most closed in the world.
But the persistence of a culture of secrecy has exploded corruption and abuses of power.
We note, however, a real progress towards greater transparency, development recognised by the European Union which gave the green light to Romania for membership at the beginning of the year 2007.
Besides the implementation of what the EU takes today for a "functioning market economy ', essential reforms in the political and legal field, which I am responsible, will strengthen the transparency and control of funding for political parties to the reorganisation of the judicial system.
The judicial reforms contribute to eradicate corruption.
Ministers and former ministers, parliamentarians, magistrates, lawyers, and members of police forces, customs and other public bodies, as well as private entrepreneurs, have been indicted.
Furthermore, new forms have been developed for the declarations of assets and financial interests by those occupying the official duties in government, parliament, in the public and local administration and the judicial system.
The new arrangements for statement are more detailed in Europe, and especially they are made public.
Progress in Romania are confirmed by a report published this month, according to which the citizens of Eastern Europe now have access to information government like those established democracies long.
The report Transparency and Silence, the Open Society Justice Initiative (available on www.justiceinitiative.org), indicates that the new democracies are sometimes better than the old: some Romanian government bodies more respond to requests for information for citizens that their French or Spanish counterparts.
More specifically, 60% of applications are met in Romania, against 31% in France and 24% in Spain.
Other good performers, we can quote Peru and Mexico, two countries that adopted legislation relating to freedom of information in 2002, shortly after Romania.
However, it is not always easier to access to sensitive information in democracies in transition.
I worked as counsel for the defence of human rights within the Helsinki Committee Romanian, and we have often had to seize the courts to demand information, in accordance with the Romanian legislation in 2001 for the freedom of information.
For example, when we officially obtained access to data on telephone tapping authorised by the Prosecutor General, he has simply ignored this decision.
We attacked civil, and the judge set a fine for each day of delays in the communication of information.
It is only when the media were interested in the case, that the data - many tapping permitted during the previous ten years, people targeted and duration of operations - have been made public.
Romania has finally then began to turn our backs on a past characterised by the omnipresence of the Securitate.
I am now part of the government, and I realize that it is not always clear to share some information with the public.
But he arrives painful reforms are.
We would not carried out the economic and political reforms which will allow us to join the EU without our policies to the public scrutiny and without accepting the greater involvement of citizens in the decision-making process which accompanies inevitably such openness.
In fact, access to information became a prerequisite for democracy throughout the world.
When the US have adopted the Freedom of Information Act in 1966, they were alone, with Sweden and Finland.
Today, 65 countries have such legislation.
In Romania, those who fought for the adoption of a law on the freedom of information fully take advantage.
According to the study of Justice Initiative, the people who come to the Romanian Government receive without any great difficulty of information that it would have been unthinkable to communicate a few years ago.
Thus, the Romanian Ministry of Defence has disclosed the number of deaths soldiers in 2003, and the circumstances (including 13 suicides, two deaths ball, and two deaths in the fight in Afghanistan).
Another example, the court of Bucharest has received a request concerning the number of judges who have been a disciplinary procedure since the beginning of the year 2000, and the motives of possible sanctions.
The court has passed this request to the Council higher of the judiciary, which has given a full reply: four pages listing all the magistrates punished, motives and measures.
This process is the fruit and the engine of the continued reforms.
The rulers have not always been very comfortable with openness, and continues the battle for the most sensitive documents.
But in the postcommunist countries, the benefits of transparency are undeniable.
However, the experience of Romania shows that the official secrecy is always a threat, no country is immune, and that only a vigilance of all moments can prevent undermining the foundations of democracy.
Saving the trees of Life
Nobody can end its day without having used a sideshow of forests.
In a measure more important than normally believes, the paper it is written, running water, medicines our taps treating wood, our homes and our furniture facts have all of the forest.
The forests us fresh air that we breathe harbour and endangered species.
They also offer us leisure centres, which is becoming increasingly important in the complexity of our world.
About 1.5 billion people living in rural areas poor depend directly forests for their basic needs food and wood heating.
However, deforestation is continuing.
Every year, we lose 14.6 million hectares of forest, an area nearly as much as four times Switzerland.
The management of forests irresponsible and accentuated by government regulations and obligations, too weak and the markets which reward illegal logging all conspire to deprive the world of its most precious forests and most threatened.
When the forests are beginning to disappear, a whole range of environmental, social and economic problems usually follow, which affect us all somehow.
The island of Sumatra in Indonesia is a good example.
Companies papers and pasta undertake endemic and illegal destruction of forests which keep the greater diversity of plants in the world.
It is highly likely that yet unknown plants disappear in the process as endangered species such as rhinoceros and the elephant in Sumatra, and orang-outang.
When the forest Sumatra will have disappeared, whole communities will also without appropriate locations of life or any decent way to earn their living.
Moreover, the distortion that the trade in illegal products and cheap products requires global markets is cause difficulties for the responsible citizens.
The developing countries are losing $15 billion tax revenue every year due to illegal logging.
To complicate the wood demand for reconstruction following the tsunami of last year, has intensified a request already unsustainable in Sumatra forests.
The Amazon basin and the Congo are the subject of similar threats.
A recent study of the United Nations, the Assessment of ecosystems for the millennium (EM), shows that the forests and other important areas are experiencing a serious decline of their poor management and will continue to disappear if serious protective measures are not put in place.
The information published by the Brazilian Government show that deforestation of forests irreplaceable in Amazonia, agricultural conversions, has reached 2.6 million hectares last year, which bears the total area of deforestation of the Amazon to 17%.
However, the battle against deforestation is not yet lost.
Various, organisations and movements of companies concerned about the forests global working together to overturn the phenomenon of deforestation and improve the management of forests.
For example, the WWF (the World Wildlife Fund) and the World Bank have helped the Brazilian Government to launch an initiative aimed at establishing new areas of protecting forests on more than 17 million hectares form of national parks.
The cooperation the WWF and the World Bank has also motivated other partners to establish a Trust Fund to manage these areas protected in perpetuity.
Similarly, a summit of leaders of the Congo Basin has cross-border cooperation for the conservation of forests and their enlightened management.
All this has led by following the release of USD 53 million from the US State Department to promote the conservation of forests of Congo.
Since the first meeting of the leaders in 1999, 3.5 million hectares of protected areas have been newly organised in the Congo Basin.
Nevertheless, given the consequences of the Asian tsunami last December, the weight of the arguments provided by the EM and statistics on deforestation of the most critical areas, we must continue our efforts.
The World Bank and the WWF have recently promised to work to the reduction of 10% of the world's rate of deforestation for 2010 and work with the institutions of the public and private sectors for ambitious achievements for the conservation of forests.
The WWF studies show that if global forests are shared between different uses, the protection of certain areas, responsible business management and the restoration of forest landscapes, we can provide for the needs global forest products while maintaining the environmental and social values essential to our immediate future.
The leaders of companies, governments, civil society organisations must all play their role in the implementation of this vision.
The Saudis are fanatical?
The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia led many to question the prospects for survival of the Maison Saud prevailing and about the question of whether the kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive or not.
For some reason or another, it seems that the Saudi society has generated a course of violent fanaticism which draws its inspiration in extreme religious orthodoxy.
The fact that 15 of the 19 of the air pirates who took part in the attacks of 11 September 2001 against the US were Saudis has crystallised a deep-rooted perception of kingdom as bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.
In some ways, this perception is right, but it cannot be applied to the Saudi entire population.
On the contrary, it would be a serious mistake to assume that Islam fanatical fully defines the Saudi attitudes toward religion.
Between 2001 and 2003, I was part of a team to carry out a study large scale of values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and Jordan.
Our results have produced a remarkably nuanced image of Saudi attitudes.
In comparison with respondents living in other countries in the Middle East, the Saudis proved less religious of all in general, and their attitudes towards democracy and marriages managed indicate a moderate underlying sentiment.
It is true that in the four countries, religiosity is widespread, more than 90% of those surveyed indicating collectively they believe in God, life after the death, and heaven and hell.
But the Saudis appear less religious that their Muslim sympathisers.
Soixante-deux percent of the Saudis are described as individuals, religious against 82% of Iranians, 85% of Jordanians and 98% of Egyptians.
The Americans also appear to be more religious Saudis and 81%.
This variation can be explained in part by transnational differences on the meaning of 'religiosity.
For example, the Americans can define religiosity differently to the inhabitants of the countries of the Middle East, perhaps with a less pronounced attachment to religious beliefs in Islamic countries.
This could also realise part of the differences between the Muslim countries.
However, the gap between the Saudis from one side and the Iranians, Jordanians and the other Egyptians for religiosity autodéfinie, is so great that it defies the widespread perception of Saudi Arabia extremely conservative and religion.
Indeed, the actions are more meaningful words: only 28% of the Saudis have stated that they attending weekly religious services, against 27% of Iranians, 44% of Jordanians, 42% of Egyptians and 45% of Americans.
These conclusions, contrary to popular perceptions of the Saudi culture, are less surprising that they appear.
The sociologists religion support for a long time in an environment monolithic religious, or when the religious institutions are closely linked to the state, the overall religiosity declining population.
It is sensible to think that when the authorities of the state applying rigid behavioural codes, individuals tend to revolt and alienate the officially confirmed religious institutions.
It is thus not surprising that the Egyptians and Jordanians, who live in countries in which the state does not apply filial, are more religious that the Iranians or the Saudis, which must deal with the police "under 'local supported by the state.
Even on the issue of marriage, many Saudis expressed opinions surprisingly liberal.
The respondents were shared almost equally on the issue of managed marriages, half supporting the marriage must be based on parental consent, against 48% love considered basis of marriage.
Given the gender segregation and paternal dominance firmly rooted, it seems reveal a strong desire to individual choice greater in what has always been traditionally a family decision.
Finally, the Saudis are reveal the advocates of democracy, contradicting once again the image of widespread Saudi conservatism.
On all the Saudis interviewed, 58% saw democracy as the best form of government, 23% were in disagreement and 18% have not expressed.
The massive support for democracy in a country without secular and nationalist history seems contre-intuitif.
In fact, support for democracy corresponds to several other liberal attitudes that we have identified in Saudi Arabia.
The advocates of democracy tend to be less religious and secular, more tolerant towards others, more critical of the actions of the public sector, and more worried by the Western cultural invasion.
Beyond the data from the study, history has shown that the liberal ideas becoming more widespread when a despotic monarch governs with the support of a religious institution.
A strong abreast of liberalism arose at the end of the ninth century in Syria Ottoman in response to religious despotism Sultan Abdulhamid.
At the same time, a secular movement anti-clérical on behalf of constitutionalism has appeared in Iran, in response to the absolutist alliance between the shahs Quajar and religious institution.
In the light of similarities between these historical precedents and the current conditions in Saudi Arabia, we should not dismiss the possibility of reform.
The data from the study also suggests that the Saudis could well demand a more transparent policy and a less interventionist religion.
The European museum
At the end of the 19th century, Asia accounted for Europeans artistic inspiration or the target of imperialist ambitions.
Unlike, Europe was a symbol of modernity - for the Japanese era Meiji -- or decadence -- for the Chinese.
A century later, through the Japanese economic miracle, Europeans considered at least a small part of Asia as a centre of technological and industrial progress rapidly.
Today, at the dawn of the 21st century, the mutual perceptions of Europe and Asia are change, with flourishing Asian economies and a European Union with identity crisis.
Some Asian personalities important, as the former Prime Minister Kuan singapourien Lee Kuan launch warnings to Europeans: if they continue on this launched, their continent will soon be more interest for tourism and property of high-end.
A business Chinese influence, which shares his time between Hong Kong and London, was more precise.
He said a few weeks ago, at a private demonstration in Paris gathering political leaders and large entrepreneurs: "You are becoming developing countries. You wasting your time with the Constitution, the welfare state, the crisis in the funding of pensions, and you add systematically the wrong replies to questions that you raise."
The idea that Europeans are Asia in general, and in particular of China, is more complex. It is lucid adaptation to a respectable new competitor, the ideological pure and simple rejection.
In mai1968, some French students taken to the streets to invent a new world dreamt of Mao's China, a country yet plunged into a brutal and senseless Cultural Revolution.
This absurd excitement was both ignorance of the crimes of Maoist regime, boredom felt in a prosperous society near full employment.
Today, their heirs openly criticise the Asian capitalist model.
China, once star anti-capitalist revolutionary utopian, became the enemy ultra-liberal feared by a new generation of reactionary utopian, who defend the status quo in Europe.
The students who have demonstrated recently in the streets of Paris do not want to imitate the Chinese and the Indians; they refuse the logic of globalisation and the abandonment of social acquis hard won.
The attitude of European economic elites is very different.
They have understood that their ideas post-colonial hint of nostalgia, that China and India would large markets for exports and immense reservoirs of labor cheap, are obsolete.
These countries have become real competitors worthy of respect, even admiration.
The quality, the costs and deadlines - in the car industry, for example - are achieving the European level.
Europe retains an advantage in scientific disciplines, such as the pharmaceutical industry, but new very efficient companies, particularly in India, manage to recruit MIT graduates and Harvard -- and through wage costs still lower -- to remain competitive on a global scale.
Unfortunately, if the European leaders have realised the Asian challenge, they have not managed to translate into a lesson of realism, in a context of globalisation irresistible, or a call to arms in the economic and social field.
In fact, European politicians, with very few exceptions as Tony Blair, too slow to adapt to fulgurantes developments in Asia.
Dépourvus long-term strategy, and obsessed with short-term interests, the European politicians - unlike the Heads of companies - have not gained their Asian counterparts.
The fact remains that, in a continent that has failed to bury the past and to end the spectre of nationalism, the EU is also a model of reconciliation, peace and prosperity.
But this image can survive a further decline?
For Asians, the European model could become a political version of Venice: a place with the visit nostalgia from greatness, as an admirable museum.
Red and blue
The appointment of Condoleezza Rice as US Secretary of State Colin Powell replacement shows that the recent presidential elections have still powerful repercussions.
It is important that the Americans, but also mainly the world understand what these elections show of America.
The presidential election of this year shows that the US démocracie is healthy, and that some things gain to be improved.
Contrary to the election of 2000, where President Bush had not received the support of the popular vote and barely won the vote of the electoral college, Bush has prevailed 3.5 million votes this time.
While some Democrats remain bitter, the legitimacy of the victory of Mr Bush cannot be called into question.
America is strongly divided between the Member States red, Republicans, and blue states, democrats.
If 100 000 votes had swung in the Ohio State red, John Kerry would become President (despite a minority popular vote).
The electoral college was incorporated in the US Constitution to protect small states in the federal system and today means that the election campaign now focuses very largely on a dozen states, battlefields where public opinion is closely divided.
Basically, there is something implausible in the election of Presidents without popular majority.
It is therefore time to discuss the amendment of the constitution to abolish the electoral college.
Some observers complain about the rhetoric and good negative advertisements to sow discord which have characterised this campaign.
It must be appreciated in a historical perspective.
At the time of the founding fathers, newspapers easily took party and George Wahsington sums up dismayed by the harshness of language policy.
For the bulk of its history premium, not to mention the civil war and the period of reconstruction, the country was also closely divided that it is now the rhetoric and bitter campaigns has always reflected this close competition.
Nevertheless, despite the negative advertisements for both sides, the three national televised debates have raised important issues in a serious format and have been largely followed.
In general, President-in-Office enjoying economic growth has every chance of being re-elected.
In this sense, the real surprise of the re-election of Mr Bush was little room for its majority.
In large part, this is due to the unpopularity of the war in Iraq.
Kerry has tried to transform the war, the low rate of employment, inadequate medical coverage and tax credits from Mr Bush towards the privileged classes of the central issues in the campaign but some observers have felt that failing to send a clear message.
Mr Bush combating with the issue of security against terrorism and cultural populism on certain issues such as gay marriage and abortion.
Finally, the cultural populism and security won against economic populism.
The interpretation of the elections was influenced by the exit polls in which the voters were pronounce (after having voted) on the issues that ontle counted for them.
Most (22%) has answered ‘the moral values', compared only 20% have mentioned the economy and 19% terrorism.
The social conservatives have interpreted as meaning that they had won the election of Mr Bush and their programme should dominate its second term.
However, a Pew poll a week after the election indicated that the category of moral values' embrace a large variety of issues of rights to abortion and gay marriage.
In fact, polls show that 25% of public defends gay marriage and 35% are in favour of civil unions legal gay couples (position defended by Kerry).
Nevertheless, for the 37% who oppose gay marriage in particular in the Member States red centre of the country, the issue has helped to unite the supporters of Mr Bush to come to the polls.
The question is, overall, if the US are divided beyond any hope.
The electoral card red and blue states has led Internet jokes and designs humorous on secession both shores of blue with red centre of the country.
Some appelent 'Côtopie'.
But the divisions are not so clear.
In both sides, many Member States have been won by a small margin and if colore cards county from the state, the country turn violet.
Cities against suburbs and rural areas would be a better description of the situation instead of Côtes against heart of the country.
Indeed, public opinion polls show that the majority of Americans are concentrated in the moderate centre of the political spectrum rather than the two extremes.
But the political elites as political activists and members of Congress tend to be more extreme that the public.
At first, it seems surprising, since they should feel attracted by the centre, rich in votes.
However, many members of Congress represent districts acquired their party and the real threat towards their re-election stands to primary parties, dominated by the most militant wings and the most extreme parties.
This trend is reinforced by the rise of the cable television, which attracts viewers in controversial programmes info-divertissement, and the authors of chronic Internet called Blogs embark on persistent controversies without editorial filter.
A reform which would change the borders of Congress districts to make them more competitive permettrer to respond to this problem, but little elected vote for such changes which might increase the risk of their defeat.
The low margin of results suggest that Mr Bush does not really the mandate of change it think won.
Given the difficult issues in foreign policy, taxation and dociale, it would be wise to turn to the centre rather than to reconcile its conservative basis, but the policy which prevails between the policy of conviction or pragmatic policy remains uncertain.
Décrochons oil!
The Chancellor Angela Merkel has made the fight against global warming the high priority of German presidencies of the European Union and the G8 which began in January.
Its practical proposal is fairly general that the leaders in account and accept, and quite clear that the other governments and businesses understands: at the next G8 summit, we must simply date on which the vehicles running on petrol will no longer be registered in the major industrialized countries.
This decision will have a positive impact considerable to geopolitical and economic levels.
Today, the real concern energy is not related to the reduction of world oil reserves, but rather the decline of the internal production of largest consumers -- Europe, the US and China -- when the growing demand from Asia strike the market.
The reserves available focus more in the Middle East, because those of other regions of the world will soon dry.
Moreover, the major exporters of oil are not prepared to submit their investment policies to market conditions.
Saudi Arabia wants to manage its only oil production and, for its part, Iran is afraid to potential investors with its bureaucratic obstacles and its corruption.
Iraq suffers from a lack of security, while foreigners under failure to every attempt to investment in Russia.
These four states contain half the world's oil reserves, two thirds potentially could be exported.
These factors, except the cost of production, are at the root of high oil prices and the race for contracts in Africa and in Central Asia.
The believing that the rise in oil prices is a good thing for the environment does not take account of basic data of international politics.
Firstly, in most poor countries of Africa and Asia, the import of oil represents a larger proportion of national expenditure in the industrialised countries, which means that economic growth and social development are compromise, and new crises threaten debt.
The rents output hamper reforms in the main exporting countries.
With the strengthening of their financial power, regimes such as those of Venezuela and Iran feel less constrained by international rules.
The latest entrants among the big countries consumers of energy, such as China, reproduce the old habits of the West industrialised and their long tradition of condone human rights abuses, to ensure lucrative contracts with authoritarian regimes and rich oil.
Only lorries political and economic, the industrialised countries which remain on the major oil consumers can undergo a change in the world.
It is important to begin by the transport sector, which represents at present more than half of the consumption of oil -- proportion certainly increase in the future.
Therefore, the G8 countries must give new vehicles more register travelling at petrol in 2025.
This decision is not directed against the mobility, but against the waste of a scarce resource to be used in producing synthetic materials.
Politicians must not give priority given technology.
They should encourage the motor industry to develop alternative technologies which use biofuels, ethylene, hydrogen and even natural gas, for a transitional period.
The countries that have opened the way to political will in this field, as collateral benefit, national industries are putting in place in the energy technology for the subsequent markets.
The important expected reduction of CO2 emissions could eventually lead to the necessary progress of international policies on climate.
The economic development between at stake: if we soignons our 'oil dependency, the poor and less developed countries, and the newly industrialized countries, could have more, which would lower prices and calmerait energy competition.
In geopolitical level, the profits would be equally obvious, particularly the big oil exporting countries would be less able to blackmail the industrialised countries.
This reversal increase the strength of negotiation of the international community in the Middle East and consolidate the social forces in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia, which seriously wish to promote economic and political reforms of the interior.
Great producer car countries and advanced technology, Germany is well placed to launch such an initiative.
Angela Merkel, which holds a PhD in physical and began his political career Minister of the Environment -- chairing in 1995 the first Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change -- would be more credible than any of his colleagues in the European Union and G8 to deal with the problem.
It is high time to carry out an act of political bravery.
The Myth of humanitarian aid and trade
Humanitarian aid and trade became buzzwords international.
Increased aid (accompanied by a debt relief) and improved access to the markets of rich countries for the products of poor countries: now seems to have taken the top of the international agenda.
In fact, the debate today concerns measures, but on the quantity of measures and with what speed.
Perdues: the clear lesson of the past five decades of economic development.
In the forefront of these lessons, we discover that economic development is left largely in the hands of poor nations themselves.
The countries which are managed in a recent past have succeeded through their own efforts.
The humanitarian aid and the markets have played a minor role.
Take the example of a developing country which has a free and preferential access to the market for its largest neighbour, which is also the most powerful economy in the world.
Suppose that this country is able to send millions of its citizens work on the other side of the border, receive a huge volume of foreign investment and fully integrated international production chains.
Moreover, the country's banking system is supported by its neighbour rich and its stated desire to act as lender of last resort.
Globalisation could not come under better than those auspices, is it not?
Consider a second countries now.
This report must face a trade embargo on the largest market, receives no foreign aid or any form of support from the Western world is excluded from international organisations such as the WTO and cannot borrow among the IMF and the World Bank.
If these external handicaps were not sufficiently debilitating, we can add an economy which itself maintenance of barriers against international trade (in the form of trade state, tariff barriers and the import of quantitative restrictions).
As was able to guess the reader, these countries do exist: the Mexico and Vietnam.
Mexico shares a border of 3 200 kilometres long with the US, which offers not only privileged access to a market of goods and labour, but also to the US Treasury resources (such as the experience of the peso crisis in 1995 has demonstrated).
However, America has maintained its trade embargo against Vietnam until 1994, has not reinstated its diplomatic relations before 1995 and has given the status of a nation's most favoured the Vietnamese imports that years later.
Vietnam is still not entered the WTO.
Consider now their economic performance.
Since NAFTA in December 1992, the Mexican economy has experienced an average annual progress barely more than 1% per capita.
Not only this figure is well below the rate of champions of the Asian economy, but it is also only a fraction of own growth performance Mexico decades before the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).
Vietnam, however, has experienced an annual progress of 5.6% per capita since the stages of its economic reforms in 1988 and the restoration of diplomatic relations with the United States in 1995, and has experienced a continuous rapid growth rate of 4.5% since.
Vietnam has witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty while Mexico has experienced a fall in real wages.
These two countries have experienced a pronounced take-up of international trade and foreign investment, but the picture is very patchy where it more account: in the improvement of living levels, particularly among the poor.
What these examples show that domestic efforts dwarfs all the other elements in determining a country's economic fortunes.
All that the US market had to Mexico could not counteract the consequences of policy mistakes on the internal market, particularly the inability to reverse the real exchange-rate appreciation of the peso or to extend productivity gains achieved in narrow sector export to the rest of the economy.
What counts most remains the adoption by a country with an appropriate strategy for growth.
Without any of the advantages enjoyed Mexico, Vietnam has pursued a strategy counteracted on the diversification of its economy and the improvement of production capacity of local suppliers.
The experience of the post-war overall underpins the proof that domestic policies are the most important.
South Korea has got off at the beginning of the 1960s, not when foreign subsidies were to their height, but when they began to dry up.
Taiwan has not benefited from foreign subsidies or privileged access to certain markets.
China and India, the economic superstars time, flourished largely through their own efforts for economic reform.
It is tempting to get account of external demand for their export products the few African success, Botswana and Mauritius (respectively diamonds and clothing), but this cannot go very far.
Obviously, these two countries would be much poorer without access to foreign markets.
However, as in all cases of successful development, which distinguish are not external advantages they enjoy but their ability to exploit these benefits.
It is enough to see how other countries have wasted the advantage that they purchase their natural wealth.
The word 'diamonds' does not particularly born with an image of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.
Similarly, few areas of treatment of exports proliferation-proof throughout the world have experienced the level of development that we look Mauritius.
But that does not detract rich countries from their obligation to help.
They can lead difficult to corrupt dictators, sharing best financial information and refusing to recognise the international contracts that they sign.
Similarly, the increase in the number of workers in poor countries allowed to work in the rich countries and a wider range of policies oriented towards growth through the relaxation of the WTO rules and conditions imposed by the US produce a greater impact on long-term development.
It is not proven that the enlargement of access to markets and subsidies is the best use to make political capital in the northern hemisphere.
The development should focus on improving the political environment in the poorest countries, rather than on aid and trade.
Interdépendances
If the great economist Argentine Raul Prebisch was living today, there is no doubt that it would take if the world came to turn towards.
Its largely influential theory of dependency hyped if the poor countries too based on exports of raw materials, they never achieve the industrial level needed to support rapid growth.
They embourberaient in place in a global round of decline in prices of raw materials and endless reduction of income.
The answer favorite Prebisch protectionism, was disastrous for the many countries of Latin America and Africa which have followed.
But the fact is that over the years, Prebisch seems to have had the right response to trends in raw material prices in the long term.
The permanent efficiency gains in the areas of agriculture and the extraction of natural resources have lower prices of raw materials, especially in the 1980s and 1990s.
With few exceptions, countries which have focused on exports of raw materials have only achieved paltry results, while the Asian countries with few resources have made rapid progress.
Today, however, with the Asian giants, India and China, who join the global economy, the price of petrol, gold, durum wheat and practically all other raw materials soar.
Admittedly, there will always cycles (the price of oil, for example, fall undoubtedly again to restart its rise) but the long-term trend of many raw materials clearly remain upward for some time yet.
What numerous trade negotiators and other policymakers have seemed not yet recognised, while Prebisch would have understood immediately, is that this sudden downturn contains huge implications for the world balance of powers.
Indeed, no other aspect of economic globalization launch of greatest challenges to the leaders of the world over the coming decades.
There are many questions.
The rich countries today are prepared to enter into a period of co-dépendance and they will also desperately seeking raw materials that developing countries are industrialised products and technologies?
Are they prepared to the inevitable flow of power and influence towards commodity-dependent countries as they enrich?
How are the two great powers in the world, China and the United States, are going to manage the fact that important exporting areas of raw materials in Africa and the Middle East to Central Asia are covered by poorly trained nation-states?
Some self-appointed prophets expose the problem as reserves of natural and claim that the raw materials the most critical scaling-down an alarming rate.
Nowadays, many followers of the "theory of the peak Hubbert 'oil production, which supports that we have reached the upper limits of our production capacity, drier wells, and that the situation is worse.
However, as the eminent oil historian Dan Yergin, birds of doom have boasted that resources black gold were to receive at least four times already.
Each time, radical technological progress off these threats.
In the late 1800, oil extraction of minesweeping involved with mulets.
Today, drilling 3 000 m under the soil oceans seems obvious to everyone.
Such progress in the areas of metal extraction and agriculture.
No, the world is not facing a forthcoming shortage of raw materials.
In fact, it happens that the integration of 2.5 billion people (China and India) in the global economy produces a shift of demand likely to put more pressure on the increase in the price of raw materials that no technological gains will probably able to counterbalance.
Therefore, and for at least 50 to 75 years, and perhaps even until human get to drilling on Mars in centuries to come, the price of many natural resources will rise.
The new balance of economic powers which result going to destabilise the global political situation?
The first World War was started in part by the concern of Germany before the monopolising by other colonial powers too much of the world's oil and raw materials.
Similarly, during the Second World War, Japan feared for the stability of its oil supplies and other natural resources from abroad.
Such tensions are going to arise between China uncertain resources (even water scarcity is problematic) and the West?
Fortunately, this does not seem likely for the moment, particularly in view of the approach that sober pragmatic of resources in their country demonstrated by the Chinese leadership.
The Chinese turn to regions such as Africa in the hope of finding stable trading partners.
They do not share the political évangélisme of the Americans, who want not only to trade with the exporters of raw materials, but also want convert.
And then there is the American leaders who speak to make the US self-sufficient in terms of energy resources.
This is a joke: sufficient, perhaps, but never auto-suffisants.
A large part of the Arab world believe, and it is understandable that the invasion of Iraq is the cornerstone of the American strategy to procure stable energy resources.
If they were right, we can only hope that America has a fallback.
Meanwhile, the prices of raw materials will continue to increase and oil exporters form the largest contributors to the yawning trade deficit in the US.
Perhaps the real American strategy does it do to try to oil exporting countries so much money that they become dependent on happiness they provide America!
This is a turning-point Prebisch never expected.
The choice of radical Iran.
The choice of Iranians to power radical mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, threatens to worsen relations with the West and exacerbating the country's isolation at international level.
However, in terms of national politics, Islamic regime will be may be better if a candidate more moderate had prevailed.
It seems clear that Ahmadinejad has a real basis for support.
The fact that it presented as a populist, he referred to help the poor, condemned the government and practically acted as an opposition candidate not: embody the choice of the regime, and eventually receive an official aid including against radical rivals.
The regime has shown great skill.
It has turned the candidate a little more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani, disagree with some government policies, figure in harmony with the established order, and its own candidate rebel.
The government has thus used the resentment against the establishment to consolidate its own power.
Given that the former president, Mohammad Khatami, supported the reformist movement, same me if it was rather foolish and it has ultimately nothing done, to stress the leaders have returned to their advantage the political situation.
Ahmadinejad is a representative of activists youngsters revolution of anti-Shah 25 years ago.
It is directly involved in the taking of hostages American in Iran, although we do not really know how.
The most worrying is that it is close to the two main groups who represent the most extremist elements of Iran: Corps of the guardians of the Islamic revolution and Basij organisation.
The first is an army parall pro-régime; the second is an organization which intimidating opponents and whoever is the search for a more open society.
However, this concern to see Iran in the hands of leaders even more radical is mixed by two factors.
Firstly, Ahmadinejad will undoubtedly concentrate on probl my national, and try - without can predict its chances of succ's - to improve the living conditions of the poorest Iranians.
Deuxi mement, the group in power since the revolution will continue to conduct the ideological and political étrang re.
The President has fewer powers that it seems, and it is particuli rement overshadowed by the supr guides me Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
In any case, the election of Ahmadinejad cr clarifies lying Iran challenge for the western policy and the stability of the Middle East.
Firstly, it signals to the most extremist elements of Iran and customers terrorists in this country -- the Lebanese Hezbollah, Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and several small groups acting against Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Arab countries -- they have the green light to launch their attacks.
They will no doubt estimate that Iran will support, although they.
On the surface, Iran has often shown relatively cautious, while playing to cover the role of global client's point of view of terror.
Iranian officials who have act individually, to command and coordinate specific operations, now feel free to do so.
In addition, Ahmadinejad openly advocates an intensive programme of obtaining nuclear weapons.
Most of the Iranian politicians, at least the government to allow act openly supports this programme, but favours a more discr approach to you and cautious.
Rafsanjani, brought the establishment of better relations with the West before the progress on the nuclear front.
If Ahmadinejad is the President of a nuclear Iran, it is more likely to use weapons of a risky way.
This does not mean that the use, but it would be for purposes of diplomatic blackmail, making climbing the threats of levels of crisis.
Since the Iranian leaders daily proclaiming their desire to wipe Israel from the map and to combat the US (Ahmadinejad market on the image of an American flag which goes vote), the risk of confrontation has increased.
Finally, Ahmadinejad is likely to defies to jeopardise the stability of Iraq, and its victory will encourage radical Iranian officials and Iraqi extremists.
Iran sends already numerous agents in Iraq and supports customers who seek to turn this country clone.
The Iraqis, including the Shia Muslims, who follow the same me version of Islam that the Iranians, usually reject such interference.
A more militant Iranian position will increase the friction with Iraq, and inspire further violence anti-American.
In short, the elections Iran is dangerous, same me if its potential destabilizer depends on acts of Ahmadinejad and the degree of power accord Khamenei.
In addition, a case also Iran openly extremist - radical same me according to the crit res a regime already hard -- will constitute a challenge not only for the US, but also for Europe.
The European countries going to continue to claim that the militant rhetoric and Ahmadinejad provocations are not and that it is possible to find diplomatic solutions to Iran's nuclear ambitions?
With Rafsanjani, a real agreement or at least the appearance of cooperation would have been easy to maintain.
But, with Ahmadinejad, it will take an immense dose of conciliation to maintain even the most minimal diplomatic procedure.
Some reformists and Iranian exiles rejoice in the election of Ahmadinejad, because they believe that his administration is more likely to show the true face of the regime and disabuse him of that notion of any hope of Western compromise.
But it can also symbolise the succ's regime to return benefit the dissatisfaction caused by a quarter of if cle gne r radical Islamist.
Whatever the consequences, Ahmadinejad's victory for the West means that everything to Iran will become even more difficult.
Consider the poor, give the rich
President Bush seems to ruin the US budget for the coming years.
When President Bush took office, the forecasts anticipated the budget surpluses as long as we could imagine.
Today, thanks to a mixture of irresponsible tax cuts launched by the Republicans, an economic slowdown, the collapse of the bubble in the stock market and a massive increase in military expenditure, the fiscal horizon is dominated by significant deficits.
The worst still to come, because the Bush administration and Congress to Republican majority preparing to aggravate the fiscal mess.
The havoc that they will probably weaken the US and increase the instability of the international economy.
Normally, the US Republican Party defended balanced budgets.
This changed with the Reagan Administration, when the Republicans Conservatives showed for tax cuts, even though it did with significant budgetary deficits.
The President Reagan announced the American people that he could enjoy both of tax cuts, the strengthening of the army and the continuation of their favourite spending programmes.
The result, no surprise, was a series of important budget deficits and the elimination took several years.
President George Bush Senior provided that President Bill Clinton last raise taxes to clean the chaos of the Reagan era.
These tax increases probably have contributed to the defeat of President Bush Senior by Bill Clinton in 1992.
However, Clinton bravely decided to conclude the process committed to restore the fiscal balance, partly to protect the long-term funding of pensions programmes for social security.
When Clinton walked the presidency in 2000, the budgetary situation was better decades.
Then came President George Bush son, prepared to redo Reagan with large tax cuts, a considerable increase in military spending and the continuation and even the development of popular programmes of expenditure.
The result was predictable.
In January 2001, the cumulative budgetary forecasts for the years 2002 to 2011 anticipated a budget surplus of 5.6 trillion dollars.
Mi-2002, these anticipated surpluses were evaporated.
In the light of these new economic conditions, and the shadow of the war against Iraq, one would expect that the Bush administration and the Republican Congress to be careful in defence of new tax cuts.
But far from their main priority is to put in place more tax cuts only the wealthy benefit in large part.
At the same time, the government calls for large increases in military expenditure.
With the approach of the presidential election of November 2004, we can be certain that no significant reduction in expenditure will come in the non-military programmes.
It seems that the massive budget deficits are intended to continue.
If domestic spending simply remain constant, a fraction of national income, the budgetary forecasts cumulative ten years anticipate a total deficit of 1.5 trillion dollars.
But this figure could be very optimistic, because it would probably not have the cost of a probable war against Iraq, or another package of tax cuts, or the risk of the increase in interest rates for years to come.
Why Republicans to show so little affected by this disorder?
Some Republicans are concerned more tax cuts for the wealthy classes for anything.
Others think that the deficits will lead by force significant reductions in internal government spending, thus reducing the participation of the state, which is their desire more expensive.
The problem with this last analysis is that most taxpayers are attached to social programmes and not easily will support large cuts.
The most intrigante question remains: why the Americans vote for such policies when they should know that it probably will result in problems.
A possible answers is that many voters do not come budgetary problems.
A better answer is that most Americans have not voted for these policies.
The participation rate of the election of 2002 was only 40% of voters, and only half of these 40% voted for the Republicans, around 20% of people entitled to vote.
Of course, the prospects must not be so bleak.
The war against Iraq will be avoided.
The tax cuts afoot could be abandoned or moderate.
But I predict significant budgetary deficits for the coming years and a growing feeling of unease in the USA and abroad about America's macroeconomic situation.
The investors may decide to reduce their funding of government budget and the deficit of America in favourable terms.
The dollar could weaken, and the fear of inflation could become even more pronounced.
All this will lose confidence in the US politicians who will then be less flexible in their responses to economic shocks.
The poor, the United States and abroad, could suffer most, since President Bush and Congress declare the American people and the world that there is no money available to address the issue of poverty, health and education, significant budgetary deficits.
If the average Americannot eye-opener on these risks, the wealthy tax could benefit from another gift of several billion dollars while the country and the world bear the harsh consequences for the years to come.
Lessons to retain fiscal recklessness of America
George W. Bush to destroy the economic policy of the US that all the other presidents of the American history, even exceeding its mentor, Ronald Reagan.
In just three years in office, he has destroyed a fragile political consensus which had asked ten years of effort and which may require another decade to be reconstructed.
But Bush risky health economic and social stability in the long term America.
Given that the budgetary challenges in the long term that the US handles extremely clumsily are not the only existing challenges, America's fiscal blunders offer important lessons to other countries.
The main problem with the fiscal policy is that politicians can easily be provisionally popular reducing taxes and increasing public spending by piling massive public debt and leaving their reimbursement to future elected.
This stratagem can last few years, but the budget deficits and public debt growing impose earlier than expected painful a change of policy.
A cynic might nonetheless buy re-election and perhaps be party to retire when the crisis comes.
One might imagine that after decades of similar episodes of political irresponsibility in the world, the voters would allergic to this type of ploy.
However, Bush's new applies buying today popularity distributing massive tax cuts while simultaneously increased military spending and spending on education and health.
The budget deficit thus obtained amounts to more than 5% of GNP.
Worse still, the long-term budgetary outlook of America were worrying before Bush starts to implement its policies reckless.
The American population is ageing, so that the costs of pensions and health care systems financed by public funds will increase dramatically.
detailed calculations show that income will be available through the fiscal policies advocated by Bush are likely to achieve the tens of trillion dollars which represent the costs of state pensions, health care and other fiscal spending expected by the people.
At some point in the future, it must greatly increase tax recoveries, drastically reduce public spending, or both, to compensate for the actions of Bush.
So why the population showing greater support its policies?
Because it understands little these consequences on the long term, or that it cares little, even if these consequences will eventually have an impact on the majority of Americans.
The rich taxpayers are delighted because they have benefited from the bulk of the tax cuts.
So surprising that it may seem, 5% richer American taxpayers have benefited from around half the tax cuts and the rich taxpayers expect clear that the other 95% (SMEs and the poor) bear the majority of future spending cuts and tax increases.
Meanwhile, Bush has convinced a large number of voters poor voters and SMEs that they should also be satisfied with their fate and tell them that they will have to pay their small tax cuts by larger reductions in future governmental services if the policies of his administration prevail over the long term.
If the Americans had a political memory, they understand that they have already gravi this' Russian mountain tax over the last 20 years.
Ronald Reagan also took its functions promising massive tax cuts and large increases in military expenditure.
This ended by an enormous budget deficit in the mid-1980.
The tax cuts made Reagan extremely popular and have allowed him to be re-elected in 1984.
It then took a decade (from the second term of Reagan until the mandates of George Bush, and Sr. Bill Clinton) to return to a budget surplus.
Of course, this result has need the approval of new tax increases, which has cost his re-election George Bush, and Sr. has led to the polarised policy of the 1990s.
History has great opportunities to be repeated.
Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush administration believe that the current budgetary deficits will result in a drastic reduction in government social spending.
They hope to dismantle programmes such as social security and Medicare.
But the American people strongly supports these social programmes.
So the strategy is to reduce taxes to lead necessarily subsequently cuts in social programs is doomed to failure and inevitably will lead to the increase in tax rates.
Other ideologists of the Bush Administration support that the tax cuts play a crucial role for the US out of recession.
This argument is also wrong.
America's economy could have recover without the tax cuts, and perhaps even more firmly.
In any case, it is a monumental mistake to establish tax long-term policies on the economic cycle short term.
The other countries have two essential lessons to retain this situation.
The first is that the budget deficits imminent US sooner or later limit America's international power.
The Americans have supported the war in Iraq just because they had not to subsidise higher taxes.
When the Americans will be forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be much less inclined to support costly military operations abroad.
Indeed, the US will deeply divided internally when the population will grappling with the fiscal mess left by Bush.
The second lesson is that countries must plan their budgets according to the growing fiscal costs incurred by an ageing population.
The budgetary long-term conditions are rarely taken into account by the taxpayers or parliament.
Governments must be persuaded to submit budgetary assessments on the long-term along their annual budget proposals to reduce the trend towards a political manipulation in the short term the budget.
The US can play the role of a warning for other countries.
The White House should give other countries the same board magicians television give their spectators: 'Do not try to make such among you'.
The politicization of securities markets
Many economic and financial analysts complain that the securities markets emerging countries are often heavily manipulated by their governments and economic policies.
By contrast, a primitive force of economic nature governing the securities markets in advanced countries and predict their performance amounts to predict the growth of trees.
This description of securities markets in emerging countries is not false, just one-sided, because the same description applies to securities markets in advanced countries.
Indeed, the best analysts predicting know that the performance of the securities market of any country basically amounts to predict the extent to which the government wants investors of securities markets involved in the current political environment.
Take the securities market of the US, far more important in the world.
The government leaves the calm companies and returns in the securities market US reflect the fundamental forces of a solid capitalist economy.
This partly explains why the US attract portfolio investors in the world.
But returns which make American securities markets if attractive reflect a fragile political balance.
In particular, tax rates which affect securities varied in time with the change of political pressure.
During the Second World War, for example, the political support for large fortunes has fallen and the government increased taxes on capital gains, dividends and high incomes in general.
When the Second World War helped to redress the economy considerably weakened by the Great Depression of the 1930, President Roosevelt and Congress have established a tax on windfall profits to ensure that the shareholders do not emerge a benefit too accordingly.
By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but the securities market was low, American voters elected Ronald Reagan, a man judged by many as too right-wing president.
He asked, and obtained, tax cuts on capital gains, dividends and incomes.
The political interference in the securities market not only on taxes on capital gains, dividends and incomes.
The property taxes, indirect taxes, import duties and taxes on sales, which are all paid, directly or indirectly, by businesses, can have an extended impact on company profits and therefore on the securities market.
It is no coincidence where develop securities markets, governments ensure that these taxes for lowering the after-tax corporate profits.
Indeed, the policies of securities markets do not stop taxes.
Instead, almost every activity of government affects company profits and, subsequently, the securities market.
After the crash of securities markets of 1929, the US Government has suspended a large part of the anti-trust activity which allows companies to acquire a monopoly increase their value.
This policy has delayed the reduction of high unemployment, but was not enough to control the political forces deployed to support the securities market.
Similarly, one of the most important actions undertaken by the President Reagan was to destroy a large part of staying power of America unions, which compete for their share industry.
The victory by Reagan during the strike of air traffic controllers in 1981 was a watershed for the US trade union movement, and also for the securities market launched its market spectacular increase in 1982.
The US Government was particularly hard to support the securities market since the culmination of the illusion of stock prices in 2000, and especially to reduce interest rates repeatedly.
Of course, this measure was justified publicly in terms of stimulating the economy, and not in terms of support for the securities market.
But it is very revealing of the scale of US securities market that one of the most important factors which weigh on the economy concerns the price of actions in decline.
Indeed, the response of the authorities is not limited to a monetary stimulus.
The national accounts of products and income of the US show that the actual rate of tax on company profits (the percentage of profits actually paid government form of taxes) has risen peak 33,7% in the first quarter 2000 (the record of the securities market and the economy in general and) has fallen to 20,2% in the fourth quarter of 2003, when the market was low.
A large part of this decline reflects the measures of tax relief passed by Congress and the perception among companies, in the economic and political environment current, they can more resilient to avoid paying tax.
Moreover, following the crash of the securities market, the maximum tax on dividends on securities from 35% to 15%, providing a new substantial benefit to investors in the long term and intensify the combined effect of reinvestment dividends after tax.
Again, this tax reduction was justified to stimulate the economy what can, of course, apply to almost any measure intended to support the securities market.
But it is the balance of political forces which determines the credibility of this kind of justification.
We could support the same variables, including the hostility of high taxes and a weak trade union movement, have worked in the US over the past 200 years and that they should continue to operate in the future, producing high returns on the securities markets and attractive influx of considerable foreign capital.
Those who believe that investment in the US securities market follow the same trend of growth for decades could well be right.
But it is important to be clear on the predicted.
The forecasts primarily relate not only on the economy, but also on the policy, even on cultural values, which shape the political and economic performance.
The property market worldwide
There is no more local investment property investment. The residence bought is rooted in a specific location, as a tree, and flourishes or languishes in grateful for local economic conditions.
The world vanish from the screen on our TV screens, but the property market, comprising almost exclusively local amateur, rarely crosses local geographical borders.
Soon, however, this could change.
In a month, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), together with my MacroMarkets society and Fiserv and Poor' Standard & 's launch, the options on long-term contracts on home prices in ten cities in the US.
Contracts will be based on price indices property S P &/Case-Shiller, established by the speculative research that my colleague Karl Case and myself conducted, almost twenty years ago.
For a long time, we démarchons in favour of a property market term, but no exchange, wanted to use these indicators to create such a market.
The long-term markets on home prices will allow the world investors to invest indirectly in the US housing, through these markets.
A buyer in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo will be able to invest in housing occupied by their owners in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, among others.
One of the fundamental principles of the financial theory -- the diversification or the distribution of risks -- implies that interest in these new contracts will be strong.
Companies and people in New York, for example, are overexposed local property risks, and by selling their long-term housing, they should succeed to reduce these risks.
Investors in Tokyo taking risks in buying long-term housing in New York, if the price is right.
The New Yorkers continue to live in their homes, having spread the risks of investment throughout the world.
The experience of a genuine market long-term homes uni-familiales has not been retentée since 1991, when the London Future options and Exchange (now called Euronext.liffe) has missed the launch of such a market.
This test has never created large volumes of transactions.
The stock market has launched a concept which has convinced person.
The UK markets diversified bets on home prices, as some retail markets online, never much reported either.
Will different this time?
Of course, the launch of a new market is still uncertain. people interested in an idea if it already tempting many others; if nobody is tempting, it did not attract more.
The same applies to the markets. There is not interested investors, it will not happen of transactions enough to generate profits for attracting others.
However, as is the case for all the brilliant ideas, we never know very well why they attract, we cannot predict the start of this new market, but we know that, sometimes, the success.
The initial indicators suggest that the growing interest in transactions term to home prices, mainly because of the current discourse on the buildings bubble, underlines the importance of the diversification of risks.
After the announcement of the CME, one of its competitors, the Chicago Board options Exchange, has declared its project of creating options on long-term contracts in the largest American regions, based on home prices means published by the National Association of Realtors (National Association of estate agents).
However, in addition to the strong public interest to property investment and risk coverage, another issue must be resolved for long-term markets operate: prices must be openly exposed and investors must understand the significance.
I believe that “shall there are major opportunities for these markets long-term soon lead to a drop in prices in certain American cities.
It will about déport ', as the traders say. Today, the price term on the market is lower than the price of a real estate.
Presumably, déport not emerge from the first day of real-estate transactions, but it should happen within a few months.
We could need déport if some of these markets effectively fulfil their duties.
Everyone knows that these cities have experienced a huge housing boom in recent years (indeed a global phenomenon widespread).
The international investors do not seem very inclined to invest in these cities, without the prospect of a fall in prices based on the markets long-term. people in Tokyo have learned to their cost.
If déport is important enough, even investors who believe that the US property market is full decline can always expect a good return home prices term, because they already benefit from lower prices on the market term.
Nevertheless, the New Yorkers will require adjustments to cover their own property investment, if they want to sell long-term contracts naturally causing a fall in prices.
They will be done to the idea that the market has already anticipated this decline and they cannot protect potential small margin which goes beyond this anticipation.
In fact, such adjustments in our way of thinking undoubtedly occur if we look carefully the future market price.
Up to now, the development of real estate prices has mainly been the result of various opinions.
When the markets create an international consensus on home prices in all the major cities in the world, it will be easier to manage the risks they encounter in stabilising their economies and, on the other hand, our own living standards.
But what moves markets?
Since 10 May around, the majority of global markets accused of strong cumulative declines, particularly in the two weeks around 23 May, with average in which persist downwards.
concerns on global stock markets are synonymous with concern for the economy of the world?
Consider the most marked reductions.
Among the main countries, the most impressive crash is one of India, where the current fell by 16.9% between 10 May and on 22 May.
The debacle on the other side of the globe took almost as many scale, and the ups and downs have only had a few days of mismatch with those of India: in Argentina, the current fell from 16.1%, Brazil's 14.7% and Mexico to 13.8%.
The European markets have also suffered huge losses.
In suède, the courts have plummeted to 15.2% between 9 May and 22 May; almost over the same period, they have fallen from 9.7% in Germany, 9.4% in France and the United Kingdom and 9.3% in Italy.
In Asia, courts have fallen by 11.5% in Korea, of 9.3% in Hong Kong and 8% in Japan almost over the same period.
Many commentators trying to combine these events in the situation in the United States.
However, the American courts accused a reduction of 5.2% between 9 and on 24 May.
China does not appear to be either behind this global decline since the current there have risen during this period.
The explanations of economists standard affect monetary policies.
In the wake of the great fear of deflation in 2003, the central banks in the world have reduced interest rates, causing speculative explosions on property markets and the stock exchange.
Today, according this point of view, interest rates rise to start, which augurs new declines in the markets.
There is undoubtedly an important element of truth in this argument.
The US Federal Reserve has increased its interest rates on 10 and its president, Ben Bernanke, then indicated that other increases could take place in the future.
On 17 May, a worsening of US data has been reported, which suggests future monetary tighten up the legislation.
Economists like to think that the world is logical and manageable, which means that they understand what is happening there.
But doing, they often exaggerate the role of central banks.
Indeed, the increase in American rates merely be in a number of increases in rates -- the 16th shifts.
No other major central bank has increased its rate after the decline of stock markets in May until 7-8 June, when several are (the European Central Bank, India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).
Another factor: the price of oil, which has increased by 24% between 22 March and 2 May, beating all records.
That would certainly be a major event capable of influencing the world markets.
The oil price rises play the role of guilty in practically all economic recessions since the Second World War.
Yet, the soared oil prices are not when the stock during fell, mid-May.
Bringing these increases caused markets declines requires a discrepancy of several weeks.
But the stock markets are not very logical, and a response to disregard clash of oil prices might be possible.
As for all in any financial market, an increase always draws attention.
When oil prices are rising rapidly, the people watching the information speak and discuss them of these increases, creating themselves greater sensitivity to these new.
The crisis in the Middle East is linked to oil prices, and it has been the dominant information of May.
There are signs of doom and the strong language used by various political personalities have been amplified in the spirit of investors by increases in oil prices.
On 8 May, the Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Peres, in response to the hostile statements by the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has told that "the Iranian President should remember that Iran could also be wiped off the map."
Similarly, around the beginning of the stock collapse of May, Ahmadinejad has visited Indonesia, the country counting the greatest number of Muslims in the world, and newspapers have reported on 13 May he had received a genuine ovation of students from two of the best universities in the country.
This history may have been interpreted as evidence that brinkmanship Ahmadinejad in the nuclear sector will political dividends, fueling the perception that the tense situation in the Middle East could lead to other oil price rises.
These newspaper articles may seem far more remote stock markets that monetary policy.
But the public reaction that there, as well as the recent increases in oil prices, could enter a good measure in the change in the market psychology.
The attitudes risk change with time, and events such as the remarks d Ahmedinejad and Peres can rush these changes.
So, although these events are difficult to quantify, perhaps analysts should pay great attention to the words of Ahmadinejad on Bernanke when they try to understand the direction that take the world stock markets.
Economists love may not concentrate on public mentality and how it interacts with the price fluctuations, the new global and dynamic speculative.
This would mean that the economic events are less predictable (economists and omniscients less) that they do not keen to imagine.
However, a view intuitive it would be logical to do.
What is really in the forefront of investors?
Ahmadinejad is a charismatic figure, Bernanke.
Ahmadinejad is embarking upon an adventure, Bernanke.
And, perhaps the most important, Ahmadinejad affects destabilizing, Bernanke.
Whatever their cause the final, the world stock falls in mid-May indicate a market psychology unstable.
It is hard to believe that they were linked to views on possible monetary policies, and not to wider issues and deeper, notably on energy and political tension, which are the foundations of the performance of the global economy.
Why pay more for fair trade?
Marks & Spencer, the chain of supermarkets and clothes owner of 400 shops in Britain, has just announced that it would convert his comprehensive range of cafes and thés including 38 different products on the label Fair Trade ', the symbol of marketing production' ethical '.
The chain already sold only tea and coffee concerning the label in those 200 coffee shops' Café Revive.
It also encourages the purchase of shirts and other goods produced in cotton from fair trade.
This announcement has taken place during the Quinzaine 'Fair Trade'. During these two weeks of promotion of labelled products, the presentation sessions have been held with producers in developing countries to explain how the British this form of trade has helped their communities.
The movement towards a more ethical consumption knows a significant advance in the United States. consumers looking increasingly towards organic food or local products such as eggs from hens high freedom.
In the UK, a study has shown that more than 50% of those surveyed recognised symbol of fair trade and understand that products concerning the label complying more working conditions of developing producers.
There is no study comparable to the US, but the data reported and the discussions I have had with my own students suggests that the figure would be less for the Americans.
The traders seeking certification Fair Trade producers must pay a price covering the costs of sustainable production and a living wage.
For example, the minimum during a pound of coffee · 1.26, whatever the reduction in the level in the market.
If the market price exceeds that figure, the tariff Fair Trade increase in order to remain more five hundred/book.
As for small producers, they must organise cooperatives or other types of groups allowing democratic participation.
The plantations and factories can claim Fair Trade mark if they offer a decent wage their workers, if they conform to health, environmental and safety standards, if they allow trade unionism or any other form of workers associations, if they provide a decent accommodation workers who work far from home, and if they use or forced labour or child labour.
Everybody is not fair trade.
Brink Lindsey Duisenberg, the centre of studies on trade policies of the Cato Institute, pro-marché body, believes that the campaign for coffee labellisé Fair Trade is a "deadlock paved with good intentions'.
It is justifying that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices lies not in the achievement of excessive profits by the multinationals, but in the considerable increase in the production of coffee Brazil and Vietnam, combined with the new techniques allowing culture caféière working less and therefore cheaply.
In view of Lindsey, if we want to help the coffee growers, we must encourage them to abandon coffee to turn towards more profitable crops -- here is right to insist on trade restrictions imposed by the rich countries and on subsidies which constitute obstacles to be deleted -- or towards products of high added value, such as the special cafes which can be paid more expensive.
What is odd to Lindsey argument, however, is that the campaign for coffee fair seems to exactly what it recommends, namely encourage the coffee growers to produce special cafes that can be paid more expensive.
Economists pro-marché are not opposed to companies which openly using the attractiveness of luxury to promote their products.
If people are prepared to spend · 48 for a pound of coffee Jamaican Blue caches, because it is the preferred coffee of James Bond, economists believe not, in this case, that the market is distorted.
So why so critical of consumers who want to pay · 12 for a pound of coffee they know that it was cultivated pesticide-free, under trees ombrageux for the survival of birds, by producers who can now feed and decently educate their children?
Economists could respond to that if we want to help people to feed and educate their children, it is possible to buy a pound of coffee non-équitable identical taste for · 10 and pay · 2 remaining a charity which distributes food and scolarise poor children.
This is indeed a possible strategy, and fair trade presents real benefits.
Producers know that they have to produce a coffee appreciated consumers not only for his taste, but also for the way in which it is cultivated.
If their coffee sold, they are proud to have produced a product sought in the world.
From the point of view of farmers receive a premium selling a product labellisé Fair Trade is preferable to the achievement of charity they receive anyway, that they work and, whatever the quality of their production.
Payment for a product labellisé Fair Trade is not more "anti-marché" spend more to buy a product of trademark Gucci.
Moreover, the label reflects better ethical priorities.
It is not just a subsidy by governments, its success depends on the market and not the political lobbied.
Fortunately, in Europe, this request is growing rapidly.
Hopefully she will soon reach levels of such everywhere in the developed countries, where consumers can decide on their way to spend their money.
The calves, pigs and the US democracy.
Among the flood of securities on the return of the Democratic majority in Congress after the elections in November, the result of an important ballot is largely go unnoticed.
Although it has highlighted the shortcomings of the American political system, he has also helped to believe again sympathy for the ordinary American citizens.
In Arizona, citizens can, if they have met a sufficient number of signatures, submit a draft law on direct popular vote.
This year, one of the issues universal suffrage was a law to ban gestantes sows or calves high for meat, to be detained or sanglés which prevents turn freely, to sleep or to expand their members.
Those who do not know the intensive farming methods astonished perhaps the need for such legislation.
The traditional farming, as it has world fifty years ago, and in some countries still allows animals to move and long, drawn-out.
But today, almost 90% of reproductive sows -- mothers of pigs reared and slaughtered for meat, bacon and ham -- spend the bulk of their lives in stalls which measured 60 centimetres by 2.2 metres.
They cannot turn, extending their legs once made, or shrink forward.
They are also sometimes sanglées to limit their movements.
Similarly, calves are confined their lives in individual pens where they cannot return to sleep, or long, drawn-out.
In essence, these methods aim to save labour costs. They facilitate the handling of animals and to employing fewer workers, and less qualified.
They also prevent animal waste energy or déplaçdant flying between them.
A few years ago, on protests of animal welfare organizations, the Commission of the European Union has requested a report to the Standing Veterinary Committee of the EU on intensive farming methods.
The report indicates that animals suffer cannot move and boredom have nothing to make entire days.
Of course, the simple good sense to achieve the same conclusions.
Leading following the report, the EU has set the dates from which the confinement of animals will be banned.
For calves, on 1 January 2007.
The individual sow stalls, already banned in the United Kingdom and Sweden, will be banned from 2013 throughout the European Union.
Measures to improve the welfare of laying hens, high battery cage cages without enough room for extending their wings, are also applied progressively.
In the US, this kind is planned.
Previously, when European friends asked me why the US accusing such a delay in the welfare of animals in Europe, I knew that answer.
If they insisted, I had to admit that a possible explanation was that the Americans cared less animals that Europeans.
Then, in 2002, associations of defence of animals Milanese to vote popular a proposal to ban on individual sow stalls in Florida.
In the general surprise, the proposal was accepted by 55% of voters.
The last month in Arizona, despite opposition generously financed by the food industry, the ban on containment boxes for calves and pigs has also been approved by 62% of voters.
Neither the Florida, or Arizona are particularly states progressive -- both have voted for George W. Bush against John Kerry in 2004.
The results of these two popular votes strongly suggest that if all the Americans were to decide on maintaining sows and gestantes containment calves, a broad majority can argue.
Ultimately, it seems that the Americans look like the Europeans living conditions of animals.
To explain the difference between the welfare of animals in Europe and the US, we must undoubtedly compare the political systems.
In Europe, the voters concerns about the living conditions of animals have found an echo among members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, as a result of the adoption of national legislation and EU directives to improve their lot.
In the US, against these same concerns did not have any visible effect on the members of Congress.
There is no federal legislation on the welfare of animals and virtually no legislation at Member State level.
Àb my view, tens of millions of dollars in the food industry enjoyed by representatives seeking to be re-elected for something.
The movement of defence of animals, despite a strong popular support, is not weight in the lobbying arena political and electoral donations.
In the US electoral races, the money into account the opinion of the electorate.
The party discipline is weak and the Congressmen themselves must meet the bulk of the funds needed for their re-election -- and every two years for the members of the House of Representatives.
In Europe, where the discipline of parties is respected and where the parties, and not the candidates, finance electoral campaigns, the money plays a less important role.
In the US, a country proud of its democratic tradition, calves and pigs are not the only losers.
But nine entirely new army comprising Afghans?
The murder of the Afghan Minister of the Aviation by a host (perhaps encouraged by the own interim administration in Afghanistan) shows that the Afghan society remains deeply showing cracks.
The first reforms on the Afghan army will only exacerbate these divisions.
The Minister of Defence of the temporary administration of Hamid Karzai in Kabul has appointed senior officers of this new army.
The Minister, General Mohammed Fahim Tadjik the Panjshir district in the North, which has become three months earlier leader of the Alliance forces northern captured Kabul after the American bombers have preparatory path.
As a group, its allocation is a direct challenge to the objective of reuniting the country of Mr. Karzai.
Afghanistan is a multiethnic nation, the most important group being Pashtounes, which represent the two fifths of the total population.
The Hasara and Tajiks respectively constitute a fifth of the population.
Of the 38 high officers as the general by Mr. Fahim, thirty-seven Tajiks, trente-huitième being a Uzbek.
If, on 15 to 17 million Pashtounes, some countries are recruited as soldiers, they serve under a command structure almost entirely composed of Tajiks.
The language of Pashtounes however differ from tajik as the Spanish and English, and millions of Pashtounes reaching the age of military service best few notions of tajik.
The geographical profile of the new military authority is also restricted its composition.
Thirty-five 38 on senior officers from a small area north of Kabul including the province of Parwan (where the airport in Baghram) and the valley close to Panjshir, along the bastion of the Alliance northern.
In other words, the potential Heads of twenty-seven from 29 Afghan provinces have been excluded from the new military elite of their country.
Such a small group could perhaps overcome the impression that its members are a clique closed if they represented a broad cross-section of dozens of the country's political parties.
But this is not the case.
Eighteen 38 senior officers have just one party, Jamiat-e-Islami, the Islamic faction that has long been headed by Mullah and former lecturer of Rabbani Burhanuddin theology.
It was this party gouverna Kabul briefly the mid-1990s, creating the carnage and chaos which led the majority of Afghan to welcome the Taliban come.
The Communists almost equalled the number of members of the Jamiat in the military hierarchy.
Sixteen 38 officers have long line on this party whose tricks in the late 1970s led to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89 which has cost two and a half million lives Afghanistan.
Most Afghans regard the Communists today with the same degree of sympathy that the Czechs or Poles earmark national socialists Hitler.
It is true that Afghans, as everywhere else, have joined the Communist Party for various reasons and they were not in any case all ideologues hardened cases.
But in the case of the general generals, six Fahim were professional workers of the Communist Party and continued to serve the Party after the invasion of the Red Army.
These six men, three communists who have served as officers in the Afghan army, have cooperated actively during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which has lasted a decade.
Imagine how the French would have reacted if a quarter of the body of French officers après-deuxième World War were joined the Wehrmacht during that occupy their country.
In Afghanistan, the new travel quickly to mouth ear.
The Afghan nationalist (i.e. almost all Afghans) soon discover the political reasons of the inner circle of General Fahim, if not already done.
Even this overwhelming evidence of partiality and bias in the high command of the new army could be outvoted if the general used to insert a professionalism and a commitment towards the patriotic values of armed forces really national in their task.
Unfortunately, only ten 38 officers promoted by Fahim have received a military officers training.
A eleventh has served as a pilot.
By contrast, 24 on the general 38 (training of four remaining generals remain unknown) are civilians, who had a profession, which come from the offices of the Communist Party or, in one case, which have been Mullah.
What mean all these statistics in terms of everyday reality?
They mean that when the Heads of international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, as well as the official US military and diplomatic, meet the Afghan Deputy Defense, they meet Abdul Rashid Dostum, a warlord and a Communist notoriously corrupt and brutal remains in contact with old friends of the Red Army always serve to Moscow.
This means that the leader of the Afghan armed forces and the head of operations and the secret service of the army are also communists, men whose loyalty remain uncertain and many Afghans distrust.
This team have any opportunity to unify a Afghanistan ravaged by war?
The presence in Kabul such a dubious team have any chance to instil confidence among three-quarters of the Afghan people who are excluded from the top military command?
Or this list rather represent the harvest of a "approach for the winner 'which the government is obliged - to a certain point in the future) to unleash another national bloody reaction by those whose legitimate interests have been trampled cynically?
The UN and the European and American politicians must reflect on these issues before consent to relentless power by a small minority unpopular.
Célébration irrational
Hurra for the new Nobel Prize winners of the economy: Daniel Kahneman of the University of Vernon Smith and Princeton University of George Mason Virginia.
As many Nobel Prize, these rewards acknowledge not only the decisive work undertaken by Messrs Kahneman and Smith, but also the schools of thought they helped to develop.
Mr Kahneman, psychologist, has shown that individuals systematically to behave less classical economists traditional do.
His work not only show that people sometimes act differently from economic theoretical predictions standard, but also that they are regularly and systematically, and which can be understood and interpreted in different assumptions that compete with those used by the traditional economists.
For most of the market players, and ordinary observers, this does not seem to big difference.
The brokers Wall Street as traffic with actions they know to be bad exploit the irrational that Mr Kahneman and Smith have demonstrated.
A large part of the excitement that led to inflating markets was based on the exploitation of psychology of investors.
In fact, this irrationality is not new economists either.
John Maynard Keynes described once the stock as not based on the struggle of individuals rational to discover the foundations of markets, but rather as a beauty contest in which the winner is the best entail those judges will say.
The Nobel Prize from this year celebrating the criticism of the market economy simplistic, as last year (I received with two other Members).
The winners of last year the emphasis on the fact that the various players in the market have different information (and imperfect), and that this information asymmetry was an impact on the functioning of the economy.
In particular, the winners of last year sous-entendaient markets are not effective; it remains governments play an important role.
The invisible hand of Adam Smith, the idea that free trade leads to the efficiency as guided by an invisible hand, is invisible in part because it does not exist.
This, too, is not new to those who work with daily markets (and are enjoying fortunes of this asymmetry of information and exceeding).
For more than 20 years, the economists are passionate for these so-called "models of rational expectations' 122 the principle that all actors have the same information (imperfect) and act perfectly rational, markets are fully effective, there is no unemployment (except when it is caused by the unions greedy or minimum wages imposed by governments, and there is no rationing of funding.
Such models are dominant, particularly in postgraduate courses in the US, despite the evidence to the contrary which show the triumph of ideology on science.
Unfortunately, the students in higher education programmes are now the decision-makers in many countries and they try to implement programmes based on these ideas, the so-called today's market fundamentalism.
Let me be clear here: the models of rational forecasts have contributed significantly to the economic theory; the rigour as their defenders have imposed on economic thinking has highlighted the weakness of many underlying suppositions.
Any good scientific thinking knows recognise its limits, but the prophets of rational forecasts have generally shown little modesty.
Vernon Smith is one of the leaders of the experimental economy, the idea that we can test of many economic proposals in a laboratory.
One of the reasons which the economy is so complex subject, which also explains the many disagreements between economists, is that economists cannot conduct controlled experiments.
The nature imbalance experiences real-life, but in most circumstances, both things can change quickly if it is often difficult to disentangle the causes of the consequences.
In principle, in a laboratory, we can conduct controlled experiments, and inférences reach more reliable.
The criticism of the experimental economy worry that the subjects are provided by the experimental contexts approaches determined outside the experience and experiences and inférences are not as clear and seconded in the physical sciences.
Nevertheless, the economic experiments, are making a certain knowledge of a significant number of issues, such as the design of auctions improved.
By above all, irrationality of market players, the main question for Mr Kahneman, is checked repeatedly in the context of laboratories.
One of the most fun results released by the experimental economy smacks of altruism and selfishness.
It seems (at least in situations experimental) that the experimental subjects are not as selfish economists believe, except one group: the economists itself.
Would that be because the economy is a discipline which attracts individuals who are, by nature, selfish or because the economy to shaping individuals so more selfish?
The answer, certainly takes a bit of both.
There is no doubt that the experimental research and the future work to resolve this issue of the relative importance of these two hypotheses.
The Nobel Prize shows how important it is to study the individuals and economies such as they are and not as we want to see.
Only better comprising the real human behaviour that we can expect design policies which will better enable to operate our economies.
Bush and its energy policy in bad faith
A more episode surrealist happened this year, during the World Economic Forum in Davos. experts in the oil industry have explained that the fonte skullcap polar -- much more quickly than all the forecasts announced - -- is not just a problem, but also a chance that enormous quantities of oil new will now available.
Similarly, these experts have recognized that the US refusal to sign the Law of the Sea, the international convention which determines access to offshore oil and other maritime mineral resources, represents a risk of international conflict.
They have also stressed the benefits: the oil industry, in his ceaseless quest for new reserves, does not need to plead Congress for the right to plunder Alaska.
President George W. Bush has a strange ability to understand the important messages.
For years, it is increasingly clear that its energy policy wrong.
Some members of his party refer to a former energy bill, written by the oil industry, as being very advantageous for all lobbyists.
As to the extols the virtues of the market economy, the sole objective of Bush is to grant huge subsidies to the oil industry, despite increasing deficits the country faced.
However, the market does not function properly when it is a question of energy. The government should take a sense totally opposed to the Bush administration has proposed.
The fact that the Americans do not pay the price of pollution -- and especially their enormous production of greenhouse gases -- resulting from their energy waste leads to a devaluation of the price of energy and blow, excessive consumption.
The government must encourage energy savings. His intervention prices, mainly through the energy tax, is an effective method to.
However, instead of promoting energy saving, Bush persists in a policy of "first dry America 'of its own resources, making in the future even more dependent on external oil resources.
Whatever a strong demand should make global oil prices and thus creates a windfall for many countries in the Middle East, which are not the best friends of America.
Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it seems that Bush has finally taken the measure of the growing energy dependence of America. It was difficult for him to see the consequences of the rampant rise in oil prices.
But, once again, the hesitant gestures of his government will not aggravate the problems in an immediate future.
Bush refuses to act even for energy savings and ultimately spent very little money to support his continued prayer of technological salvation.
What is to be done, then, the recent statement of Bush on its commitment to reduce, in the 25 years, America's oil dependency on the Middle East 75%?
For investors, the message is clear: no longer efforts in the new reserves in the Middle East, which are far less expensive oil resources in the world.
However, if there is no new investment in the reserves of the Middle East, the unbridled growth in energy consumption in the United States, China and elsewhere implies that the request exceeds the offer.
And to cap, threats of sanctions Bush against Iran could cause the termination of the supply of one of the largest producers in the world.
With a global level of oil production almost maximum and price having almost doubled since the war in Iraq, this augurs even higher prices and more profits for the oil industry, the only real winner of Bush in the Middle East.
Nevertheless, nobody should blame Bush for having recognized that there was a problem.
But, as always, its proposals are nothing other than a small trick of its administration.
Besides its refusal to admit global warming, to encourage energy savings or to allocate sufficient funds to advance the research, the great promise of Bush to reduce the American reliance on Middle East oil does not much.
With only 20% of America's oil extracted in the Middle East, the aim of Bush simply could be achieved by increasing supply modestly from other parts of the world.
The Bush administration must realise that oil benefits in the global market.
Even if America was completely independent oil from the Middle East, the reduction of energy production in this region would have devastating effects on world prices and fortiori on the American economy.
As is too often the case with the Bush administration, there is no clear explanation of the official policy.
Bush is it taking to play with the policy waving the sentiment and anti-iranien anti-arabe Americans?
Or is it yet another example of incompetence and confusion?
On the basis of what we have seen over the last five years, the right answer undoubtedly contains more than a bit of bad faith and sheer folly.
The roadmap in China
China is on the point of adopting its 11th five-year plan, putting the scene to extend what is undoubtedly the economic transformation most remarkable history, while improving the welfare of almost a quarter of the world's population.
Never before the world had experienced a sustainable growth; never before been Was such a reduction in poverty.
The explanation for long-term success of China partially takes in its unique association of pragmatism and vision of the future.
While much of the rest of the developing world, following the Washington Consensus, launched in a quest for increased GDP worthy of Don Quixote, China has once again clearly established that it sought increases more equitable and sustainable real levels of life.
China realise that it is entering a phase of economic growth imposing enormous demands on the environment cannot continue.
Unless change of course, living standards will be compromised.
It is for this reason that the new five-year plan really emphasis on the environment.
There are many parts of China among the most backward have grown so quickly crierait wonders if other parts of the country undergoing a growth even more quickly.
While this phenomenon has reduced poverty, inequality has increased, with growing disparities between urban and rural areas, and between regions of the coasts and the interior.
This year's report by the World Bank World Development Report explains why inequality, and not only poverty, should raise concerns; yet China's 11th five-year plan tackle head-on the problem.
The government mentions for several years a more harmonious society, and the plan describes ambitious programmes to achieve this goal.
China also recognises that what separates the least developed countries in the more developed countries is not only a disparity of resources, but also of knowledge.
It has therefore established bold projects to reduce these disparities and create a basis for an independent innovation.
China's role in the world and in the world economy has changed, and the plan also reflects this situation.
Its future growth will be based on domestic demand on exports, which implies an increase in consumption.
Indeed, China suffers from a rare problem: an excessive savings.
The people save partly because of weaknesses in the social insurance programs of government: strengthening social security (pensions), public health and education simultaneously reduce social inequality, increase the sense of well-being of the citizens and promote consumer staples.
If this works (and now China has almost always surpassed its own high expectations) these adjustments might impose enormous pressure on a global economic system already destabilized by the enormous fiscal and trade imbalances in the US.
If China is to save less -- and if, as announced its representatives, it pursues a more diverse investment policy of its reserves, which will finance the trade deficit of more than $2 billion per day of the United States?
This is an issue to another day, but today is not perhaps so distant.
With such a clear vision of the future, the challenge reside in the implementation.
China is a great country, which could not succeed without a vast decentralisation.
But decentralisation raises its own problems.
The greenhouse gases, for example, are global problems.
While America declares that it has the means to do anything about the highest Chinese officials have acted more responsible manner.
In the space of one month after the adoption of the plan, new environmental taxes on cars, petrol and wood products have been imposed: China uses market mechanisms for solving environmental problems and those of the world.
But the pressure on those responsible for local governments to create economic growth and jobs will be enormous.
They will be tempted to say that if America is not capable of producing to protect our planet, how them please?
In this vision translated into action, the Chinese Government will need strong policies, especially consistent increases in taxes on the environment.
While China became a market economy, it saw to develop certain problems which are the scourge of developed countries: specific interests concealing personal interests under a mask of market ideology.
Some effect expanding the trickle-down: you do not for the poor, the final everyone eventually benefit from growth.
And others oppose competition policies and the strict laws of corporate governance: let Darwinism operate its wonders.
Growth arguments will to counter strong social and environmental policies: for example, increase taxes on gasoline kill our infant industry.
Such policies supposedly pro-croissance fail not only to provide growth, they threaten the whole of the vision of the future of China.
There is only one way to avoid this: the open discussion of economic policies in order to reveal the specious and provide the means to implement creative solutions for the many challenges China today.
George W. Bush has demonstrated as it is dangerous to abuse of secrecy and restrict the decision-making to a narrow circle of sycophantes.
Most people outside China do not realise how its leaders, conversely, engaged in extensive deliberations and extensive consultations (even with foreign) when they fought to solve the huge problem to which they face.
The market economies are not auto-régulatrices.
They cannot simply be left automatic pilot, especially if we want to ensure that their profits are widely shared.
But manage a market economy is not easy.
It is an act of balance which constantly must respond to economic changes.
The 11th five-year plan for China provides a roadmap in this direction.
The world eye-opener, full of hope and fear, while the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to be processed.
The lessons of Tocqueville democracy.
Due to the war in Iraq, 200 years after the birth of Tocqueville, the world discussing the nature of democracy.
Tocqueville is famous rightly rejected the reactionary nostalgia in recital that democracy was our destiny, however, we warned about the risks it presents for freedom.
Should we share his concern?
Tocqueville not considered first democracy as a political system, but above all as an intellectual system which tailors the custom of society, thereby giving a sociological and psychological dimension.
Tocqueville believed that the democratic regimes guide the course of our thoughts, our desires and our passions.
Similarly there has been the Renaissance man and XX, century sovieticus homo, the man 'democratic' is a form of the human being.
To Tocqueville, the effects of systemic democracy can bring the citizens to abandon their ability to reasoning.
They can only pretend to judge events and values by themselves, when in fact they merely reiterate limiting opinions of the majority.
What Tocqueville called the stranglehold of "social power" on the opinion is undoubtedly more powerful in the democratic regimes - a point of view left augur the level of demagogy and manipulation by the media in the modern world.
Tocqueville believed that in the long term, nothing can actually oppose this trend.
Neither the local democracy, nor small groups within society, checks and balances, nor civil rights cannot prevent the decline of critical thinking that democracy seems lead.
The school is at best an enclave immune to the irresistible influence that society exerts on the spirit.
Similarly, Tocqueville believed that the research under the elderly or religious faith occasionally raise the soul, but one another and are incompatible with the democratic ideal until they are imposed by the authorities in the framework of public life.
In this sense, the theorists néo-marxistes school in Frankfurt and Hanan Arendt who feared above all the disappearance of reason in modern societies are the heirs of Tocqueville thought.
We can also note that the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet entitled the recent books against democracy itself.
For these authors, democratic life tends to eliminate any original thinking and to prevent the emergence of a culture of good level, yielding room for a mediocrity that leaves the citizens vulnerable to the enemies of democracy.
If history agree criminal regimes supported by masses intimidated and manipulated, the greatest risk of democratic countries is to see their citizens sink into indifference and limited to a short-term thinking, in the search for their immediate interest.
The past - despite the rituals aim the commemoration of the historic events - is masked by dependence on the present time and the last novelty.
Even the ruling class, supposed well educated, is a victim of this grip.
The main problem with the democratic mentality lies in its lack of historical awareness.
As the proclaimed Tocqueville, the shortcomings of democracy seeking pessimism resigned the only way - but realistic unacceptable - which opens us?
I do not think so.
There are ways to combat what we might call the stupidity 'democratic' when spread today.
The first of these resources is to develop an education system which form of real critics, particularly through teaching materials largely neglected (nowadays) literature, history and philosophy.
If we want to train citizens informed and able to think for themselves, which is essential to the functioning of democracy, our schools must stop chasing last methods and start to develop analytical capabilities of pupils.
As a result of their tendency to grow superficial and distraction, mass media are the main obstacle to such education.
Today, many people spend more time in their lives before the TV classroom.
The passivity mass media entail the opposite of the active involvement of citizens, necessary to democracy.
But it is difficult to imagine that the mass media (newspapers in quality) accept their own volition to become the tools of education which develops the critical spirit of citizens.
This focus on mass media reflects not an elitist contempt for popular culture.
It is not just a question of popularity - Mozart was popular time and coins from Shakespeare attract the poor as much as the rich - but the refusal of the mass culture question and cause.
As a result indifference and widespread passivity of the public.
For a long time, a globalised media culture is spreading increasingly unable to generate the slightest criticism or to raise the feelings.
Because of its disregard for these questions, it is a culture which threatens democratic freedoms because it in no way creates a sense of duty to society, history or community.
Is it too late to defend themselves against a culture which émousse minds?
Tocqueville scorned the elites of time because of their complaisance towards the dangers of mass democracy.
The short-sightedness of our leaders will facilitate the achievement of its worrying prediction?
A Europe for all
The members of the European Union long seem to doubt the future of the European Union, but the Ukrainians watching the European Union with a certain hope and a certain admiration.
The basic aim of our foreign policy is to integrate the European progress, because Ukraine has discovered that national autonomy is not an end in itself but a beginning.
Indeed, the European unity is indivisible: when a nation is the victim of ostracism, there is no nation free.
We are Europeans, all bound by a link which we cannot escape, linked in a single destiny.
All aspects of culture that we share, not to mention the century of suffering that we share, we confirm this.
Anything which affects a European directly affects us all indirectly.
We can never afford to live with the narrow notions of two Europes, a Europe of affluent and a Europe of destitute, elected and banned.
Anyone lives on the European continent today can, must be regarded as a foreign Union.
The great Pax Europa today, as the current pan-European prosperity, depends.
Some will say, of course, that Ukraine is not part of Europe.
Whether they come to Kiev and meet its inhabitants, young and old, workers, the wives of farmers, lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and remained standing in the cold and snow of weeks to defend their freedoms last winter.
Do they not united to rassemblèrent around the General de Gaulle within the French Resistance?
Do not seeking body with those who died in the fight for the defence of the Spanish Republic in the 1930s, those who libérèrent Budapest in 1956 and set the end of fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970s?
Do they not driven the same spirit as that of Polish union Solidarnösc and amorcèrent peaceful masses of the Velvet Revolution in Prague in 1989?
That is the soul of Europe real and no doubt cannot destroy it.
In all those who consider that Ukraine is too lagging to become a member of the Union, I say this: they also visit my country and see mothers who remain late office to teach their children to the use of their computers office.
What they attend language courses of each village and town where our youth is preparing for Europe learning French, German and English.
Those who doubt the European vocation of Ukraine should understand that Europe is not a simple matter of equipment and motorways: the insatiable desire for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.
I believe that our future is also promising that the past of Europe is proud, and that our intended is not a land border forgotten in a troubled region but a participant influential peace and unity of Europe.
Self-determination is no longer synonymous with isolation because arrive at national independence nowadays simply means the return on the global stage with a new status.
The new nations can build with their former occupiers the same sort of fruitful relationship that France has established with Germany: a relationship based on equality and mutual interests.
This is the type of relationship that my government wants to establish with Russia, so that we can help to extend the area of peace in Europe.
It is premature, of course, to go beyond the indication of the appreciation that we attach to the opportunity to enter the European Union.
We know that our role in this great edifice will not overnight.
We know that the major works of European unification are not limited to documents and declarations but rooted in the innovative action designed to improve the levels of life and provide security for all Europeans.
Building a Ukraine worthy of joining the European Union will not be easy, nor rapid, without effort.
But as the European Union itself, build and happen.
We know that there is a great challenge but is worth it, and Europe must understand that this is our objective.
The renovation of Ukraine in part through an innovative battle to stop a nightmare century during which fascism and communism, ideologies born in the heart of Europe, clashed to take power.
In through the Ukrainian mentioned even a few months ago, parents and children confronted each armed troops, dogs grondants and even death.
Only a few years ago, still a young journalist Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public about the corruption of our former regime, was brutalized and beheaded by the henchmen regime.
Our Orange Revolution, last winter, has proved that Ukraine and its people could prevail.
Thus, despite the difficulties and doubts, I retains a grim confidence in Europe.
I refuse to accept the despair as final response to the ambiguities and horrors of the history of Ukraine.
I refuse to accept the idea that Ukraine is so tragically condemned to live at the heart of the night without stars of the communist legacy to never able to see the day of peace and a genuine European unity.
When the citizens of the European Union reflect for Ukraine in Europe, they must look closely and know look beyond face show that we them.
Seeing beyond the devastated areas that we imposed communism, apart from poverty and social divisions through which our former leaders today répudiés have sought to extend their hands.
They must look rather on the face of our President, Victor Yushchenko, ravaged by the poison that he was administered during the election campaign last year, and remember the words of that great French that was André Malraux, for whom the greatest faces are those wounded. "
The civil war Muslim
The gap between Sunni and Shiite Middle East is it now more profound antagonism between Israel and the Arabs?
We could believe seeing the reaction of some Arab governments to Hezbollah decisions attacking Israel.
While the Israeli bombs are falling on Beirut, and Tyr Saudi Arabia, perhaps Muslim Arab state more conservative of all, has openly condemned the actions of the Shiite Hizbollah which has initiated the conflict against Israel.
Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, a state that sees itself as the leader of the Arab people Muslims had supported Israel so openly.
In addition, the breakdown of Saudi Arabia with Hezbollah is not a unique case.
Egypt and Jordan have also categorically condemned Hezbollah and its leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, for their adventurism.
What is behind this astonishing situation?
Are we live a key turning point in relations between nationalism Arab and Islamic bigotry?
The government Sunni in Saudi Arabia ressent-il more fear and anxiety to Shi'ite Islam that it is in the Arab unity and the Palestinian cause?
Hezbollah complaints by Arabs suggest that the Muslim sectarian divide, already evident in the daily violence in Iraq, widening and intensifies in the Middle East.
The willingness of President George W. Bush to destroy frozen societies in the Arab world was doomed to draw up the forces of modernisation against the traditional elements of Islamic and Arab societies.
It seems to place have released the most atavistic forces in the region.
The opening of this Pandora's box was able to give rise to an era even more horrific widespread violence, what can only be described as "Muslim civil war."
The gap chiite-sunnite existed since the dawn of the history of Islam, but the geographical isolation and ethnic Shiite Iran non-arabe, as well as the domination of their minorities Shia by Sunni Arab countries, usually has left this rivalry background.
These tensions have fallen more during the wave of Islamicisation 'created by the Iranian revolution, because in its wake identity sectarian Sunni Arabs more has been postponed to the background as appeared a statement "Islamic" widespread.
All this has changed when Al Qaeda, a Sunni terrorist group which is largely based on ideology and staff Saudi wahabbites, launched its attacks against America in September 2001.
A specifically Sunni branch of militant Islam was underway.
When the United States have launched both wars against the Taliban in Afghanistan Sunnis and against the Iraqi regime Sunni, this new trend radical Sunni has acquired more daring.
The Sunni Arabs in the region, which have now gained insurance, see Israel and the West as a single threat, the other comprising the so-called growing Shia "-- arc of land which stretches from Lebanon to Iran to Syria and Iraq, inhabited by the supposed heretics Shiites.
The leaders in Saudi Arabia, as guardian of the sacred sites of the Muslim faith in Mecca and Médine, perhaps feel this threat with more acute.
For Sunni, Shia not merely to dominate the rich oil in Iran, Iraq and the regions of Saudi Arabia, they also economies-attempt, by Hezbollah's acts, to usurp the role of 'protector of the central dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cause.
This is because the Saudi royal family derives its legitimacy of a strict form of Islam Sunni and doubt the loyalty of its Shiite population that the kingdom deviate Hezbollah.
Ironically enough, is that America, protective long Saudi Arabia, has made the responsibility Shiite possible by toppling Saddam Hussein and putting Shiite parties in power in Iraq.
The Bush administration seems recognise what it has done; as Shi'a crescent amounts in the Arab Muslim world, the US is trying to consolidate their protection of the Sunni arc -- Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia -- to the west of the region.
Israel, once unrelenting enemy of the Arab cause, seems encastré today in this defensive structure.
But such a defensive position is necessarily unstable, the only panarabes sentiments.
Today, the Saudi ordinary citizens do not static Al Jazeera networks and TV Arab satellite to follow events in Gaza and in southern Lebanon.
They see bloodshed Arab (not Shiite), and only Hezbollah answer.
For them, Hezbollah has become a model of heroic resistance.
This situation leads the Saudi state to widen the sunnite-chiite schism.
After the official denunciation of Hezbollah by the kingdom, the Saudi state has asked its official Wahhabi clerics issuing fatwas condemning Hizbollah as heretical and Shiite deviant.
Such sentences can only exacerbate the sectarian divisions in Saudi Arabia and in the region.
Given the worsening of these antagonisms, Sunni regimes finally believe that they need for their own Hezbollah to combat in their corner?
If they manage to this conclusion, they will not need to search too far, because the fighters of this kind have already followed a training - backed by Al Qaeda.
Why Europe can no longer ignore Georgia
The time when Europe could rely on America to wage war, peace and democracy in its own court is over.
With the enlargement of the European Union and, as demonstrated by the recent crisis of Russian gas, this court now includes not only Ukraine but also Georgia.
Indeed, in Georgia, as in Ukraine, democracy is tested and Europe cannot afford to ignore.
Georgia was the first country in the post-Soviet space to operate its "revolution" colour and thus show, with dignity and maturity, the choice of his people in favour of democracy and European values.
The European Union flags now on all public buildings Georgian since then show the natural attachment, as old as the history of this country which, for the old Greeks, was part of the world of the time.
Médée Prometheus, and amazones in neighbouring Armenia Noah's ark, are all signs that the Europe of our myths begins.
Through its history, its culture, its traditions, old but also more recently, when Georgia differed from other republics of the former USSR, by its critical spirit, or independent maverick, Georgia is probably still today in this area where the democratic transplant can take better.
It is therefore all the more worrying to see the democratisation of the country threatened.
Everything seemed to have started well enough.
Thanks to launch without dissent of reforms, privatisation, fight against corruption, the search for new frameworks and unscathed compromises with the previous regime, the implementation of a foreign policy characterised by a return of Europe in the Georgian game.
The state of mind totalitarian since has resurfaced among these leaders who proclaims the representatives of the majority, have always appropriate more powers.
It is a caste such Hydra thousand warheads do not ultimately die and revived ashes.
They and their methods of power "Rose Revolution" in November 2003 wanted once and for all bowdlerise reintroduced into the heart of power, with their networks, with ramifications including outside their considerable financial burden, their skill to intrigues and manipulation of political and electoral equipment.
This is a power which does not sufficiently the essence of democracy which is not in the polls, but in the separation and the balance of powers.
Every day, the government to interfere in the legislative, the vast majority of laws written to the presidential Registry; Parliament wants to monitor the daily government policy, including, in my case, the nomination of ambassadors and their everyday operations!
Finally, and this is the most serious, the judiciary still do not disregard the tutelage of the executive and no longer represents or not yet for the citizen or the investor guarantor and protector, without which there is no rule of law, nor of economic freedom
It is a society to be democratic in his head, is not yet legs, but still hesitate to engage in politics and leaving the scene to those who occupy for too long.
Because this democracy is in danger of collapsing, but because it is still strongly established in the population, civil society organisations, in a press seeking but which does not lose its ability critical...
It is time for Europe to save democracy not to annihilate all these hopes.
The United States have done what they have, since independence, and they are alongside the Georgian stability.
The stability was certainly not identified democracy under the reign of Eduard Shevardnadze, a former Minister of Foreign Affairs Soviet Rose Revolution dismissed from office of President Georgia.
But the Americans were very generously invested in the survival of Georgian elites and learning of democracy.
The criticism of the initiatives Soros today, fashion, seems more unjustified: the Revolution in November has not been created in all parts by the Americans, whatever the propaganda of the Russian nationalist too used to direct interventions to think differently, but the democratic substratum has certainly been fed, promoted and supported by the aid from the Soros Foundation.
The course must be taken today for Georgia eliminates his body -- définitivement- the totalitarian evil, is a complex step which calls support of a different nature, that Europeans are more to deliver.
The models which must be proposed for the balance of powers, the institutions of the rule of law, the judicial or local democracy must inspire closer to the European forms of the Georgian reality that the Anglo-Saxon model, American variant.
If Europe now rejected this task, betraying its fundamental duty towards this small country, Mediterranean, flexible, long tradition, where democracy has much better chance of success than in Ukraine, which is both great and still very Soviet spirit, without talking about Central Asia.
Do not help Georgia and accept the Democracy and stability are long to come not only in Tbilisi, but even more in Kiev, Minsk, to say nothing of Moscow.
This is especially take a very serious risk.
Moscow, with ups and downs, infinite prevarication, an internal tearing, began to resign itself to the idea of the democratic inevitability, at least around, but renounce its imperial dreams and their instruments of domination, could suddenly revise its perception.
Such resignation hesitant, this acceptance of normality in its relations with its neighbours, who was in its infancy, can be washed away by a sudden eruption of irrationality of the Russian power of this infamous' Derjava which cannot resist the attractiveness of the weakness, the sense of vacuum, the temptation to be again not equal, but the strongest.
That is what explains the recent crisis of Russian gas.
Any signs of decline of democracy, slowdown in the democratic tide, will be taken by Moscow as a foolish hopes of reversibility gradually where Russia accoutumait not believe.
That is the responsibility of Europe to convince Russia that it places its hopes scotches in a return to the past.
Europe has this responsibility for itself, its future energy independence, but also has the responsibility to show that there are also strong European values -- of freedom, democracy, justice between peoples.
For that Europe needs instruments of its policy: a great foundation private and public for Europe and democracy, a university training managers of democracies tomorrow still looking, police, army of judges and magistrates who are living close models of societies that we convert.
Europe needs to conviction.
If Europe does not convint itself it is the fate of its neighbours, their democracy and the future of its values and their spread, believe it tomorrow?
