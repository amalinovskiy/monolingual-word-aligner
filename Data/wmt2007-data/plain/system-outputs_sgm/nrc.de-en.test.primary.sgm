<seg id=1>Our Charter of Fundamental Rights is the first in this millennium.</seg>
<seg id=2>We must succeed in the Union of the Fifteen Member States in such a way that we, the countries that are knocking at our door, under appropriate conditions can start.</seg>
<seg id=3>In Article 87, of services of general interest for social, cultural and charity interests to be included, so that this important institutions also long term can be protected.</seg>
<seg id=4>Some are of the opinion that we can create an internal market in Europe, without on fundamental values and principles to be agreed.</seg>
<seg id=5>I would also like to also the clear and substantial speech by President Prodi welcomed.</seg>
<seg id=6>As you know, it was decided in Amsterdam is aware, these two roles clearly be separated, the High Representative manifests itself - in contrast to the Commission - not completely independent, but its task in the coordination of foreign and security in the competence of the Member States, and we must make the intergovernmental method certainly give a greater role.</seg>
<seg id=7>He has expressed the desire that the Presidency in Nice in the future path indicated.</seg>
<seg id=8>It is in fact a broader and better result hope, but I am offengestanden take the view that we have made a good start.</seg>
<seg id=9>I therefore hope that the European Council in Nice, this project, which is to accept and adopt it as a specific project, not as a fait accompli, to bring the necessary reforms, of course, having now been decided.</seg>
<seg id=10>However, I have also pointed out that we specifically in today ’ s reality is a very important objectives of the Community method, such as, for example, to be able to achieve a more effective action in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg id=11>Only if we are to the West and Russia to bind the European Union, we will also influence on its policy and in contact with Russia and in discussions.</seg>
<seg id=12>Motion for a resolution (B5 0767 / 00) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</seg>
<seg id=13>He is currently trying to continue with this genocide and also, media freedom and the rule of law in Russia, which already exist, very difficult to eliminate.</seg>
<seg id=14>In the attempt to meet the expectations of this rentners, Giuseppe Italia, live in Cremona, like the Po sail with, will have to do, I have voted in favour of the Piecyk report, of the development and the development of the sea and inland ports and intermodal terminals.</seg>
<seg id=15>The vote of this House, the aim of the directive, of which all the speakers and the Commission recognised and supported, made impossible.</seg>
<seg id=16>Mr President, I, as I said during the debate, that is, before the vote, made it clear that I have voted in favour of the report by Mr Skinner, because I see venture capital as very important.</seg>
<seg id=17>My colleague Armonia Bordes yesterday crystal clear that only a minority that is, from Community funds and to cover of rentenversicherungsbeiträge unternehmerrisiken to use.</seg>
<seg id=18>It is, therefore, that the Charter of Fundamental Rights, rather than to the current, even retrograde practices of the nation states to confirm, as it represents a genuine step forward.</seg>
<seg id=19>Mr President, at last we have a Charter of fundamental rights of the Community citizen on the table, in which a whole article, Article 25, which is devoted to older people.</seg>
<seg id=20>But if he would legally binding and incorporated into the Treaty would, as the European Parliament is calling for, he would inevitably in time to a harmonisation of national legislation of the various European countries, it would mean that the European Court of Justice a disproportionate power would ensure that the centralisation of the European institutions, the independent entscheidungsspielraum each nation should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id=21>· a überfrachtung of the Charter with detailed and this should abgestellt subordinate the right reserved.</seg>
<seg id=22>I will vote for a different Charter by me to the demonstrations on 13 and 14 October in Biarritz and in Nice on 7 December 2000 beteilige.</seg>
<seg id=23>Progress of the 12 countries on the road to accession.</seg>
<seg id=24>I believe that a number of Member States, it still has not understood that it is in this context, and that the slow progress of the Intergovernmental Conference can bring us into serious difficulties, the extension of the period.</seg>
<seg id=25>All of this, I have been talking about, we will be able to succeed in the long term only in the candidate countries, as well as in the European Union's policy and the elite limited - and in this context, I agree with you, Commissioner - at long last to promote that enlargement of the European Union for their own benefit.</seg>
<seg id=26>This is the universal principle.</seg>
<seg id=27>Let me now come to the second objective with which the Presidency during these six months to make progress on the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=28>Therefore, I suggest that, in this direction, with the presentation of the work that we have to consider in relation to 2003 which candidates are willing to sign up to us to date.</seg>
<seg id=29>I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his comprehensive and clear report.</seg>
<seg id=30>It is in any case, in the negotiations on the question of "whether", it is only by 'how' and 'when'.</seg>
<seg id=31>But you have also done so, because the prospect of membership of the European Union, the hope of the solidarity of the European peoples and because they are so strong political and economic these offered.</seg>
<seg id=32>A number of countries are also the second criterion of economic competitiveness within the internal market as well as progress, that it is rapidly approaching the accession.</seg>
<seg id=33>We therefore seek the engst possible coordination with the programmes of the national governments, the European Parliament and other institutions.</seg>
<seg id=34>Every year, and will soon, on 8 November, once again, be the case - will in each of the candidate countries with a very large state the Commission ’ s assessment of the progress accomplished expected of them.</seg>
<seg id=35>Quite rightly, we have opted for the principle of differentiation, according to which each beitrittskandidatenland to its progress and services will be assessed.</seg>
<seg id=36>This debate is a further opportunity for my group, to confirm that the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus and Malta, the best possible future for all of us in Europe in the East and West.</seg>
<seg id=37>This is a matter of the utmost importance, but the public will be little attention.</seg>
<seg id=38>Many my jokingly that after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the run-up to the enlargement always unchanged: it is five years.</seg>
<seg id=39>The next opportunity is natural, in the context of the next European elections in 2009, but we want to ensure that as many countries as possible to join in 2004.</seg>
<seg id=40>Moreover, there are six substantive aspects on which we have reservations about the method applied.</seg>
<seg id=41>In fact, it is the model of the elected European integration itself, i.e. the simultaneous incorporation into all sectors, regardless of the traditions and the specific characteristics of those involved in this dead end.</seg>
<seg id=42>This "in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s almost artikulierten general feeling, is to give shape to this day, for all of us and an obligation.</seg>
<seg id=43>But in order to make things clear name to mention: there can be no accession to cut-price.</seg>
<seg id=44>It is a great and fine idea that we are not against the enlargements to the public and that the best way to the enlargements, in accordance with the public, to their participation in the elections, it is because the elections are an expression of democracy and a form of involvement of citizens in the political system.</seg>
<seg id=45>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like briefly to comment on the conditions for a scenario to say that this was wanted by several parties.</seg>
<seg id=46>I would be very surprised if you do not pressure would make.</seg>
<seg id=47>But I had already pointed out that all the countries of the accession relatively quickly approach.</seg>
<seg id=48>In other words, the liberalisation in the area of agricultural products is already agreed, without the Poland is concerned, that is why the Polish agriculture collapse.</seg>
<seg id=49>It has also been burdens, but by and large, peace and trade, the citizens of the EU countries closer together and that the Monetary Union further strengthened this development.</seg>
<seg id=50>The negotiation results should be crucial.</seg>
<seg id=51>The only amendment that has been presented, which is already contained in my report, but I am happy to see that the Group of the Greens is the importance of equal treatment of the citizens of the.</seg>
<seg id=52>This is not only a law in the public sector, but also that it is for the young administrators opportunities and adequate payment.</seg>
<seg id=53>This applies both to Latvia as well as to the European Union!</seg>
<seg id=54>Is planned connecting the Union's litas to the euro in the second half of the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=55>- (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, in Poland, for which I am the rapporteur, is the biggest and most important, but at the same time we know that the problematischste countries to prepare for accession to the European Union; it has such a multitude of problems that it even rumours about a possible Poland's exclusion from the first group, in other words, the first group of accession countries.</seg>
<seg id=56>As in Poland and the Eastern Europe, former communist countries too many promises which we have not kept.</seg>
<seg id=57>There is a point which, time and again, when it comes to the Czech Republic to appear. That is the problem of the Roma.</seg>
<seg id=58>The Slovak Republic was not in the second group said, and they would also be consistent with the Czech Republic join.</seg>
<seg id=59>Finally, I also have a single point of domestic policy allows.</seg>
<seg id=60>Thirdly, as far as agriculture is concerned, whose productivity is still under the European Union is, as it will be necessary to the agricultural fully for the privatisation of land, the modernisation of farms and the distribution and in order to increase the capital they need to open up.</seg>
<seg id=61>Bulgaria is very much on a accession to the European Union and NATO.</seg>
<seg id=62>Since 1990 the acute poverty is one of the most serious problems Romania, but it is under the present government, that is, the economic situation is indeed turn for the better.</seg>
<seg id=63>I hope that these issues to the priorities of the new, in 14 days constituent Parliament and the Slovenian government.</seg>
<seg id=64>However, to emphasise that a final just and lasting solution to the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council, in other words, nothing more than current international law, as well as the underlying principles of the European Union must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id=65>On Malta, moreover, stable, functioning democratic institutions.</seg>
<seg id=66>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we want to play our part in this debate.</seg>
<seg id=67>They must also be implemented, the European Community law is not just a law in the books, but also in the candidate countries a law in action.</seg>
<seg id=68>This change is tough requirements for the people in the candidate countries, but at the same time guarantee their future and the future of their children.</seg>
<seg id=69>Special attention - and here I agree with the previous speakers - is on the border to lay.</seg>
<seg id=70>In this connection, the Commission should not be left alone!</seg>
<seg id=71>The applicant countries the quest for a rapid economic growth, even if this is to the detriment of nature protection is already established.</seg>
<seg id=72>There was an exchange of bad habits, including in the field of health.</seg>
<seg id=73>Mr President, enlargement is essential for the development of a strong and united European continent.</seg>
<seg id=74>The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and in the field of the trans-European networks is responsible, are aware of the need to the various sectoral policies in favour of a broader spatial planning policy to coordinate.</seg>
<seg id=75>But even before an indication that the infrastructure of central importance for the success of enlargement will be.</seg>
<seg id=76>Mr President, I agree with those who in the greatest task of the forthcoming enlargement of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=77>In the former economies of Central and Eastern Europe will on the traditional social values considerable pressure.</seg>
<seg id=78>The PPE Group would take responsibility for the candidate countries not beitrittstempo decline, because we can no longer fixieren accession date.</seg>
<seg id=79>The second point is the naming of data.</seg>
<seg id=80>There is another reason for this.</seg>
<seg id=81>Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for each country and for the EU as a whole depends, Denmark has shown - greatly depend on the fact that the social and democratic European Union policies will be reduced.</seg>
<seg id=82>Herabwürdigende populism is the name of the technocrats diffamieren the popular will, if he is in a way which does not suit you.</seg>
<seg id=83>Ladies and gentlemen, you have essens erholungspause and, it is continuing at 9 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=84>It is, albeit in the long term, a common currency for the whole continent.</seg>
<seg id=85>"on these issues be internal conflicts in the individual countries entfacht.</seg>
<seg id=86>We are asking you to fight for a different Europe, a Europe of all the peoples of these inhumane stigmata liberated, in which all peoples to determine their own destiny and mutual relations of peace, freedom, the brotherhood of cooperation and mutual benefit, to restore.</seg>
<seg id=87>I would like to pay tribute to the work of these organisations publicly. These include, above all, the appeal to the Romanian challenge in Birmingham in his seat, as well as organisations from Ireland, which are supported by many people, including the Irish unterhaltungskünstler Daniel o donnell, become a donation of EUR 1 million pounds committed and this sum in Ireland and other parts of the world has acquired.</seg>
<seg id=88>The summit in Nice must, above all to clarify whether and how the EU can, in turn, enable the itself fully and in good time to be ready for enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=89>Poland, the question is: will you when we have joined us, or are we also paid second-class countries?</seg>
<seg id=90>However, I am certain that in goodwill and with the help of the European Union a solution can be found to a harmonious coexistence of the two communities and a life in prosperity allows for centuries, as has been the case.</seg>
<seg id=91>We have, however, the issue of minorities gekümmert, because the issue of the integration of minorities, including their linguistic integration, in these countries is also important.</seg>
<seg id=92>The conditions for membership is actually compliance with the basic criteria of Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id=93>We have heard a lot about the benefits of enlargement, but it is an area in which we can learn of Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id=94>Just imagine, we would all so!</seg>
<seg id=95>Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to thank Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs and congratulate you, but I would like to concentrate mainly on the Slovak Republic, in particular, the policy on minorities.</seg>
<seg id=96>I call on you to Nice to a date to date by them, with the most advanced candidate countries, without namensnennung - intend to put an end to the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=97>The European Union must Bulgaria to continue on its path to enter the European Union and help, of course, mean that the planning of aid is more decentralised.</seg>
<seg id=98>The dialogue between the social partners, civil society and the other groups, the government and the European Parliament is an important factor and - as we say - positive role.</seg>
<seg id=99>We are in the process of overcoming the division of Europe and not to create new.</seg>
<seg id=100>All this is in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne contain, and I would like to thank her on behalf of our group warmly for this report.</seg>
<seg id=101>This understanding, in my view, the issue of Cyprus should simply be that has the ability to shape Europe, politically, will decide.</seg>
<seg id=102>I myself live close to the Baltic Sea, which is a common concern for us all.</seg>
<seg id=103>The political vision there be.</seg>
<seg id=104>So we are particularly pleased with the desire of Klaus Hänsch to note that, on behalf of the PSE Group that the Commission has talked about a proper assessment of the impact of enlargement and of the economic consequences may be, if it comes to enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=105>Nevertheless, I share the view of the rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, without transitional periods will be in the interests of both parties, and not just as an MEP of a border region, who, as Mrs Schierhuber a farm near the Czech border has, it is a matter of concern for me that, in the near common wirtschaftsräume without major problems can be solved and a positive outcome on both sides.</seg>
<seg id=106>I would like to emphasise three points as a Social Democrat.</seg>
<seg id=107>The questions of the first pillar containing EEA were granted to the economy in the candidate countries access to the internal market, the youth exchange programmes, scientific, legal and committed to the EU but not yet on the other hand, the system of aid to these countries, which would extend the EEA positive starting point for the economy, especially in the candidate countries - they need in order to increase their society for accession as to make, as also for the economy in the EU, if it is considered that the costs of enlargement on growth even represent two-thirds of the EEA model may be even more.</seg>
<seg id=108>Secondly, on the idea of the 'big bang' - many of the candidate countries at the same time, this would run counter to the principle that each country according to its progress.</seg>
<seg id=109>Thirdly, we must do everything possible to 2003, the European Union in terms of the excellent speech by the President Prodi to prepare for the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=110>I would in this connection, the relationship between the Council / Parliament to raise by saying that there has been considerable delays in reply to the written questions.</seg>
<seg id=111>It is true that this dubious, is in a country that wants to join the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=112>I request referral back to committee, in which the necessary steps are to be prepared.</seg>
<seg id=113>Mr President, today we are all three reports on this subject, including two from me, perhaps discuss and vote on it.</seg>
<seg id=114>That would, at all stages of the food chain favourable effect.</seg>
<seg id=115>Safe food mean in the whole chain costs.</seg>
<seg id=116>We must, therefore, Mrs Paulsen and agree with the Commission and the verschneidungsverbot start, so that animal feed will be safer and European consumers really to be protected.</seg>
<seg id=117>The directive from 1999 was well thought out, and it can also is already a success, because detectable burdens could be reduced.</seg>
<seg id=118>But then simply allow a confusion, is not the solution.</seg>
<seg id=119>Very briefly, we need to press on the subject of Amendment No 37 dioxinproblems.</seg>
<seg id=120>On this point, we are in agreement.</seg>
<seg id=121>As a result, we will continue to European consumers as meat, milk, and the by-products to buy on the world markets, not the European Union established emerging and the limit values to be produced, in other words in a system in which raw materials on the world markets be acquired, where each substance or any preparation can be mixed freely before the products into the territory of the European Union should be introduced.</seg>
<seg id=122>Up to second reading, the Commission should inform us the planned assessment procedures for providing information.</seg>
<seg id=123>However, it would be folgenschwer when, for example, Amendments Nos 39 and 40 were approved, as it is for the Member States will no longer be able to intervene quickly discovered in new dangers.</seg>
<seg id=124>Consumer protection begins with the animal feed, already in the deklarierung futtermittelinhaltsstoffen, and, finally, the official controls.</seg>
<seg id=125>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Paulsen on undesirable substances in the tiernahrung concerns an important issue, as all the important issues is a highly controversial issue.</seg>
<seg id=126>The discussion on the excellent report by Mrs Paulsen, before us today, was in some respects strong emotional marked, and following on from the current debate, it was assumed that the feedingstuffs industry, strict rules, the quality of mixtures, but both can be changed.</seg>
<seg id=127>Each of these three proposals, both individually and as in the common to eliminate the shortcomings, the most important contribution by the dioxin crisis emerged.</seg>
<seg id=128>With Amendment No 33 is the re-exportation of futtermittelpartien which do not meet the requirements of this directive, in the ausfuhrdrittland prevented.</seg>
<seg id=129>The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which proposes that the possibility of dilution kontaminierter animal under certain conditions, again.</seg>
<seg id=130>This should be given our pledge that we, in the context of the new proposal on the establishment of a food authority a system for the rapid exchange of information will, the whole of the food and feed chain will cover.</seg>
<seg id=131>Commissioner Byrne, when this directive on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs hidden, in fact, our old problem, namely the question of open declaration.</seg>
<seg id=132>And for me, that is already the profits of the morning.</seg>
<seg id=133>Because if we do, if we do this quickly implement quickly and would also go through the codecision procedure, this is certainly a great asset, and I am sure that we very much agree with the Council and will be.</seg>
<seg id=134>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the future too, at least, it can happen, but it is not possible that contaminated ingredients in animal feed.</seg>
<seg id=135>The BSE scandal, was the worst best-known example.</seg>
<seg id=136>As our rapporteur has already said, it would be best if we have a label with open declaration, to the list of ingredients.</seg>
<seg id=137>I think that the professional qualifications and the judgment of the members of the Agriculture Committee in terms of agriculture and, therefore, also in terms of animal nutrition is no doubt, in the sense of a practical and workable solution to the question of the farmers and consumers will be understood and applied.</seg>
<seg id=138>So far as the positive part.</seg>
<seg id=139>I think this is a legitimate right to information, to which we must take into account.</seg>
<seg id=140>On behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, I would ask you, Madam President, the relatives of the victims and the local authorities of Brittany, as well as by Mr Marín, Galicia, where most of the victims come to convey the condolences of the House.</seg>
<seg id=141>(Parliament adopted the resolution)).</seg>
<seg id=142>Is there anyone who - would object to the presentation of this oral amendment to?</seg>
<seg id=143>As the rapporteur has explained to us the situation.</seg>
<seg id=144>Most of the technical proposals deserve our firm support, such as, for example, in the field of food safety, the decommissioning of nuclear power stations of the first generation, environmental protection, the fight against social dumping, the vital code of conduct for companies operating in the east, west and much more these tasks are huge and therefore an absolute priority.</seg>
<seg id=145>At the same time, to continue to considerable difficulties to overcome, particularly in budgetary matters.</seg>
<seg id=146>An increase in 13 countries not only changed the geopolitical context of the European Union, but also to change their structure, because on the one hand, + population will increase by 28%), but also the number of "" disadvantaged regions.</seg>
<seg id=147>It is important to note that in the candidate countries a competitive agricultural and food-processing sectors because of their high economic and social transformations and importance for the successful restructuring will be crucial.</seg>
<seg id=148>In this context, I would like to express the wish that the outermost regions, which are far from six to seven of the ten poorest still along the EU's structural funds, not only on the basis of GDP criterion alone, but also because of the geographical, demographic and, above all, social indicators.</seg>
<seg id=149>Since this Europe, in the interests of French, can we reject its enlargement to the countries and peoples of Eastern Europe, which has only just been liberated from the Communist dictatorship and do not yet know, in which case they technocratic and totalitarian trap by taking this step, not with a clear conscience.</seg>
<seg id=150>We would have been in the country reports on than a short and concise but resolution should leave.</seg>
<seg id=151>The system of aid currently practised, subsidies and quotas must be through free trade and adapting to the market to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id=152>The significance and scope of the problems that enlargement entails verträgt, is not with the hypocrisy with which we in the European Union is spoken.</seg>
<seg id=153>On enlargement, is not for me to speak, which some of the countries of Europe to confirm or not.</seg>
<seg id=154>Our neighbouring country has over the last ten years in order to meet the accession criteria zielstrebig effort.</seg>
<seg id=155>Latvia has its place in this House, not only because it its progress on the whole, the right to these "vertrauensvorschuss" to the negotiations to a successful conclusion of this kind is essential, but, above all, first and foremost, because it is at home in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=156>I believe that the State of Poland, most of all the candidate countries deserve our support and commitment, because without the extremely important initiatives of Communism in Poland had not been the case, and we are not here today, in order to deal with this problem.</seg>
<seg id=157>The Polish people, who is still largely from Eurosceptics, this may not be in the same way.</seg>
<seg id=158>I appeal to Prague, this message, this request, this would urge you to take on board the dialogue, to meet and work together with this House to ensure that these legacy of nationalist era can be overcome.</seg>
<seg id=159>I welcome the report by Mr Wiersma, on Slovakia's application for accession to the European Union and can support most of its conclusions.</seg>
<seg id=160>It is with great pleasure that I take this opportunity to offer the pensioners and the elderly people of the Republic of Bulgaria my special greeting.</seg>
<seg id=161>If Romania continues to make progress and the European Union its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Romania and should not be admitted to the Union.</seg>
<seg id=162>The report 's position is quite clear, as it is hard to find a solution to the problem of settlers might look, as well as the landrückgabe for both sides is extremely difficult.</seg>
<seg id=163>Unfortunately, some of the statements in the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on Cyprus's application for membership of the European Union are included, not very helpful.</seg>
<seg id=164>In the light of the goodwill of the Turkish Cypriot ethnic and Turkey, this will not be an easy task.</seg>
<seg id=165>Mrs Stenzel report (A5-0243 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=166>Unfortunately, I was a victim, albeit slight, food poisoning, which I had zugezogen fatalerweise in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=167>For all these reasons, I am for the proposed by the European Commission verschneidungsverbot voted.</seg>
<seg id=168>We have to ensure the ASEM countries in this resolution to put pressure on the military regime in Burma to, so that democracy is restored.</seg>
<seg id=169>We are not consistent in our approach and in the implementation of our measures.</seg>
<seg id=170>Now is not the time for kleinmut and verzagtheit.</seg>
<seg id=171>A number of important points in the regime are: firstly, the regulation of the burden of proof.</seg>
<seg id=172>Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=173>"So what are the reasons for which we legislation to combat discrimination on the required.</seg>
<seg id=174>On that basis, we have now fachjuristische many amendments, which have the same level of protection against discrimination on the grounds of race, on the one hand and on the grounds of religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, on the other to ensure.</seg>
<seg id=175>He had to find a balance, prudence and a good rechtstechnik to try and be report reflects my opinion reflects these qualities.</seg>
<seg id=176>Furthermore, these members of the opinion that the discrimination not so often, is that there should be specific legislation.</seg>
<seg id=177>The funding of the programme is not enough to replace the work to be done, the fifth framework programme and, I hope, will be continued in another framework programmes, our task is to ensure that the programmgrenzen for cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=178>On the need to combat discrimination, although there is general agreement, as on the extent to which and with what resources are, however, opinions differ.</seg>
<seg id=179>In committee I had the opportunity, I am opposed to defend that also experts to speak, does not belong to the NGOs.</seg>
<seg id=180>We also welcome to a large extent the richtlinienbestimmung that equal treatment for people with disabilities also means that the appropriate adjustments in the workplace are provided by companies.</seg>
<seg id=181>That is the only way we create it, discrimination in all areas of human coexistence in Europe effectively fighting.</seg>
<seg id=182>All in all, also teach us great democracies of the Anglo-Saxon that racism and discrimination, with the help of the European Liberal, Democratic and not by the gradual weakening and restriction of freedom of expression, freedom of expression, freedom of association and of the economic freedoms to be combated.</seg>
<seg id=183>In a proposal, the equality of homosexuality with the holy for before.</seg>
<seg id=184>In this way can the European Union in specific cases in which there is discrimination or the treatment of its citizens, is a clearer position.</seg>
<seg id=185>I would also address the issue of exception in terms of religion.</seg>
<seg id=186>From various quarters have concerns about the potential interpretation on the grounds of Article 1, expressed the still somewhat unclear is, however, between sexual orientation and sexual behaviour distinction.</seg>
<seg id=187>In this way, is a hierarchy of discrimination it.</seg>
<seg id=188>It is because of the colour in Caledonia to benefit from its advantages.</seg>
<seg id=189>Together with the recently adopted Directive 2000 is the orientation of the directive to the stated desire of the European Union demonstrate, for an open society by einzustehen denkschablonen and, above all, which is deeply rooted in European history stigma of racism is free.</seg>
<seg id=190>Those, then, that in this House to explain the values which we all want to defend, did not have a European directive to be laid down, are in error.</seg>
<seg id=191>This must not be touched hard-earned successes.</seg>
<seg id=192>Finally, the media is also played an important role in this task.</seg>
<seg id=193>We experience has also shown that the promotion of legislative proposals to combat discrimination on the essential, but it is not enough.</seg>
<seg id=194>We must prevent a sinnloses bureaucratic disorder, by the European Union only to a purely materialist, politically correct Community without more sense would be reduced.</seg>
<seg id=195>This Parliament has, in my opinion, is actually cautious legislation which the European Commission to propose, to a Christmas tree ausgeschmückt.</seg>
<seg id=196>Let me begin by the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, for his two excellent reports.</seg>
<seg id=197>I can also accept your amendments which both the importance of prevention, as well as the fight against discrimination should be underlined.</seg>
<seg id=198>The second category is aimed at the text of the proposal from the Commission to clarify its content, while the third category from numerous amendments with which this proposal is in line with the directive adopted in June last year to be brought against racial discrimination.</seg>
<seg id=199>In particular, Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20, it is proposed that the reference to discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic origin, to be deleted.</seg>
<seg id=200>Can I have your comments in Amendments Nos 21 and 45 on natural and legal persons and nichtformalisierte of groups of people not able, since this proposal on employment, applies only to individuals.</seg>
<seg id=201>The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.</seg>
<seg id=202>We cannot expect friedensschaffende public support for operations, if our troops are threatened with the weapons which we ourselves have supplied.</seg>
<seg id=203>In my own country, I could not even without permission, while I buy a shotgun for the opening of an arms in my gartenschuppen needed no approval.</seg>
<seg id=204>Another important point is the ban on the export of promotion and marketing of equipment or of know-how, which first and foremost for the purposes of torture is used.</seg>
<seg id=205>Having said that, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Titley on his excellent report, of course, gentlemen.</seg>
<seg id=206>In addition to the questions we must also be binding in our view, firstly, to extend the immediate priorities, based on a military intervention designed to disarmament, conversion, intensification of the work of the police and customs, and on the other, that of Mr Wiersma referred to the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=207>Would the geldumlauf controlled, it would be much more difficult, the existing provisions for the arms trade round.</seg>
<seg id=208>The aim of the annual review is to such potential improvements to identify.</seg>
<seg id=209>The European Union is currently examining whether this project on the projektdauer, in November of this year, in the end, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id=210>There have been a methodology and indicators established at the next 'Research Council' will be presented.</seg>
<seg id=211>I thank you, Mr Busquin.</seg>
<seg id=212>As regards the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises, we have, of course, to ensure that the small and medium-sized enterprises, as provided in the framework programme, haushaltsentscheidung duly taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id=213>It seems, at least from the debate on the budget in Greece herauszukristallisieren, and many of these are even on the attitude of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=214>What happens to the multidisciplinary nature, I share your concerns.</seg>
<seg id=215>The first point which he expressly in his statement has mentioned, is the EU participation in national programmes.</seg>
<seg id=216>Therefore we could not speak of a European research area, if we only 5% of the research fund.</seg>
<seg id=217>Thank you, Mr Busquin.</seg>
<seg id=218>On the one hand was due to the efforts of the funds by the end of the year 1999 to fully commit, at the start of this year, the number of applications for the decision on the funding of new projects to low.</seg>
<seg id=219>However, I would like to point out to the fact that Portugal in the previous period to Question Time has fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id=220>Question No 2 by (h 0730 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=221>The definition of mineralölsteuer at a high level, has not led to the fact that Community competition rules are not complied with.</seg>
<seg id=222>Mr MacCormick, secondly, what are known as follows: the Member States with fiscal means a certain industrial sector, they violate the rules on state aid, and in this case, fiscal aid that subsidies amount to around.</seg>
<seg id=223>A very clear case, for example, is nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id=224>Subject: the budget line for minority languages since 1983 existing European Union 's budgetary resources for minority languages up to 1995 saw a constant increase in the year and achieved their levels of EUR 4 million.</seg>
<seg id=225>Mr President, my colleagues in Parliament will doubtless be aware that the Structural Funds - and this is new - a lot of money to expel cultural activities, because I, together with Mr Michel Barnier emphasis was placed on the fact that the structural funds not only to invest in roads, airports, but also in the world.</seg>
<seg id=226>Therefore, the Commission will be next year also no financial commitments.</seg>
<seg id=227>What concrete proposals for financing is concerned, I can take this opportunity to make no comment on the usual procedure, because we have to accept.</seg>
<seg id=228>I, in various ways consideration.</seg>
<seg id=229>And this is to prevent, because we are talking about millions of small and medium-sized enterprises throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id=230>Concerning the rules on hunting, for example, the elk hunting, also the treatment of for private domestic use certain meat?</seg>
<seg id=231>If the rules on meat from animals for the eigenbedarf gejagten apply, meant that a disaster for the bureaucratic elk hunting.</seg>
<seg id=232>After this report, I intend to present proposals to improve the transport, I shall also the problem of inadequate enforcement of transportzeitbeschränkungen comment.</seg>
<seg id=233>We have on this issue before my meeting with the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance discussed.</seg>
<seg id=234>Our question was clear: What action is the Commission taking?</seg>
<seg id=235>The general product safety, and also to the potential risks inform their customers.</seg>
<seg id=236>The case Maryam ayubi is very worrying.</seg>
<seg id=237>Question No 14 by (h 0745 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=238>The end of the EU in relation to the meeting on ministerialebene in Vientiane, of course, also in relation to the question of whether it takes place at all, or at what level the EU ought to be represented by the developments in Burma until December dependent on it.</seg>
<seg id=239>One final observation..</seg>
<seg id=240>The elections are an important step in the inclusion of the inhabitants of Kosovo in the shape of their communities.</seg>
<seg id=241>I can assure you that these elections are a democratic elections and better implemented in our countries, in which I often either have participated as observers or where I was here yesterday.</seg>
<seg id=242>However, we saw it as a beginning and not as the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id=243>It will be more effective and more coherent control of the arms trade and greater transparency in favour.</seg>
<seg id=244>Now, I note that every year more supply contracts for weapons and zubehör be closed.</seg>
<seg id=245>On the basis of information, fictitious of virtual reality, we cannot relevant decisions.</seg>
<seg id=246>The regime of these activities by one and the same Directorate-General have been made should be examined.</seg>
<seg id=247>These institutions, must have the opportunity to set up an internal auditor, it would not be enough, however, the financial controller, auditing certain minimum standards with regard to the requirement to make.</seg>
<seg id=248>This proposal meets, as the Commissioner is well aware, in Parliament, not of unanimous approval.</seg>
<seg id=249>Therefore, I have nothing against an independent internal audit service, for which we are today with the report by Mr van Hulten give the green light.</seg>
<seg id=250>Mr President, Commissioner, first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=251>We are of the opinion that the modernisation of administration is urgently needed.</seg>
<seg id=252>An independent gegenprüfung is indispensable, in order to prevent mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=253>The money should be spent on future targeted and more effective and, of course, should also be better to ensure that the money for the purposes for which they will be determined by the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=254>Let me now turn to the amendments proposed briefly: the introduction of this additional recital, the Commission agrees to.</seg>
<seg id=255>I should therefore like to thank you for your ideas and your advice.</seg>
<seg id=256>I would like the proposals contained in this report which, in my view, the most important and most effective way is as follows: firstly, set up an expert group, made up of representatives of the Member States appointed senior figures in order to establish universally recognised the parameters for the protection of minors in the media; secondly, to introduce an selbstkontroll code by all TV companies; thirdly, the possibility of access to the promotion and filtersystemen both for television as well as to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id=257>I can, unfortunately, do not agree with the demands of the Liberals.</seg>
<seg id=258>It is and remains primarily a task for the legislation of the Member States, but a konsensuale understanding on specific benchmarks in the dialogue with all interested parties at European level by no means excludes.</seg>
<seg id=259>Under the given conditions, it is in my view, the task of the parents, children, their own national programmes of this kind to preserve.</seg>
<seg id=260>Parents are in this area in particular, the need to include the following: the parameters for the protection of minors in the media in the whole area of the European Union, and the setting up of cheap filtersystemen, availability of legislation on the protection of minors and the responsibility of the media companies and operators in the private and the public sector.</seg>
<seg id=261>If ausschussdebatten when there are those who say that there is no evidence of the negative influence of the various forms of violence on television on children, then I am surprised and think this is a fatal trivialisation.</seg>
<seg id=262>With regard to the introduction of a code selbstkontroll is, above all, from a technical point of view to note that broadcasters in some Member States already have a kontrollcode for television have worked, to enable parents to eliminate the television.</seg>
<seg id=263>. The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=264>Above all, in my report which is in itself praiseworthy generalisations through the return of power to the Member States replaced.</seg>
<seg id=265>That would be the least we can do in the area of freedom, a fundamental right is to ensure that every Community citizen.</seg>
<seg id=266>There is still a late payments in 1996.</seg>
<seg id=267>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani, for the work he has done.</seg>
<seg id=268>I would commend to the House this report and I support the adoption of the amendments put forward by Mr Evans.</seg>
<seg id=269>Our human resources are our sole future in a world in which know everything means.</seg>
<seg id=270>And I know a lot more. There is no problem with Green - I do not know -, black - or rotbüchern, but by means of concrete measures.</seg>
<seg id=271>But Parliament has fulfilled its function and pressure, so that the researchers, however, be included in the text.</seg>
<seg id=272>Your visit today is, at a time when the for the future of European integration is of major importance.</seg>
<seg id=273>However, we know that this process is not yet complete, and therefore in danger of losing its vitality.</seg>
<seg id=274>If we do not now, on this difficult and stormy umbruchphase of European and world history, when will we do it can then?</seg>
<seg id=275>None of us can now claim to know exactly when and in what order we achieve these objectives, but we are all aware of the fact that, if we are to believe they aspire to persevere and half of the way we have behind us and that we have.</seg>
<seg id=276>It is important to ensure that women's jobs nutznießerinnen inferred, are not the same as inequalities in the more traditional sectors should occur, i.e. less qualified jobs, part-time work on a voluntary basis, sometimes not fixed-term contracts and difficult access to decision-making positions.</seg>
<seg id=277>The Council will be dealing with a proposal on the basis of the relevant indicators which progress.</seg>
<seg id=278>In short, the fourth pillar on the equal opportunities means to support the integrated approach of equality through gender mainstreaming and the specific guidelines.</seg>
<seg id=279>I am thinking in particular of violence against women, one of the priorities in governance, and I know that this issue, you have a very special concern.</seg>
<seg id=280>We know that the measures aimed at reconciling work and family life and, in particular, women are, if there is a lack of studies of the current situation of the family and the role of women in the family, which is no longer the traditional roles, because society has changed, and with it the family.</seg>
<seg id=281>Sometimes seem to be some people, including some Members of this House, to believe that to do so would be, but that is not true.</seg>
<seg id=282>Mr President, I would like to conclude by emphasising that gender equality in their own four walls begins.</seg>
<seg id=283>Such a position, and I think it is zwielichtig, and should, in my opinion, in view of the projects to be considered, because it is not certain that we have to improve the practical implementation of reach.</seg>
<seg id=284>In this area, there is no equality.</seg>
<seg id=285>The image of the European Union, as it is in our reports, from our directives, is not in keeping with the Danish of women, the majority of the euro a reject.</seg>
<seg id=286>So I think it is significant that the report to abhebt, in all areas of society, for example in the labour market, must zahlenmäßiges a balance between men and women are produced.</seg>
<seg id=287>That is precisely why it is a missed opportunity that in this report marriage and the family have been completely ignored.</seg>
<seg id=288>This should also of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities better heed!</seg>
<seg id=289>We have heard that the previous presidency the gleichstellungsministerium restructured and only then has abolished.</seg>
<seg id=290>The average wage of women are on average 28% of the men, which will help to ensure that the women of the poor majority of the population, and their participation in social and political life more difficult.</seg>
<seg id=291>This is really by.</seg>
<seg id=292>Europe is taking place today a process of impoverishment of working women, also in France, where at least 15% of them less than 3 650 francs per month for life.</seg>
<seg id=293>Not all countries succeeded in their example to follow, and I hope that the example of France in other countries will bear fruit.</seg>
<seg id=294>The history of the women it is a long way behind.</seg>
<seg id=295>The betrittskandidaten must in the transposition of the acquis communautaire really be helped.</seg>
<seg id=296>This but I need your help.</seg>
<seg id=297>That is not the case, but it is a text satisfactory, and the Committee on Legal Affairs decided, after mature consideration and an in-depth debate and no amendments to it.</seg>
<seg id=298>The Committee on Legal Affairs reached after long debate to take the view that it is not appropriate to the uncertainty about six years to maintain, and that is the period of three years, more than a reasonable period, with the resources and an average carefully to see whether, in the event of irregularities were declaration or not.</seg>
<seg id=299>This is Amendment No 15, in which it is to fraud.</seg>
<seg id=300>The objective, and, above all, a simplified, but qualitative communication with sufficient flexibility, however, the basic regulation, the improvement of the procedures for the collection of customs duties and greater adapting the provisions relating to the registration of customs, can meet the requirements of the single market, and which has been achieved, even in such a way that, in many countries that have inspired quickly, in order to be able to participate in world trade.</seg>
<seg id=301>They would like to thank Parliament, and in particular the committee chaired by Mrs de Palacio Vallelersundi for the efforts of the two institutions for this dossier spent, and the interest that you have shown him.</seg>
<seg id=302>Welcome</seg>
<seg id=303>I would not like to see the vote that will be affected, but the translation of the French version really must be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id=304>Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report,.</seg>
<seg id=305>It is recognized that language skills are a necessary condition for the mobility.</seg>
<seg id=306>Furthermore, we believe that the Member States themselves to a large extent on the taxation should decide.</seg>
<seg id=307>I somewhat regret that we have had no chance, a majority in favour of the need to obtain a verjährungsfrist for the aufbewahren of documents to formulate.</seg>
<seg id=308>- (FR) In the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam, we had at the time the inclusion of Article 13 concerning discrimination on the grounds of gender, race, ethnic origin, religion or the sectarian) (not belief, disability, age or sexual orientation welcomes.</seg>
<seg id=309>The problems of minorities in these countries, are all aware of.</seg>
<seg id=310>From the explanatory statement of the amendment is clearly shows that this is the intention, which is against the rules in the Member States to the old provisions to proceed on the basis of entwicklungspsychologischen perfectly well founded, and the main beschäftigungsleben any importance.</seg>
<seg id=311>I also think everything that in a new Article 12 (a), which was for zusammengeschrieben insulating.</seg>
<seg id=312>To religion and faith. The EPLP welcomes the principle of schutzwürdigkeit report.</seg>
<seg id=313>- (SV) We Christian Democrats welcome the thrust of the proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation.</seg>
<seg id=314>But the only says something about the staffing occupation of internal audit service and nothing on the financial importance and thus on the usefulness of such a service.</seg>
<seg id=315>The EU has decided to build a common military jurisdiction to the so-called Petersberg objectives must comply with the crisis and conflict resolution outside the territory of the EU), but does not have its own defence.</seg>
<seg id=316>Without weapons the world would be much more secure.</seg>
<seg id=317>The motion for a resolution is not of a drastic reduction in sales promotion of a policy of abrüstens from, but I would simply like to make the rules, in order to continue to guarantee rüstungskonzernen profits.</seg>
<seg id=318>In its communication, the Commission acknowledges, the problem is, however, no specific measures, because it is the idea of the liberalisation of the market and competition are arrested. all your proposals are, in fact, the harsh reality, especially for children, the unaccountability of the multinationals, which have gone in their thirst for care about is the impact of their programmes and products, and the responsibility of the parents zuschieben, even on the acquisition of new products to be encouraged, in order to protect their children.</seg>
<seg id=319>As the rapporteur, I too am of the opinion that the measures for the protection of young people from harmful on violent and no longer on the traditional television to restrict, but for all media must apply.</seg>
<seg id=320>With an average of three hours a day is television - and, in addition to sleep for adults in addition to the work - the most important human activity.</seg>
<seg id=321>In addition, women occupy often 'flexible' jobs; fixed-term contracts and low wages are typical of the sectors in which mainly women are employed.</seg>
<seg id=322>They are the first victims of the reduction of public funds, the privatisation in the health sector, the restriction of the right to health care and medical treatment, cuts, which are still tangible vorbeugungs and the right to information programmes.</seg>
<seg id=323>B5 0792 / 2000 by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, on the crisis in Peru.</seg>
<seg id=324>Mr President, I would really like to see here, not only in connection with some urgency, but for a well prepared discussion within the committees have had a debate about Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=325>We must pull out all the stops to Peru candidates with the objective of which is the challenge and are in a position to the request by the Peruvian people after renewal and substantial political democracy.</seg>
<seg id=326>The joint debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=327>We know, Afghanistan is not far from Afghanistan is the world ’ s largest opiumproduzent, so that we can imagine what role this political - not only political mafias - with the extension of the drug trade.</seg>
<seg id=328>The Commission will make an assessment of the humanitarian aid programmes for the benefit of the Afghan population to, so that nobody on the ground is forgotten.</seg>
<seg id=329>This conflict is unspeakable suffering with it.</seg>
<seg id=330>For years, there is a budget line under which minenräum and prevention programmes to be funded.</seg>
<seg id=331>Let me at this point to the reference made by Mrs Paciotti, of course, I say that, even today, within the Commission will ask the question: what has happened with the resources for mine clearance and should be done.</seg>
<seg id=332>B5 0794 / 2000 by Mr Medina Ortega, linksohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the abduction of negotiations with the guerrilla movement in that Spanish Jesuits in Colombia;</seg>
<seg id=333>We all regret this and we would like, not to speak again about Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=334>The Commission has already offered, such a package of measures to coordinate the Commission intends in the next few days, already for funding this zuzusagen.</seg>
<seg id=335>Once again, therefore, a case of double standards, which I think for regrettable.</seg>
<seg id=336>It is incomprehensible that the behaviour of the Albanian opposition party closes here, however, it is necessary that a solution to a problem Albanians in Macedonia.</seg>
<seg id=337>I think it is an extraordinary achievement by the Macedonians, within their own country with clear.</seg>
<seg id=338>That is why I also believe that this reconciliation can be tenable, but the government, with great courage to find a solution to the universitätsfrage and many other issues, it has been visible signs of success and powerful support is needed, otherwise the peace in the region as a whole at risk.</seg>
<seg id=339>In the context of the national programme for the year 2000 can also PHARE funds to support from the University of academic in the coming year, 2001 and 2002, to be used.</seg>
<seg id=340>I should point out that it is already all Greek Members of the European Parliament on this issue have expressed.</seg>
<seg id=341>All of these problems, namely Greece, which concern the largest schifffahrtsektor within the European Union has, in fact, they relate to the security of every kind of shipping in the whole of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=342>In recent years, in our waters, many more people lost their lives, not only by large fährunglücke, but all too often in our own fischereikommunen.</seg>
<seg id=343>On the contrary, innocent victims must now be used to ensure that the ship owners can achieve its objectives in the broadest sense.</seg>
<seg id=344>We must be aware that this is also a question of the credibility of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=345>Finally, I would like to stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the issue of European legislation on the safety of passenger a matter of priority in the European Union must be, and that it is important to ensure that this legislation throughout the Community and in a uniform way strictly applied.</seg>
<seg id=346>I apologise for the fact that I am, for reasons which you are well known, late, I would like to make a brief statement on the two items on the agenda which issues: the situation in Belgrade and the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general and the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=347>Commissioner Verheugen, as Mr Solana on the two issues we are discussing this afternoon on our agenda, namely the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg id=348>We must be prepared to this promise, as soon as the will of the people is respected.</seg>
<seg id=349>Madam President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, I am beteilige me in this debate is not entirely without reservations; I was not in fact that Parliament has given the dramatic consequences of the new gewaltausbruchs in the Middle East, just one month after the in this Chamber today, so confident expectations exclusively as a judge occurs, the authority, or those that should be condemned.</seg>
<seg id=350>Madam President, my contribution today is not based on all kinds of fernanalysen, but on my own experience of the past week, because I was by chance in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, when it came to the gewaltausbrüchen.</seg>
<seg id=351>As an opponent of the violence is the violence of the Israelis and the Palestinians is not on the same footing.</seg>
<seg id=352>I would like to ask the House at this crucial moment, a declaration of solidarity with the brave people to adopt this today in the streets of Belgrade defended the same freedom, solidarity, which we Europeans have a few years ago people receiving other capitals are made, which is also fought for their freedom.</seg>
<seg id=353>There is no doubt that the Europeans would be well advised to us here in this House by the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council to take the opportunity offered schopfe.</seg>
<seg id=354>The status of Jerusalem is a difficult point in the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=355>For years, it is managed, with its propaganda machine brutalem and put pressure on the media, the people in his country, but that, unfortunately, many in the Western world to give you a false picture of the reality vorzuspiegeln.</seg>
<seg id=356>Since the curtain falls to this tragedy, it is the duty of this Parliament, which is a symbol of a united, free Europe, the masses before the Yugoslav Parliament and to support Mr Kostuníca and compliance with the exercise of their mandate to help.</seg>
<seg id=357>It is precisely this irreconcilable attitude is also fear the worst, and the events of this moment to emphasise these words, which I have quoted a few hours ago.</seg>
<seg id=358>I wonder whether the Commissioner on this point, already action plan to show that we really Kostunica as the legally elected representatives of the Serbian people see as the partner with which the European Union today has to do.</seg>
<seg id=359>The European Parliament to him at this historic moment, because the tyranny of wanken equipment and the democracy triumphed, its undivided solidarity beteuern.</seg>
<seg id=360>The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0237 / 2000) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2000 / 24 / EC as regards the extension of the losses to the Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank to cover loans for projects in Croatia [COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000 / 0122 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=361>The following the parliamentary and presidential elections in that country today new political course is to be welcomed.</seg>
<seg id=362>It is a consultative task force, whose aim is to Croatia their competence and technical assistance in the Treaty negotiations to offer.</seg>
<seg id=363>We must not forget that Croatia was until recently the classic example of a totally failed privatisierungsprogramms was, with only a few people have benefited from the privatisation of this whole process must be supported.</seg>
<seg id=364>The debate on possible contribution in the form of EIB loan of EUR 250 million for the period 2000 to 2007, this is not a milestone, but a befördernde help.</seg>
<seg id=365>That is why it is not entirely true, if this report by democratisation of about.</seg>
<seg id=366>As Croatia and the Slovak Republic half a century ago, for the first time, in particular, they were flunkeys became independent of the Hitler regime.</seg>
<seg id=367>We can, of course, the question of the guarantees and the question of Croatia is not separated from the debate yesterday evening and the development in Belgrade.</seg>
<seg id=368>If it is the case that Milosevic has fled and the will of the people has gained the upper hand, then, we hope that it is up to the normal taking practical partnership relations between Serbia and our democracies of the European Union takes just a few days.</seg>
<seg id=369>I declare resumed the session of 6 October 2000, the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, resumed.</seg>
<seg id=370>(The House rose and observed a minute 's silence)</seg>
<seg id=371>My question is: who is power, on behalf of the European Parliament on the Statute to speak?</seg>
<seg id=372>I would ask you, Madam President, that all possible steps to ensure that the current procedure in the Committee on Petitions, in terms of the more than thirty social groups and NGOs protestschreiben tabled, in which the petitioners are opposed to the current situation in the Community, in flagrant violation of radiation to be speeded up.</seg>
<seg id=373>The In Georgia vorgenommene autopsie has shown that it is clearly a murder, probably in conjunction with torture, has acted.</seg>
<seg id=374>We have the opportunity to their dream - which, moreover, not of my - is a major step forward.</seg>
<seg id=375>This is the basic legislation and the basis for any other legislation of genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id=376>It is evident from a fettnäpfchen to another.</seg>
<seg id=377>(The sitting was suspended at 5.50 suspended 17.40 p.m. and resumed at).</seg>
<seg id=378>The next item is the report (A5-0291 / 2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council [COM (2000) 379 - C5 0508 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 (COS)], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the social agenda.</seg>
<seg id=379>To stress the importance of the open coordination method does not mean that this should take the place of social legislation, because we are also in Europe, social rights, laying down minimum social standards and social laws must dare to formulate rules within the framework of a single European market is required.</seg>
<seg id=380>In our opinion, we are calling for dialogue and cooperation with the civil society and, above all, with the women in the countries which are currently in preparation for accession to our European family, because here too we need time for harmonious development action, which in theory and practice, is an example of the rest of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=381>On in the Commission's communication is also listed tätigkeitsfeldern general agreement.</seg>
<seg id=382>At this point in my speech, I would like to remind you that a seminar on this subject, 4 and 5 December will be held in Biarritz, and which I shall chair.</seg>
<seg id=383>As regards the fight against exclusion, on 17 October at the Council meeting on Employment and Social Affairs' great progress and appropriate objectives in the fight against poverty and social exclusion, which defined as a basis for the national action plans to serve.</seg>
<seg id=384>I have heard some quarters to have to read the report, after the diagnosis, but not by the recipe agrees.</seg>
<seg id=385>The development of technology and the new organizational forms is certainly also a flexible cooperation, in the procedural arrangements for less, but rather on the objectives and the results.</seg>
<seg id=386>What is in our view the old-fashioned views due to those charged, which are of a liberalised market do not expect that it regulates all the best.</seg>
<seg id=387>This is crucial to social peace in our country has helped and confidence in foreign direct investors consolidated.</seg>
<seg id=388>The method chosen seems to me to be rather however questionable.</seg>
<seg id=389>When we talk of a Charter of fundamental rights and a European constitution all face, we must not be short-sighted, but we must be open to all the necessary steps need to be taken, even if it takes exakterer rules.</seg>
<seg id=390>I would like to say critical lack of initiatives to the new challenges in the safety of employee participation and in the industrial relations.</seg>
<seg id=391>Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Minister Mrs Péry to congratulate this presentation of the social agenda.</seg>
<seg id=392>We know that these points by the conservatives in Europe to be combated, but we in our group, attach particular importance.</seg>
<seg id=393>The third feature of substance relates to enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=394>The vote will be on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=395>The actions of the Commission, should be a review of the impact of the various Member States for access to health care, social security and pension, and an investigation by the shortcomings in the organisation of work and perhaps also the question of a general working hours to be supplemented.</seg>
<seg id=396>In this way, the women of Europe feel close to Europe, but also by the interesting and innovative ideas, which benefit from the level of commitment to this programme up.</seg>
<seg id=397>We expect an annual report by the President of the Commission in the context of the annual debate in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=398>Moreover, I am delighted that the improvement of measures to child care is provided, work and family life should be facilitated.</seg>
<seg id=399>My group in the final vote will be taken.</seg>
<seg id=400>(The President cut the speaker off).</seg>
<seg id=401>I believe that the new approach, the Commission very positive, and the proposal for a decision on the programme for the period 2001-2005 well thought out.</seg>
<seg id=402>In my opinion, many of us reflect the common position reflects the amendments supported by the Commission and the Women ’ s Committee on this issue.</seg>
<seg id=403>On the one hand, I have, in the course of the past year, the questions put by a number of companies receive a certain amount of impotence in connection with the investigation have seen, not least in those cases in which an appeal against the decision of the Commission, the Court of First Instance appealed to be.</seg>
<seg id=404>I would also like to take this opportunity to Commissioner Monti to ask when the implementation of an effective and efficient, public register of state aid is to be expected, and also, when the prospect of long scoreboard will be put into practice.</seg>
<seg id=405>On the other hand, Mr Monti, I would like to point out that the next report the kreditgewerbe whose area should be given.</seg>
<seg id=406>What I have said, not only in the area of energy policy as a whole, but it is also for other areas.</seg>
<seg id=407>Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work, to the two reports in which they are a flattering assessment of the activities of their person and the Directorate-General for Competition, which they have done.</seg>
<seg id=408>I stress this because the market does not regulate everything, and it is in this sense, and there must be no unlimited competition.</seg>
<seg id=409>Mr President, nobody denies today - and I do not, of course, that the conditions of competition and state aid in the structure of this evil, as they are the inefficiency of the companies.</seg>
<seg id=410>It was at least a strange to hear that he is the reduction in state aid in the period 1994-1998 abstreitet, even though the Commission itself admits that.</seg>
<seg id=411>My opinion is, of course, the Evans report of the Commission on competition policy, but let us now once again fail to look back at the past.</seg>
<seg id=412>In the time available to me, I would like to mention the following three issues: modernisation of Community competition law, work in 1999 on the enforcement of competition rules and, finally, state aid.</seg>
<seg id=413>The Commission is always firmly against kartellbildungen and against the abuse of a dominant position intervened.</seg>
<seg id=414>Mr Rapkay, that the Commission attaches great importance to the support of its competition policy by the European Parliament, and I do not have the impression that this support is decreasing.</seg>
<seg id=415>This system can either at the request of a Member State or in accordance with Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, a provision which can be activated during the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union, only for the Member States with a derogation, is therefore apply to Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden, which is true.</seg>
<seg id=416>In the future should the recourse to the capital market is the only possible option.</seg>
<seg id=417>I would therefore ask that the report as it stands, with the approval of the House and that, therefore, also in the field of rebpflanzgutes the European internal market can be used.</seg>
<seg id=418>It now needs to be changed, and the development of phytosanitären rules and in the scientific and technical progress, in particular, due to the increase in vitro have been achieved.</seg>
<seg id=419>By making this precautionary principle also on the possibility of genetic changes refers, for example, the intensive use of pesticides can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id=420>Finally, I should like to say that we are in the interests of the precautionary principle, if the amendments I have just mentioned, and unfortunately not Article should be withdrawn, then, the wine growers, the view of Mrs Isler Béguin and ausschusse Marianne, therefore, of the environment, public health and consumer protection for their support and vote should be removed.</seg>
<seg id=421>Mr President, with your permission, Commissioner, could you give us its opinion on the amendment tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy set out what we are talking about Amendment No 1.</seg>
<seg id=422>The only controversial point was whether I was on the decree withdrawing the mandate of Mr Le Pen's immediately after its transmission by the French government had to be on the record of "or not.</seg>
<seg id=423>I would remind you that this vote will take place at 12.30 p.m., only.</seg>
<seg id=424>In the field of justice and home affairs I am optimistic in finding a solution to the civil judicial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=425>The preparatory group will be your task to fully until the meeting on 19 November, the date of the next meeting at ministerial level, continue.</seg>
<seg id=426>We need such a anregendes climate, as Mr Moscovici has pointed out, and I was also with the Heads of State and Government a strong feeling of a common, historic responsibility at an historic moment in European integration can enjoy.</seg>
<seg id=427>It is important to ensure that we are now in these matters of qualified majority voting not behind the spirit or the climate of to fall.</seg>
<seg id=428>The small countries are not the befehlsempfänger the large countries of the European Union!</seg>
<seg id=429>I would be grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council, when it would make it clear on this point.</seg>
<seg id=430>Firstly the presence of President Kostunica was an historic event.</seg>
<seg id=431>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is true, the progress made in cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting has been achieved, but there are still be differences of opinion as regards the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council, as you have emphasised.</seg>
<seg id=432>It seems to me rather, that we are going in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id=433>Anyone who is not follow the closer cooperation, which has one of the freedoms of the mitfahrers rücksitz a motor vehicle.</seg>
<seg id=434>I would also like - not even less than it - in the internal affairs of Germany involved, but I believe that this position completely and is, moreover, by the Commission in the desired direction, if I am not mistaken.</seg>
<seg id=435>We have an exchange of views with the Member States on this issue from the start, shows that all the Member States after enlargement, are in favour of maintaining this ceiling.</seg>
<seg id=436>This will certainly not be the case.</seg>
<seg id=437>Firstly, it has sometimes had the impression that, to a certain amount of obsession with the debate between small and large States prevailed.</seg>
<seg id=438>In this regard, in my opinion, it is not enough to say that the Community must be respected.</seg>
<seg id=439>Even after the accession of the candidate countries must now each individual Member State or a junior seniorkommissar retain.</seg>
<seg id=440>The wording of Article 93 of the is problematic in view of the fact that, after the first successful vollzogenen wave almost impossible, to achieve progress in the direction of a qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=441>The citizens of these countries have the undoubted benefits, all the new European Treaty brings with it to be convinced.</seg>
<seg id=442>It would mean the tiefliegenden causes of this crisis to deny, could we accept that the fears for generations voting without new shocks a definitive peace, which is a prerequisite for reconciliation, place could make.</seg>
<seg id=443>I am concerned, the only right weak ECHO on Parliament ’ s demand for democratisation.</seg>
<seg id=444>It may be, but rather the forces be accused of, even before enlargement, the implementation of more reforms demand.</seg>
<seg id=445>On the one hand, the decision of the Heads of Government of Israel to the peace negotiations, because of the violence in the region and freeze its efforts on the formation of a notstandsregierung with the leader of the opposition, Mr Sharon, too.</seg>
<seg id=446>We have, of course unbeschreiblicher with pleasure the victory of the Yugoslav people and the election of Mr Kostuníca to President noted.</seg>
<seg id=447>I commend Mr Barón Crespo, his Italian fellow Members but a reason to ask why it is in Italy, with a very Communist party in the government and in a very different Communist party, the Partito della Rifondazione Comunista, to take part in the preparations for the elections.</seg>
<seg id=448>This should progress has been made in the codecision procedure.</seg>
<seg id=449>The Commission, with the possibility of a simple majority vote in the Commission is in a position to do so to do that in the future.</seg>
<seg id=450>Now, in the European Union not visionary needed, with a view to the year 2030 fixed, but people with solutions that are in a position to accept the problems to which the period of 3 years, bewerkstelligende 8 to enlargement, and to find answers to them.</seg>
<seg id=451>This is therefore an open under conditions of work, not from the top to or has been enforced.</seg>
<seg id=452>. The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=453>Is this fundamental orientierungspunkt lost understands, it is no longer, and, at worst, it is at best, to each other.</seg>
<seg id=454>The democracy is better in Europe, but the European democracy kränkelt.</seg>
<seg id=455>The European Parliament has today, on 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, a simple and strong statement made: yes, you can the European Constitution, yes, we want to achieve it.</seg>
<seg id=456>So it is in itself a sufficient we criterion.</seg>
<seg id=457>I am going to the heart of the matter, I should like to confine myself to the essential points of the report of the committee chairman, Mr Gil-Robles, concentrating on which I would like to say that I find it extremely well.</seg>
<seg id=458>Firstly, the simplification and clearer shape of the Treaties.</seg>
<seg id=459>Here I would like to leave it at that, because the report hochschulinstituts Florence is here - at least for me, not up for discussion.</seg>
<seg id=460>According to the information, there is now a very technical, you will see that I ask that, according to which the Presidency seems to have been a clear majority of the versions in contrast to the Italian version of the application of the cohesion policy to the least favoured islands and not of the islands in general referred to.</seg>
<seg id=461>Mr Duhamel, you will surely agree with me in saying that, if it is not a success of Nice will have no place, or at least no credibility for considering the future of European integration, or at least not in the current context.</seg>
<seg id=462>It is also in the European Constitution to be the division between the Member States and the European Union to define clear and the momentum of European integration in areas with the, where it is essential to act in foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=463>They could also be to continuing obstacles to be overcome.</seg>
<seg id=464>We need a clearer distribution of responsibilities and of a clearer.</seg>
<seg id=465>As you know, there are very different views in the various Member States, in the various social forces.</seg>
<seg id=466>The endzweck a European constitution would, however, unfortunately, exactly the opposite, and we can therefore not accept it.</seg>
<seg id=467>Because in the European Parliament closer to the peoples of the military, the monetary and fiscal policy might be on the table, and then the other to the sidelines.</seg>
<seg id=468>The second version is clearly wrong, because on the one hand, the economically backward regions are already covered by the structural funds, on the other, in accordance with this interpretation and there is no reason for the adoption of the Declaration No. 30 have been.</seg>
<seg id=469>Mr President, I will be brief in my modest 60 seconds on the report by Olivier Duhamel, the focus is excellent, as it is called a spade a spade and the lyrismus our rapporteur earlier us finally convinced.</seg>
<seg id=470>In my opinion, the unity of Europe can only be political.</seg>
<seg id=471>In our view, should the new Constitution already available to the next European elections and can enter into force.</seg>
<seg id=472>Therefore, the term 'the most disadvantaged in terms of the island as applied to the other areas, and according to the proposal by Mr Barnier is here, in accordance with the provisions of the agreement in Vienna, a modification of the Italian text to be carried out.</seg>
<seg id=473>. The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=474>Because the Mrs said that they wanted to vote against this amendment, is lapses.</seg>
<seg id=475>Mr President, it is obvious here after a recipe for the chaos.</seg>
<seg id=476>- I welcome the adoption of the report by Mr Trakatellis, Parliament, it is high quality and safety standards for blood or plasma derivatives from that.</seg>
<seg id=477>If the European parliamentary immunity is independent, would have been to the French authorities with the request for waiver of immunity of Mr Le Pen, we need to address.</seg>
<seg id=478>I am particularly disappointed at the vote of the European Parliament on the report on the marketing of vegetative propagation of the vine.</seg>
<seg id=479>The keep an alcohol, tobacco and drugs for a product that for consumers and their fellow human beings can be damaging to the others see it as a means of creating jobs and a sprudelnde source.</seg>
<seg id=480>The rapporteur welcomes the White Paper, in general, the Commission's proposals on this subject, however, is concerned about the possible impact of the reform, the fundamental aim of the enforcement of competition rules to decentralise.</seg>
<seg id=481>In the debate yesterday evening, I congratulate Mr Jonathan Evans, on his work, but I had outset my clear criticism of the Liberals, if not ultra-liberal orientation of his report.</seg>
<seg id=482>This is the priority interconnection refocused to get over the next three years half of all projects in the Green field in new jobs created in the objective 1 region.</seg>
<seg id=483>In the light of the indignation, the consequences of this policy will trigger, sometimes, with the help of state intervention and state aid and other economic or tax incentives to defuse the situation, at least in part.</seg>
<seg id=484>(The sitting was suspended at 14.06 who p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=485>So we are now in October 2000, on the eve of the decision on the budget for 2001 zahlengerüst.</seg>
<seg id=486>This has not prevented the Council but, agricultural spending overall 555 million euros to cut.</seg>
<seg id=487>Furthermore, we are of the opinion that it is not simply an additional 400 jobs must be created, simply obendrauf.</seg>
<seg id=488>The Council, I can only say that you follow us!</seg>
<seg id=489>That is why the administration for the Members of this House, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id=490>The European Court of Auditors makes us at the moment the least concerns.</seg>
<seg id=491>Finally, the budget of the Ombudsman of us to deal with.</seg>
<seg id=492>On the contrary, we believe that it is in relation to the candidate countries should be pushed the research.</seg>
<seg id=493>In addition, we propose that will continue to keep Parliament regularly informed.</seg>
<seg id=494>And if a legislative conciliation on social affairs, the environment or culture takes place, the Commissioner will agree with me, then let us, together, the Commissioner for the budget, the Finance Ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets to work together to pray that no financial ungereimtheit is committed.</seg>
<seg id=495>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your kind welcome.</seg>
<seg id=496>Instead, he has already approved at first reading of the budget for 2001, which they appear to be justified, without a tactical considerations, with the aim of ergehen the proper management of the Community institutions must continue to seek, it would have been detrimental.</seg>
<seg id=497>Before the vote on the budget 2001, I would like to highlight a series of objectives, on the agreement between the Council and Parliament, and there is an agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority can lead.</seg>
<seg id=498>In the structural policy, we are in a similar situation.</seg>
<seg id=499>The conciliation procedure in the summer - that, Mr Colom I Naval pointed out - has had a good result, namely that future improved information ausgabewirksamen legal bases in the European Parliament to be made available.</seg>
<seg id=500>I would remind you that last year adopted in the financial programming for the Balkans only 1.85 billion for the whole of the period until 2006.</seg>
<seg id=501>I would ask you once again - that the Commission makes its proposal on the table - to examine this proposal with an open mind and also as an opportunity to consider.</seg>
<seg id=502>The material was both for planning the budget for 2001 as well as to the discharge for the year 1999 it very useful.</seg>
<seg id=503>Indeed, I as a Member of the Committee on Budgets on the work of this body, and so I very much appreciate the work carried out by the rapporteur and the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but not fail to draw attention to two amendments which the committee has once again presented in plenary and whose importance despite less, is not entirely unwesentlich.</seg>
<seg id=504>With these measures, we want to judicial control again fully functional, confidence in the legal certainty of the EU restore and strengthen the European Union as a community based on law.</seg>
<seg id=505>The Commission 's vorgenommene ersatzlose to delete this initiative was a clear lack of political will of Lisbon and the priority of this House.</seg>
<seg id=506>This decision was very strange, and many of us with the feeling that this important programme simply back at the mercy between the Committee on Budgets and the Commission had become.</seg>
<seg id=507>My third point is the European agricultural policy, as they are now in the preliminary draft budget there.</seg>
<seg id=508>If the employment a political priority of the Union, then we as a further the fisheries sector to remain outside.</seg>
<seg id=509>I am particularly pleased that the funding for the new year adopted last on the Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000 programmes be secured.</seg>
<seg id=510>The delays in our mittelmeerhilfe, for example, amount to the budgets of several years.</seg>
<seg id=511>Mr President, over the past few years I was a spokesman for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on whose behalf this afternoon Mrs Iivari said.</seg>
<seg id=512>But I would like the House this afternoon, to say that we should not lose sight of the fact that the EU is only 1% of GDP and a large proportion of consumed hiervon administered in the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=513>Let me now to turn to the general strategy.</seg>
<seg id=514>This is the strategy of my group, I now come, because the starting point is the desire of our convictions, to the citizens of Europe as a favourable cost-benefit ratio.</seg>
<seg id=515>On the contrary, we need to work towards a Parliament, for the transparency, efficiency and effective democratic control of the European institutions entry.</seg>
<seg id=516>Then we must consider as to how we solve this problem.</seg>
<seg id=517>We want to promote democratisation, and we want a balanced relationship between the traditional policy areas of foreign policy, we now have before us.</seg>
<seg id=518>The biggest problem in the new draft budget concerns the external measures.</seg>
<seg id=519>Sparsames economies is, of course, need to be supported by us, and let us also not for mogeln.</seg>
<seg id=520>This is an extraordinary initiative, particularly in the first reading, and it is a thankless initiative because it does not find a majority in the current circumstances.</seg>
<seg id=521>Nevertheless raises the size of the haushaltsansatzes for Kosovo on a number of problems.</seg>
<seg id=522>With the budget we have the confidence of the citizens in the European policy win.</seg>
<seg id=523>All measures to strengthen the small and medium-sized enterprises are therefore support it.</seg>
<seg id=524>The scale of the implementation of the budget,</seg>
<seg id=525>It maintains this strategic approach to the budget line as this and in the next few years, then this Parliament takes its place in the budgetary procedure in full.</seg>
<seg id=526>With the transfer of 175 million we have around EUR 25 million available more than we had expected.</seg>
<seg id=527>The Council has said on the subject of MEDA, the commitments are not a problem, because for eight years late payments have been accumulated.</seg>
<seg id=528>I believe that Mr Duff was this morning, when we present to the European Council in Biarritz entered into.</seg>
<seg id=529>My answer is quite simply.</seg>
<seg id=530>Ramiro Zapata was the last in the 25 human rights activists, recently published in the press and the Colombian Plan "100" the paramilitary groups, the 100 human rights activists to be murdered.</seg>
<seg id=531>The present attitude of the Council I am more than satisfied the July, but it seems that the European Union, as we have seen in many situations, internationally, the last to enter into phenomenon and its voice to be heard.</seg>
<seg id=532>My question is as follows, and I will end here, whether it is not possible to have a stronger pressure, as proposed by the President, in its information, and whether the aid that we are trying to do with the help of the United States is basic difference is that it does not refer to the fumigation of plantations, but on the replanting of other cultures and not of the military, but on the social aspects of this.</seg>
<seg id=533>The by myself and the other Members questions relate specifically to the situation in Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=534>As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 together.</seg>
<seg id=535>Subject: the taxation of financial transactions, the demand for a tax on capital gains in recent months there have been more and more ground. so many committees (Attac association pour une taxation sur les transactions financières et citoyens pour l aide aux) in France and in Europe and in the French National Assembly and in the Senate amendments.</seg>
<seg id=536>On the other hand, we must also answer the question, what impact they have on the volatility of the markets, especially in the case of a sentence of 0.1 per, while the speculators with devaluations in the order of 20 to 50% expect.</seg>
<seg id=537>In paragraph 26 on the other hand, it calls for the establishment of an international schiedsorganisation cancellation of the debts of the countries of the South.</seg>
<seg id=538>It was, incidentally, in the case of the euro jahresmaßstab, irrespective of whether they are to be deplored or welcomes.</seg>
<seg id=539>What Danielle Auroi spoke about in the countries of the south has said, I should like to add that the estimates of specialists interesting figures contained, for example, that a tax in the form of the Tobin tax revenue from 50 to 250 billion dollars would provide, according to the UNDP estimates USD 40 billion per year, would be enough to ensure a minimum living conditions for the hundreds of millions of people to ensure that they are in third world countries in particular are lacking.</seg>
<seg id=540>In the last few months is the disease, among other things, in various parts of France has occurred.</seg>
<seg id=541>Now, as the representative of the French Presidency is here, I would like to know whether the slaughter of cattle from the EU budget, or from the national budget and paid according to see whether it is appropriate to them from the EU budget to repay.</seg>
<seg id=542>I would ask you to your consent that you are now can be answered.</seg>
<seg id=543>The room for manoeuvre of the two government concerned by international law is therefore limited.</seg>
<seg id=544>That is a mystery, as the Commission is already in February to comment on this, and what they need, and the Council in July.</seg>
<seg id=545>If the European Union in the name of subsidiarity, such a move forward to the day, it is in fact a exempt themselves from their task to be met, as you that, in recent weeks, both in Northern Italy, as well as in Spain has done.</seg>
<seg id=546>How can I as a Member of the European Parliament, the majority of the heart, allow the 11.5 billion pounds from British taxpayers' money - that is our current jahresbeitrag - be spent, if the public is not behind?</seg>
<seg id=547>With a more flexible attitude on the part of the Council could be an agreement at second reading to be found in the budget we.</seg>
<seg id=548>If anyone is still convinced that he will have to be looking to demonstrate.</seg>
<seg id=549>Mr Joan Colom I Naval, the Vice-President responsible for buildings, this strategy has already presented.</seg>
<seg id=550>As Commissioner Schreyer has already mentioned, this year's draft budget contains many political messages, and the reform of the common agricultural policy and the new structural programmes to ensure better implementation of structural policy, the implementation of the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit and the creation of a more competitive EU and to combat social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=551>The NATO war has destroyed and too much to great suffering left.</seg>
<seg id=552>Despite the agreements reached, sometimes I wonder whether it is possible to achieve this objective within the framework of the existing budget constraints to achieve, without the agricultural budget, for a sustainable agricultural sector in the present Member States, it is vital to undermine.</seg>
<seg id=553>And I have told Mr Kostuníca and quite clear: it must be its chance and will, I hope that in the next few weeks or months, to ensure an amnesty, but now I am entirely in favour of the political level and in terms of the budget to the introduction of two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, political conditions attached.</seg>
<seg id=554>The elections in Yugoslavia have shown two: the last people have had enough of the dictator Milosevic, and they have confidence in Mr Kostuníca Professor.</seg>
<seg id=555>I am sure that also the Albanian political prisoners are released soon.</seg>
<seg id=556>If we do not, it will inevitably lead to a 'planning', aimed at redistributions cuts both in general, and the social and environmental expenditure as well as in terms of cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=557>These are initiatives to resolve the major social problems, such as unemployment, asked.</seg>
<seg id=558>Of course, a fact I stage as an extremely important one, namely the fact that we have started under heading 4, that they have to be tackled, but it is not clear whether, now that we have managed to find a solution, because the Council of Ministers not enough is willing to cooperate.</seg>
<seg id=559>Every budgetary work, it is important to to set priorities.</seg>
<seg id=560>This is with a view to the expiry of the Treaty in the near future is very serious, but it would be extremely serious if the legal framework on the ECSC following the possibility of such practices that would be.</seg>
<seg id=561>This leads to my third point, what is now facing us.</seg>
<seg id=562>The new finanzvereinbarung there is not, the distrust of the politicians in the EU is growing, as I know.</seg>
<seg id=563>To you deserves recognition.</seg>
<seg id=564>The willingness of all the institutions concerned has an unprecedented cooperation which will enable it to us, I hope very much that I will, in the first reading to reach agreement.</seg>
<seg id=565>We, for our European values in an EU country are sceptical, now have a further argument in favour of the European Union: a more effective protection of personal data, for the citizens of the modern society is of major importance.</seg>
<seg id=566>I have noticed that in my own country, an amendment of the law on personal data is to be carried out which influence the decisions of the Members of the Commission's accounts.</seg>
<seg id=567>In many other points, we are also problems here must await the verdict of the practice to be sure to go.</seg>
<seg id=568>- (FR) The Commission would first like to mention the commitment which we have all the citizens, the protection of personal data processed by the institutions.</seg>
<seg id=569>In making this statement, the Commission accepts that the scope of the regulation solely on the activities within the framework of the first pillar is limited.</seg>
<seg id=570>In accordance with the political agreement reached with the Council, the Commission and the rapporteur for adoption at first reading has achieved, it will not, therefore, any amendment of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and who reject the Paciotti report is included, except for Amendment No 69 on the correction of Amendment No 41.</seg>
<seg id=571>That is why it is essential that the staff of the dienststellenübergreifenden group within the General Secretariat of the Commission must be increased, so that all proposals of acts with general scope for its review by the Commission on the basis of Article 299 (2) can be added a thorough impact assessment.</seg>
<seg id=572>From the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is, I am keen to point out that it is really the only treat can, as it is.</seg>
<seg id=573>In view of the importance of fisheries for the outermost regions, I am saddened that.</seg>
<seg id=574>Since, under the presidency by Delors an interdepartmental group for the outermost regions have been a long and fruitful, we have a long way, and I have of this group, which has led to the extreme tiefempfundenen Europeans living in peripheral areas.</seg>
<seg id=575>As already contained in the Treaty of Rome a reference to the French overseas departments, but it took until 1989 and right up to the POSEI programmes, the programmes for resolving the problems specific to the remote and island retirement, so far as the European Union finally realised that the unveränderliche geballte nature and the appearance of the structural disadvantages of the outermost regions, special treatment in comparison with other regions of the Community justify.</seg>
<seg id=576>I have no doubt that the proposals that the Commission submit to the Council, which is to be characterised by these characteristics.</seg>
<seg id=577>This issue will be all the more relevant, the closer the enlargement is.</seg>
<seg id=578>This right of differentiation is nothing but a result of the principle of equality, therefore, to be treated differently, which is different.</seg>
<seg id=579>It is a document that I and my team as rich in ideas and proposals, to look at the heart of the vordringt none of the problems and issues that disregards the in the outermost regions are cause for concern.</seg>
<seg id=580>In her report, Mrs Sudre, rightly highlighted the need for a long-term action.</seg>
<seg id=581>The revival of the economic diversification, we have made progress in a number of essential areas.</seg>
<seg id=582>Now, it is crucial that a large number of projects within the framework of the DOCUPs proposed, but at the same time as this activity on the ground, we have the specific needs of the specific to each of these outermost regions, a comprehensive analysis.</seg>
<seg id=583>Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg id=584>I will, of course the President on your information.</seg>
<seg id=585>I am worried about the fact that many more devices and the decisions of the House could be called into question, because the necessary arrangements for the absence of such a case.</seg>
<seg id=586>Both the food safety agency, as well as the proposals presented to us, which are intended to guarantee of food safety, will receive the support of this Parliament, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=587>The focus is on its work of the scientific advice, because the debate on food safety must be equally on an objective basis to be held.</seg>
<seg id=588>Mr President, I would not fail to the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and for his willingness to take into account the opinions of the other committees, to express my thanks.</seg>
<seg id=589>If we are faced with a potential risk, the precautionary principle must be applied.</seg>
<seg id=590>What is still a controversial issue concerns the extent to which we in the remit of this authority, issues such as the food and the advice and support of the authorities to carry out risk management, to take into account, we believe that this agency for food standards in all matters of food safety should at least be given the opportunity to deliver an opinion and to offer its support.</seg>
<seg id=591>It is of crucial importance the preservation of the rich traditions.</seg>
<seg id=592>Any such recognition, it will not through legislation, not by rules, but the integrity of scientific spitzenqualität, by independence, of accountability, transparency and comprehensibility by.</seg>
<seg id=593>Good scientific knowledge are certainly indispensable, if the risks associated with the food chain, from the farm to the table, would do better.</seg>
<seg id=594>Mr President, there is no doubt that the establishment of a European food safety agency, as our rapporteur you mention, widely supported.</seg>
<seg id=595>If the programme who continue to have the necessary resources and the need to support, we do not need additional agency, this applies in particular to an agency with one of the 15 Member States of the European Union as a limited scope.</seg>
<seg id=596>The food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers, because consumers want to eat healthily, and we must concern ourselves.</seg>
<seg id=597>If we do not get new framework directive, we will have a great deal in the area of food safety can only smile.</seg>
<seg id=598>Consequently, in the EU Treaty changes are needed so that the Commission sanctions in the food sector in the hands of be given, as these are already in the field of competition.</seg>
<seg id=599>I support all partners, whether in the political, administrative, or in other trägerschaften the strategy 'food for all work. "</seg>
<seg id=600>I agree with this statement is not to, as a man is more than just a body.</seg>
<seg id=601>The authority must be the main by the coordination of the network of the national agencies, which, in turn, a network of excellence for food safety at the level of the regions on the need to launch and coordinate.</seg>
<seg id=602>Their Amendment No 11 and Amendment No 17, I should therefore be to reconcile its.</seg>
<seg id=603>The reform of food legislation in the European Union should be at the level of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=604>In his report are not so much amendments put forward rather than priorities.</seg>
<seg id=605>In the report we have for this clearly, and I very much welcome.</seg>
<seg id=606>The creation of a European agency for food safety, however, is extremely positive move.</seg>
<seg id=607>In the interests of all European citizens is to hope that these criteria will also be respected.</seg>
<seg id=608>In my view, must be laid down specific periods within which the European Commission, in any case, the justifiable cause for concern, to the point.</seg>
<seg id=609>The EU must their citizens in the food sector highest possible standards guarantee.</seg>
<seg id=610>The Commission is now proposing the establishment of a European food authority before.</seg>
<seg id=611>I am concerned that Europe is once again in danger of a bloated bureaucracy to do, which is unable to act.</seg>
<seg id=612>The more we create a new bureaucratic levels and the more money we spend, the less we can do this.</seg>
<seg id=613>They prevent similar and parallel work in several institutions.</seg>
<seg id=614>However, we must avoid that, in the shadow of the discussion on the White Paper, the fear of the public in a bureaucratic Europe, on the quality of the products, without influence is effectively against the health and misleading the consumer has to be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id=615>As you know, enjoys the strategy on food safety in the Commission's top priority.</seg>
<seg id=616>The Commission will adopt a proposal for a regulation, the framework for future health in the food sector and which will form the overall principles and objectives of food to be set.</seg>
<seg id=617>Thank you very much, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=618>But now to our report: I bewerte the Commission ’ s proposal as positive and to say that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation of Parliament's intensive work to make it possible, on certain points, in particular, to further improve.</seg>
<seg id=619>As our colleague Mrs Bonino, clearly and explicitly mentioned, the Commission's proposal for a regulation is a further step forward.</seg>
<seg id=620>We believe that the proposal for a regulation of the Commission for too vague.</seg>
<seg id=621>It is essential that the budget for mine clearance is organised in accordance with reasonable and that we are funding for research detektions räumungsarbeiten instruments, and, on the ground, in a simple way, so that they can be used in developing countries to help.</seg>
<seg id=622>In the past eight years, we have more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget for the fight against landmines allocated.</seg>
<seg id=623>We can, however, the people not punish unfähige for their government.</seg>
<seg id=624>As I have already said, it would, in my view, although well-intentioned, but wrong and counterproductive, accession to the Ottawa Convention to be made immediately and to become a condition for support for mine action by the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=625>I reject Amendment No 19 as from.</seg>
<seg id=626>Secondly, the global Community coordination at a global level and, in particular in the countries concerned.</seg>
<seg id=627>Mr President, the Socialist Group agrees with the comments made by Mr Van Orden, and is also proud of the role of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=628>We remember the Soviet spielzeugbomben in Afghanistan!</seg>
<seg id=629>Thank you very much for the excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=630>Mr President, the Cambodians described the mines as eternal wachposten.</seg>
<seg id=631>Uniformed forces towards the people have a legitimate suspicion that has long kriegsjahren has built in.</seg>
<seg id=632>Mr President, I am pleased that there is a European legislation in the form of a regulation on anti-personnel mines, and that we have today is a good report from Mrs Bonino on this regulation before us.</seg>
<seg id=633>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are dealing with a very sad subject to do.</seg>
<seg id=634>It is not by chance the mines are mainly in crisis regions, i.e. in areas where different kind of initiatives could be taken in order to overcome this crisis.</seg>
<seg id=635>In two kilometres from a distance Bosnian village, in 1999, a sign to the minengefahr in a field that is not, however, prevent that there is a small boy.</seg>
<seg id=636>It is tragic, if the civilian population, the inability of the leaders of their suffering.</seg>
<seg id=637>Allow me, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of our institution, with the special relations with their country within the framework of our common project to build an area of prosperity, security and peace in the Mediterranean region maintains, to welcome.</seg>
<seg id=638>All mines are in depots.</seg>
<seg id=639>Mr President, I agree with almost everything, what my fellow Members have said earlier, I shall not repeat it.</seg>
<seg id=640>Their concept of open cooperation is synonymous with a relapse into the institutional system dominated by Commission officials.</seg>
<seg id=641>We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, the fact that decisions as close to those affected as possible will be taken.</seg>
<seg id=642>Nevertheless, since the main points of the PPE Group for just a majority, could I have voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg id=643>Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the results of the informal European Council, to the for two reasons: firstly, because I have had the opportunity, in particular on paragraphs 2 and 5, and this split vote to express my opposition to both.</seg>
<seg id=644>In other words, at the table of the common European home would some à la carte dishes, while others with einheitsmenü content.</seg>
<seg id=645>And the democratic control should not relax, but, in our opinion, the main problem in the European Union in the list of these rights or their inclusion in the Treaties.</seg>
<seg id=646>The instrument of the referenda and the related amendments to this report have already been addressed.</seg>
<seg id=647>In the elections to the European Parliament in 1999 by the turnout was only 40%, if those countries with wahlpflicht and those who, at the same time as the European elections, abrechnet carried out national elections.</seg>
<seg id=648>In order to achieve the desired objective of a European Constitution, it is not advisable to strict rechtsfiguren and methods to oktroyieren whose consequences that would miss the desired objective.</seg>
<seg id=649>A real social constitution should the most important achievements, to assist the employment of women, immigrants, and the citizen 's upwards to adapt.</seg>
<seg id=650>- (PT) I have not voted in favour, although I, a commendable intention lighting, the strengthening and deepening of the European Union and the simplification of the texts, which is necessary for its citizens, not abspreche.</seg>
<seg id=651>The competences</seg>
<seg id=652>In my opinion, it is crucial that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights a following the Convention of the Council of Europe means.</seg>
<seg id=653>The report by Mr Gil-Robles, to help me, however, because it contains the proposal that a number of Member States of the European Union on certain issues, sectors and areas coordinate a common approach.</seg>
<seg id=654>If on more and more important issues will be decided by qualified majority decisions, basic standards of democracy are violated.</seg>
<seg id=655>Today, it is trying to block the strengthened cooperation more flexible, and will also be subject to this.</seg>
<seg id=656>The report before us is to clarify the position of the Parliament's resolution of 13 April 2000).</seg>
<seg id=657>We are, by and large, a so-called flexible cooperation with good.</seg>
<seg id=658>The UK Labour Members of the PSE Group welcome the agreement on her contribution to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference on the issue of closer cooperation, even if they do not agree with all the details.</seg>
<seg id=659>These island regions must take an active part of the European Union feel that they will, I hope, in a paradise for tourists as well as for the local population will turn.</seg>
<seg id=660>In the Middle Ages were these regions and their populations of Europe, and, today, as they are not really European.</seg>
<seg id=661>In fact, to the specific features of these regions, which, in general, because of their island status and their distance from the continent, but also from its chronic dependence on a few products or by a single product, that we need to overcome these obstacles appropriate, specific measures are taken.</seg>
<seg id=662>Mr President, please excuse me if I am to the Bureau and the interpreters here once again to aufhalte to my last explanation of vote to listen to and I would like in particular to my solidarity with the translators our explanations of vote, in my case, the Italian woman ornella buson.</seg>
<seg id=663>From these texts which is very clear that this agency and the reduction or paralysis of the national schutzbefugnisse seeks to bring it to the service of the kommissionsziele.</seg>
<seg id=664>This from the Commission and the European Parliament would not, however, that this institution as a 'authority', although this description of completely contradicts the philosophy behind this institution.</seg>
<seg id=665>This is not exactly what we are proposing the Bowis report, in which one has the feeling that the food safety will essentially be another pretext, by means of which we are familiar with the process of strengthening the powers of the Commission to the detriment of the national institutions and the safety of citizens would further.</seg>
<seg id=666>That is why I think it would be appropriate to make this statement on behalf of the European Parliament, which always respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all the faith groups has occurred, this incredible actions to condemn.</seg>
<seg id=667>Madam President, I understand the rapporteur 's einwürfe, but with the amendments of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural development is not just about money voted, but it will also be voting on a particular direction.</seg>
<seg id=668>I would also ask you to support this, that we have a budget line 206, acquisition of property to adjust, depending on what amendments are adopted, so that we have our own limit of 20% of total administrative expenditure is not exceed.</seg>
<seg id=669>Before the vote on Amendment No 929</seg>
<seg id=670>Section VI, and economic and social</seg>
<seg id=671>Report (A5-0276 / 2000) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation with additional technical measures for the recovery of the kabeljaubestandes in the Irish Sea (ICES) VII) [COM (2000) 0190 - C5 0219 / 2000 - 2000 / 0071 (CNS))</seg>
<seg id=672>(Parliament adopted the resolution for.)</seg>
<seg id=673>The export subsidies, the EU's lebensmittelüberschuss at dumping prices on the world market, which in turn led to serious competition, for example, the food industry in many developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=674>In order to have sufficient financial resources for additional release in the Balkans, the Member States will have to redistribute funds from the existing budget.</seg>
<seg id=675>Nevertheless, it is the European Parliament managed to push through a number of important tasks - not least in terms of increased efforts in the fight against unemployment and poverty, a number of important environmental and gender equality, etc., we are against the attacks on the right of the LIFE programme and the European Women 's Lobby.</seg>
<seg id=676>As for travel expenses for Members of the European Parliament is concerned, we think that in our view, that this is only the actual travel costs incurred when we are paid.</seg>
<seg id=677>I assume - and I hope that the Commission will constructively with appropriate solutions for - that we have three years between 2002 and 2005, with a transitional period will be filled.</seg>
<seg id=678>In order, above all, the national parliaments to a genuine gag to miss, within the framework of the European Commission has put forward a proposal for a regulatory and liberalisierungswut directly binding regulation, rather than a directive, presented in a genuine hauruckverfahren by Parliament and the Council of Ministers to be gepeitscht already on 31 December of this year to enter into force.</seg>
<seg id=679>We therefore support the Commission's reformbestrebungen and not the other from preferential treatment in this sector.</seg>
<seg id=680>This they were in heavy dependence on borrowing.</seg>
<seg id=681>(Nicholson report (a) 0276 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=682>The zweckentfremdung of resources for military targets must be avoided.</seg>
<seg id=683>We have always taken the view that the cost of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the first instance of the actual verursachern, i.e. of big business, and at the expense of their superprofite must go.</seg>
<seg id=684>Mr Moreira Da Silva Report (A5-0271 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=685>This money should be used by the expenditure on research in all 15 Member States of the European Union and be coordinated with each other.</seg>
<seg id=686>In order to make provision for this, it is right to give us clear about these substances.</seg>
<seg id=687>That concludes voting time.</seg>
<seg id=688>It should then take the place of the national formats are already used everywhere.</seg>
<seg id=689>The zahlungsbilanzstatistische loss as a result of this amendment is minimal.</seg>
<seg id=690>You have to imagine that, first and foremost of small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned.</seg>
<seg id=691>We press for for years to a harmonisation of effort.</seg>
<seg id=692>I believe that this report really is of crucial importance to the citizens, the small and medium-sized enterprises, including in the euro zone to integrate and acceptance of the Economic and Monetary Union.</seg>
<seg id=693>The free movement of capital with the single currency must not need or greater differences.</seg>
<seg id=694>Despite this, to the European Parliament and the Commission the great attention.</seg>
<seg id=695>I support the twin-track approach of the rapporteur, and with it the hesitant to encourage banks to move.</seg>
<seg id=696>We are not forcing banks to verlustträchtigen business, but we as politicians can the amendment tabled by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs, you have for the PPE-DE Group, have tabled support what measures before the end of next year, and the best, the existence of such standards in the introduction of notes and coins will be called for.</seg>
<seg id=697>The request by Mrs Peijs, and I also aims in the direction of the banks in a table together, not to set out to do, but because we are short of the political side, the pressure is increasing.</seg>
<seg id=698>If the handling of cross-border transfers is just as expensive as today, is the credibility of the new coins and banknotensystems called into question.</seg>
<seg id=699>In our opinion, this form of the collection of statistical data on transactions unionsinternen a relic of the past, and this in a single area integrated, no longer be justified, and the proper functioning of the internal market affected.</seg>
<seg id=700>If I were to the speeches of some of my colleagues in the Committee, the Members of this House for longer than I have heard, I have the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, the European Parliament is now, for the fourth time unterzieht in this category.</seg>
<seg id=701>I thank you in advance for the support my report.</seg>
<seg id=702>But if you look at the European level withdraw, then we have to give the regions more opportunities.</seg>
<seg id=703>The SMEs are at the forefront in job creation, in both qualitative and quantitative, as well as in that way, play a key role in favour of social cohesion and planning.</seg>
<seg id=704>Through the careful study of the proposals and the vote with many interested parties, they help to clarify the wording of the programme and the best possible preparations for his work.</seg>
<seg id=705>Thirdly, we must try to an additional European use.</seg>
<seg id=706>Drawn is that it is small and medium-sized enterprises will only be useful when the unemployment rate too low, if the public budgets at all levels of debt are freely and have enough resources to this in the investitionshaushalt cease.</seg>
<seg id=707>Companies required clarity.</seg>
<seg id=708>Above all, if there is a man or a company operating under 250 employees a project, it is not only with sicherstellungen of land with 120% assurance to be possible, but it should also be possible, with a good idea to be financed.</seg>
<seg id=709>The Member States and also the regional or local authorities have already operate as a huge finanzpumpen, that is, the taxpayers' money, that is to say the majority of the population, including the poorest, eingetriebenen money in the pockets of the large companies and their owners and shareholders to pump.</seg>
<seg id=710>The small and medium-sized enterprises to thousands of zarten plant shows that the large companies as seed for human schaffenskraft and ideas.</seg>
<seg id=711>I would like to see the Commissioner in connection with all the proposed measures are most concerned about the fact that a faster and easier access to information and assistance is being created, so that those who hold these companies are in a position to effectively use of this information.</seg>
<seg id=712>You will all find their place in the multiannual programme.</seg>
<seg id=713>Finally, I also endorse the idea that we meet once a year, to take stock of the implementation of the programme to account.</seg>
<seg id=714>The recent actions against the Greek minority in die areas, more forceful measures on democratisation, to strengthen the institutions and the protection of human rights in Albania.</seg>
<seg id=715>A substantial number of by Albanians, leave their homeland, due to the insecurity in their country, because of the social difficulties, because the prämodernen social and family structures.</seg>
<seg id=716>We particularly need to Albania tailored preventive measures in order to help in the construction or the reconstruction of the country in order to provide a decent standard of living in the region.</seg>
<seg id=717>Thus, the documents of a body to other longer, and the European Commission is refusing, for example, the report that, amongst other things, by the Albanians prepared customs assistance mission (cam), to be published.</seg>
<seg id=718>Let us to face the truth.</seg>
<seg id=719>Mrs Karamanou, my congratulations to the broad and comprehensive ïhorizon tour of her report.</seg>
<seg id=720>This is a very important issue, the for historical, social, political and economic situation arises.</seg>
<seg id=721>The real number of dead, we will never find.</seg>
<seg id=722>Common business create peaceful links.</seg>
<seg id=723>However, what I find totally unacceptable on this report and I would like to point out is that cause and effect here, in other words, the illegal immigration with a system of weighted visas and thus be confused migrationsmöglichkeit is it the other way round.</seg>
<seg id=724>The Treaty of Amsterdam derived from the major institutional reforms had an impact on the treatment of problems refugee and immigration policy.</seg>
<seg id=725>Thirdly and lastly, the action plan and its implementation must be considered regional.</seg>
<seg id=726>But, of course, this request fare also to ourselves, economical deal with European rules.</seg>
<seg id=727>This strength of the Community action must now be highlighted.</seg>
<seg id=728>I also call for changes in the existing legislation, the EC codified, the proposals will be presented in the amendments to the existing directives or regulations are incorporated.</seg>
<seg id=729>The principle of subsidiarity, that we have understood properly, in both directions: decisions taken at the lowest level, but to come to recognise that the level niedrigstmögliche sometimes a very high level can be when it is universal values, which are threatened loss, and if they do not always equally protected.</seg>
<seg id=730>The report is a perfect example of concise, clear wording, and I hope that colleagues will have a great deal of serious note of that.</seg>
<seg id=731>The report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was in its Members not of enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id=732>I am delighted that the report on the SLIM project has, since the Community legislation Mr Medina Ortega, we read in one of the articles of the Treaty is a test for the experts are difficult to understand.</seg>
<seg id=733>That is why solve some aspects of the report, I have little enthusiasm, because I would have liked a more 'vergemeinschaftenden' report with regard to the internal market wanted, and it is obvious that the report is that it is not steeped in.</seg>
<seg id=734>For the EU institutions, it is important that we have the explicit commitment, the quality of legislation, particularly with a view to subsidiarity, should be improved.</seg>
<seg id=735>. The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=736>The persistence of this condition could the end and the acceptance of citizens in relation to the euro will have a negative effect.</seg>
<seg id=737>Mr President, we have with very great care in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs the Karamanou report prepared.</seg>
<seg id=738>But as the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I should like to our oral question and this debate to make both sides - because our motion for a resolution is addressed to both sides, a few comments, and I would like to present it with a great deal to do.</seg>
<seg id=739>This is the demand of the peoples of the Union, which we represent here.</seg>
<seg id=740>Much water is gone down the Rhine, the agreement has not yet expired and has been replaced.</seg>
<seg id=741>I can understand the reasons for the Commissioner, but not the the Director-General would.</seg>
<seg id=742>We could say that we eleven months after the closure of our vessels to continue for the prior agreement of the previous for the previous.</seg>
<seg id=743>Mr President, a similar debate we were a year ago, and the fact that it has taken a year before negotiations can be included in the first place, demonstrates just how difficult it is for our great fleets that fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id=744>The second agreement was the situation clear.</seg>
<seg id=745>But we have to understand that everything is, at last, the fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id=746>That is why I am particularly keen to make it clear that the PPE-DE Group, not only in hervorgetan to the fisheries agreements to support to defend and promote, but also to extend its determination to promote.</seg>
<seg id=747>Thirdly, the exploitation of the Sahara fanggrundes since the suspension of the fisheries agreement by Community fleets and the other has been continued, neither the Commission nor the control by the Member States subject: it is, above all, a major fleet from the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id=748>I understand this very well, because the fishing industry has been a source of jobs created and, in terms of a European, poor region.</seg>
<seg id=749>Another aspect to which I would like to highlight is the expiry of the temporary aid for fishermen and vessel owners at the end of this year served as compensation for a halt to this situation is intolerable, for everyone to work rather than aid.</seg>
<seg id=750>I am a year as an Andalusian parliamentarians here, in the corridors of the Bureau, in the Committee on Fisheries and in the discussions with the Commissioner to negotiate and to propose initiatives in order to ensure that the special character of the Andalusian fishing fleets will be taken into account, in Morocco, fangbetrieb carried out.</seg>
<seg id=751>Spain has the difficult neighbourhood, in the past, repeatedly between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco, which has been developed in a very positive way.</seg>
<seg id=752>As a Spanish Member Andalusian and I call upon the right of thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families on conservation and protection of jobs, which has almost a year are at risk, and we also need to be protected from this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=753>We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=754>Almost a 12-year history and kanzleitrost, delaying tactics, hopes, personal distress to placebo for those affected, to the defence of tough old rights to people who were nothing more than its right.</seg>
<seg id=755>As you know, the matter is extremely complex and happens around 700 employees to 25 Italian universities.</seg>
<seg id=756>If the Italian law reform and change, as it is for the hochschulpersonal has been the case, the Commission can, in our view not intervene, as long as all European citizens have the same access to all grades,.</seg>
<seg id=757>It is wrong that the two people who carry out the same work, work side by side, but different paid and have different working conditions.</seg>
<seg id=758>Worst of all, I think that if we are to draw attention to the fact that a judgment in their favour, perhaps just a few words is reassuring for their lives and another is not really is of importance.</seg>
<seg id=759>I expect the Commission to respond to the point that it is in accordance with the decision of the Court of Justice in the case of allué against Article 48 (2) of the Treaty, in breach of the law of a Member State of the duration of contracts on a limited fremdsprachenassistenten each year, with the possibility of extending, while on the other, this principle is not limiting teachers.</seg>
<seg id=760>Now, in my view, these issues affect the very heart of the European right associated with the fundamental principles of freedom, in particular the free movement of these principles, and there can be no exceptions.</seg>
<seg id=761>We have, as today's debate shows that there are very many shackles, a great many obstacles to the internal market, not only in this case.</seg>
<seg id=762>We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=763>(The President cut the speaker off).</seg>
<seg id=764>The condolences of the Austrian Federal President Klestil, Chancellor Schüssel, I, on behalf of this House to the families and the whole of the Austrian people at this difficult time our sympathy expressed.</seg>
<seg id=765>Are there any any comments?</seg>
<seg id=766>I support the proposal of Mr Ceyhun, and would be very grateful if the Council say whether he could actually intends to put forward a new proposal on this proposal.</seg>
<seg id=767>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group thinks that event is so important that we believe that it is in the form of an urgent procedure would not adequately dealt with.</seg>
<seg id=768>Mr Barón Crespo, I get the impression that you have, if I have understood you correctly, this on.</seg>
<seg id=769>Madam President, some time ago, we debated in this House on the sanctions on Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=770>It is essential that the implementation of amendments before we announced by the British authorities are conducting a debate on this subject, and the Commission must clearly to the legal provisions in this matter.</seg>
<seg id=771>(A5-0314 / 2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the conclusion of the Convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, particularly in the area of the fight against organised crime, the laundering of the proceeds from crime and crime (10213 / 2000 - C5 0394 / 2000 - 2000 / 0815 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=772>The declarations of intent specific steps must follow, so that the proceeds from crime identified, frozen, seized and confiscated.</seg>
<seg id=773>The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot be in the hands of a specialised up under the sole control of the national governments will remain.</seg>
<seg id=774>On the other hand, Article 8 of the draft convention to the reasons for the refusal of mutual assistance in criminal matters, on which a Member State can ersuchter professions, on the essential interests.</seg>
<seg id=775>I would first like to congratulate Mr Marinho on his work and to point out that the efforts to combat crime, but also support the caution.</seg>
<seg id=776>If terrorists or drug trafficking and money laundering, the policy must, of course, been pursued and punished!</seg>
<seg id=777>It is our task to the proceeds from organised crime, to see to trace, freeze, seize and to collect.</seg>
<seg id=778>It is these points in the amendments and, following the debate in committee, then, I am very confident that this House votes in favour.</seg>
<seg id=779>It seems to me that this list of initiatives in this direction, in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights may be protection by destroys.</seg>
<seg id=780>In fact, however, things are not that simple.</seg>
<seg id=781>Finally, the PPE Group supports the compromise amendment on the work of lawyers, to which we have concluded with Mrs Roure.</seg>
<seg id=782>The second measure, the second instrument is the harmonisation.</seg>
<seg id=783>This is a Portuguese initiative, to which several speakers have expressed praise.</seg>
<seg id=784>And that was also the aim of the joint meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the ECOFIN Council on 17 October this year.</seg>
<seg id=785>The best way for a strengthening of parliamentary and judicial control over Europol is the full involvement of the Europol Convention, in the framework of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=786>A step in the right direction, which the European Parliament for a long time seeking, is the creation of an interim unit to judicial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=787>That is the meaning of the guarantees, namely in the development of this aspect of freedoms.</seg>
<seg id=788>And the European Parliament is the supranational EU body which defines relations with my speech, I would ask you, on the basis of this relationship to support our rapporteur and to support.</seg>
<seg id=789>Only when clarity about the institutional model and the rules for the future European judicial area is the will of the citizens and the European Parliament to the proposed by the Council cannot comment on individual measures.</seg>
<seg id=790>That is why it is a logical Eurojust should form part of the efforts of the people through the fight against serious organised crime an area of freedom, security and justice, as well as a high degree of safety to offer.</seg>
<seg id=791>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we can only to Mrs Gebhardt on her excellent report on the implementation of a decision taken by the Council in Tampere in.</seg>
<seg id=792>But how can we talk of Eurojust 's coordination at the level of national public prosecutors and judges, in order to combat all forms of serious crime - and here I agree with the approach of the rapporteur, then, is the extension of the concept of Europe: it is not just about cooperation in purely cross-border crime, but it is about cooperation to combat criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id=793>We will have from 1 January 2001, we have an opportunity in this interim unit to judicial cooperation to engage, the Commission intends to the discussion on the future of the definitive Eurojust will have to make.</seg>
<seg id=794>It was from all sides honest position - I think - without, however, for in frontstellungen to lapse.</seg>
<seg id=795>The problems associated with the expenditure for the Committee on Fisheries were not very worrying; other areas is of more interest.</seg>
<seg id=796>It is really unacceptable that we have no clear objectives and the results are not the measure can there be any other body.</seg>
<seg id=797>My second point is this: in the area of the hierarchy of anweisungsbefugnis here, it is really unacceptable overlaps here, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=798>I would like to make it clear that the programme a number of issues has played a positive role.</seg>
<seg id=799>It is obvious that this work within of consortiums not automatically lead to a dualität in the joint financial responsibility, the problem is more complex.</seg>
<seg id=800>We have been so committed himself to these 3.4 million, and we can say that we have managed to more than 90%.</seg>
<seg id=801>Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg id=802>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after long struggling parts and work for a consensus is now the European Charter of Fundamental Rights in the draft before.</seg>
<seg id=803>I hope that this Parliament, even if it were only says yes to this Charter, in the next few weeks in no doubt that it will cause to the Council the legally binding Charter and this requires that the people of this Charter, access to the European Court of Justice should be open.</seg>
<seg id=804>This position is well known that the Heads of State and Government at the meeting of the European Council in Biarritz, unanimously agreed that the Charter of Fundamental Rights and fully approved, I can therefore only ask, on behalf of the Council, this position, I would like to join several reasons explain.</seg>
<seg id=805>Above all, however, that the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I am convinced that by their inhaltliches a weight - as I would say - epoch-making gain importance.</seg>
<seg id=806>The European Trade Union Confederation, for its part, has taken on this - what he calls the presence of complaining gaps, such as, for example, the absence of any reference to the right to a minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id=807>Regardless of the number of people and, in particular, some Members of the European Parliament, which proposes that an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, to the already contains a reference to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=808>Our group agrees with the exception of the British delegation of the Charter to unanimously.</seg>
<seg id=809>We are in the European People's Party and unanimously together to ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be incorporated into the Treaties as soon as possible, so that they can force direct to the people of the European Union Mr.</seg>
<seg id=810>They have shown us that it is the European issues on a new, exemplary approach of this kind can, as a result of their democratic, open and transparent way and the possibility of participation in the form of the Intergovernmental Conference should consider.</seg>
<seg id=811>The right to social security, health, housing, or the lack of a minimum income or are in the area of solidarity, said.</seg>
<seg id=812>Fourthly, that the Charter of Fundamental Rights - and this is particularly important to me - is the indivisibility of civil and political rights and of fundamental social rights.</seg>
<seg id=813>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this Charter is the umpteenth demonstration of the capacity of the Union, always bedeutungsleere texts and declarations of intention to produce.</seg>
<seg id=814>The representative of the European Court of Justice has already been made to recognise that it is inspired by the Charter, and the representative of the Commission in the Convention in Turin in legal document attaches importance to this.</seg>
<seg id=815>Since the time of the market is so perhaps the last hour of the Europe of rights come the concept of European citizenship in the European Union is a relatively new concept.</seg>
<seg id=816>The Charter is, in fact, drawn up as a text which are legally binding.</seg>
<seg id=817>With pride I can also see that a representative of my parliamentary group in my own country, Mr Gunnar jansson, a very important role in drawing up this Charter has played.</seg>
<seg id=818>As I have already said last night, and I do so again today, in this respect, there are still too many shortcomings throughout, succeed in our efforts to judicial and police cooperation are not always to eliminate certain effects of crime and to prevent the innocent victims of passive.</seg>
<seg id=819>Madam President, the draft European Parliament resolution on the Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the same uncertainty as the work of the body.</seg>
<seg id=820>The Italian Constitution is, for example, the limit of sittlichkeit, and the Convention on the rights of other border or public order.</seg>
<seg id=821>Mr President, in today ’ s vote at 12 noon, we are starting a process that started in 1984, when this Parliament the draft of the Treaty on European Union, which has already adopted a declaration on the rights of the 1989 has been requested, and with the resolution was still de Gucht.</seg>
<seg id=822>The Charter will have consequences, whether it is enshrined in the Treaty or not.</seg>
<seg id=823>This is to be welcomed, and not, as Mr Bonde seems to think, to fear.</seg>
<seg id=824>This is apparently the neigende century, with all its fight to the liberation of disadvantaged social classes, useless passed and has taught us nothing.</seg>
<seg id=825>The Charter fills a gap in the EC and enhancing the protection of individuals with regard to the European police force, the authorities in the fight against fraud, and the competition authorities.</seg>
<seg id=826>However, the rejection of the Charter will unvollständigkeit from, I cannot understand.</seg>
<seg id=827>Mr President, I can continue where you Mr Gahrton has left off.</seg>
<seg id=828>Allow me to a third comment on the rights of third country nationals.</seg>
<seg id=829>The Council of Europe, in addition to the Court of human rights, a great deal of experience with such forms of monitoring across on which we can build.</seg>
<seg id=830>In the light of the text of the Charter, which we will vote today, as I hope, by a large majority -, it is obvious that with our Charter of Fundamental rights and more zeitgemäßeren reach, as it would have provided the accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=831>So it is important to forge ahead.</seg>
<seg id=832>I believe that we must pursue this objective if we are to provide the necessary support for the Charter by the citizens of Europe want.</seg>
<seg id=833>After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental Rights as analyseschema I am in favour of this report, and, as far as my personal intellectual potential and the human resources available to me, I am going to make it a right and countries untergliederte analysis of the application of the Charter in the fifteen Member States of the Union to carry out.</seg>
<seg id=834>Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to begin, in the words of Mr Moscovici and join the substantial contribution of the Members of the European Parliament to debate in the Convention and tribute, in particular, the role of Mr Mendes de Vigo, who, in the Praesidium of the Convention drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights has played.</seg>
<seg id=835>I would just like to respond to some of the points raised markantesten this debate.</seg>
<seg id=836>The fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention, as a result of the various instruments of the Council of Europe, the Treaties and the constitutions of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=837>The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:</seg>
<seg id=838>The current state of affairs, Parliament has also make it clear to the Turkish people, that it is at least three conditions for its accession.</seg>
<seg id=839>Such conditions have also not only by Parliament ’ s decision can be made.</seg>
<seg id=840>I therefore have the suggestions made by Mr Morillon on the conditions for the accession of Turkey to note that the deserve a great deal of interest.</seg>
<seg id=841>I am happy to be able to say that the Turkish Government, in the meantime, this accession partnership as a basis for further cooperation has recognised, so that we can have a legitimate hope, precisely to achieve what we wanted to achieve, i.e. with our policy of reformkräften in Turkey, to help to give fresh impetus to the reform process and it with regard to the objective of membership of the European Union forward.</seg>
<seg id=842>For me the most important thing is that after Helsinki, in Turkey The Turkish public opinion, in a debate on the conditions of Turkey ’ s accession to the EU has been a debate on the reform forces in the country and for its support.</seg>
<seg id=843>This text is to you opinion before.</seg>
<seg id=844>Now, it is a necessary to for a future accession.</seg>
<seg id=845>I would, however, I do not know how the vote - Turkey will also urge that this issue should be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id=846>The European Parliament will be actively for taking care of and relations with the political parties, the NGOs and the press use and is trying to improve their difficult and sometimes tense relationship to the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id=847>Mr Morillon, your report is, in my opinion, very realistic and responsibly.</seg>
<seg id=848>On the occasion of my visit to Turkey in March, you have the problem of the Kurdish people, just today, at least, with name.</seg>
<seg id=849>It is also of great and great arrogance, naive to assume that the Europeans to the Turks, and I quote, 'a radical change in habits and their which could move ".</seg>
<seg id=850>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report before fills me with great concern.</seg>
<seg id=851>Recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the adoption of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487 / 1 / 00 - C5-0570 / 2000 - 2000 / 2233 (AVC))</seg>
<seg id=852>In any case, we must look at the next occasions when we debated the power of information technology, we realise that a engmaschigere and therefore the citizens more certainty bietende control is required.</seg>
<seg id=853>Recommendation Duff / Voggenhuber (A5-0325 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=854>We wish to act the following points:</seg>
<seg id=855>The rights contained in the Charter are already enshrined in the national constitutions, and by the national parliaments, which defends the peoples and their cultures close.</seg>
<seg id=856>1, which provides that: 'collective expulsions are not allowed to "not set that this ban in times of war or serious disturbances in cases of public law and order can be suspended in Article 52 (.</seg>
<seg id=857>We should be following a short explanation on these three reasons, in this order.</seg>
<seg id=858>The right of a government on the arbitrary außerkraftsetzung their own constitution is characteristic of a tyranny.</seg>
<seg id=859>But today, we have, I repeat, every reason to be proud of, as we have overcome this important stage for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=860>A society which only know their rights, but not duties, will lead to its own selfish society.</seg>
<seg id=861>This is our priority must fight to ensure that the fundamental rights proclaimed at the political decisions will be specified.</seg>
<seg id=862>The Convention method is a very interesting and efficient for the drafting of a basistextes, which requires a broad consensus, but it does not in any way, the European Parliament as a representative of the peoples of Europe the opportunity to amend the text and complement to escape.</seg>
<seg id=863>This Charter must be improved, and Parliament must have a strategy to update their enrichment and propose.</seg>
<seg id=864>Therefore, it should not be decided at the Council meeting in Nice and proclaimed, but of the Summit should be the initiative for a European debate on the Charter will be given.</seg>
<seg id=865>Fortunately, the national governments to vorzuherrschen tendency to the path of reason to follow, in other words, a Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding, and not with a purely political scope to.</seg>
<seg id=866>The Cologne Summit 'body', has proclaimed this even the 'convention', a term, in the way of 1793 fatal and another by the Convention to verantwortenden excesses of the French Revolution, in the form of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=867>The procedure used, made the exclusion and the uncertainty regarding the nature of the text, however, a clear throw light on the new totalitarian approaches, in the heart of the European integration process are present.</seg>
<seg id=868>Fortunately, the European Parliament in this field to the full implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty only a consultative role, but it is the ways and means to do so that the right decisions to be delayed.</seg>
<seg id=869>The views on the way to go but apart.</seg>
<seg id=870>It was a century ago, and after it was somewhat pushed into the background, it is now once again fully and entirely brought to the fore.</seg>
<seg id=871>What we want on no account, there are opportunities to allow criminals, through the back door to the internal market.</seg>
<seg id=872>We affirm and the creation of a future kooperationsstelle to support the fight against organised crime and money-laundering as well as of the various measures proposed in order to achieve these objectives.</seg>
<seg id=873>In other words, it is a provisional judicial cooperation should be set up as a result of a representative of the public prosecutor's office, judges and police officers with staatsanwaltschaftlichen powers representatives of our 15 Member States.</seg>
<seg id=874>Mr President, as a member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I dealt intensively with the accession of Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=875>Also Turkey's conduct in Cyprus is unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=876>However, we support the rapporteur ’ s critical comment about the lack of an effective evaluation of the loans from the EIB and the lack of transparency and appropriate public control of the activities of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id=877>Despite their differences, Turkey was and is an integral part of the European reality.</seg>
<seg id=878>The welcoming of Turkey into the European Union is to become an issue which today is more topical than ever.</seg>
<seg id=879>Mr Morillon says that Turkey should make an effort to give the European Union is not the exclusive Christian club to see to it that Turkey wants to exclude.</seg>
<seg id=880>Turkey will be a real democratic state if they are with their lives will be learned from the past, as well as a democratic Germany, from which we have the same demands, has managed to live, with its past.</seg>
<seg id=881>As soon as the government in Ankara, is the fact that the status quo for Europe and for the rest of the world is not acceptable to the great progress possible the island reunited and could be a fair, lasting and international law and to find a solution.</seg>
<seg id=882>Why are for all of these issues in the report of the European Commission not mentioned?</seg>
<seg id=883>In this context we must also be balanced our action to promote the rapprochement between the Union and Turkey's determination to continue.</seg>
<seg id=884>If the Armenian issue in connection with accession to the EU treat - please note, what I am saying: the Armenian issue in connection with accession to the EU, then the project on which we have spoken today, not start, it is as simple as that.</seg>
<seg id=885>For this reason, we have worked very hard so that after the first five years of the implementation of the Barcelona process to a conclusion will be held in Marseilles, so that we are in a position to set the necessary approaches.</seg>
<seg id=886>But we have managed to maintain the dialogue and also sensitive issues such as terrorism, human rights, stability, emigration address.</seg>
<seg id=887>Having said that, the Council was concerned, particularly since 1995, for the Mediterranean greater resources to the objectives of the partnership are appropriate.</seg>
<seg id=888>This is indeed an extremely important matter, and I would also say this as someone who comes from Central Europe.</seg>
<seg id=889>Mr President, as you know, there is a saying in English, whereby a show without a star like Hamlet without the first aufführung totengräber.</seg>
<seg id=890>We do this in order to link the policies of the internal market and the introduction of a consensus cumulation while conclusion of sub-regional free trade agreements between all partners and the adoption of the protocol on the harmonised cumulation.</seg>
<seg id=891>We have also the intention of the Commission, to give fresh impetus to the Barcelona process, noted with satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id=892>I would stress this aspect because it is the key to the relaunch of the process of seeking, and also the political agenda of the Barcelona Summit needs to be supplemented.</seg>
<seg id=893>That is why it is our task to guarantee of peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean, and we must do everything we can to ensure that this cooperation is enforced and the promised funds on the basis of its own selfish generosity - shall we say - the European Union are used effectively in.</seg>
<seg id=894>This is an important and specific questions I would like to ask, and I would like to thank Mr Brok, who this debate before the relevant discussions, the presidency and the Commission on these issues has made possible.</seg>
<seg id=895>The world is now an inexorable to globalisation, and in such a scenario is an organisation in large, in the vast field of international competition as players operating blocks.</seg>
<seg id=896>It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries by 4.7 billion in the MEDA programme, which expired in 1999, just taken up only a quarter.</seg>
<seg id=897>That is why the Commission 's proposal for a new impetus good, and we agree entirely with the priorities which the Commissioner mentioned in his speeches here this afternoon and has confirmed.</seg>
<seg id=898>This is an alarm for the European Union, a much more active role to play in the Mediterranean, of our European continent historically and culturally enriching and strengthened.</seg>
<seg id=899>But what is worse is that, at the same time, as we in this House are sometimes very different views factual exchange, more Palestinians killed.</seg>
<seg id=900>Aid for the recovery and</seg>
<seg id=901>In December, we should not, however, the appropriations for the implementation of this regulation, then today we contribute dreschen empty straw.</seg>
<seg id=902>However, we cannot and do not want our view, the role that they have played, close, and I hope that the Member States that do not.</seg>
<seg id=903>The mass media in that region for the tragedy there were often responsible; it will be needed, which is completely free media according to the rules in force in our democracies act.</seg>
<seg id=904>I am also a happy man because it to Parliament, in my opinion, the persistent pressure has succeeded in a state of affairs, which was not as favourable as possible, to turn for the better.</seg>
<seg id=905>Once again, unnecessary expenditure for unnecessary meetings really must be avoided.</seg>
<seg id=906>We must in our view, however, not only on the Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id=907>Also, the fact that some of the programmes, the so-called 'performance reserve' performance reserve ', which have been assigned, is regrettable.</seg>
<seg id=908>In Feira, he has the countries involved in the stabilisation and association process the status as potential candidates for accession status.</seg>
<seg id=909>I would refer again to the main objectives of the CARDS programme: institutional strengthening in terms of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction and regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=910>It is right that the European Union and the coup by President Kostunica good response.</seg>
<seg id=911>A first meeting was held on 6 November not.</seg>
<seg id=912>What initiative in accordance with the request by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, the Presidency intends to take in order to play a more active role to play in order to ensure that the full implementation of the UN peace plan and restlose is guaranteed?</seg>
<seg id=913>How can this must be without the settlement of this conflict?</seg>
<seg id=914>So I can only say that France and Germany - and here I am no longer speaking as President-in-Office of the Council - these issues on a bilateral Summit last week in vittel addressed and the establishment of a working group on the agreed solution to this problem.</seg>
<seg id=915>At the same time the European Union granted to these two countries continue to extensive aid, through its various programmes, especially TACIS.</seg>
<seg id=916>The Presidency to the honourable Member ’ s question to take advantage of, and to eliminate some ambiguities.</seg>
<seg id=917>Let me just add the accuracy sake both texts: the aim of this is that the criminal framework for the fight against organised the stepped up.</seg>
<seg id=918>In the report that the Turkish ministers on 21 September of this year has passed a reform as part of the changes in question several projects: the taking of measures to strengthen the genuine equality between men and women in the civil code; greater sozialpädagogischen area in the fight against violence within the family; better condemnation of violence by setting up special familienrichter as well as the possibility of banning strafnachlasses of crimes'.</seg>
<seg id=919>The Presidency has therefore no reply to this.</seg>
<seg id=920>Next week, in France, at my invitation to a meeting of the European Conference will be held, i.e. with the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=921>Do you think that the model of Austria, namely bilateral, majority decisions in the future, to be an instrument of the European institutions over decisions in and a new institution or a new group of reasons, in order to be able to deal with unanimity in the Council?</seg>
<seg id=922>The Council has not dealt with this letter, but the Presidency has, of course, Mr Cem replied the text of this response has been sent to all Member States.</seg>
<seg id=923>And what does it, moreover, of the statement by Mr Cem - is that the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Moscovici, not replied, in his view that the Cyprus question in the further consideration of the accession partnership between Turkey and the European Union are not taken into account?</seg>
<seg id=924>We must be aware that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is far more than a simple agreement on the fishing agreement, and that should not happen, as he knows, a deterioration in the relations between the European Union and Morocco, the House may be.</seg>
<seg id=925>I must therefore express my scepticism, for what the outcome.</seg>
<seg id=926>As regards the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that the strengthening of cooperation between the Member States, but also the protection of individual rights should be allowed.</seg>
<seg id=927>The supplementary questions must be asked by other Members.</seg>
<seg id=928>Moreover, the Commission announced in the communication adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union's oil supply at the Gothenburg European Council a plan for energy savings and the diversification of energy sources will present, to contribute to the energy efficiency in buildings, particularly in the transport sector and to strengthen.</seg>
<seg id=929>It is in this spirit that we have at the vote on the resolution on the embargo within the framework of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on 9 November an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with the international human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id=930>This is therefore a matter for NATO, to take the necessary precautions it sees fit, so that these events are not repeated.</seg>
<seg id=931>(The sitting was suspended at 6.55 who p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=932>If the money is there, it is now the privilege desjenigen, the money is there, the political objectives set clearly to define, and the Commissioner has always done.</seg>
<seg id=933>His visit can signal and all the policies that we pursue, a perspective to.</seg>
<seg id=934>If we see it in a region, in the political conflicts are quite possible, we are in the wrong.</seg>
<seg id=935>The second requirement, which will be made by the two rapporteurs and all of us must be supported, relates to the regular consultation and information of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=936>The Heads of State and Government also underlined the determination of the Union, this process through technical and economic assistance to untersetzen.</seg>
<seg id=937>It was the European Parliament, the Commission's proposal to create a European Agency for Reconstruction has supported.</seg>
<seg id=938>As the House knows, we believe that an explicit reference in the relevant regulation not necessary.</seg>
<seg id=939>The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=940>For the Asia-Europe cooperation 2000 participants agreed to an enlarged and updated, within the framework of the programme for the coming decade is.</seg>
<seg id=941>I think that we have in Europe in mind the importance that we have for Asia, and not only in terms of economic and trade, even though, at this point, it should be pointed out that its economic recovery in Asia, for example, the situation is due to the fact that we have kept our word and also our markets in the last two years Asian exports were openly.</seg>
<seg id=942>I believe that it was a very good political commitment, but we are still a few problems.</seg>
<seg id=943>As you know, the Commission is serious about ASEM II, and we support the Commission in this regard also fully.</seg>
<seg id=944>It is necessary to the existing mechanisms for implementing the Community law should be improved, in order to increase legal certainty and to overcome the current slow pace.</seg>
<seg id=945>That is why the creation of the regional organisations and promote the start there, where there is already a presence in the Community, as in the western and southern Pacific.</seg>
<seg id=946>That is the prerequisite for a truly sustainable fishing.</seg>
<seg id=947>I believe that the future of fishing in international waters of these organisations and the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, is still too low, and about the attitude of the United Nations, both in the Convention, in 1982, as has been mentioned in the course of New York, to defend, we must have a very active presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing.</seg>
<seg id=948>Therefore, I think, too, that the Commission is a particularly important role should the fishermen to cooperate and to propose solutions which we can all agree.</seg>
<seg id=949>In addition, the Commission has also plenty of tasks in connection with the negotiations to accept in the context of the regional fisheries organisations must be conducted.</seg>
<seg id=950>Mr President, I have the same problem as Mr Nicholson, only much more acute.</seg>
<seg id=951>So far as So the solutions of the Committee on Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=952>Sometimes we have already asked the extent to which the cyclical absatzkrise even perhaps speculation triggered by the so-called corporate structures, which will, in this way, the control of the sector according to their interests.</seg>
<seg id=953>The additional EU aid in the Garot report proposes that, in my opinion, is unreasonable, at a time when the with Agenda 2000 and the prospect of enlargement with Central and Eastern Europe, the reform of agricultural policy is on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=954>I think that it is almost a glanzleistung, which the rapporteur has hingelegt here, which shows what we can do with administration, if a certain objectives, and that is clearly set out.</seg>
<seg id=955>One of the largest producers and those who conducted downstream are integrated, away from this instrument, and the systems of preference, about which you have already: savings, as individual bankdarlehen ausgleichskasse.</seg>
<seg id=956>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me say at the outset that I am in principle the Commission ’ s proposal to set up a compensation fund, also in the spirit of the Austrian agriculture welcome.</seg>
<seg id=957>. I would to thank the rapporteur for his report.</seg>
<seg id=958>I understand that it wishes to an intensive animal husbandry, the organisation of the market and a reduction in agricultural policy, if they bodenabhängig bodenabhängige, production is.</seg>
<seg id=959>The schweinemarktordnung there, and we should not make the mistake of existing schweinemarktordnung, in principle, works, to call into question.</seg>
<seg id=960>The Commission believes that it is justified, only the farmers of the compensation to join, subject to a discipline, because these wars, in return for a certain amount of einkommensgarantie, while others which do not join, they do not get einkommensgarantie.</seg>
<seg id=961>(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.).</seg>
<seg id=962>The VAT based on the revenue to 36% and 15% of the traditional own resources from gesamtbetrages.</seg>
<seg id=963>Another part of the reform, to a large extent the Court has identified priority area is concerned, the increased importance of the result and erfolgsmessung within a system of ressourcenzuweisung vorgegebener according to priorities and clearly defined, measurable objectives.</seg>
<seg id=964>This is a good thing, and I should like to tell you, Mr Karlsson, the members of the Court of Auditors and the services of the Court of Auditors that you very warmly on her report on the reform of the Commission for support.</seg>
<seg id=965>I hope now that this proposal at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice not simply shelved or swept under the carpet, but that it is so seriously auseinandersetzt.</seg>
<seg id=966>The fact, as it is described in the annual report is rather sobering.</seg>
<seg id=967>The number of errors have occurred is too high, as such a guarantee that could be accepted.</seg>
<seg id=968>The amount for high and tiefbauarbeiten to 240 million has been set too low.</seg>
<seg id=969>I could to the report by the Court of Auditors also imagine a more user-friendly, supplemented by clear recommendations, for example, one or two per chapter.</seg>
<seg id=970>In 1995 was a convention on the protection of the Communities' financial interests agreed.</seg>
<seg id=971>The Commission and the Member States should consider it in that light and the results of the report as a tool to improve the management of financial resources of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=972>I am aware that this report and the work of Parliament within the framework of the forthcoming discharge to greater vigilance with regard to the spending will help.</seg>
<seg id=973>And now, Madam President, I would like to remain silent and waiting for that someone from the Council to us.</seg>
<seg id=974>The Court of Auditors, as well as in recent years, it has no precise data, where the now described mistake occurred.</seg>
<seg id=975>Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union, and before the Court of Auditors' report makes it clear that it is also in the applicant countries a great deal is yet to be done.</seg>
<seg id=976>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have recently concluded an agreement with the Court of Auditors, which is about whether we already have for the secret kämmerchen vorinformationen from hofbericht receive, and we are also agreed that we should keep silent about.</seg>
<seg id=977>I would also like to appeal to the Council and to ask the question why the decision on Article 24 of the Financial Regulation is still out.</seg>
<seg id=978>Perhaps some common sense in the European Union to solve the problem and help George Bush its rightful place in the history of gain, namely in müllkorb!</seg>
<seg id=979>It is not our task to identify scapegoats, to make both in our institutions, even in our countries.</seg>
<seg id=980>President, I am pleased that the Members of Parliament are of the view that the situation with regard to the procedure for the presentation of the annual report of the European Parliament and of the Committee on Budgetary Control was satisfactory than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id=981>However, we will have the opportunity to speak on all points.</seg>
<seg id=982>If, from the point of view of the auditor is relevant to mention all the facts, we need to be mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=983>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you noted, that was the last part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors by a fatal affected by the virus, in his contribution and this House has crept into.</seg>
<seg id=984>As a number of Amendments Nos 1 and 18 are issues in relation to the United Kingdom and, above all, it must be pointed out that all the representatives of the United Kingdom, from the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the Greens, it is with great vehemently defended, and they have been adopted in the Committee on the Environment.</seg>
<seg id=985>Mr President, we in March this year, the directive on the Passenger cableway installations adopted.</seg>
<seg id=986>We are of the opinion that in these cases of trade not with the burden of herstellerpflichten produktsicherheitsgesetzes.</seg>
<seg id=987>We have the justifications for them and for the resumption of the industry, at the arguments put forward in committee.</seg>
<seg id=988>It should be enough, if the seller the buyer general information on the products can give and the lack of information and documentation on these points.</seg>
<seg id=989>Finally, small a request to the European Commission to Article 4 on the European standards and the question of whether these have to be published.</seg>
<seg id=990>The verkaufseinrichtungen of charity and non-profit organisations current exceptions and exemptions for the markets or from the second-hand car boot sold, which I welcome.</seg>
<seg id=991>The reliability of the product and the customer service increase the value of the European label in a particular difficult and richtungsweisenden moment.</seg>
<seg id=992>If we ask the Commission to elsewhere in the near future to submit a proposal on the safety of services, it is incomprehensible why the aspects of the services here with rules, and that do not wait for the Commission's proposal, because it is already now that abgrenzungsschwierigkeiten between the various schemes will arise, and that the uncertainty over the course of time, will increase.</seg>
<seg id=993>I should like to explain very briefly the priorities of this proposal.</seg>
<seg id=994>We will now also the opening of the system for third countries, especially for the candidate countries: we have the procedures for the implementation of emergency measures at Community level, simplified, so that we are following the recommendation of the regulatory committee to act as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id=995>Through this new provision will these shops no significant extra responsibility imposed.</seg>
<seg id=996>The proposal in Amendment No 11, the term 'producer' by 'service providers' should be replaced, but rather clarity, will not lead to confusion, because the directive does not definition of the term "service providers."</seg>
<seg id=997>The Commission is in favour, the rapid establishment of a network, but this must be more coordinated between Member States.</seg>
<seg id=998>Such a certification can be used as evidence, it is not a 100% safety.</seg>
<seg id=999>I now have explained why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36 and part of Amendment No 7, and the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of Amendment No 27 to 34 reject, however, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31, 35 and part of Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21, and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, since the proposal of the Commission, is that these amendments will be improved and will be more clarity.</seg>
<seg id=1000>It must be the view of Mr Barón Crespo not as an Italian Socialist Members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.</seg>
<seg id=1001>In my opinion, there is Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37 between no contradiction.</seg>
<seg id=1002>In the order I leave the decision of the President, but I would remind you that, in any case, I am against all three amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1003>The members of the EU not Mediterranean countries in terms of economic development is undoubtedly the most serious problems to contend with the regional inequalities, where there are constant tension.</seg>
<seg id=1004>As for respect for the dignity of legal immigrants are concerned, in the sense of a European immigration policy must be harmonised, appropriate legal instruments for guaranteeing a fair treatment of immigrants, instruments for financial support for all those young people to be created, which is of a technical or absolvierung hochschulstudiums in European countries wish to return to their countries of origin, where a career.</seg>
<seg id=1005>I would like to emphasise that I consider to be a factor the really decisive in this regard: the lack of equality in the labour market.</seg>
<seg id=1006>- (PT) late, but it still has the Commission, the programme of support for the Community framework strategy for equality between women and men (2001 / 2005), submitted by the previous programmes and, above all, of the fourth framework programme striking expire at the end of this year is different.</seg>
<seg id=1007>Firstly, a number of suggestions were taken into account in my group, on the other, studies have been called for on the situation of women in the national markets and the inadequate access to insurance points, for which we need to have statistics aussagefähigen geschlechterbezogenen data.</seg>
<seg id=1008>President, my party has serious reservations about the application of Community law to the sale of consumer goods, instead of the application of the concept of the mutual recognition of standards.</seg>
<seg id=1009>Now we understand it, and the labour amendments offer the guarantee that the charity shops of intact and remain exempt from the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1010>Finally, Amendment No 15, the Commission gives free rein to the language regime used in the Agency, which in our view a very worrying development.</seg>
<seg id=1011>The simplification of decision-making, the establishment of decentralised operational centres (not only in Pristina, what its separation of Yugoslavia gleichkäme) and the solution to the problem of the management board with dual structure and could be a positive steps in the direction of the shortcomings in the administrative shortcomings within the European Agency for Reconstruction to be.</seg>
<seg id=1012>We are therefore voting against the Commission ’ s proposal and the Parliament's report.</seg>
<seg id=1013>An adjustment of the current Community rules in this area can therefore be regarded as a right.</seg>
<seg id=1014>The Fund is also the possibility that, in the form of cofinancing by the Member States more or less hidden state aid to be granted.</seg>
<seg id=1015>(EL) Despite its serious shortcomings in the Morillon report clearly goes further than the Commission's proposal on the accession partnership between the European Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1016>, we have voted against it.</seg>
<seg id=1017>Like the rapporteur, we have to acknowledge that Turkey has made progress in some areas and positive signals that progress has been made.</seg>
<seg id=1018>Parliament has already since 1987 in used for this recognition, and the adoption of this amendment is proof of the coherence of the Parliament on this issue.</seg>
<seg id=1019>The Union must put forward concrete proposals and the enlargement to include Turkey as an essential geopolitical strategy design.</seg>
<seg id=1020>These ulterior motives are not worthy of Europe and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1021>For several years, as a member of the delegation for relations with Canada in the way of the regional organisations, to NAFO, the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (a), seeing that the countries of the region, including Canada, including, as well as all those who use traditional fishing in the region, such as France, Spain and other European countries.</seg>
<seg id=1022>It is only then satisfying when their own kanonenbootflotte sternenkreisbanner under their fisheries prevails.</seg>
<seg id=1023>The most important thing is not able to satisfy the hegemony of the Commission, by the European position weakens what a proper implementation of the principle of subsidiarity would be totally contradictory.</seg>
<seg id=1024>Finally, after tough negotiations reached a final result, which deserves to be defended.</seg>
<seg id=1025>With this proposal, the replacement of three directives on waste incineration, which will, therefore, for the quality of air, water, soil and public health should be improved by giving the emissions from schmutzpartikeln in connection with the incineration and co-incineration and in particular the emissions of heavy metals, dioxins and furanen reduced.</seg>
<seg id=1026>It seems to me that innovation is also important to point out that no longer only emissions into the air, but also in the water and the soil about.</seg>
<seg id=1027>During the discussion is the draft has been improvements.</seg>
<seg id=1028>The introduction of more stringent stickoxidgrenzwerte new co-incineration in cement, such as, for example, is a step forward, the incentive to reduce emissions will present, even though the proposed standards are not the most modern reflect the state of the art.</seg>
<seg id=1029>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise to you, Mr Blokland, I am, for a few minutes late.</seg>
<seg id=1030>Finally, I would like to say that this directive is a significant contribution to reducing the damaging consequences for the environment and of the risks to human health.</seg>
<seg id=1031>It is Parliament's credit if it on behalf of the rejection of any form of discrimination, the fight against exclusion and in accordance with the responsibility of the individual, the introduction of a system that will give new impetus to the practical implementation of the essential solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=1032>From country to country, but there are great differences, and there is a lack of detailed and comparable statistical data, reliable information about which system where the ways in which provides the best results as to what its weaknesses, etc., and for this very reason, in my view, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs drafted an opinion stressed the need for the Commission to establish any allgemeingültiger rules for supplementary health insurance for a Green Paper, in which all these scattered herausgibt data and the relevant information is put together and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id=1033>So this was in a sense a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id=1034>The threat that is not entirely healthy citizens and older people because of their high risk only requires private can assure you that is not acceptable for the gesellschaftsentwicklung.</seg>
<seg id=1035>The second idea that the rapporteur has explained in his introduction, and this will be supported by many Members, including the promotion of the necessary rules and codes for the introduction of the forms of mutual kostenübernahme between insurers, all the provision of high-quality services and guarantee the development of the dangers of discriminatory practices and a risk and kundenauswahl counter.</seg>
<seg id=1036>In my opinion, it cannot be right that the money is dependent on the waiting list who is at the top.</seg>
<seg id=1037>The new proposal of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is right to begin stock in the form of a Green Paper to make, and only then to decide whether we need a recommendation or a directive.</seg>
<seg id=1038>In the Netherlands is currently being discussed on changes of the system.</seg>
<seg id=1039>On this basis, the Commission should take an initiative and concrete cornerstones as guidelines for the health systems of the Member States express.</seg>
<seg id=1040>An absolute one-size-fits-all can therefore for the insurance will probably not be.</seg>
<seg id=1041>I therefore believe that we should thank Mr Rocard for his report, in which he and the Commission to a service, a Green Paper, which calls on us an insight into the current state of the insurance companies in the Member States and, at the same time weichenstellung for the future, and to congratulate him as far as the content.</seg>
<seg id=1042>Both build on a dreisäulenmodell: on the state, the business and the private sector.</seg>
<seg id=1043>As regards the supplementary pensions, the European Union has already produced some rules, the Commission has presented a Green Paper, then from the proposal for a directive has emerged.</seg>
<seg id=1044>Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Rocard and congratulate him on his report, and also Mr Marinos I congratulate the opinion of his committee.</seg>
<seg id=1045>This study will then form the basis of a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament, in the initiatives and measures are proposed.</seg>
<seg id=1046>In the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets, I am pleased to inform you that they all have been adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1047>We have agreed on the indicators of the programme, to which the multidimensionale launch of the phenomenon, the measures in the areas of health, education and housing, the consistency and complementarity with other neighbouring policies, as well as the participation of non-state bodies as well, but also the social exclusion of the people themselves count.</seg>
<seg id=1048>This means that we must use the cyclical wachstumsphasen, in order to create a balance or surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1049>Here I would just like to remind you that the last Ecofin Council, the Commission has asked, as from next year, these long-term aspect of public finances in relation to the ageing of the population in the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id=1050>One of the positive features of the programme of the Netherlands is the special consideration - as I said before - of the impact of the ageing of the population on the budget in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id=1051>Therefore is the accounts for the year 2000 in Germany a surplus of one and a half points of the gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg id=1052>We are still wechselkursentwicklung the euro to the dollar, moreover, we have a clear negative effect in terms of inflation.</seg>
<seg id=1053>What will remain, a public pay-as-you-go system with private kapitalbildungssystemen to reconcile, and they are also obviously compatible with aid for the creation of specific investment, the long-term tax, and perhaps the solution to the problem of the ageing of the population are helpful.</seg>
<seg id=1054>It follows that the third, US senior principle, namely the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg id=1055>It must be remembered that, at present a number of proposals for legislation to be discussed, all of the efficiency and effectiveness of Community rules and, therefore, I hope, will strengthen the confidence of consumers.</seg>
<seg id=1056>But this relatively small inzidenzrate is no room for complacency.</seg>
<seg id=1057>To be honest, I was disappointed that in yesterday's statement by the Prime Minister Jospin extremely positive role of the Community in recent years, was not recognised.</seg>
<seg id=1058>Of course, requires the increased incidence of BSE, not just in France, but also in other Member States, the statements.</seg>
<seg id=1059>The Commission's Food and Veterinary Office, which devotes the protection measures against BSE is concerned, the controls in the Member States already have top priority.</seg>
<seg id=1060>What its security is concerned, I would like to repeat that there is already a whole series of controls to ensure that meat and bone meal in the transmission of BSE no threat.</seg>
<seg id=1061>Indeed, it may be hard to believe it has taken four years to adopt a measure, which I consider to be the protection of public health as basic consider.</seg>
<seg id=1062>Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I urge the Council to at last to express its opinion on the regulation on TSEs announced.</seg>
<seg id=1063>In the current situation is the only way to break the cycle of BSE infection, that is, the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs is the ban.</seg>
<seg id=1064>In this context, I would like to mention that we from the Liberal Group have tabled an amendment, which I hope will be adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1065>This policy must change in order to really responsible for this crisis in the duty to be taken and the specific decisions taken a first step towards the end of this dramatic crisis is being done.</seg>
<seg id=1066>They must therefore be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id=1067>The labelling of beef, decided on a mindestetikettierung two and a half months, which have only been in force for no proper traceability of the origin of animals, and it is already too late spezifizierte specified risk material, we have banned.</seg>
<seg id=1068>The citizens must be fully on the characteristics of which I have referred tests to be informed.</seg>
<seg id=1069>Mr President-in-Office of the Council, then they have done nothing or almost nothing, as well as their colleagues in the consequences of Chernobyl, the AIDS epidemic or the contaminated blood on remained. The reason has always stated that they wanted to enable the public not panic.</seg>
<seg id=1070>The French ban will lead to a massive bedarfssteigerung the supply of raw materials, but this is limited.</seg>
<seg id=1071>Consumers have lost their confidence, and in order to put a stop to this phenomenon must be compulsory for the cattle and sheep to be introduced.</seg>
<seg id=1072>Now, however, is more important in the spirit of the Commission's proposal working on meal that the highest safety standards.</seg>
<seg id=1073>Otherwise, I am - just this once - entirely agree with what the rapporteur, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs Grossetête has said.</seg>
<seg id=1074>What was happening, the Council and the Commission, you have a sufficient financial basis and can now implement a vigorous policy.</seg>
<seg id=1075>We have to tackle this problem.</seg>
<seg id=1076>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am very pleased, here in this Chamber to hear that the CAP at any price to revise it.</seg>
<seg id=1077>We have the soil, climate and the right to know - and the necessary know-how meal immediately by not genetically modified pflanzenproteine to replace, and yet we have the right to give up on our own soil for the feeding of animals and the food needs of the population, while at the same time we pflanzenproteine cultivate set-aside finance; this is why our group has tabled an amendment which the Council and the Commission will be called upon to ways to look to Europe for the cultivation of these pflanzenproteine again to increase for an appropriate to replace animal meal and American prionenhaltiges genetically modified soya.</seg>
<seg id=1078>Foodstuffs must guarantee the safe, of the people.</seg>
<seg id=1079>I think it is exemplary that France, has managed to take this step to that.</seg>
<seg id=1080>But to help them the gentlemen not!</seg>
<seg id=1081>That is why I am surprised that, in these circumstances, a carcasses or must be recycled.</seg>
<seg id=1082>In Great Britain has been recently published the Phillips inquiry into BSE.</seg>
<seg id=1083>I would like the European Commission to propose to the precautionary principle in beef from France also apply.</seg>
<seg id=1084>We still have no certainty and therefore need to know how the scientific facts is and what measures are required.</seg>
<seg id=1085>In addition, I have of course taken note of all ideas, for which I am very sensitive.</seg>
<seg id=1086>If citizens of the Member States, and I would say that the legislation should not properly or not completely implemented, then we should perhaps consider again, but not because the scientists tell us that it is necessary, but because it is in the European Union in terms of lack of respect for the law.</seg>
<seg id=1087>If we do not want to say, it invites we are not even the best one.</seg>
<seg id=1088>The Commission is of the opinion that the readmission agreements for the clarification and coordination of these policies have an important role to play, and the negotiations currently underway on the first Community readmission agreement with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=1089>What proposals, the Commission has on the basis of Article 31 of the Treaty on European Union?</seg>
<seg id=1090>(The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=1091>The aim in this period was the reduction of public deficit in order to achieve a zufriedenstellenderen monetary policy, lower interest rates and a higher growth.</seg>
<seg id=1092>I always say that the euro does not enter into force on 1 January 2002, we have already introduced it in our pockets; we have it in different coins, but we have it in our pockets.</seg>
<seg id=1093>The current limit values for nitrogen dioxide and mercury were not exceeded, not even the ozone threshold in Athens inner city in accordance with Directive 92 / 72 / EC. But it should be noted that it is in hochsommer have been made.</seg>
<seg id=1094>Subject: State aid for the audiovisual sector at a seminar on the subject of European cultural industries of the French Presidency took a representative of the Directorate-General for Competition on the European Commission of the opinion that the legal channels investitionsverpflichtungen simply by imposed by the legislator, that they were mandatory, State aid will be.</seg>
<seg id=1095>It must be respected and to protect. '</seg>
<seg id=1096>But this does not happen by itself, since this new growth is very inegalitär and may, as we in the United States since around a decade of continuing to see signs of insecurity, of exclusion, poverty and the urban formation by.</seg>
<seg id=1097>The governments of the Member States have not this definition, which is a little too easy and it is meaningless.</seg>
<seg id=1098>In the resulting from the harsh climate there is more and more people who are not able to compete being sidelined and excluded.</seg>
<seg id=1099>Mr President, in this House we hear all too often, a similar litany, such as the European social model and the social market economy to be praised, who feel that many, in contrast to the chaotic model of the United States of America would form.</seg>
<seg id=1100>(technical disruption)</seg>
<seg id=1101>This is a huge amount.</seg>
<seg id=1102>Furthermore, we must all political levels be involved.</seg>
<seg id=1103>I agree that it is necessary to improve knowledge of the causes of poverty, I am in favour of preventive measures through innovative and practical answers to the involvement of the social partners, local and national authorities and the citizens of the joint action against exclusion as a result of mergers, changes and relocation of companies, and a strong populated urban rural depopulation of the countryside.</seg>
<seg id=1104>We had a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and the role of the social and structural reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1105>This is a legal problem, because the text of the Treaty, and not only on social exclusion, poverty refers.</seg>
<seg id=1106>These proposals are, I think, a pragmatic response to their request.</seg>
<seg id=1107>But, approval of the strategy is not necessarily assent to the detail.</seg>
<seg id=1108>If we have a clear, binding framework for the Member States should define the differences between the systems, which must meet these requirements, for a long time of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id=1109>Renewable energy sources are not a panacea to resolve this problem, but nobody doubts that the considerable extent on his alleviate and also to the diversification of energy sources and to reduce our dependence on oil and gas, can contribute, as far as we are also well would.</seg>
<seg id=1110>I want to reiterate three of our demands.</seg>
<seg id=1111>The establishment of realistic zielrichtwerte can only the confidence of the citizens to be followed the increase in energy policy.</seg>
<seg id=1112>In my view has a consistent policy in the field of renewable energy a symbolwirkung for the future of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1113>Finally, the Member States must with these agreements of the European Union to demonstrate that it can contribute to achieving the Kyoto.</seg>
<seg id=1114>It would be a pity if a category would be excluded, for the whole erwirtschaftung of energy from waste can be it for small projects or as part of the accounts.</seg>
<seg id=1115>The formation of the assimilation and the torfmasse waldstreuentstehung the other vegetable biomassen.</seg>
<seg id=1116>Mr Chichester, I would like to inform you that, before my heimatküste at sea have already been installed very modern wind. It is a project that will very soon be taken in operation.</seg>
<seg id=1117>The dispute over the abandonment of nuclear energy, for example in Sweden and Germany being conducted, has shown that without visible environmentally friendly and at a competitive price realisierende energy alternatives to the debate but inevitably into the sand.</seg>
<seg id=1118>That is why the Member States must draw up binding targets.</seg>
<seg id=1119>That is why I am optimistic about the zukunftspotential for renewable energy sources, if the right incentives.</seg>
<seg id=1120>I believe that it is very much courage to renewable energy, again and again in such a position, as it deserves.</seg>
<seg id=1121>This is a very strong increase in oil prices leads us undoubtedly with greater severity of the problems with this in mind, our dependence on fossil energy sources in connected.</seg>
<seg id=1122>We can therefore do not accept Amendment No 28.</seg>
<seg id=1123>In this respect, however, that the terms used are no interference in its right of initiative and that they are not incompatible with the single electricity market can be.</seg>
<seg id=1124>In the Commission for the reconstruction of Tajikistan where 25 000 lives under 26 participants are widows, was only a woman.</seg>
<seg id=1125>Although the proportion of women has been relatively small, studies have shown that the presence of women in the friedenssichernden UN troops to an improvement in relations with the local population and the general morality.</seg>
<seg id=1126>The report is very Theorin 'in this area and also in repetition in detail, which we in the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, to ask in terms of removing official document.</seg>
<seg id=1127>Politically speaking, the current Amendment No 19, rather than a defeat tactical or tactical withdrawal suggest as a compromise substantive values, and this should actually be the frauensache unworthy.</seg>
<seg id=1128>They have been detained.</seg>
<seg id=1129>In Portugal, where the women, after the aprilrevolution of 1974 access to diplomacy, has recently received with our ambassador in Indonesia and East Timor, Mrs Ana Gomes, shown how the role of women and their awareness of the problems and the suffering of a people, the 25 years in his freedom struggle alone, as things stand around the world and especially here in the European Parliament can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id=1130>This very few have so far done, two or three of them, I understand that.</seg>
<seg id=1131>We must therefore also future this dimension in the development of the policy of the European Union will be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id=1132>Unfortunately, the terms not defined, and it will be no distinctions made.</seg>
<seg id=1133>I would ask you to convey to the Council protest.</seg>
<seg id=1134>They are people with other experiences - experience for the politikführung and in particular for the settlement of conflicts are essential.</seg>
<seg id=1135>. The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1136>Secondly, if the sector is to be legally regulated, of course, a number of points to be studied.</seg>
<seg id=1137>In the last few weeks, I have noticed that both sides, as well as international gewerkschaftskreise in certain national trade unions is a great deal of interest.</seg>
<seg id=1138>Second objection: they are also in favour of a housewives receive equal pay?</seg>
<seg id=1139>All those who are currently black work, then received a work under decent social conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1140>Weiters have this project resultierend have joined together in two or three families and made a budgetary together.</seg>
<seg id=1141>We have found ourselves in a during the first October part-session, when we, in our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia by the reaction of the Serbian people brave learned, whereupon we immediately, you will recall, ladies and gentlemen, called for the suspension of international sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=1142>So, Europe has the vitality of its civilisation in the history of the world and its political creativity in shaping of the future entwicklungswegs demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id=1143>There must be no doubt that the question of the status of Kosovo is a democratic question.</seg>
<seg id=1144>Then we would have an opportunity for Europe to show that we are under its own steam, recognition and respect the principles of democracy are in a position to the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg id=1145>I have to say that, as I was very impressed with you spoke - as you said, this was an extremely difficult situation meisterten and determined as they were.</seg>
<seg id=1146>This will be in the next protocol put in order, Mr Watson.</seg>
<seg id=1147>Access to documents and information on the work of the institutions to the citizens, decision-making bodies to account and proposes an increase in efficiency.</seg>
<seg id=1148>The fifth amendment is important in my view, one of annual reporting, above all the documents that we have to remain secret or are at least still secret.</seg>
<seg id=1149>This question is outstanding, and there is the possibility that the rules of transparency, the more limited to remain in force, and, among other things, we have tabled amendments on this point.</seg>
<seg id=1150>The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, is opposed to the proposal, the documents foreign or security issues affecting the whole of the principle and automatically exclude.</seg>
<seg id=1151>If we want the citizens to exercise their rights, we need in these contact points particularly geschulte staff who are seeking information to the citizens, in the hands of the complicated maze pfadfinder and as a result of the institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1152>Register are essential, if we do not want a insider public from the public.</seg>
<seg id=1153>It is very pleased that the European Parliament has been a broad majority in favour of more transparency.</seg>
<seg id=1154>Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs for their very good work its.</seg>
<seg id=1155>Mr President, openness and transparency in the European Union in no good light.</seg>
<seg id=1156>This should be the case, then that is a fehlkalkulation, because it is a question of the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1157>The document you now understands the many different things, and we want a possible full access to ensure dokumenttypen in many different forms.</seg>
<seg id=1158>Mr President, the Commission's attitude to inspect files is evident from the internal manual, on 11 October to the employees of the Commission has been distributed and to be informed, as they deal with the requests for access by Members of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1159>This regulation must be removed or at least the duty to a interessenabwägung be supplemented.</seg>
<seg id=1160>The normal way of international cooperation with the diplomatic traditions and rules, and that, for example, all operate behind closed doors - is not appropriate for modern forms, such as the EU is developed.</seg>
<seg id=1161>We should not it with the role of the European Parliament or with future interinstitutional agreements confuse.</seg>
<seg id=1162>It was a step forward on the use of the right of citizens to information and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1163>However, it is not the only, to whom I should like to thank, a huge thanks to Mrs Maij-Weggen from the PPE-DE Group, on the basis of the consolidated Hughes procedure is co-author of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1164>The transparency, must be a cornerstone of the work of the European Union as a whole, but is the right of access to the documents are to be able to the implementation of the transparency alone is not enough.</seg>
<seg id=1165>The European Parliament therefore calls for, that the European security and defence policy in future in the structures of the European Commission be involved.</seg>
<seg id=1166>As President Prodi, on 3 October wrote to Parliament, he spoke of the institutional triangle and pointed out that in a system of checks and balances based European functioning each institution will contribute to the common interest.</seg>
<seg id=1167>I have to admit that the great challenge in this regulation is the precise definition of documents.</seg>
<seg id=1168>I would like to stress that the Commission when the time comes practically all the amendments could accept, as no.</seg>
<seg id=1169>In some cases, I would like to support the proposals of the Commission, and to vote in favour of the Members on the list with the amendments, the Commission can support, and with the amendments which they do not want to support in their hands.</seg>
<seg id=1170>/ of credit institutions</seg>
<seg id=1171>And finally, and this was the most controversial point, the committee strongly urged an accelerated procedure for the implementation of this legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1172>These changes are to take the place of a number of other proposals in the report, which will probably be rejected in the vote, and now be replaced by the new amendments, which are the result of this consensus.</seg>
<seg id=1173>Mr President, in the light of the vote in favour of this report and the response of the Commission this morning is quite clear that, if you look at all points on which we voted - that we are in accordance with Rule 69 (2) the vote on the draft legislative resolution should be postponed, with the Commission and the Council in successful negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=1174>Mr President, I am sorry to have to say that the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats (PPE-DE), the postponement of the vote in favour, but I must point out that your coordinator, I came to tell me that they vote until the November II part-session instead wanted to postpone the vote this evening.</seg>
<seg id=1175>I would be for a different reason propose a postponement of the vote - Mr Goebbels said it already - this is a very important matter.</seg>
<seg id=1176>I do not know what a roll-call vote costs, but there are certainly some thousands of francs or Belgian francs from our budget.</seg>
<seg id=1177>I know that in France, whole herds have been slaughtered, and that does not seem to be the best solution.</seg>
<seg id=1178>Removal of meal in animal feed, and not only for cattle and sheep, but also of pigs, poultry and fish,</seg>
<seg id=1179>That is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1180>These provisions are likely to restore the confidence of consumers and farmers solidaritätsbotschaft to provide, which we want to convey to you.</seg>
<seg id=1181>There is an urgent need to go further - and an amendment to the common agricultural policy to consider.</seg>
<seg id=1182>The ban on the use of animal meal as animal feed is only the first step on this path.</seg>
<seg id=1183>We regret, however, that the amendments tabled by our group were not support.</seg>
<seg id=1184>I think it would be logical to the working of the workers in the environmentally harmful conducted to reduce.</seg>
<seg id=1185>In conclusion, I would like once again to stress that the widespread dissemination of the recovery of hazardous waste, should not lead us to the production of such waste abzufinden.</seg>
<seg id=1186>If, for example the pensions do not so low that it would not be enough for the livelihoods, there would be less poor.</seg>
<seg id=1187>The report is a budget of EUR 100 million for a period of five years ago to the reduction of poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1188>The proposal for a second Luxembourg in the area of social exclusion, to launch the guidelines and national action plans, which receives my unqualified support.</seg>
<seg id=1189>The report calls for the establishment of qualitative and quantitative indicators for the social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1190>With the presentation of its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission's request, the Council of June 2000 'a' initiative for the cooperation in this area "to produce.</seg>
<seg id=1191>Mr President, I have a very specific reason: the With this report, in my opinion, in environmental terms, no progress has been made, which I had hoped for and wanted.</seg>
<seg id=1192>I hope that this system in all the cities of Europe may be.</seg>
<seg id=1193>Some of the proposals of the European Parliament are unrealistic and not find my approval.</seg>
<seg id=1194>It must also be able to better future existing bestpractice publicly for them.</seg>
<seg id=1195>Umweltbewusste großverdiener given the opportunity, in a liberalised market voluntarily submit to a cleaner energy help, while for others it is the old.</seg>
<seg id=1196>The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1197>It is the following three reasons: firstly, this amendment is in the process of consolidating democracy and the increased demand for respect for human rights, in particular with regard to the indigenous communities.</seg>
<seg id=1198>In this debate we wish, as previous speakers rightly said, the solidarity and support for our institution to the Central American Parliament expressing this is happening at a time when we have to ensure that the external relations of the European Union to the countries iberoamerikas continue priority.</seg>
<seg id=1199>I have no reservations with regard to human rights, our colleague and friend, Mr Seguro, President of the delegation responsible for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, was authorised to speak.</seg>
<seg id=1200>Finally, the Commission, in the dialogue with the American authorities on several occasions pointed out the importance, from a regional integration process as an instrument for the consolidation of democracy and the development in the area on it.</seg>
<seg id=1201>In order to cling to power, he has not hesitated to the absurd debate over the "birthright" bemächtigen, a wave of hatred and xenophobia auslöste: on the other, the strangers to burkinabé or the malinesen, of which many people have for many years been ivorischem ground to live and work.</seg>
<seg id=1202>A precondition for the creation of a real democracy in Côte d'Ivoire is to set up an independent investigation of the crimes committed and the formal obligation to respect for human rights and of internal peace.</seg>
<seg id=1203>Some people think that the relative importance of democracy, when it comes to Africa, it is a complex process, and that it should be the time for us to work on the other hand, I am of the opinion that there can be no compromise in terms of democracy, and that in Côte d'Ivoire today the same question, for example, like Guinea, where we know that people are imprisoned and there is no democratic system.</seg>
<seg id=1204>Finally, let me say one more thing: dictatorships are only possible because it is the people who live in poverty, the access to knowledge, and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1205>It would be illogical if the European Union today called for new presidential elections, in which all candidates in this time.</seg>
<seg id=1206>In many parts of Africa, we are very with various ethnic and religious mixtures to do.</seg>
<seg id=1207>These elections should be the nation-wide representation of the political parties to be excluded from the presidential elections, so that, even if only partially, the shortcomings of this first choice for.</seg>
<seg id=1208>On the situation in Burma</seg>
<seg id=1209>It is a large-scale offensive against the Karen and Shan and the UN, as the rapporteur has said, there is no sign of a dialogue between sdpc and NLD.</seg>
<seg id=1210>Therefore we will once again the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1211>I hope that the European Parliament by addressing this issue in the topical and urgent debate, the Burmese people sends a clear signal that his desperate situation not forget is that we have to recognise that the situation in Burma worse rather than better, and that we are determined to do something about it.</seg>
<seg id=1212>It has taken a long time.</seg>
<seg id=1213>In Asia, there is a danger that economic and political reform be decoupled that economic progress and economic liberalisation can give without liberalisation in the political field, and without strengthening the rule of law, even though I believe that without a functioning state subsidies, in the long term, trade and investment are lost.</seg>
<seg id=1214>Mr President, I agree with previous speakers in many important points, because a lot of what is happening today in Vietnam, which is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1215>The human rights organisation Human Rights Watch, which Mr Swoboda has mentioned, said just now that the issue of human rights in Vietnam in recent times has done a great deal to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id=1216>These strictly secret documents to us a rare look behind the scenes of the policy of the Vietnamese government.</seg>
<seg id=1217>However, the Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation through a dialogue between the military regime, the opposition and democratically elected representatives of the ethnic minorities can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id=1218>There is also a clear pressure from the Vietnamese authorities in the direction of self-censorship of its own press.</seg>
<seg id=1219>The next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1220>We also need the help and support of the EU, not only in the south-west of England, but in all the areas concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1221>I would ask you all to support our resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1222>It is imperative that the European Union has not of exceptional aid after the transition of disasters is limited.</seg>
<seg id=1223>In this connection, the Commission has two initiatives.</seg>
<seg id=1224>Mr President, it is a purely linguistic errors in the inclusion of the amendments in the joint motion for a resolution has occurred.</seg>
<seg id=1225>To postpone the vote, which means that the remit to the Commission to be postponed.</seg>
<seg id=1226>(Parliament adopted the resolution for.)</seg>
<seg id=1227>The report is from the fact that an increasing proportion of krankenversorgung in Europe, must be covered.</seg>
<seg id=1228>I find it rather strange that the Commission now wants to tie the hands of a proposal for a directive but, at the same time, a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and krankenzusatzversicherungen demands by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1229>In view of the fact that the proportion of the population of elderly people is increasing, it is important to improve the health of people throughout Europe to consider.</seg>
<seg id=1230>We can, of course, will not go along with.</seg>
<seg id=1231>Mr President, much is for an accelerated procedure in the implementation of the results of the revision of the Basle kapitaladäquanz regulatory framework.</seg>
<seg id=1232>What is the sense of urgency on the subject of Mrs Villiers', the Commission gave draufgesetzt feeling the need is, by the adoption of measures in an accelerated procedure is calling for, that is to say that the rapporteur himself acknowledges that this arrangement does not affect the anti-competitive practices, which, unfortunately, in the United States are widespread.</seg>
<seg id=1233>Of course, we must be careful that Basel not also leads to higher capital requirements for banks still a second disadvantage arises.</seg>
<seg id=1234>Having said that, I would like to point out that the economic operators, in my opinion the approach as satisfactory in this regard, the rules on the capital, the issues associated with the risk that abstützen behind.</seg>
<seg id=1235>These are some of the initial ideas on how we, within the current rules of the Treaty could achieve a swift legislative process, and would be monitored effectively.</seg>
<seg id=1236>It is now the time has come to recognise that the institution of European Ombudsman '"up enough and is already sufficient evidence that they gave to the maturity of its own budget.</seg>
<seg id=1237>The PPE-DE Group supports the view of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the powers of the European Ombudsman should be extended to the faster, the better, especially in relation to Article 3 of the decision in 1994, the powers of the Ombudsman.</seg>
<seg id=1238>An Ombudsman geheimhaltungsvorschriften subject, of course, but it is important for the citizens to know that he or she as Ombudsman access to files, can remain closed to the rest of the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1239>The starting point of this report was subsequently by the Ombudsman addressed to the Commission recommendation, to which it organised competitions access to their own candidates of applicants and marked prüfungsarbeiten possible.</seg>
<seg id=1240>We believe that, to the Community institutions, and indeed all procedures, with maximum openness and transparency, they should go to suspicion of partiality, injustice or incompetence of the administrative procedures.</seg>
<seg id=1241>I am referring, for example, to an amendment about the request for an oral examination of the undeniable evidence.</seg>
<seg id=1242>Mr Bösch is already very briefly on the amendments to the report has.</seg>
<seg id=1243>Having been two questions to the Commission on the implementation of the internal organisation and which had, at last I have precise and detailed answers to them.</seg>
<seg id=1244>So will be open and transparent verwaltungsprozesse.</seg>
<seg id=1245>First of all, to be carried out by the Commission be the corrections always anonymously.</seg>
<seg id=1246>Clearly was meant July 2000.</seg>
<seg id=1247>VOTE</seg>
<seg id=1248>(Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote).</seg>
<seg id=1249>In the evaluation of the directive on the Union's own resources must be carefully number of banks in conflict with each other possible interests be weighed.</seg>
<seg id=1250>That is the idea of a European police college for the Member States of the European Union and for the candidate countries have created.</seg>
<seg id=1251>This position also the rapporteur, and the European People's Party shares it also.</seg>
<seg id=1252>The social situation in most of the Member States of the European Union requires now actually essential cross-border cooperation between the different police forces.</seg>
<seg id=1253>Most of the other speakers seems to think it is crucial that the College has a single permanent seat.</seg>
<seg id=1254>The umpteenth provisional, but not widerrufliche decision, with the Council for our Parliament usually a small gift power.</seg>
<seg id=1255>The rapporteur would also kriminalitätsvorbeugung, provision of services, innovation and the monitoring of the borders are involved and the safeguarding of internal security in the spirit of the maintenance of public order is amended.</seg>
<seg id=1256>These were the ideals, the US suggerierten, and we saw from the State, to the they wirkten.</seg>
<seg id=1257>A levelling of standards in some Member States of the European Union I would welcome.</seg>
<seg id=1258>Since the first concern in this matter, on the initiative of the European Parliament have been made at European level, the Commission has committed itself to a campaign against the Member States with the aim to bring to a building, which we as the European polizeikultur could look at the highest level of ethics, respect for human rights and freedoms of the citizens and the effectiveness of the fight against crime is based.</seg>
<seg id=1259>This planning a development of the police college in the first instance at intergovernmental level.</seg>
<seg id=1260>For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are voting against the report.</seg>
<seg id=1261>- (SV) I have voted against the provisional up the European police college voted.</seg>
<seg id=1262>There is no doubt that many of our courts and bedächtig work very slowly, and it is very difficult to you on these issues to a rapid action to move.</seg>
<seg id=1263>Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, because it is based on the Brussels II regulation is based, not for the children of separated parents living and unmarried applies.</seg>
<seg id=1264>My mother has such a divorce and kidnapping, 85 years gone along, and it is still there.</seg>
<seg id=1265>That is why I would like to tell Parliament that the Commission in the action programme on the mutual recognition of civil decisions - which I hope will be adopted by the end of this year, to propose the extension of the scope of the Brussels II regulation and so that this Regulation on the supreme visiting rights and high priority to children without distinction for married couples, as well as for children from couples.</seg>
<seg id=1266>We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=1267>In the meantime, sport - this must be said - in close cooperation with other industries, for example, to the business of the audiovisual sector or the advertising profession and the sportartikelverkauf.</seg>
<seg id=1268>What we need is a intelligent, flexible interpretation of the current arrangements.</seg>
<seg id=1269>Strictly speaking, it is an attack on democracy, much as we also defend, things from this waiting to see.</seg>
<seg id=1270>Therefore, the Commission will shortly be a response to their request for detailed information on the measures planned by the British Government.</seg>
<seg id=1271>The proposal by the Finance Ministers in connection with a preliminary draft budget half a year before the statement on the general budget made in spring 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1272>Also, I think that what Mr Simpson has said in extraordinary way contributed to us in view of the probable intentions of the United Kingdom Government to confirm.</seg>
<seg id=1273>By traffic jams we lose not only a lot of time, and not only high costs, but this is a major concern for the environment, and that is why I believe that if the British Government is using the money to solve the problems, we have all seen, in particular, of all European citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1274>We are more or less the only erdölproduzenten within the European Union and yet we have the highest petrol and diesel by all European countries - 1.20 £figures, we in the United Kingdom for a litre diesel.</seg>
<seg id=1275>That concludes this item.</seg>
<seg id=1276>The European Parliament, it is guilty to assure you that it is on your side, I would ask you to observe a minute 's silence to show our solidarity and to express our concern.</seg>
<seg id=1277>Madam President, I should like to fully support this proposal, since I am one of those who have requested that this item be included.</seg>
<seg id=1278>We are a good piece of progress.</seg>
<seg id=1279>The EU will develop its relations with the main groups and also as quickly as possible with the new government in the United States in contact.</seg>
<seg id=1280>In the light of what a surprise - are enthusiastic about the report by Mr Prescott deal with which he has negotiated, I cannot understand why he not only by Mrs Voynet, but, in my opinion, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, also by almost all the other European Environment Ministers was rejected.</seg>
<seg id=1281>Now, there is a danger that we have lost the impetus, the American negotiator change their position, and we may be in the front must begin.</seg>
<seg id=1282>The great controversy were this time the forests.</seg>
<seg id=1283>A constant warming of the earth would have for some EU countries means that part of its territory or versteppt flooded.</seg>
<seg id=1284>You have a high level of prosperity and low prices for products.</seg>
<seg id=1285>I congratulate Mrs Wallström on her efforts in the Hague, and wish her more success.</seg>
<seg id=1286>No doubt it was better to no agreement as to come to a bad, because the proposal was totally inadequate for Europe and not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1287>Change in the developing countries have far-reaching consequences.</seg>
<seg id=1288>I should like to repeat it in English: forest turns from being carbon sinks to carbon sources.</seg>
<seg id=1289>Only if the European Union is credible, it can in the discussions and the actual measures at the COP "B" in Bonn, take the initiative.</seg>
<seg id=1290>We have our own assessment of the events and to prepare documents, with the different parties and, of course, of the 'umbrella group' to come into contact.</seg>
<seg id=1291>Of course, there is a step in the wake of the forthcoming COP or the continuation of the COP is that the agreement will be in the Union, will be ratified.</seg>
<seg id=1292>Before the European Council, we will, in other words, Pierre Moscovici and next Sunday, I still hold a klausursitzung ministerial level, on which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, on Monday, at the General Affairs Council will be a meeting of the Intergovernmental conference will be held.</seg>
<seg id=1293>The minimum number of participating countries should be set up to look at the possibility of a unanimous decision of the Council to demand, which is a de facto veto right, which should be replaced by a anrufungsrecht.</seg>
<seg id=1294>That is regrettable, but I have to this fact.</seg>
<seg id=1295>The European Council will also address the state of progress of accession negotiations and therefore deal with the enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1296>The Lisbon European Council had guidelines to promote an innovative and competitive Europe adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1297>The level of consumer protection, for obvious reasons, to which I do not need to go into an increasingly bedeutenderes concerns of Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1298>We need to prepare to this unprecedented enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1299>Indeed, this is the criterion on which we, in the final analysis, the Nice Summit, we have to do.</seg>
<seg id=1300>(Applause))</seg>
<seg id=1301>Firstly, the applicant countries adopt and implement the acquis communautaire. It is also our task.</seg>
<seg id=1302>We are very much to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and we do not want it only great promoted.</seg>
<seg id=1303>The text, however, could be better; it can also following Nice, and improvements to be clarified.</seg>
<seg id=1304>I think it is simply indiskutabel that several governments, the question of the inclusion of a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty simply swept have on the table.</seg>
<seg id=1305>They do not want to incorporate into the Treaties, as proof of this is that this text, this elaborat, set aside.</seg>
<seg id=1306>In the WTO should we unpleasant with a common voice.</seg>
<seg id=1307>I think that, given the rather gloomy prospects of the burden of the Intergovernmental Conference with a more complex and controversial issue would be no intelligent schachzug.</seg>
<seg id=1308>I urge the French Presidency, maximum efforts to ensure that this gap is being closed, because it is highly destructive.</seg>
<seg id=1309>On trade policy, the Commission has drawn up a proposal which must be carefully considered.</seg>
<seg id=1310>Although some progress with the previous Treaty concerning the extension of the formula could be made, it was also the crazy formula of the codecision procedure, including the requirement of unanimity in issues of citizenship, social security, the inclusion of the self-employed and exercise erwerbstätigkeiten and cultural policy launched.</seg>
<seg id=1311>The fact that this question is, is in itself a clear evidence of the failure of a policy to strengthen the ties of mutual trust between the countries of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1312>That is the situation in which we at this Intergovernmental Conference for months, because no one will abandon putting toys.</seg>
<seg id=1313>The experience of this year lead us to the fact that we are in progress, the following Nice, with a view to the future of Europe in the konstitutionalisierungsprozess between the European Union must be achieved, not only in the meantime erschöpfte method of negotiations between the government representatives must have confidence.</seg>
<seg id=1314>The qualified majority is not the norm, it will be so that Mr Prodi has just correctly pointed out, the decision in blocked.</seg>
<seg id=1315>This aspect is the principle of subsidiarity was not mentioned in today's debate, however, is of great importance.</seg>
<seg id=1316>We have made it so that enlargement has taken place in 1995, it was the careful reflection group chaired by Carlos Westendorp, as it were, Amsterdam, and Nice, and now we are practically the same point, Mr President: we circles to institutional matters, without having to find solutions to us the opportunity to meet a very challenging task, the enlargement to 27, give.</seg>
<seg id=1317>Let us not the disappointment of the Nice Conference will in any case, if they are not an end result, to the disappointment of the peoples of our Parliament to add.</seg>
<seg id=1318>In the past, we have demonstrated that this is possible, and as a citizen of one Member State by a planmäßigen transition to membership has benefited, I have an enlarged and peaceful Europe to with great expectations.</seg>
<seg id=1319>But even if we have a right of veto, which it must be clear that this also has to apply to all the other.</seg>
<seg id=1320>However, a first change in 2004 at the elected Parliament will be needed because some Member States at least before the elections or during the period 2004 to 2009 will come.</seg>
<seg id=1321>The President-in-Office of the Council has raised the question of closer cooperation and stated that it bewege itself in this matter to reach a consensus.</seg>
<seg id=1322>Mr President, at first sight, it is nice to the leftovers and to make the necessary adjustments in the face of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1323>We also besäßen only a glimmer of those which, insofar as we are to negative developments in our part of the world and less emphasis legten verlaufende more positive processes in could give priority, then we would be happy, as is currently the case.</seg>
<seg id=1324>We should not only the goods, but also to the gehörigen services, investment, intellectual property and competition in the majority of the Council of Ministers and include the Article 133 (1) of the Treaty to change.</seg>
<seg id=1325>An initiative of the European Parliament would but also in this highly sensitive issue party-political open the floodgates to arbitrariness.</seg>
<seg id=1326>We therefore need to be able, as it is one of them said when he made to the American einging optimism and the way in which the Americans, is to highlight the, which is what progress.</seg>
<seg id=1327>I would also say to you that, in my opinion, it is not a problem of large and the small countries.</seg>
<seg id=1328>We have done a great deal, but we come to keep this old problem, and I do not believe that this is a development that will happen, because only a single country, because what we have here is, I repeat, with a very strong national political, democratic realities in Twelve of the 15 countries to do.</seg>
<seg id=1329>Mr President, Mr Védrine, you have said that this is perhaps too spannungsgeladenes climate is, and you have spoken of a certain pessimism.</seg>
<seg id=1330>I would also like to ask you to do everything possible to tighten up the requirements in the appropriate manner, so that such an incident does not happen again.</seg>
<seg id=1331>I believe that we have to make provision for this, we are still far from being made, that the guests of this Parliament, in this House can feel as guests and must not be afraid of the threat.</seg>
<seg id=1332>Here, hospitality hospitality and respect for there too.</seg>
<seg id=1333>Thank you for your comments, Mr Tajani.</seg>
<seg id=1334>The best tribute that we Ernest November and his life is to be able to follow in Catalan, its message is that they dìaleg. So we can all the dialogue in the Basque country a chance?</seg>
<seg id=1335>On the other hand, of course, everyone can its opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1336>(B5-0549 / 2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Council on the political and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan;</seg>
<seg id=1337>When I speak of organisation, I also mean that the European Union, which such great effort, the responsibility for that, too, should have.</seg>
<seg id=1338>Secondly, they will be in the resolution on the clear will of Parliament, that the security and defence policy to be based on two pillars: the balanced and civil crisis management in the event of a failure of the military crisis management, and these two pillars which complement each other.</seg>
<seg id=1339>Mr President, in the light of already taken here and the commitments which I again today, I shall try to the contribution that I had prepared, something to cut.</seg>
<seg id=1340>These relations are particularly on the meetings between the Council and the NATO copsi and meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European applicant countries and / or the allies manufactured.</seg>
<seg id=1341>As an example to the events in the Balkans, out of which can be said that everyone has fully exercised its role.</seg>
<seg id=1342>During this period that we have the United States also fully on the developments under the European security and defence policy kept informed, which is an indispensable condition is that they are harmoniously developed, such as at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=1343>It was the second annual report on human rights of the European Union submitted to the European Parliament, and a Forum will be held in Paris on 13 December.</seg>
<seg id=1344>This policy, as you will see that seeks not only to the competitors of the Atlantic Alliance, which are the basis of the collective defence of its members, or to set up a permanent European army.</seg>
<seg id=1345>If the figure of 100 000 I have mentioned, it does not mean that we want to outdo as laid down in Helsinki, the objective, but we have a reserve of different qualifications and spezialisierungen have so as to ensure that the objective of the Council to 60 000 men, all einsatzbedingungen can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id=1346>Let me now, very briefly, the public accepted by a large part of our real political meaning to this new task, with the European Union has been a lack of an instrument of political influence it.</seg>
<seg id=1347>However, we are now faced with the problem, we need to ensure that we are seeing the consolidation of democracy in Europe is freedom of speech, the whole continent, because that is what this is about the enlargement and the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=1348>There are three things we need to combine into a coherent whole, Community policies, the CFSP, including the ESDP and national measures of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1349>Despite the costly procedures within the Commission we need no strong force of 60 000 soldiers in order to achieve our objectives.</seg>
<seg id=1350>It is therefore much a possibility of humanitarian aid has to be found.</seg>
<seg id=1351>I do not agree with the cynics who say that Europe to get to a toys, which have nothing to do with this, however, it is true that the rapid reaction capability in many situations not deployable immediately.</seg>
<seg id=1352>The EU should not its own defence troops with fixed form.</seg>
<seg id=1353>I would like to end my group's concern about the situation in Afghanistan is verschlimmernde and express to the Commission and the Council to call upon you, as far as is possible, their efforts to find a peaceful solution and a assistance to the civilian population, to strengthen in particular is now before the winter.</seg>
<seg id=1354>To put it in simple terms: where, when and how the European rapid reaction force should be in the future?</seg>
<seg id=1355>The interview shows how the appalling record of these two months Intifada came to 270 deaths, mostly Palestinians, and nearly 10 000 injured amounts for life often disabled.</seg>
<seg id=1356>That is why it is also constantly trying to an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction to schrecklichster nature.</seg>
<seg id=1357>Secondly, and contrary to what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it is possible and desirable that the European Union in the light of the conflict and the escalation of violence in the Middle East, is more than ever, especially now, during the transitional period in which the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1358>Mr President, in this speech, I would like to concentrate on the report by Mrs Lalumière, points which, in my opinion, very good and clearly is.</seg>
<seg id=1359>But there is no real political concept, and there is still no common foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=1360>The EU has only one problem, namely that you öffentlichkeitsinteresse for such actions have not yet won, even though they are much more effective and more sustainable.</seg>
<seg id=1361>Another point is, of course, the question of the distribution of budget.</seg>
<seg id=1362>I am speaking this, despite the many obvious assurances on this subject, in the last few days as happened at the time and time again.</seg>
<seg id=1363>Our potential is currently limited to the Member States should at last their defence review, which is significantly different from country to country.</seg>
<seg id=1364>Even those who use the decision, for example, the creation of the so-called European army, is questioning the important political content of this decision, and its influence on the cohesion of the European Union must recognise.</seg>
<seg id=1365>The first appearance of defence in our Parliament is historically, so that we have reserved for him the night sitting, so that the impression of our Members is not too much.</seg>
<seg id=1366>For all of these conflicts is a civilian crisis prevention better than military action.</seg>
<seg id=1367>Russia is, in the long term, of a unionspartner undemocratic regime be?</seg>
<seg id=1368>Europe will be no new alliance represent, as some do, I believe, on the basis of incomplete information have indicated.</seg>
<seg id=1369>I have, pursuant to Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure, a motion for a resolution to wind up the debate.</seg>
<seg id=1370>Given the extent of the four committees involved were task, which is why a new procedure with the drawing up of four reports simultaneously was applied.</seg>
<seg id=1371>The measures proposed in the White Paper must serve as a whole, the whole of the functioning of the Commission to modernise and more efficient.</seg>
<seg id=1372>It would therefore be appropriate to the reform of the opportunity to take your intervention in order to limit on those areas which do not involve expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1373>The least bewertungsunterschiede are not only political, but, above all, a reflection of the cultural differences between the fifteen Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1374>The main task of the new internal audit service, which you, Mr Kinnock, the Vice-President responsible for reform, which is directly under the analysis of the internal control functions and systems within the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1375>The cooperation has made great fun, and I believe that the process of the Commission to submit an important reform which, for the future of the European Union is so critical that has a deep and wealth, we won four to have contributed.</seg>
<seg id=1376>They should expect to the other European institutions into or to the national governments to abgestellt or in the private sector, but to work.</seg>
<seg id=1377>That is why our committee points out once again the importance of a strong, independent, efficient, transparent and political leaders Commission attaches.</seg>
<seg id=1378>As the Committee on Budgets, we think that we have the budget after activities because of the lack of visibility of expenditure and because of our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority problems.</seg>
<seg id=1379>That is the determination of Parliament clear that this reform, together with the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1380>Mr President, first of all I should like to all thank the four rapporteurs for their work.</seg>
<seg id=1381>This is shameful, given the fact that the EU itself is the modernisation of the champion of economic life.</seg>
<seg id=1382>Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteur to support the work of the Commission, it is a fact that the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men to a comprehensive and consistent response in terms of strebens after a real government and not only for better management of the Commission is given.</seg>
<seg id=1383>The amended attitude should be expressed in a transparent administration.</seg>
<seg id=1384>In my opinion, there are around the world and no structure which substantielleren greater importance than the 15, 20 or more countries tomorrow - a whole continent, for the most part of the planet pulsiert industrialised areas of the European Union and by you in the Commission on their structures.</seg>
<seg id=1385>Changes are never easy.</seg>
<seg id=1386>It was the Socialist Group, however, take the view that the management of the Community is currently working very effectively.</seg>
<seg id=1387>We know the outcome, and that is why the many members of the Commission and its management in detail and expertly dealing with this problem.</seg>
<seg id=1388>Thousands of projektanträgen are already over a year an evaluation.</seg>
<seg id=1389>As we have seen in the debate, it is not so much about principles, objectives or opportunities of the reform process, but rather in order to speed up the timetable, the potential disturbances or undesirable consequences in its implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1390>I would like to inform the House that, as has already been pointed out, Mr van Hulten, on today's meeting of the College, a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement, which was adopted within the framework of which an advisory group 'rules for the conduct of the public service to be set up as a measure of the action programme on the White Paper.</seg>
<seg id=1391>Mr van Hulten has this point in the course of this debate I believe taken up again.</seg>
<seg id=1392>The main aim of the revision is to simplify, of increasing the transparency of the strengthening of principles, that is, less specific exemptions, special less incomprehensible, and it is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg id=1393>It is also very uneconomic simply for the Commission to take place if the Treaties so that 20% of the cost X, Y for costs to be replaced by 30% and often to be replaced by the evidence collected kleinstbeträgen and will be examined.</seg>
<seg id=1394>The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI)).</seg>
<seg id=1395>The latter aspects relate in particular the NGOs.</seg>
<seg id=1396>Of course, this is not sufficient, but that we should in any case, the excessive representations of the weakness of our development aid protect.</seg>
<seg id=1397>We have to come back, because this is in itself a sensible framework.</seg>
<seg id=1398>Mr President, I am now returned from Mozambique, where the European Union following the tsunami excellent humanitarian aid, but are once again reconstruction projects, for which we have already prepared to put the money to be delayed, since not all beisammen signatures in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id=1399>Faced with this reality, a greater commitment and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=1400>We have now on a harmonised system for the drawing up of country strategy papers and indicative programmes for cooperation in all developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=1401>It also provided for the establishment of SEM no solution to the existing imbalance of eight bloated verwaltungskörpern.</seg>
<seg id=1402>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have placed particular emphasis, in this debate today on the first package on maritime transport in the European Parliament to be, because they are dealing with three important texts, which are an essential first step in this area, which, unfortunately, the recent events so much in the public eye have is.</seg>
<seg id=1403>That would be from the point of view of the Presidency the opportunity to discuss with the Member States on the basis of their proposals, in order to reach agreement in the Council and the text at first reading, if necessary, by a qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=1404>This rapid and targeted action, whose result two Erika and six proposals are, has a dynamic has.</seg>
<seg id=1405>The lesson that this Parliament this morning, the need to realise that, if the result is that the sea in the world in a shameful state and it is high time that we in this House in order.</seg>
<seg id=1406>In terms of the vessels that do not correspond to the standards, it must send out a clear signal that we take them in European waters or tolerate in European ports.</seg>
<seg id=1407>At the lower tonnage container ships, we have a compromise between the 5 000 tonnes of sustainability, the limit of the IMO, and the 600 tonnes of sustainability, the ceiling proposed by the Commission, referred.</seg>
<seg id=1408>This information must be the European public, and port authorities and the interested public to be made available.</seg>
<seg id=1409>The grenzenübergreifende nature of the marine environment, that is, the pollution of an area of greater region will, calls for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution.</seg>
<seg id=1410>In the cooperation at local level will also naturschutzverbände included.</seg>
<seg id=1411>The amendment to the directive in terms of stricter application of the harmonisation of the legislation, especially with regard to the selection of überprüfenden ships and the scope of the various überprüfungsformen is, of course, positive.</seg>
<seg id=1412>I would like to point out once again that the request for urgent procedure, which you now, not been anmahnen is.</seg>
<seg id=1413>I think that the classification societies for haftungsgrenze between the Council and Parliament will once again have to be considered, irrespective of what is being decided today.</seg>
<seg id=1414>A tachograph, a black list, with all these matters, we are fully agree, but I would like to draw your attention to a few points.</seg>
<seg id=1415>In the light of this disastrous situation and anarchic maritime transport, Europe has the challenge, and eleven months after the Erika disaster, the European Union will be able to show that the procedure has worked so quickly, as none ever.</seg>
<seg id=1416>It is as the extent to which the liberal logic, contrary to a high level of security in maritime transport.</seg>
<seg id=1417>What technical measures also always to be taken of the hauptquellen for uncertainty will remain as long as it is in the English Channel and the North Atlantic zone the exponential growth of transport because of the hypertrophie nordseehäfen has not stopped.</seg>
<seg id=1418>The President-in-Office of the Council, it would be good to face if it were to be in his country would create order.</seg>
<seg id=1419>Mr President, since the break-up of the Erika was tankschiffs under political pressure a package of measures package, with the security of ships at sea should be improved.</seg>
<seg id=1420>Greek ships were simply, in the area, without there was storm, Mr Gayssot.</seg>
<seg id=1421>Thirdly, when we talk about these issues to be made clear that our erdölbevorratung between on the one hand and the fact that we are continuing to use fossil fuels, on the other hand, there is no connection.</seg>
<seg id=1422>We should at long last, have the political courage to our environmental ambitions also to.</seg>
<seg id=1423>This means that, in this area, we have a very great responsibility and must, it seems to me that any institutional eigenliebe aside.</seg>
<seg id=1424>For Finland, for example, it is essential that Russia is involved in these agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1425>This applies to both the more stringent requirements for the design of oil tankers, better rules for the port state control, as well as the more stringent rules for the classification societies that are also an outcome will be.</seg>
<seg id=1426>Mr President, today we are debating the safety at sea in the light of these three reports, on which I congratulate the rapporteurs we.</seg>
<seg id=1427>As far as the three new proposals to safety at sea is concerned, it is an urgent need to congratulate the three rapporteurs: they are in a very short time the evidence provided that our Parliament is determined to new measures to increase maritime safety, the strengthening of the controls and the tightening of design to adopt this type of disaster, and that in future no longer be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id=1428>Madam President, a series of hochgradiger disasters, especially with the oil tankers, in the recent past has our continent seriously affected.</seg>
<seg id=1429>More than 80% of accidents are due to human error, but there are reasons for the human error, the social nature.</seg>
<seg id=1430>Who spoke of 'traceability'.</seg>
<seg id=1431>With the directive on port state control to monitor compliance with international standards, and no new rules to be introduced.</seg>
<seg id=1432>Amendment No 18, the port state control to the rest of the seamen in respect of the implementation of the provisions on seafarers' hours of work, however, is already by the existing Directive 99 / 95 fully covered.</seg>
<seg id=1433>I am pleased that the rapporteur in Amendment No 21, a reference to the system for assessing the conditions is built, and we agree with the proposed hauptstoßrichtung, but something still needs to be done to make the wording more to make the whole system.</seg>
<seg id=1434>Amendment No 4 and to the point K "" serious as part of Amendment No 18 is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1435>I can assure you that a owner of a vessel in such flag register his intention to leave, that, once again, our proposal is in force.</seg>
<seg id=1436>The Commissioner has spoken about 18 minutes and in these times of dozens and dozens of articles quoted and the position of the Commission before.</seg>
<seg id=1437>Proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on a package of measures concerning the trans-European network for the collection and dissemination of compiling the statistics of the inside and außergemeinschaftlichen goods (EDICOM) (COM (00) 0458 - C5-0401 / 00 - 2000 / 0201 (COD)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)</seg>
<seg id=1438>I therefore zurückziehe by the motion for a resolution, however, I would like to express the conviction that our Parliament should have its voice heard more of it if the European Council of Nice a specific and separate resolution on this very important and sensitive issues of the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than have it within the framework of a single, all other items on the summit resolution must deal with.</seg>
<seg id=1439>(Because more than 12 Members from their seats raised will, does not take into account the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1440>Report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI))</seg>
<seg id=1441>I have done as a sign of protest, because the European Union in this area is still not be able to intervene, as it should.</seg>
<seg id=1442>Although neither the proposal to amend the existing directive on port State control, the Watts report meet the real needs to contain some of them in the right direction, which is why we have weisende aspects, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1443>That is why it is regrettable that, in the Commission 's proposal was not taken up the idea of a genuine European küstenüberwachungsbehörde modelled on the United States, the current "coast guards" establish.</seg>
<seg id=1444>An essential condition for the safety of ships, the protection of life at sea and the environment are the fight against the unaccountability of shipowners, apply strict measures to control the state of the ships, the severe punishment of schiffsgesellschaften against the safety requirements are contrary to the improvement in the working conditions of seafarers, their specific training as well as to the composition of the occupation in such a way that it is the increased demands on the ships will be able to meet.</seg>
<seg id=1445>Unfortunately, the power of the Hatzidakis exactly the opposite.</seg>
<seg id=1446>The sinking of the Erika in December 1999, the question of safety at sea at the political agenda of the Community, and the Commission have these texts on which we are now, almost a year after the terrible accident, voted, at the insistence of the European Parliament proposed.</seg>
<seg id=1447>The current compensation fund is in unzureichendem, resources, this was only too clearly the Braer disaster of the fishing industry, the Shetland does not adequately compensated for their losses.</seg>
<seg id=1448>Madam President, I had already said that I am used to maritime risks.</seg>
<seg id=1449>The rapporteur ’ s proposals, on the harmonisation at European level, which can only be good.</seg>
<seg id=1450>The area in question is very important, as it happens the schiffsklassifikationsgesellschaften.</seg>
<seg id=1451>This would be a great success, because, on the eve of enlargement, we need a supranational Europe, which is rigid and hierarchisch bürgerfern, but a flexible nahes, the peoples of Europe, which is based on respect for national democracies.</seg>
<seg id=1452>The public in the increasingly ausgetragene power struggle between Member States in view of the many verstellt trade-offs.</seg>
<seg id=1453>In Nice is the most important task is to ensure that the institutions of the EU work efficiently.</seg>
<seg id=1454>Personally, I see the in a week's summit to hopeful.</seg>
<seg id=1455>I am not in favour of an automatic link of qualified majority voting and codecision and I believe that here, too, that any decision to extend the power of codecision, must be taken on a case by case.</seg>
<seg id=1456>The amendment of Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Europe of qualified majority voting, are in the Council for the goods to be applied to other areas such as public services, intellectual property, health or education extend.</seg>
<seg id=1457>So Parliament is deprived of the right to influence, keeps quiet and silent in homage to the parteilichkeiten, the duty and the national governments and forgetting the its obligations towards the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1458>In addition, I have voted against a text, the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty calls for, which will be adopted in Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1459>It is a mistake, in the European Union into two classes; that is why I cannot support that one third of the Member States is advancing faster.</seg>
<seg id=1460>Its new role heralded the end of the traditional neutrality Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria a.</seg>
<seg id=1461>In this report, there is a lot of the British Conservatives support give this applies in particular to the emphasis to be placed on the enlargement of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1462>The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament support the report on the implementation of a common European security and defence policy.</seg>
<seg id=1463>But also against the peoples of the European Union, the new military expenditure, on which the report indicates, in any case, finance, and which does not even have the guarantee that these forces not one day in the name of maintaining order "against" you yourself used.</seg>
<seg id=1464>Just as serious is the proposal that a state that is a task not involved, would like to make a financial contribution to that of the states involved in this war will be divided.</seg>
<seg id=1465>Through military means from the outside, there is no solution, because it does not address the causes of the conflict to bring about a shift in public opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1466>That military operations from a line are to be financed by the Community and the Member States to make a financial contribution for these tasks should do, even if they do not wish to participate (paragraphs 49 and 50).</seg>
<seg id=1467>The EU would do well to face when they are the priorities of the Petersberg tasks and reverse focus more on humanitarian and civilian lösungsmodelle would focus.</seg>
<seg id=1468>I support this report by my colleague Mrs Mrs Theorin.</seg>
<seg id=1469>But the needs of this group will only be vorgeschoben to the call for the 'n) (tax deductibility of domestic' and the 'adaptation of prices and costs to the financial resources of private individuals' to raise.</seg>
<seg id=1470>It is in fact sagenhaft that we in the 21st century, we recommend that the Member States for domestic security and the right to adequate pensions should be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id=1471>For many young people at risk can the first contact with the labour market.</seg>
<seg id=1472>The worst thing is that, if it is still to women from distant countries, which this work notgedrungen adopted and have no option but to look to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id=1473>The reform of the Commission will be judged by its results, hence the need for the regular sachstandsberichte programmdauer throughout the whole of the Commission and the importance of the full assessment expected December 2002.</seg>
<seg id=1474>Not so long ago, there was a result of various scandals and managementschwächen in March 1999 following the resignation of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1475>Finally, I think it is essential to remember that we have for the future of this essential reform also greater consistency and transparency in the Commission in its day-to-day administration, but also a greater responsibility, for their part, with strict limits on their powers.</seg>
<seg id=1476>The Conservatives also support the statement in paragraph 7 of the report that the democratic control and to ensure the system of the three pillars is to function.</seg>
<seg id=1477>(The sitting was closed at 1.15 to).</seg>
<seg id=1478>The information we have received - and I would like to add that I do not believe that the Council - and the French President tomorrow there will be only 30 minutes to speak.</seg>
<seg id=1479>That is why I agree with a detailed and I reasoned opinion from.</seg>
<seg id=1480>We should, in any case, and I am personally in favour of a resolution, as Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others have proposed.</seg>
<seg id=1481>In these texts, in so far as the night work, as well as for the quantitative stimmenaufteilung in the Council and seats in the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1482>Madam President, I would strongly urge that the de Roo report cannot be removed from the agenda, because he is very well drafted by the recent earth during the French Presidency will next Monday and Tuesday to draw up a common position.</seg>
<seg id=1483>Thank you very much, Parish.</seg>
<seg id=1484>In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, its chairman, it is also often he smoke.</seg>
<seg id=1485>The political basis, is clear: the market, whilst taking account of a high level of health protection and, building on the existing legislation and new scientific evidence.</seg>
<seg id=1486>It is about their living conditions and lebensauffassung in which the health ever greater importance.</seg>
<seg id=1487>This rule is equally to all in the leisure consumed, but not dangerous drugs to be applied, if no other, apart from these drugs konsumierenden person will be affected.</seg>
<seg id=1488>Just yesterday were in the United States against multinational tobacco processes with convictions poisoning and false information on the harmlessness of products to an end.</seg>
<seg id=1489>As regards the cigarettes, in the EU are banned for health reasons, but from the European Union to be exported, we believe that the end of this is the only right thing exports and consistent.</seg>
<seg id=1490>Not the lessons from the defeat of 9 October of this year in Luxembourg, we will be in a position, which is not legally tenable.</seg>
<seg id=1491>I have listened very carefully to what the Commissioner to Mr Hume said: "no massive job losses in this sector.</seg>
<seg id=1492>It is Parliament and the Council, to approve this proposal for a directive and, amongst other things, that the appropriate legal basis have to examine.</seg>
<seg id=1493>I do not believe that such a narrow path, because, regardless of its content, which is substantially, as Mr Maaten and others aufzeigten, there is a risk that this Parliament, the Council and the European institutions as a whole, if this Parliament and the Council by the Group of the European People's Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi 's proposed to accept a restrictive interpretation of the legislative work of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law, and its feet hands are tied.</seg>
<seg id=1494>Its weakness lies in the fact that the emphasis on the promotion of free competition.</seg>
<seg id=1495>Lastly, following the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament is entitled to ask environmental and consumer protection to coordinate, and it is in this respect, of course, cooperate closely with the Council and the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1496>In fact, really has nothing to do with tobacco, but the decision of the Court of Justice had just as well as on the advertising of alcohol ergehen, or a ban on advertising for chocolate, as we know, sugar can be harmful.</seg>
<seg id=1497>I simply do not understand that a majority of this Parliament wishes to introduce generous exportvorschriften, as it is by their own governments of the Member States is intended - those governments, but also the many sectors represented, to the point.</seg>
<seg id=1498>It is proof that 80% of people want to stop the tobacco industry, but has only a few strategies to offer in order to help these people.</seg>
<seg id=1499>If we insist, other countries to which they should health standards set by our reasonable proposals for the internal market, and to extend exports, so that the whole of the excellent work by Mr Maaten in question.</seg>
<seg id=1500>We support the implementation of this tests by a country akkreditiertes testlabor recognised EU-wide after a single method.</seg>
<seg id=1501>The effects of smoking on health are now widely acknowledged, and the general public and legislators have come to the conclusion that the time has come, strict rules and regulations on this product to adopt.</seg>
<seg id=1502>For this reason the Community will be very well in the future international rules fit and, therefore, the risk of barriers entstehens away, at the same time, strengthen and guarantee a high level of health protection.</seg>
<seg id=1503>Instead, we should wait until the whole question of additives in the first report of the Commission will be dealt with.</seg>
<seg id=1504>As regards the amendment on the laboratory tests approval of superfluous, since in one article stipulates that only those products placed on the market must be that the provisions of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1505>Madam President, this report is very clear: today is the duration of the directives on only in five years, then it must be limited to Parliament once again to extend to be presented.</seg>
<seg id=1506>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a Directive on summer-time arrangements, which we are considering today, I believe it is a good proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1507>I therefore believe that we in this House, this issue should not be too long delay, but the Member States and also to the population in the regulation of the already widely accepted, and it is as part of our jahresrhythmus recognised.</seg>
<seg id=1508>I am in favour of the questions regarding the time zones and harmonisation of the summer-time, as proposed, in the power of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1509>It spräche more in favour of summer time at the end of September, some six months after its beginning, to an end.</seg>
<seg id=1510>We support appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report to be drawn by 2007, as mentioned in Article 5.</seg>
<seg id=1511>It makes it clear that interventions in the human germ line cannot be accepted.</seg>
<seg id=1512>We will vote in favour of this compromise, even if we still have a regulation that the therapeutic progress and guarantee the protection of patients in Europe not only in this way, as it is, but can be improved, and that is why I am arguing in favour of this compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1513>These groups must also continue in the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1514>I am glad, though, is that we have managed to a stop to the therapy.</seg>
<seg id=1515>I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on his report and congratulate him for his efforts to reach a compromise in the differences.</seg>
<seg id=1516>These programmes relating to the prevention of cancer, AIDS, the drug and the health of their breakdown by the end of the relevant plans and the work of the networks created.</seg>
<seg id=1517>It is extremely positive, even in the run-up to the ground as quickly as possible to prepare, in order to make progress and, even if a second reading, it will be possible to approach the issue on which a decision can be taken.</seg>
<seg id=1518>On the other hand, we must bear in mind that both the prevention and support, as well as monitoring the increasingly important, and that is why we need greater importance attached to them and a higher budget be set aside.</seg>
<seg id=1519>Madam President, on the occasion of the Trakatellis report on the extension of the current European action in the field of public health, I would like to express concern about the direction in which the European policy in the field of public health concern.</seg>
<seg id=1520>I find that the Council also be fundamental agreement has indicated.</seg>
<seg id=1521>In the European Union is now the paradox that the internal borders, to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital borders have been abolished, the 15 Member States but also in the fields of police and judicial mutual assistance in criminal matters should be maintained, eliminating them by the Member States will be more difficult.</seg>
<seg id=1522>Finally, is the fact that the initiative for a real and important step forward in the creation of a European strafrechtsraums. If they also covers only strands and in its impact is limited, but it is very much to the real needs of many European citizens, to date, the virtually helpless because, if they were outside the territory of their country have been victims of crime.</seg>
<seg id=1523>What we have for these people for?</seg>
<seg id=1524>At the same time to ensure that the experts who are direct contacts to the victims of the exercise, a specific training.</seg>
<seg id=1525>Victims must not be victims twice, only the victims of crime and then of the system.</seg>
<seg id=1526>In this context, it is also important that the family of the victim's family and professional discreetly, on this issue will be informed and, if you wish, with the necessary support, and that they do not need to know from the press.</seg>
<seg id=1527>This applies regardless of the type of crime.</seg>
<seg id=1528>We have still not at national level ever abgehen from the principle that an individual has always bear the responsibility for its own actions.</seg>
<seg id=1529>In other cases, it may be necessary to the information needed to obtain the Union in a language which is not their own.</seg>
<seg id=1530>I am pleased that Parliament's favourable reaction to this is the first text on such an important issue, so that the area of freedom, security and justice, the protection of our fellow citizens, we have created in situations in which it is often only with difficulty zurechtkommt.</seg>
<seg id=1531>The vote on urgent procedure</seg>
<seg id=1532>(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure).</seg>
<seg id=1533>We have in the night from 23 to 24 November with the Council on the cornerstones of a budget, the agreed, but certainly not glanzvoll is reasonable.</seg>
<seg id=1534>The Commission has had to be a revision EUR 300 million proposed by the Council, tooth and against opposed.</seg>
<seg id=1535>But I also know from discussions that it is a difficult times, is a non-negotiable ratsposition to formulate a mandate, and to get the puren national self-interest in a reasonably sensible and reasonable pan-European decision will make.</seg>
<seg id=1536>I hope that the work on a common recruitment office, as it is, therefore, a European neudeutsch einstellungsbehörde, so that we can actually make progress with the problems in the next few years and sent to all the institutions - the Council, like the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions - namely the personalbedarf the next few years to tackle together.</seg>
<seg id=1537>The Council has refused this revision, we should already have on the data, and I would like to warn the precautionary instrument in two consecutive years, and in fact less than 15 months' time, for the first time, less than six months after the adoption of the financial perspective - to use the flexibility instrument to weaken financially, since it prevents its restoration and possible accumulation of up to EUR 600 million is envisaged.</seg>
<seg id=1538>This considerable amount to the need for the year 2001 is due, in particular through the use of the flexibility instrument in the sum of EUR 200 million to be financed.</seg>
<seg id=1539>In light of new facts in a second reading, the Council has adopted a budget, the increase has 2.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1540>Before they finally adopt this budget, I would like to stress the value of the Council on the application of certain fundamental budgetary rules for the recruitment of funds in the reserve, the legal basis and the classification of the expenditure is.</seg>
<seg id=1541>And, unlike the Nice are, I believe that all three institutions - Parliament, Council and Commission - with the result of the net reasonably satisfied.</seg>
<seg id=1542>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the return of BSE auffinden diseased cows made and for the budget, namely the need for immediate action on health, consumer protection, but also at the level of aid for farmers affected by this situation.</seg>
<seg id=1543>Moreover, the Council for the framework programme to support the reconstruction of the Western Balkans a set of mehrjahresbetrag, although only a benchmark, but is in line with the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1544>With würgen attached and we still have a few million euros more herausgeschlagen.</seg>
<seg id=1545>My sincere thanks to Mrs Haug,.</seg>
<seg id=1546>Do you think therefore that this 1% of the budget of the European Union is very well used.</seg>
<seg id=1547>If I have understood you correctly, you said that we should not use the reserve, because it goes against the rules.</seg>
<seg id=1548>I therefore think that we, along with much else, that I now because time is short, not to mention, very good things can be seen.</seg>
<seg id=1549>While the agricultural expenditure, the almost half of the entire budget, taking account of the letter, in the coming year, in order to grow more than 5% average growth of the entire budget only 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1550>Now we see a great risk that in the next few years, the dispute between mittelmeeranrainerstaat MEDA projects and Balkans will increase, even though we all know that, where money is urgently needed.</seg>
<seg id=1551>Satisfied, the difficulties to be overcome, and on the way to the desired objective, which the Helsinki auftürmten in relation to the applicant countries to fulfil their commitments, not to exceed the Union, and the future of Europe was to enable it to continue to act efficiently.</seg>
<seg id=1552>But there is real progress, progress has been made, even if they do not go as far as the presidency - which, as I would like to point out national, and I saw a great openness demonstrated - would have liked.</seg>
<seg id=1553>For the statute for European political parties is a new legal basis provided, and the European Parliament would be given the right of klageerhebung under Article 230 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1554>In the last few months are three important steps forward has been done.</seg>
<seg id=1555>This is the aim of the declaration adopted in Nice on the ideas and has started to the fight against doping at European level to coordinate.</seg>
<seg id=1556>The environmental risks is - as is well known - the global warming.</seg>
<seg id=1557>In Nice, the European Union continues to the provision and for the leadership of a common foreign and security policy necessary permanent bodies used: a political and a committee sicherheitspolisches Committee, as well as a European military staff.</seg>
<seg id=1558>For this cooperation, for their support and also for granted us taking thanks to you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency.</seg>
<seg id=1559>(Applause))</seg>
<seg id=1560>(Applause))</seg>
<seg id=1561>We now need to examine carefully the text in the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1562>I would like to point out in passing, Mr President of the European Council that the costs are borne by the taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id=1563>I regard it as a failure, not only with regard to the European Union has proclaimed ambitious objective, and the efficiency of the institutions of the European Union should be improved, in order to be able to include the new Members are properly, but also in terms of a further important aim, which is perhaps too little has been emphasised, namely in relation to the convergence of the European Union and the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1564>The right questions, in our view, those who the impressive menschenmenge bewegte, on the eve of the summit in Nice was zusammengeströmt from the whole of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1565>First, the Fifteen have rushed in a climate of tränengasgeschwängerten grundrechtecharte signed.</seg>
<seg id=1566>(Applause))</seg>
<seg id=1567>My group is disappointed by this Treaty and the future of the US, he is concerned, is why we must fight against it with all its might.</seg>
<seg id=1568>Mr President, you have the floor.</seg>
<seg id=1569>Finally, I would like to reply to Mr Hager, is that the instrument of reinforced cooperation in my view, is useful, in order to make Europe more dynamic, and the path to explore how it earlier - I believe - as Mr Romano Prodi, has, I fully support this.</seg>
<seg id=1570>Mr President, I would like to know whether the competence of the European Parliament, in a new achievement after Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1571>In the past by the complexity of the clinical trials abgeschreckten pharmaceutical companies, perhaps by means of the Member States, as well as our Parliament to clear desire expressed, encourage the market to develop for paediatric medicines, even if it is not enough to return on the investment to secure.</seg>
<seg id=1572>- (FR) The summer-time, which at the time of the oil crisis for reasons of energy saving and introduced until 2001 was extended to be continued?</seg>
<seg id=1573>It is not always is the status of victims in criminal protected effectively.</seg>
<seg id=1574>This European initiative will therefore many travellers and holidaymakers benefit.</seg>
<seg id=1575>Mr President, I wish to begin by President Prodi, to greet the here with us, as well as the Presidency of the Council, in particular the Chamber betritt, and would like to stress that, in this Chamber, probably never such unanimity in the assessment of the results of a summit showed.</seg>
<seg id=1576>The Europe which has in movement, is that, under the French presidency in six months' time, it seems to me that in spite of everything, on his work in six key areas.</seg>
<seg id=1577>Above all, however, I fear that Britain, France and Germany will now be in a position, in the course of the decades between States of different sizes and reached between the delicate balance to be upset.</seg>
<seg id=1578>It is difficult to see how the Nice decisions actually facilitate the enlargement of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1579>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can today, very brief.</seg>
<seg id=1580>All of this, I can only the conclusions that I on this, if the Treaty of Nice, which should be voted 'no' vote.</seg>
<seg id=1581>Mr President, the most important outcome of Nice was that, in spite of everything, an agreement has been reached and now place for the candidate countries can be created.</seg>
<seg id=1582>The real winners of this conference, Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, the gentlemen, to say 'no' to Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1583>So let us look at Nice and we look at the post-Nice process, allow me, I would like to hope that the Belgian presidency for its great project announced a convention on, because it has been proved: we need to break new ground, and we need a new method, we need to speed up the history, it is too late, because 2004 is too distant, is too many risks with.</seg>
<seg id=1584>Instead, there was the spirit of Nice appears to have to ask how we can block, how can we intergouvernementalisieren, how can we therefore at home as defenders of national interests to celebrate, not in order to ensure that the EU really move forward.</seg>
<seg id=1585>Moreover, we are at Amsterdam and Nice, is a Europe of reichsfürsten, a Europe of national administrations and not the Europe of the political agreement.</seg>
<seg id=1586>On the main issues we can no longer on qualified majority voting up.</seg>
<seg id=1587>It is true that I am here - I am opposed to the words of Mr Bayrou, - and I have been here this morning seats, first on the side of the President of the Republic, now in its own business, and by all sides hagelt it criticisms, moderate, friendly criticism, it seems to me, but in any case criticisms.</seg>
<seg id=1588>We must not forget that it is in fact the first time since 1957 is that this scheme is or has been reformed.</seg>
<seg id=1589>We have to do with constitutional systems, and can therefore the powers cannot be mixed.</seg>
<seg id=1590>Thank you, Minister,.</seg>
<seg id=1591>But it has not yet been included in the Treaties, there is a reference to the Charter in Article 6 (2) of the Treaty on European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1592>Finally, there are positive aspects mentioned, for example, the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty, the article on political parties and their staff, the right of Parliament to the other institutions with the Court of Justice to sue - is an important factor of political control, the new wording for the European Commission, the inclusion of the so-called 'lex Prodi' in the Treaty, the strengthening of the President and the new composition of the Commission, this is a reasonable compromise, which I accept, of course, prove it.</seg>
<seg id=1593>Mr President, we already have a kompromisslose assessment of what happened in Nice, carried out.</seg>
<seg id=1594>If we look at the things: the Charter has not been incorporated into the Treaties, not even a reference.</seg>
<seg id=1595>We want the Heads of Government demonstrate that we can do better.</seg>
<seg id=1596>Despite the eigenlobs from the French presidency this morning is the Intergovernmental Conference is not been brought to a successful conclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1597>Mr President, it is not so easy, now the French Council Presidency to criticise, since he is not here.</seg>
<seg id=1598>Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the model of the Intergovernmental Conference has end.</seg>
<seg id=1599>Budget year 2001 (continuation)</seg>
<seg id=1600>This does not mean, however, it would have been no more and some not able to make even better.</seg>
<seg id=1601>Through such ceilings, the Commission will be forced, within the framework of a limited budget to set priorities, as any authority must do.</seg>
<seg id=1602>With this debate on the following vote is a long and complicated process of decision on the European Union's budget for the year 2001 will be completed.</seg>
<seg id=1603>That is why we are as follows: at the recourse to Article 272, we have a budgetary crisis avoided the financial perspective has been maintained, despite the use of the flexibility instrument.</seg>
<seg id=1604>Addressed to the Council, I would like to say that we are not in this game as quickly as possible and that we will be the balls so long play, until we have achieved the desired result.</seg>
<seg id=1605>We do not want to have a resolution Colom revisionsvorschlag next year ’ s report, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we also agree with his criticism of the fact that a solution with regard to the financial unterausstattung category 4, in this way the long-term nature of the major objectives of the external action of the Union and also the definition of the financial perspectives which distorted.</seg>
<seg id=1606>In order to achieve all of this, in order to be able to meet our long-term commitments, must continue to be priorities.</seg>
<seg id=1607>This is the only way that the money we have for our fellow citizens is available, sensible and properly spent.</seg>
<seg id=1608>If we are to be expected to supplementary budget already einkalkulieren, then it will in almost 8%, whereas we in all other areas, whether it be the education, it is the whole area of internal policies, including research, foreign policy, the administration of pre-accession aid, as a whole - is a growth rate of 1.1%.</seg>
<seg id=1609>As the cooperation so well, we will, then the supplementary budget back in January, you have the opportunity to continue.</seg>
<seg id=1610>Equally, we welcome it, if the has still not been regulated relations between Russia and the Baltic States criticism.</seg>
<seg id=1611>We are following with great interest the social and Russia ’ s internal developments.</seg>
<seg id=1612>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1613>President Putin, even if we are to guarantee the democratic development of his country, he is not automatically guarantee for a stable and democratic Russia is still the democratic order not gelebte reality in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1614>However, we should not do secretly, it is, however, a Europe of economic cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1615>As far as the Caucasus is concerned, Mr Van Orden has is right.</seg>
<seg id=1616>If Russia from outside, and then also individual immediate impression from the country itself, and of our Russian partners given quickly, is in danger of selective approach to the reality of the country to explain what it is in Russia does its image.</seg>
<seg id=1617>In the political field is the common strategy on Russia, in an ongoing dialogue on politics and security and to ensure a permanent mechanism to create.</seg>
<seg id=1618>I would like to stress that we really have to make it clear that Russia is in fact a political union with Belarus is.</seg>
<seg id=1619>Are you, Mr Patten, prepared to such a project to support?</seg>
<seg id=1620>As Members are aware, has been at the last summit between the European Union and Russia by Romano Prodi a far-reaching dialogue on matters of energy set in motion.</seg>
<seg id=1621>I very much hope that I at the beginning of next year, will have an opportunity to visit Kaliningrad itself, not only because Immanuel Kant has spent his whole life there.</seg>
<seg id=1622>I would like to congratulate the honourable member again on an excellent report on an extremely important issue, that of the US in the coming years here in Parliament certainly has to be addressed.</seg>
<seg id=1623>You put me in a very difficult situation.</seg>
<seg id=1624>Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is very important, because the BSE crisis has an enormous impact on feedingstuffs, on production and imports of animal feed.</seg>
<seg id=1625>The Council has at its many meetings with Russia at all levels of his concerns expressed, in particular, to the Russian Government to encourage excessive violence, as well as possible to prevent the conflict spreading, independent and effective investigations carried out, the rights of the OSCE support group in fulfilling its mission to assist and, finally, for the transport of humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id=1626>Mr President, on a point of order, it is quite usual in this House, that the issues that are not sufficiently orally will be answered in writing nachgereicht.</seg>
<seg id=1627>(Interruption from Mr Posselt's)</seg>
<seg id=1628>This directive dates back to 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1629>In this sense and we must work on.</seg>
<seg id=1630>These groups are, however, do not appear to have been included in the new proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1631>The presidency and some Member States have the association of the European sugar industry several letters to the Commission's proposal, which you will take into account in its deliberations.</seg>
<seg id=1632>Question No 6 by (h 0886 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1633>First of all, I must say that the President-in-Office of the Council, I think the question by Mr Korakas has not yet answered.</seg>
<seg id=1634>Now, it is important to establish this authority, and I believe that the European authorities are well aware of the problem and that we need to make progress.</seg>
<seg id=1635>In order to bring it to the point, is the representative of the Presidency, in this case, the French ambassador in Algeria, with Mr Ahmed says taleb met?</seg>
<seg id=1636>In this connection, we welcome the proposed by vorbereitungskomitee and of the General Assembly adopted provisions for the accreditation of the NGOs and the preparations for the special session in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1637>The text on the accession partnership includes a number of references to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=1638>As to the Council, in its previous reply to the honourable Member has already pointed out, is a process of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters better protection of the rights of persons allow.</seg>
<seg id=1639>I would, however, nachhaken.</seg>
<seg id=1640>It takes political control and, in particular, under the strategic use of military crisis management.</seg>
<seg id=1641>I would just like to remind you that the system of the Treaty makes a difference between the treatment of indirect taxes, which, for the establishment and the functioning of the internal market is necessary, and that is what it says in Article 93 - and the harmonisation of legislation, in accordance with Article 94 - those who directly to the establishment and the functioning of the single market will have an effect, and that includes the direct taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1642>I would just a few words on these three key point.</seg>
<seg id=1643>If that is in any doubt that verhaltensmuster fighting against any, is that this could be the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, based on regional cooperation is based, exceed.</seg>
<seg id=1644>We will also need the cooperation with former Yugoslavia - and that a mutual cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1645>Mr President, our group supports the work of Mr Baltas in connection with the report on the possibility of negotiating a stabilisation and association agreement with the Republic of Croatia.</seg>
<seg id=1646>Mr President, over the years in which I was President of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, I had the opportunity to many Croats in its efforts to freedom and prosperity to accompany which they, like other peoples of our continent, with its integration into the European institutions gleichsetzten.</seg>
<seg id=1647>In the light of developments in Croatia in the course of this year, I am convinced that, if we succeed in presenting a straffes pace, for that is what, Croatia has done over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id=1648>This is the approach followed by us, and the speed with which we have in recent months on the developments in Croatia, which have confirmed this.</seg>
<seg id=1649>We owe it to the people in Croatia that we owe it to you and your government in the coming years allseitig support, and we are very grateful to the honourable Member that he recommends that we continue along the path.</seg>
<seg id=1650>In this connection, it is incomprehensible that in the spring of this year thousands of supporters of the Laskar Jihad has been able to draw the Moluccas where the flames of conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1651>On East Timor militias deny the refugees to return and) will be threatened.</seg>
<seg id=1652>On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should just like to comment on three points.</seg>
<seg id=1653>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by Mrs Maij-Weggen - Maij-Weggen on her excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1654>Because it is no exception in.</seg>
<seg id=1655>The continuing violence in the Moluccas, in Aceh and Irian Jaya bring in great suffering on the population.</seg>
<seg id=1656>Tomorrow will be held by the presentation of the Sakharov Prize here.</seg>
<seg id=1657>The recent reports from the Indonesian archipelago is short, however, the question of whether the situation is even more serious, for President Wahid and its allies, even more precarious, as described by the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=1658>If we want to help Indonesia, then we must do now with money and deeds do words are not enough.</seg>
<seg id=1659>In my view, the report's important educational work on this point.</seg>
<seg id=1660>It is obvious that the problems of the country not overnight to overcome.</seg>
<seg id=1661>Protection of the financial interests of the Communities</seg>
<seg id=1662>The obstacles to its independent work, especially in the personalrekrutierung and in its structural development, must finally be removed.</seg>
<seg id=1663>The Commission must therefore by an internal reform process finally wahrmachen your announcement that fraud cannot be tolerated any fraud and consistently pursued.</seg>
<seg id=1664>I think that that is what should actually be the consequence of Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1665>We welcome the negotiations between the Member States on the approximation of the laws in the field of crime, but we would like our countries no federal EU accuse prosecution authority.</seg>
<seg id=1666>Furthermore, I would like to know why the publication of the document from the Commission on this issue until one day after the Danish referendum on the euro has been delayed.</seg>
<seg id=1667>I have asked for these countries, in particular aufzuführen because I think that it is time that you have to exist.</seg>
<seg id=1668>In fact I am sure that even OLAF is interested, the choice of higher managers to make transparent.</seg>
<seg id=1669>However, we must be careful that we do all the concentration on the problems of the Commission not our own, but at least it quite considerable problems overlooked; we also have problems.</seg>
<seg id=1670>We are trying to extinguish the fire and stifle it the smoke.</seg>
<seg id=1671>No one can understand that, I also not.</seg>
<seg id=1672>This objective will be achieved in every respect, I would like to focus on four points which, in my opinion, a crucial role in the work of the haushaltskontrollbehörde play.</seg>
<seg id=1673>For Parliament itself is the problem with the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1674>It is true dubious, if the Commission, Commissioner, as the guardian of the Treaties, respect for the rights of Members must be explicitly out.</seg>
<seg id=1675>He has the opportunity, for a certain period no mittelüberweisungen concerning the budget lines in question to approve, in particular, are on the increase in the budget allocated funds designed to further investigations have been completed it can even the President of the Commission to ask the Commissioners to demand the resignation of the environment in which serious problems were identified - a kind of EU kaiserschnitt.</seg>
<seg id=1676>The report calls for the detailed bestandsaufnahmen operational activities, a thorough review of budget lines and irregularities and kommissionsinterne leistungsbewertung.</seg>
<seg id=1677>Commissioner, the starting point of the transmission of information to the European Parliament is not the EC Treaty and the Interinstitutional Agreement.</seg>
<seg id=1678>The result of this common position, but it would be if it is not changed, that we would end up not only in relation to North America no level playing field, but not even within Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1679>I do not know why it should not succeed in this, as all the other directives have been able, at the end of the compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1680>It is a proposal which, I am afraid, a long and stormy long way has, to some of the difficulties to be overcome.</seg>
<seg id=1681>The first amendment concerns Article 4, in which the issue of the competent supervisory authority for the offer is regulated.</seg>
<seg id=1682>However, the proposal before us now would create confusion and a search for the best each court and potential rechtsstreite during the adoption of a company in a very delicate time give rise.</seg>
<seg id=1683>In the United Kingdom, the takeovers übernahmeausschuss prescribed by the voluntary code of conduct well worth. It is a good example of how, with a very complex matter, for which legislation less suitable, pragmatic can be handled.</seg>
<seg id=1684>Far more important, however, is that we have to be formulated in Lisbon, should be the task of creating a dynamic European economy competitive.</seg>
<seg id=1685>It is for us in the European Parliament, therefore, the major spannungsfelder übernahmerecht in, for example on board versus shareholders, to versus small shareholders, businesses, in a European capital market versus mindestform to regulate.</seg>
<seg id=1686>A number of amendments tabled by Parliament, the text of the Council's common position, by improvements to the points which could lead to interpretation, out of a speedier implementation of the directive calls for.</seg>
<seg id=1687>Indeed, it is not clear that the proposed definition of an equitable price is better than another, because the various currently in force in the Member States definitions are all very significant.</seg>
<seg id=1688>. The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1689>In addition, the artists a auskunftsrecht granted its claims, within a period of up to three years in a professional art dealers to find out what is useful, because they are buying and book sales on hold.</seg>
<seg id=1690>Therefore, the Austrian legislation is needed and not the European legislator attack, the only the auction houses for artists and positive framework creates.</seg>
<seg id=1691>In addition, the issue we are dealing with, the need for a common position is all the greater, because only such as the European Union, which will enable, at international level to ensure that the interests of artists worldwide are protected.</seg>
<seg id=1692>I trust in the wisdom of this House and the weitsichtigkeit.</seg>
<seg id=1693>In 1998, only benefited Germany 274 by 7 000 artists, whose rights were ceded to the resale rights, with 40% of the amount of administrative costs and erhebungs accounted.</seg>
<seg id=1694>In short, there is absolutely no need for harmonisation in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1695>A similar amendment at first reading was already been rejected.</seg>
<seg id=1696>It is assumed that the translations, despite this right and difficult gedrängten terminplans nachgereicht could be.</seg>
<seg id=1697>As we are only now that we are, unfortunately, this can no longer be put off.</seg>
<seg id=1698>We have proposed in committee, this a year earlier to do.</seg>
<seg id=1699>By their very nature this Parliament supported these values and it will continue to defend.</seg>
<seg id=1700>Because of the technological developments and changes in the markets will inevitably a take place.</seg>
<seg id=1701>Since we cannot rechtsgrund to find as competition.</seg>
<seg id=1702>The reduction of the kernstücks the postal sector, that is, the universal service, and the transport of letters to the weight limit of 50 g for national postal operators would seriously run the risk of heraufbeschwören, no universal service at a reasonable price for the entire population in all the regions more secure.</seg>
<seg id=1703>I and my colleagues from the Conservatives in this House to the mess, remind you that in the UK, the British Post Office anrichteten when they wanted to privatisation.</seg>
<seg id=1704>From the safety net for postal service, we have a hängematte for these large companies, the rest of the postal service is and will continue to do what you can still be allowed.</seg>
<seg id=1705>I am very pleased with this result, because it is the concept of special services for the new technologies in the field of universal service to exclude.</seg>
<seg id=1706>Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, we can and will not tolerate this.</seg>
<seg id=1707>The European Commission is therefore for the second stage, not the full liberalisation of the postal services.</seg>
<seg id=1708>I would also like to see such a future for other countries of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1709>Mr Bolkestein has recently in the Dutch press the French an illiberal attitude accused, was at least a newspaper article betitelt.</seg>
<seg id=1710>I could say that Spain, such a fund set up and has taken up, in other words, it could be the uncertain legal bases of the fund, to the criteria of its composition and the virtual ermessensentscheidungen in its application.</seg>
<seg id=1711>We shall vote tomorrow will, I hope, for the amendment by Mr Atkins or by Mr Sterckx, because otherwise I would have led me to vote against this report.</seg>
<seg id=1712>Royal Mail is involved and competition in this same my letters in Malmö, Sweden.</seg>
<seg id=1713>What did we do from the debate or, rather, the controversy over the learned, Commissioner Bolkestein, with its follow-up of the liberalisation of postal services in the absence of any assessment of the first phase and in violation of the rules provided for in this directive has caused? we have learned that, under cover of progressive and aufwertender concepts such as liberalisation and modernisation of the technology boom of the dismantling of social quality of a country can hide.</seg>
<seg id=1714>The protection of the universal service provided by setting up a compensation fund, private operators on the contributions to the financing of the universaldienstpflichten postanbieter in remote areas, will not be easy to do was to be.</seg>
<seg id=1715>These shortcomings and these delays have also contributed to the debate, for the purpose and often be confused with each other.</seg>
<seg id=1716>Madam President, in addressing this issue we are talking about the economic and social cohesion.</seg>
<seg id=1717>Madam President, allow me first of all, the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, to congratulate him, because, of course, a complicated and difficult work carried out, in which he had to seek a balance between the different proposals, attitudes and destination and zielpunkten.</seg>
<seg id=1718>I am afraid that the result will be that the current monopolies its position at the taxpayers' expense and to further consolidate the latte neuanbieter for something still higher should.</seg>
<seg id=1719>I am pleased that our Liberal party from the other European countries the position of the British liberal support.</seg>
<seg id=1720>I believe that the liberalisation of the desirable and welcome the advantages for consumers, who will arise.</seg>
<seg id=1721>Justified because it is in the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union einfügt, the completion of the internal market, the free movement of goods and services in a wettbewerbsbestimmten environment in give priority.</seg>
<seg id=1722>The provision of a service is the cornerstone of the Community policy in this field, and all our activities are focused on the improvement of this service.</seg>
<seg id=1723>The special services are another important area in which promote the modernisation and innovation must be pursued.</seg>
<seg id=1724>He also said that he is practically the whole postal market opening up until the end of this decade for inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=1725>I am to ensure that the obligation to provide a universal service and unumstößlich enshrined in the future too, be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id=1726>For this reason, and I will not stand idly by when the future of this sector is at stake, because we are the tasks which we are all in Lisbon to were not properly fulfil.</seg>
<seg id=1727>Thank you, Mr Simpson.</seg>
<seg id=1728>I would remind you, however, that the primary objective of the common market organisation is a zugangsgarantie their products to the Community market.</seg>
<seg id=1729>I am pleased that we have been able to achieve unanimity in the Committee on Agriculture, and for that I thank my colleagues, and Mr Fernández Martín, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, for their support.</seg>
<seg id=1730>For example, we have to continue our concern about the banana production in ACP countries, in particular the small producer countries in the West Indies and in some countries in West Africa, to express the traditional lieferländer on the banana market, and to whom we have obligations, we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id=1731>I would therefore ask you to ensure that this report in its entirety, just as the Agriculture Committee, will be supported by the Members of this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1732>The United States were the historical reference periods was rejected, in the meantime, however, a solution with its own historical referenzzeiträumen advocates.</seg>
<seg id=1733>Strong interests, particularly those of the Americans, which are not even bananenanbauer, but the American capital in the commercial have set to play a role.</seg>
<seg id=1734>Sometimes, it seems as if the Commission in the proposals for the deregulation of trade in agricultural production and at international level even further away than the Cairns Group.</seg>
<seg id=1735>Unfortunately, the Commission and the Council to insist on a solution to this seriously jeopardise production, particularly after 2006.</seg>
<seg id=1736>In the various WTO decisions, not to say that we must not give our traditional lieferländern preferences.</seg>
<seg id=1737>The transitional period should therefore around fifteen years at least ten years, but it is also a need for compensatory einkommensgarantie for Community producers and the supply of production in the outermost regions, which include, therefore, also help for the institutions which are grown bananas marketed.</seg>
<seg id=1738>I hope that you will now listen to our arguments, because the system proposed by the Commission of preference, even if it is set at EUR 300, could, in fact, rather than be ineffective because the ACP producers by the so-called first ausgebremst.</seg>
<seg id=1739>VOTE</seg>
<seg id=1740>(Parliament approved the proposal by the Commission).</seg>
<seg id=1741>The Commission cannot accept the other amendments as from.</seg>
<seg id=1742>, before the vote:</seg>
<seg id=1743>(Parliament adopted the oral amendment) to.</seg>
<seg id=1744>Report (A5 0383 / 2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the reform of institutions and (2000 / 2008 (INI)]</seg>
<seg id=1745>Most smokers are neither on the full risk, on the consequences of their activities in clear.</seg>
<seg id=1746>Do I have in my long parliamentary life from now 35 years always kept.</seg>
<seg id=1747>However, I fear that this is in vain hope.</seg>
<seg id=1748>This is our last attempt, by means of labels and photographs on cigarette packets, the actual consequences of smoking to clear.</seg>
<seg id=1749>Mr Lehne report (A5-0368 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1750>This is a view which I still think is correct for relevant and Accordingly, I have voted against the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=1751>The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is quite right when he, on the rejection of the maximum and minimum insists on a, not by 7%.</seg>
<seg id=1752>It was my Group would vote against this directive, a political achtungszeichen, because, as we in the European Union, must not to stop superfluous provisions to be enacted.</seg>
<seg id=1753>Of course, the former Stalinist dictatorship must be condemned, but how can you, Mr Putin, even the slightest confidence that this executioners of the Chechen people, this godfathers of various mafias, that the head of State, any opposition and civil society, trade unions and political parties would eliminate), in order to strengthen its own power?</seg>
<seg id=1754>In fact, Indonesia is a strengthening of the relations not particularly deserve, because over the past few years, the leaders of the country, not just by a high degree of democracy or dahingehende by great merit, but we must also bear in mind the Indonesian people, and that is why we have this intensification of relations and welcome this aid.</seg>
<seg id=1755>This unit we only have to deal with crimes by the EU employees been committed.</seg>
<seg id=1756>- (FR) The Theato report on the fight against fraud will enable us to note that the European Central Bank is certainly the famous better proof of its independence, accession to the agreement on the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has not considered appropriate.</seg>
<seg id=1757>That concludes the vote.</seg>
<seg id=1758>We must realise that there are only two options: either we are to, or we do not belong to.</seg>
<seg id=1759>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, give us no reason for a namensänderung.</seg>
<seg id=1760>The mere customs system, but it is an important element for the balance of the Commission proposal is concerned, this is an important basis for, so that we can make any progress at all in the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1761>Measures for the marketing of these bananas are also in the national and regional programmes to promote the development of rural areas.</seg>
<seg id=1762>Europe and the United States work in defence of our common values and closely.</seg>
<seg id=1763>We will probably also have a new WTO round, and on the effects of the many new bilateral trade initiatives in this round, which is currently being discussed in the American hemisphere.</seg>
<seg id=1764>He pointed out that the transatlantic relationship in the last ten years has been considerably extended and that the Americans, in particular, the efforts of President Clinton is due to. But I think that, in the history books one day it will be noted that these new relations between Europe and also with the 1990 transatlantic declaration and the transatlantic agenda under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995, a very important contribution to the relevant part of the success of these relations.</seg>
<seg id=1765>Therefore, it will be a umsteuerung and through a transatlantic agenda for the year 2001 to the letter.</seg>
<seg id=1766>I would like to conclude by saying to the representatives of the Dominican Republic quote: "the WTO arbitration was an impartial should be to ensure that the common rules are complied with and that the countries which are familiar with the free trade can do.</seg>
<seg id=1767>Secondly, we are on the decline of communist hochstapelei pleased, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union is only one superpower left, namely the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1768>I know he is very successful and constructive dialogue with Parliament and the committees to promote the in these issues are involved.</seg>
<seg id=1769>The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:</seg>
<seg id=1770>These objectives, the primary and secondary objectives, which will be the test in which the specific proposals put forward by the Commission must be assessed.</seg>
<seg id=1771>As you know, this is a solution - up in only one country, with the possibility of the provision of services in the Union as a whole - an avalanche in those countries with a lower taxation lead.</seg>
<seg id=1772>This was true of the standard rate did not fall below 15%, but the Member States were given the right to one or more rates of no less than 5% to be applied, in this case there is now provided for derogations.</seg>
<seg id=1773>We asked the European Commission to monitor in order to ensure that no market distortion there and that the Council and Parliament to be informed.</seg>
<seg id=1774>In short, the aim of this proposal is correct, but the intergovernmental method is wrong designed, and if we really want to support the electronic Europe ’ s economy, it would be a VAT e and our own companies and not the attempt to our problems on the other, to give the right signal.</seg>
<seg id=1775>This calls for a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, we must be able to meet all kinds of measures to reduce its measures.</seg>
<seg id=1776>The only case where a tax levied not yet, is, if the from a third country in the European Community is delivered.</seg>
<seg id=1777>The positive discrimination of air transport must be ended.</seg>
<seg id=1778>Companies from third countries, will not be taxed at.</seg>
<seg id=1779>CDs are not very altertümlich, but should be taxed, while available on the Internet programmes are to be exempted from tax.</seg>
<seg id=1780>However, as the solution being proposed is not technically feasible and as a barrier to the development of the Internet transactions in the European Union in the future, even though all their herbeisehnen expansion.</seg>
<seg id=1781>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax and of the European Union will lose the ergiebigkeit toothless.</seg>
<seg id=1782>We should ausdenken options as to how we can promote the e-commerce and we have no new methods einfallen let him tax, as we can.</seg>
<seg id=1783>The Liberals support the principle of 'state' as little as possible, with the United States, for example, be mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=1784>The Primarolo has the simple rules, which will have to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id=1785>The objection is that of my group in this Parliament 's opinion that the fact that should be corrected in the newspapers normally benefit from the reduced VAT rates, while reducing the digital newspapers is not applicable.</seg>
<seg id=1786>A tax on kerosene, it can therefore only in international consensus, in order to guarantee wettbewerbsgleichheit.</seg>
<seg id=1787>I particularly welcome the fact that the report of one of the most important to me in my report for the Committee on Transport and Tourism has underpinned the statements made in this Parliament a few months ago, was in favour - and that is that we, as long as there is no doubt that it is politically difficult to an international agreement on the taxation of fuel to come, at least in the short term, should examine alternative instruments in order to achieve the same effect, including a emissionsabgabe.</seg>
<seg id=1788>In fact, the industry to 100% by and for their flugsicherungsabgaben airport infrastructure in 1998, which amounted to USD 4 billion - in contrast to other modes of transport such as rail and road transport, which is still heavily subsidised.</seg>
<seg id=1789>The current situation is detrimental.</seg>
<seg id=1790>In this connection, we must unfortunately note that there is a problem with the emissions from aviation, even if it is not so great in percentage terms, but it is a very great, and that is why we should not be kleinreden.</seg>
<seg id=1791>This is a plan for the development of SMEs both inside and outside the European Union be harmful, particularly in the light of the proposed reduction of the threshold for an exemption from the tax on an unacceptable low level of annual turnover of 40 000.</seg>
<seg id=1792>If we are to be dealt with in the question of beflissen are at risk, we really important for Europe of the future of electronic commerce.</seg>
<seg id=1793>That is the starting point of a providers of services with its headquarters in a third country, in terms of a customer in the Community, only provides, in terms of a single register of need, must not lead to a transfer of tax revenues between Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1794>Since the discussion in the Council is still under way and, among other things, in the light of the Commission, the issue of VAT bestrebens and electronic commerce in the short term to a successful conclusion, it seems to me to be the best, the amendments proposed by Parliament have not yet been formally to accept, but to try to you during the discussions in the Council, as far as possible, be through.</seg>
<seg id=1795>That is why I cannot accept the proposed amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1796>Thank you very much for that it is this week, all these issues have been different.</seg>
<seg id=1797>The Commission, for its part, has only three months after the accident and its responsibility exercised a first package of measures adopted by the European Parliament on 30 November fully confirmed.</seg>
<seg id=1798>In fact, it is of more than fifteen current directives or regulations, there is an urgent need to harmonise the practices and greater control of the application of the standards in order to carry out the necessary and unacceptable to considerable differences in the area of maritime safety in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1799>Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs de Palacio for her sustained commitment in the area of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1800>Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that, at the level of safety in the air transport sector in the European area and in the field of the USA applied in other countries with no compensation amounts are applied.</seg>
<seg id=1801>Secondly, I would like to say that it is the French courts, which would have the opportunity, by means of a specific society to confiscate or freeze to compensation for damage to pay, or else the liability, which would lay down on the amount of the objective criteria, beyond the current international rules on pollution mineral oils is envisaged.</seg>
<seg id=1802>The Commission is of the opinion that these steps in the right direction and to create a fairer abgabensysteme lead, incentives for a more rational and efficient use of the road network.</seg>
<seg id=1803>In the light of criticism, especially from Ireland and France, it was then, this amendment will be, and now the matter by the British Chancellor an entirely new phrase: it will now than verbraucherabgabe for all, including the British lorry drivers, presented.</seg>
<seg id=1804>I am obliged to ensuring that the food available to consumers, whether they are from the European Union or from outside, the highest requirements.</seg>
<seg id=1805>Of course, I understand the concern of the honourable Member.</seg>
<seg id=1806>Commissioner, I have to say that I am, unfortunately, your reply is not enough.</seg>
<seg id=1807>The raised by the honourable Member point is very important.</seg>
<seg id=1808>In Nigeria, Chevron of ethnic ijaw the accused, to use violence against the people and even angestiftet Nigerian soldiers to have paid, demonstrators at the naval base to Warri beschießen.</seg>
<seg id=1809>In her report adopted on 15 November, the Commission came to the conclusion that the operating under Regulation 1540 / 98 no solution to the problem of the South Korean preispraktiken could be found.</seg>
<seg id=1810>I believe that the intentions in its entirety is very reassuring, but the reality is that our shipyards that now rule.</seg>
<seg id=1811>Question No 38 by (. H-0868 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1812>Commissioner, I can understand that you do not wish to change its decision, although ten Member States reject such a customs.</seg>
<seg id=1813>This initiative is based on a Council regulation amending regulation, which lays down that the current GSP.</seg>
<seg id=1814>I represent several beet and so I am, in fact, very concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1815>This work is taking place in committee, and this week, as had to be Poul Nielson on a balkanreise now.</seg>
<seg id=1816>We are just at the safeguard clause, and if Mr Clegg arguments in favour of dialogue with its zuckerrübenanbauern needs, it is time to ask me.</seg>
<seg id=1817>I should like to thank Mr Liikanen for a in all respects, good and very positive reply.</seg>
<seg id=1818>I will discuss this matter with my services, as soon as the question of the budget for next year is clarified.</seg>
<seg id=1819>My services and myself are currently endeavouring to put out of the geographical distance between prozessparteien and the future Court resulting consequences to limit.</seg>
<seg id=1820>In exactly the way in which the courts in Düsseldorf, Munich and elsewhere in Germany to patent law have specialised - and there is also such a specialised courts in London -, should also be a legal community, and it meets cases to decide the patents relating to very specialised.</seg>
<seg id=1821>So that such a provisional situation not verstetigt, has the Commission in a letter of 13 July last year in the Member States of their duty to remember, national courts to appoint.</seg>
<seg id=1822>As the honourable Member knows, has the right to submit a complaint in itself no impact on the progress of the project.</seg>
<seg id=1823>Question No 47 by (h 0877 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1824>The Commission will, therefore, of the appeal at its disposal only in the laid down in the regulation to make use of.</seg>
<seg id=1825>The question is, however, to whom the students apply in order to be able to make sure that the students this studiengangs and be completed in Britain them the right to recognition of their studienergebnisse gives.</seg>
<seg id=1826>The temporary King could, for example one of the verdienstvollsten Finnish Members of Parliament to be elected.</seg>
<seg id=1827>All of this can also be seen as a wettbewerbsfrage, as in the southern Baltic Sea fallen by the wayside, Stockholm and Helsinki, the tax free sale is allowed to continue, whilst between Umeå and Vasa is banned.</seg>
<seg id=1828>We have to ensure that this situation is through the promotion and support to multilingual content, because this for the success of the European inhaltsindustrie is absolutely crucial.</seg>
<seg id=1829>I am talking in particular about the problem that small businesses investors is not always sufficient guarantees and to present a sound business development point.</seg>
<seg id=1830>To achieve this ambitious undertaking European eContent programme to a successful conclusion to the planned and simplified procedures must be safeguarded.</seg>
<seg id=1831>That is why it must be the objective of public support for EU inhaltsindustrie be a high level of education and a cultural diversity.</seg>
<seg id=1832>On the other hand, there is the communications to the content, they need for their virtual area inexorably to fill it, in turn, are, of course, the content of this subject, and in particular they buy up without regard for the produktionsregeln.</seg>
<seg id=1833>Mr President, I welcome this programme, eContent, and would draw your attention to two points.</seg>
<seg id=1834>I therefore support the amendments in which the implementation of specific measures in the field of new technologies calls for.</seg>
<seg id=1835>Firstly, the social and cultural function of the digital content here: the Commission is pleased that Parliament, the social and cultural aspect of digital content it.</seg>
<seg id=1836>Evaluation and against of environmental noise</seg>
<seg id=1837>In fact, I am grateful for the fact that the Christian Democrats, and also some of the liberal group that a specific amendment, the aircraft noise caused by now to limit their support.</seg>
<seg id=1838>Now six years later, and to press for stetes the French Government, the Commission has presented its proposal for European harmonised noise indicators.</seg>
<seg id=1839>This is a modest proposal. In the Scandinavian countries are already stricter standards than they are being proposed for the year 2012.</seg>
<seg id=1840>Orly shiphol, Barcelona, and other airports which already meet rigorous standards.</seg>
<seg id=1841>Another important point, which was tabled by us, and in connection with the issue of noise will be important, is that, along with the rapporteur that there should be additional noise indicators noise indicators.</seg>
<seg id=1842>There are no common rules in the European Union, there is an obvious unfair competition between airports and ungleichbehandelung to citizens of the different Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1843>That is why the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange my it is so important.</seg>
<seg id=1844>Mr President, first, I must say that I welcome this report.</seg>
<seg id=1845>This was, in principle, the idea of Amendment No 36, although I believe that this idea is not finally invented.</seg>
<seg id=1846>That is something we should consider very carefully and then on two levels, combined approach to limit values for the various sources and, on the other hand, quality standards for emissions.</seg>
<seg id=1847>We need more time, and I regret that we did not have this, even if I generally support the framework directive.</seg>
<seg id=1848>Once the Member States have comparable data submitted by the Commission on the issue of gemeinschaftsgrenzwerte and other measures be, in order to reduce noise, and will then report to the Council and Parliament about this report.</seg>
<seg id=1849>Food additives other than colours and sweeteners</seg>
<seg id=1850>These are the three criteria.</seg>
<seg id=1851>Thank you very much, Mr; my concern is similar: they have a dry mouth, and I have a frog neck in, as we are concerned here with us, but a little about the flu.</seg>
<seg id=1852>Chronic nutrition, furthermore, the increase cancer.</seg>
<seg id=1853>This, then, that the Commission did not have the right tools to take appropriate measures.</seg>
<seg id=1854>Tomorrow, before the next stage in the plan. Then in Mrs Paulsen by the ELDR and is in the saddle the possibility of the directive even further nachzubessern.</seg>
<seg id=1855>The Member States and the Commission is a better instrument available to ensure that the rules for animal nutrition are properly implemented and the defence of a rapid response to emergencies in third countries is possible.</seg>
<seg id=1856>We know that the majority of Europeans live in cities, and so far, in particular, these issues stiefmütterlich been dealt with.</seg>
<seg id=1857>The planning must be honest and innovative be implemented.</seg>
<seg id=1858>The multiannual programme (2000-2004) for sustainable urban development is a suitable instrument for the implementation of Agenda 21, and is an excellent means of coordination and implementation of actions and.</seg>
<seg id=1859>Less transport and of abandoning fossil fuels at local level are essential if we are to change in the current klimabedrohung want to achieve.</seg>
<seg id=1860>Many have meant that the financial framework is too small.</seg>
<seg id=1861>Hauptpartner, within this framework, however, the Commission and the networks of the local authorities, for the preparation and the implementation of the measures in the area of sustainable urban development legally responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1862>The Court of Justice of the European Communities and even the streitbeilegungsgremien of the WTO are of the opinion that the precautionary principle in the field of the environment or in the field of public health, to be applied to vereinzelt even against the people of Europe, such as the unresolved procedure for rohmilchkäse shows.</seg>
<seg id=1863>Not harm reduction or compensation, the aim must be the ultimate goal must be to damage to the health of the people or property and possessions.</seg>
<seg id=1864>After all, back in 1996 advocated by the European Parliament in accordance with the precautionary principle a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in the whole of the European Union - but only if...</seg>
<seg id=1865>Absolute scientific safety on new substances or products, there is not and never will be.</seg>
<seg id=1866>If the precautionary principle to be applied effectively and credibly, after all, it is important that all hauptbeteiligten, representatives of civil society, in the political decisions in the framework of the application of the principle to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id=1867>And finally, public health and the environment in other considerations, particularly economic, the priority.</seg>
<seg id=1868>The requirement for recourse to the precautionary principle is that the concern that it could happen harmful effects, is scientifically justified.</seg>
<seg id=1869>Only yesterday, an American professor George Carlo, the Food and Drugs Administration in the last seven years, with a study on the effects of radiation on human health asked, in Lisbon, we were informed that the risk is that the use of mobile phones, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and by hirntumoren hautschäden increases.</seg>
<seg id=1870>Mr President, the environment and public health are like a complex machine with many functions which we monitor and control in order to be able to intervene, so that no unheil happens.</seg>
<seg id=1871>In the application of this principle must in any case, be prevented the innovation and economic activity gehemmt that it to show restraint and stagnation in the industry, and that the competition will be circumvented.</seg>
<seg id=1872>Parliament will not have escaped the fact that the Commission with most of the issues raised in your resolution agrees.</seg>
<seg id=1873>The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=1874>In Article 2, the right to life, and whenever there is the terrorism in Spain lives, has been the whole of the European Union in one of its most important principles are violated.</seg>
<seg id=1875>We want to see created legal institutions, not replace it, but this our rights and our freedoms, not to protect the terror yield.</seg>
<seg id=1876>VOTE</seg>
<seg id=1877>It has in mind the comments of the Council on the classification of vorruhestandsprojekts lines on the subject of the Commission and of the administrative expenditure in connection with the fisheries agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1878>(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution).</seg>
<seg id=1879>I believe that this is no longer timely!</seg>
<seg id=1880>These are only 23 428 far too little, as you see, the necessary growth possibilities but welcome.</seg>
<seg id=1881>This will wipe out in the middle of last year was effectively, led, as anticipated by us - to a dramatic slowing the approval of the project and the implementation of payments, the result was the annual implementation of appropriations under this fund at the end of June 2000 on one point.</seg>
<seg id=1882>This text is an ideal carte blanche for a practical closure of the General Secretariat of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id=1883>Before I left you said to me: "Christmas is just around the corner and we celebrate Christmas in Bergamo, and that is that the St Lucia.</seg>
<seg id=1884>Our vehemente also criticism is directed against the overproduction of agricultural products, as well as opposed to the EU information channels, in order to sell this surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1885>Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil on the tax treatment of services electronically erbrachter voted.</seg>
<seg id=1886>Mr President, I shall try to the before 2004, with a few statements on Malta to remedy.</seg>
<seg id=1887>I would, however, with a certain solemnity say that this is possible, which was what I can accept, in a Europe that is too liberal in my view.</seg>
<seg id=1888>A fristsetzung will motivate the post, your services - and to modernise and facilitate the planning and investment.</seg>
<seg id=1889>They will continue to exert pressure, with the money that they are in the service of 150 above the border deserve to strengthen its position.</seg>
<seg id=1890>The liberalisation of postal services in the form proposed by the Commission is neither suitable nor consistent; that is why I voted in favour of the report and all the amendments put forward, which were voted in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1891>De Roo report (A5-0378 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1892>We have also opposed to Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31 our reservations, because we are not convinced that they are compatible with the rules of the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1893>Against a globalisation, the most basic human rights trample.</seg>
<seg id=1894>This would be in contradiction to respect for the national identity (Article 6 (3) of the Treaty on European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1895>It is worth emphasising that the lesser used by the globalisation of the Internet were not erdrückt, but it is a cultural and economic opening up new opportunities have found.</seg>
<seg id=1896>Mr President, in the absence of other results, the haggling in Nice at least the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union offengelegt.</seg>
<seg id=1897>The joint motion for a resolution underlying thrust is in this respect, too one-sided.</seg>
<seg id=1898>The delay in the publication of the written conclusions - which now, after four days - not yet officially available shows how difficult it is to the decisions of a general confusion, which have been clearly on paper.</seg>
<seg id=1899>The only way to avoid conflicts dangerous for the future, that is, with the traditional approach to Europe that remain in the national communities based on mutual respect.</seg>
<seg id=1900>The Nice Summit, on Sunday is with an agreement to an end, in a draft treaty will be.</seg>
<seg id=1901>The resolution put to the vote today reflects this does not reflect on Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1902>Finally, a comment on the social policy that France in the presentation of its presidency to tackle wanted to, it is now, in addition to the fine declarations of intent and vague in terms of documents, in the light of the problems and the great dissatisfaction by workers, as has been said so in Nice to be insufficient, and a handful of details are left.</seg>
<seg id=1903>The really important issues, such as taxation, taxation, social policy, asylum and immigration - is obviously all the old left.</seg>
<seg id=1904>Impressive in terms of the debate on Nice is the idea that the Treaty does not ultimately mother, father - he is nobody's child of the French Presidency has clearly not been issued excuses, the results of the Intergovernmental Conference and the reasons for this support.</seg>
<seg id=1905>On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies is now, because the right of veto will be further reduced and the European Parliament more power will.</seg>
<seg id=1906>It would have been the year in which I was born in 1944, therefore, the agreement of the predicted effects at this time, we would probably not be agreed, and by the other flugzeugbedarf fuel tax exemption.</seg>
<seg id=1907>One such thing as zero risk does not exist, because it is the scientists, or at least the politicians to apply the criterion of proportionality, uncertain risks and consider their responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id=1908>This Parliament has fought for this, but also that this innovative measures for the reduction in the resources available to it by the flexibilisierungsrahmens compensation would be held in a statement on the financial perspectives.</seg>
<seg id=1909>In this important area we must all play a part in this, because it really is a global market in which we now move to the new ideas, which are properly financed, pertinent and realistic underpins - to ensure that we in Europe have a seat at the top of the technical development in the new sectors and, in particular, in the technology can claim.</seg>
<seg id=1910>On the question of the budget in the previous speech here is already serious words have been said: EUR 400 million is in fact only a minimum for funding, and in the second half of the flexibility instrument must the opportunities for additional funding can be used, as the report was presented.</seg>
<seg id=1911>So I believe we have also, as the report does not automatically schlussfolgert, loss of European added value hand.</seg>
<seg id=1912>We all know that unemployment is the highest in the European Union in the economically and technologically less developed regions, especially in the Objective 1 regions, the innovative measures must not only technological nature, but we must also express will be borne by the economy and employment.</seg>
<seg id=1913>If I now return to my own region, after ostengland, I note that not a single and local authority over the last period this money, then, I doubt whether we have been so effectively in the future, as we have new communities, so that we can welcome.</seg>
<seg id=1914>Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Helmuth Markov for his extremely competent and constructive comments on the proposal for a communication on the innovative measures the ERDF for the period 2000-2006, and to pay tribute to him.</seg>
<seg id=1915>Energy efficiency and environmental aspects have their place in these guidelines, they can cause for innovative actions to the third issue, that of the regional development and sustainable development.</seg>
<seg id=1916>We would, however, that these projects are selected at regional level, as Mr Berend nous in his contribution has understood perfectly.</seg>
<seg id=1917>. The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1918>That is why we are calling for in this report and, in addition to the three amendments which have been tabled that the Commission's efforts, an international dispute settlement procedure before the WTO to be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id=1919>It seems to me that the Commissioner responsible for the industry needs to show that it is all to the external threat to our industry to deal with.</seg>
<seg id=1920>Lastly, we expect that the shipbuilding industry agreement at the meeting of the group of six of the OECD, on 18 December is discussed.</seg>
<seg id=1921>It is, however, later on, as will the endspurt always somewhat delayed, so that we never achieve the finishing line.</seg>
<seg id=1922>As you all know, is only the start of the procedure over six months to take up.</seg>
<seg id=1923>As for the large corporations for their political lawyers means the demand for less state intervention only that the state and its finances only available to them.</seg>
<seg id=1924>To this end, but simply in order to ensure that the shipbuilding industry and jobs in the sector and consolidated by the families dependent on security can be provided, that is, on 31 December 2000, aid is needed, because the market cannot be achieved by women, but by dumping and unfair competition marked.</seg>
<seg id=1925>To improve the competitiveness of the EU shipyards will be promoted by the Commission, but in view of the massive preisunterbietung by the Korean shipyards is not sufficiently produktivitätsfortschritt achievable.</seg>
<seg id=1926>The Council also underlined that this mechanism does not distort competition within the EU we.</seg>
<seg id=1927>The presence of the submarine havarierten in the waters of the Bay of Algeciras, unfortunately, has now become a diplomatic conflict between military nuclear and colonial power and a Member State, as the last category 2 classification, Nice is extended, the rights of its demands, and prevents infantilen statements.</seg>
<seg id=1928>As a doctor, through the report of the country's besitzers - in other words, by the British press, the seriousness of the spread of the disease became known, was not transfer hospital in another, but to a change in the classification of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id=1929>Of course we await with interest the reply of the Commission, to see whether the objective has been achieved.</seg>
<seg id=1930>Mr President, I too would like to start with the families of the murdered gemeinderats and the members of the European People's Party my condolences and my horror at this fascist barbarity of ETA and its accomplices express.</seg>
<seg id=1931>I also consider it advisable to the submarine Tireless as soon as possible, as soon as the relevant climatic conditions are to be transferred to the United Kingdom, to repair.</seg>
<seg id=1932>The honourable Member has asked whether the Commission believes that the Directive 89 / 618 / Euratom on informing the population in a radiological notstandssituation and the Directive 96 / 29 / Euratom laying down basic safety standards in terms of the submarine are applicable and therefore what steps have been taken.</seg>
<seg id=1933>We are in the context of the usual beschwerdeverfahrens not entitled to answer to the general public, although we will be able to say what it says.</seg>
<seg id=1934>There is one aspect of the Euratom Treaty, that is the transport of waste kontaminierter between the Member States of the European Union in Gibraltar, however, the United Kingdom, and would be contaminated waste from one part of the United Kingdom in another part of the country, without moved to another Member State of the European Union to happen.</seg>
<seg id=1935>Spain needs only to the confidence of the people on the rocks to win.</seg>
<seg id=1936>Here we have a Member State, with the public in another Member State, as it deals with any other country in the world would as if it is 50 years after the start of European integration, as there would be no affectio societatis for European solidarity to whether or not the slightest progress had been made.</seg>
<seg id=1937>In fact operierte British waters at a particular time the only a German submarine.</seg>
<seg id=1938>There will be discussed, but the citizens are aware of your attention intuitively or to the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1939>Because of the cuts that the Labour government in the defence budgets have been made, there are fewer resources available to the acquisition of new military equipment, so that in future is to be strengthened in cases where defects technology for necessary repairs to be decommissioned.</seg>
<seg id=1940>The competence of the Community - and how much is it perhaps also some very different wishes - covers, however, neither on the classification of ports to carry out repairs, submarines, on the question of technical safety of nuclear reactors, or claims that a submarine to repair and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id=1941>In order to be able to help them better, should be the Community institutions to call upon the financial, human and material resources of the UNHCR increase.</seg>
<seg id=1942>I call on the Commission to financial aid for the UNHCR, and increase in all its agreement with the NGOs the UNHCR has always been koordinierungsorgan expel.</seg>
<seg id=1943>It must therefore have access to the civilian casualties and his team, on the ground must be safe and to bring about the necessary resources to fulfil its mission.</seg>
<seg id=1944>On 22 November, the Commission adopted a communication on the common asylum procedure and uniform status recognised throughout the asylum seekers, as laid down in Tampere - that is the ultimate objective of the common European asylum system.</seg>
<seg id=1945>Finally, I would like my respect for all the work which Mrs Ogata bezeigen for the UNHCR has been done and Mr Ruud Lubbers every success in his new position.</seg>
<seg id=1946>We think it is important for the restoration of a political amnesty in Yugoslavia to press, but also in our view, it is essential that we return to the terrorist attacks and the border between Kosovo and Serbia, Albania, very clearly condemn this worrying because, in the form of the events in Kosovo, where the Western powers and responsibilities contributed.</seg>
<seg id=1947>The paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, of kompromissentschließungsantrags contain clear demands.</seg>
<seg id=1948>I also appeal to the Commissioner to investigate what President Kostunica, with people like Mr Ukshin Hoti has happened, with whose fate we repeatedly have worked, and of whose fate we know nothing.</seg>
<seg id=1949>I can also accept the call to the KFOR, to prevent further attacks in the Presevo Valley.</seg>
<seg id=1950>I welcome the now from the KFOR taken steps to deal with the problem and I call on all parties to continue to urge, to exercise restraint.</seg>
<seg id=1951>B5 0916 / 2000 by Mr Barón Crespo and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1952>This clause was decided on in March 1990 Moneda palace. I know that it is precisely because I had the privilege, in the office of President Aylwin plebiszit according to which the regime of General Pinochet set an end to be here.</seg>
<seg id=1953>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say something to the resolution, for which, of course, we will vote.</seg>
<seg id=1954>Here the international community must exercise their right to democratic control, not as interference in the internal affairs of an independent country, but, as a political, umsichtiges and preventive action.</seg>
<seg id=1955>The situation in the prisons and the police stations, where, among other things, abuse and torture is the order of the day, in every sense is unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1956>This would correspond exactly the same treatment in Western Europe, and because of the protests, the Ministers hikmet Sami Turk delayed, so that the transfer in the whole of Turkey a social and political consensus on a gefängnisreform can be drawn up.</seg>
<seg id=1957>The question is much, and that is why we have agreed to this item on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1958>It is on 8 January of next year the process put it, he raises a number of Tunisian Assembly in opposition in France, but what he denies.</seg>
<seg id=1959>If the Members and officials of these associations on the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we will be holding a meeting their homes surrounded by police on the streets, and anyone who dares to men in civil attacked.</seg>
<seg id=1960>The second case is really only a part of a fabric of harassment.</seg>
<seg id=1961>My group, as well as this Parliament, is following the human rights situation in Tunisia and the rest of the world, with particular attention.</seg>
<seg id=1962>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, moderate, we ask a little.</seg>
<seg id=1963>The negotiations verliefen extremely well, and I am very pleased that we are making progress and I hope that the dialogue with the result that the honourable Member has raised.</seg>
<seg id=1964>Several Members mentioned the situation of the prisoners in Turkey in.</seg>
<seg id=1965>B5 0912 / 2000 by Mr Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1966>We should, in my opinion, not lag behind in this position.</seg>
<seg id=1967>In this context, the power of the military, which, as always, only contributed to exacerbating the situation.</seg>
<seg id=1968>This attitude is part of the continuity of the policy of French imperialism.</seg>
<seg id=1969>The Commission is also very concerned at the recent violence.</seg>
<seg id=1970>The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1971>Unfair competition is a good schiffbauklima destroy, know-how and the loss of jobs and lead in the long term, a monopoly situation in world trade, which is detrimental.</seg>
<seg id=1972>Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg id=1973>That is why I would like to thank all my colleagues for their cooperation, including the amendments, as well as the Committee of Experts, which have contributed significantly to the motion for a resolution under the umbrella and fach.</seg>
<seg id=1974>On the adoption of the social agenda by the European Council in Nice, we are very pleased, and we hope that the Member States, in order to seize this opportunity, social insurance and the way for the elderly - and, in order to better coordinate but also other measures, to ensure that their reintegration in active life, such as lifelong learning.</seg>
<seg id=1975>The promotion of lifelong learning a subject that has already been mentioned in the debate it is one thing, which I support.</seg>
<seg id=1976>People over 60 or 70 years, of course, many other useful things, but it is not right to their incomes, in this age of the work they have done to link.</seg>
<seg id=1977>The European Central Bank has in its monthly of July 2000 already warned urgently.</seg>
<seg id=1978>In my opinion, the Member States can the problem with the help of its legislative instruments more.</seg>
<seg id=1979>Thanks to your proposals for an active life in old age society is gaining a whole generation there.</seg>
<seg id=1980>The promises must be respected, but the pensions are with the resources to ensure that these countries, without having to pay the cost of the common monetary policy of the EU must be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id=1981>We have the greatest social revolution in the last 150 years been 100 by the age of us humans has been doubled.</seg>
<seg id=1982>It is only the accounting, the extension of the life of the medical progress made possible, make sense.</seg>
<seg id=1983>They could pay - which was so gesamtgesellschaft involved - But, for older workers, schieden younger workers have not been stopped, and there have been many positions deleted.</seg>
<seg id=1984>The family and the tax should, however, mean that men and women and the family, able to decide freely whether they want to be pension or not.</seg>
<seg id=1985>My brother and I accompanied him.</seg>
<seg id=1986>Future initiatives in the field of public health are more on health and pflegefragen age and on the promotion of healthy ageing.</seg>
<seg id=1987>(2), as well as Amendment No 3, which he advocates a change to the text and the use of the term "demographic development" instead of "the ageing of the population" calls on board.</seg>
<seg id=1988>It is not to overlap with the advertising and promotion of the inter-branch organisations and the authorities. The emphasis should be placed on these issues, such as.</seg>
<seg id=1989>Mr President, the Committee on Budgets also said that the Commission's proposal in principle favourably.</seg>
<seg id=1990>It is therefore very important, is to create a balance and the can by the absatzförderungs and advertising measures very well developed.</seg>
<seg id=1991>I believe that in the marketing of sales in the training, lifelong learning in the far more focus should be, because the new technologies, the handling of the promotion of a modern logistics entirely new opportunities.</seg>
<seg id=1992>First of all I would like to congratulate Mr Dary 'on his excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=1993>The next point is that, if we talk about export and intervention.</seg>
<seg id=1994>It must not be sonderzahlungen for not nachgefragte products and for those who have not been carried out.</seg>
<seg id=1995>Everyone has sufficient food, and if we are to promote a product, that is, of course, directed against the consumption of another product.</seg>
<seg id=1996>Amendments 18 and 24, first part, by the zeitabstände which the vorschlagsfähigen issues and products to be reviewed, from three years to two years to be reduced in order to improve the efficiency of förderungsinstruments.</seg>
<seg id=1997>In the Greek version, Mrs Jutta Haug, as rapporteur, therefore, as a man, Mr Markus Ferber, as rapporteur, and as a woman, so be it.</seg>
<seg id=1998>Here we see the way in which small changes in practice the great effects can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id=1999>It is for the time being the last Friday in Strasbourg, i.e. Strasbourg is losing 12 days of the presence of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=2000>Finally, I would like above all to the few, which it is worth, that on Friday, during the last session in Strasbourg in the year 2000 to be here, a happy holidays hope and a happy New Year, but, above all, wise.</seg>
