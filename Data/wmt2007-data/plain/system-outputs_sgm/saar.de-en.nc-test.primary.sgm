<SEG id="1"> After </SEG> 
<SEG id="2"> A common feature of the extreme right in Europe is their problems and the fact that the immigration as a political lever. </SEG> 
<SEG id="3"> The Lega Nord in Italy, the Vlaams block in the Netherlands, the supporters of Le Pen national front in France, are examples of parties and movements, which concerns the joint subject: refusal and demand a demand for them. </SEG> 
<SEG id="4"> As individuals and and Jean-Marie Le Pen and not to come and that, unfortunately, the problem from the European policy is not so soon disappear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="5"> And an ageing population and always open the European in the European countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="6"> The large parties of the right and the left that have put the problem, in which they head in the sand, contrary to all views and have it may soon disappear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="7"> That, however, it will not be, as the history of racism in Europe clearly shows. </SEG> 
<SEG id="8"> The links between the task, in the USA over decades - and still do today - in the centre of the political debate in this debate so far, as important as the income was - if not even more importantly, political attitudes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="9"> The first step in order to deal with the problem is, and to understand, even if this means, then if. </SEG> 
<SEG id="10"> Precisely in the USA, a large number of research plans, and sociology. researches these confidence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="11"> The House are less willing to support, as they do, with equal to certain racially divided societies., have less efficient governments more corruption and nepotism, more crime and less threshold values per dollar revenues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="12"> That does not mean that the response must be to remove the diversity and quality, but we must create the realities behind this question, a sound public policy in terms of the policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="13"> Of course there is no consensus about how to do it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="14"> Some, for minorities in the allocation of the technological and public contracts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="15"> These measures as a kind of compensation, which are known to help to overcome to overcome. </SEG> 
<SEG id="16"> Others reject such action and claim that there is only one in politics in connection with a free market, and a market for the minorities and to help to create jobs, and the need for. </SEG> 
<SEG id="17"> The latter is crucial for any policy, because one of the main causes of poverty in the USA is the dissemination of the single-parent parents (i.e. mothers) under the came. </SEG> 
<SEG id="18"> Despite the right answer to the question of how we should deal with the task with an outstanding job in politics. </SEG> 
<SEG id="19"> Of course, progress in the direction of better and better. </SEG> 
<SEG id="20"> In the 1950s were not allowed to take place, today we are two of the main players in the us authorities were. </SEG> 
<SEG id="21"> Nevertheless, one can be sure that place in America on the "as. </SEG> 
<SEG id="22"> Take the case of Patrick, the former assistant and who, in the last elections as independent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="23"> He recently published a book entitled: "the death of the West: the invasion of the invasion by". </SEG> 
<SEG id="24"> But for every book as this, there are two other with a serious analysis of the problem in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="25"> Political analyses and debates on the policy in Europe are lagging behind. </SEG> 
<SEG id="26"> The question is the question also closely in terms of the and the, and these problems and not only on the related social problems, and the opportunities which,. </SEG> 
<SEG id="27"> Of course a clear immigration is necessary in order to avoid the accumulation of illegal immigrants. </SEG> 
<SEG id="28"> But that is not all. controls at the border to Mexico is not everything, what the American policy to the problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="29"> Europe is rich and quickly; the perception of the leather industry more, "dirty work", we say in agriculture or in the welfare. </SEG> 
<SEG id="30"> That makes an immigration. </SEG> 
<SEG id="31"> We are, however, coming to us any mistakes in their policy on minorities and any indication of racism across the Atlantic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="32"> On reading the European States in often a question in relation to the United States: the Americans have problems with us; on the other hand, we are, from a few, of a couple of. </SEG> 
<SEG id="33"> In the last few weeks has shown that the rassenproblem in Europe of December until Amsterdam, to sit and - as in the USA - on the sad fact that are inherent to a difficult and that a built on trust and cooperative approach not easy on rassenschranken. </SEG> 
<SEG id="34"> If Europe great tensions, and in Europe to investigate and to understand and a ", if Europe as Le Pen as the gaps with their message of hatred in as at the university havard; Francesco giavazzi, for the wirtschaftswissenschaft at the hasses university in Milan, for the benefit of the wirtschaftsberater of President of the European Commission. </SEG> 
<SEG id="35"> The initiative which you! </SEG> 
<SEG id="36"> We in Europe today is rightly on enlargement and the Constitution, which is currently being drawn up between the Member States of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="37"> Yet, the result of some geplänkel galliens with the European Commission, the fate of the new and enlarged Europe where less serious. </SEG> 
<SEG id="38"> France has unilaterally decided to ignore the stability and growth Pact, as there is a deficit within the limit of 3% of GDP), adopted in buying. </SEG> 
<SEG id="39"> The French the likes, but if it is not, but separate asked. </SEG> 
<SEG id="40"> France was one of the leading critics of Ireland, as the Irish government in the year 2000, its budget surplus, then, with 4% of GDP, only verringerte% reduced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="41"> Other countries, but so is the first country with such contempt. </SEG> 
<SEG id="42"> However, something should surprise nobody. </SEG> 
<SEG id="43"> France, to which the EU regulations, namely its own culture be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="44"> For example, France, reforms of the common agricultural policy (a). </SEG> 
<SEG id="45"> As there was in the knowledge, means a considerable and completely present at the wealthy European (particularly French) - and indeed at the expense of the at the farmers in the developing countries and of consumers in the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="46"> Also tries to an old back, since private companies on the edge of the taxpayers' money to relieve. </SEG> 
<SEG id="47"> The Commissioner for competition, Mario Monti, must not lose this terrorism: it needs the support of those on the market and on the equal treatment of all faiths. </SEG> 
<SEG id="48"> In this case, the situation is very simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="49"> The French government does the company is to entsetzten, a company that has a number of high-tech goods under the TGV, the French hochgeschwindigkeitszeug, has developed, but when others. </SEG> 
<SEG id="50"> The French government claiming that they are left in their plans, Alstom, a plan with all the preservation of the preservation of jobs, the protection of investors, etc. </SEG> 
<SEG id="51"> Moreover, the French government, since it is concerned with the investigation,, investments, investments in R & d, good for growth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="52"> To save through, is very wrong. </SEG> 
<SEG id="53"> The company is in many different parts of some of the other, others: what we have to do is obvious, the company. </SEG> 
<SEG id="54"> The profitable parts, as the work will find should be closed, the works that are closed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="55"> The French taxpayers money is better for the support of the support of the for subsidies, in order to keep alive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="56"> It is important that the European Commission is not allowed in France, as the Commission apparently already with its obligations, special arrangements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="57"> The Commission must public aid to private companies in France, just as, as it has taken in any other EU Member State has to case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="58"> The Commission has already achieved some successes on this front, as everybody knows, Germany for public banks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="59"> In the particular case and in general should not make exceptions; they should at the same. </SEG> 
<SEG id="60"> If the Commission fails to act, the EU still more, as the French civil servants. </SEG> 
<SEG id="61"> France has already taken a leading role in the EU ’ s external policy, and more and more as the foreign Secretary, and also so. </SEG> 
<SEG id="62"> At the same time essential provisions of the common economic policy and the award of public aid to private companies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="63"> Does the European Commission that what is left is losing its credibility, and in the end? </SEG> 
<SEG id="64"> In the case of a defeat would have far-reaching consequences for Europe, and that not only for its competition policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="65"> The war around. </SEG> 
<SEG id="66"> For decades, has pursued a number of presidencies a range of goals to hold, namely the stable land as; the dependence of reducing imports, wherever possible, to ease; and in several countries of origin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="67"> Even if it seems to be under the Bush administration was no. </SEG> 
<SEG id="68"> Many observers believe that Bush have hit a new course, because the invasion in Iraq seems to run counter to these objectives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="69"> A large increase in the might of oil in relation to the other sources, because the population in the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="70"> This would be an increase in dependence on imported oil, particularly from the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="71"> The USA is, however, that the USA under the irony of the UN, that the USA, the UN and not Saddam Hussein that at the level of the specific) a greater control over the production control, as they will continue to do. </SEG> 
<SEG id="72"> If the Bush government, and of many cheap, then it would simply the embargo against countries such as Libya, Iran, Iraq, the oil. </SEG> 
<SEG id="73"> However, the American interest on Iraqi oil not of their economy or energy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="74"> The Bush that controls and, above all, a crucial geopolitical lever. </SEG> 
<SEG id="75"> Who, according to the rules. </SEG> 
<SEG id="76"> Wasn't do on its control over the second largest in the world today. </SEG> 
<SEG id="77"> He understood the role that the oil for his exercise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="78"> With the possibility of an invasion and from Indonesia,, in Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="79"> A large part of the later on the arrangements for the widespread knowledge and that the control of the oil the dominion over Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="80"> In the us-invasionsplänen was the safeguarding of the develop a decisive priority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="81"> The aim was not going to expand and the prices for the Americans to harmful, but the Americans, but Nevertheless a new basis and to stabilise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="82"> The future depends on the fate of the Iraqi production. </SEG> 
<SEG id="83"> Yet the whims of Ölgeschäftes, especially under different circumstances, it is difficult to see how, within the next few years will be able to achieve their objectives in Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="84"> The logic is simple. </SEG> 
<SEG id="85"> The USA must use the next to the funding of the regime in Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="86"> All depend on the long term of the ability of the capacity to export in large quantities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="87"> If Iraq oil can be extradited, not because of its promises to the controls, the American people, or the international Community has not deliver. </SEG> 
<SEG id="88"> Before the invasion of the capacity of the three million per day. </SEG> 
<SEG id="89"> Iraq, its production within the time frame, that is, an Iraqi government not to establish level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="90"> Any increase in the area which calls on developing what extensive investments, a lawful, government and political stability. </SEG> 
<SEG id="91"> Not even the Bush believes these conditions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="92"> Indeed, political stability, the most important condition for the increase in production capacity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="93"> Historical examples from Iran, from Kuwait, Russia, and even the show that it after the political stability around three years for the capacity and the capacity to higher level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="94"> The number of years in order to write a new Constitution, a legitimate and democratic government, the distribution of the negotiating new its economy and its laws. </SEG> 
<SEG id="95"> It requires further time with the international Ölgesellschaften and neighbouring countries to negotiate, technical feasibility studies and rebuild its eyes in order to relaunch and to explore. </SEG> 
<SEG id="96"> Therefore seems even a period of three years as optimistic, since it presupposes that the occupation in this time with the Iraqis, their own democratic government, and a political will. </SEG> 
<SEG id="97"> You do not need to mention that the situation quite differently. </SEG> 
<SEG id="98"> The tensions can still can. </SEG> 
<SEG id="99"> No one should be surprised if the Iraqi production under a democratic government to completely. </SEG> 
<SEG id="100"> Historical experiences that actions and similar and can, in democratic countries, a greater threat than in our countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="101"> If Iraq its fast in the next few years, this will not its both energy and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="102"> How does the USA to finance the reconstruction of Iraq? </SEG> 
<SEG id="103"> Who will pay for it, to get a alive? </SEG> 
<SEG id="104"> The United States is maintained, if the Iraqi people, not food, health care and other basic services can offer? </SEG> 
<SEG id="105"> These are difficult issues should remain in unbeantwortbar, but not a stable, democratic regime in Iraq, the constant flow of the steady. </SEG> 
<SEG id="106"> As guardian of human rights </SEG> 
<SEG id="107"> It would not be so deeply sad laugh: this is the chairman of the UN Commission on human rights has been elected! </SEG> 
<SEG id="108"> When being made towards senators, did not least at least no whose hooves. </SEG> 
<SEG id="109"> The process was, of course, perfectly legal: the Presidency of a region of the world, driven each year to the next. </SEG> 
<SEG id="110"> This year was Central to the line, the chairman, to vote and it has appointed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="111"> Only the USA and Canada voted against. </SEG> 
<SEG id="112"> To their shame, the European countries to abstain from voting. </SEG> 
<SEG id="113"> It is typical of the status of the office of the UN, that this decision just now, in this for the difficult time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="114"> President Bush has prompted the UN to prove that you, with your irak-resolutionen an Ambassador: otherwise, they will schmachvolle suffer the same fate as the League of Nations, in the early years of the aggressive policy nazideutschlands and fascist Italy totally powerless at its inception. </SEG> 
<SEG id="115"> Just now, in which human rights, which is responsible for human rights, is wrong on the legitimacy and the moral authority of the whole. </SEG> 
<SEG id="116"> Let us remember that this is a totalitarian and his head, they often unberechenbares Muammar al-gaddafi associated with extremist policy by making the dictators of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="117"> It is a world in which it has not yet again the sham elections and where. </SEG> 
<SEG id="118"> Under its domination terrorist organisations in the whole world - of the terrorist. </SEG> 
<SEG id="119"> The UN for the role which the country in which the Lockerbie, Scotland, are still not returned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="120"> In the last ten years is the position of the UN as a symbol for the ideal of a peaceful world is constantly undermined. </SEG> 
<SEG id="121"> She was completely unable to prevent the wars in the Balkans, and at least in one case - a Dutch peacekeeping force - the Srebrenica massacre the worst in Europe since 1945, can, in the Bosnian Serbs to 6 of the defenceless. </SEG> 
<SEG id="122"> A Netherlands later that the complicated this into this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="123"> Rwanda. hardly had begun, organized genocide for the peace and certain of the retreat from the country and left the field of the world since the second world war. </SEG> 
<SEG id="124"> The name of this funktionärs is Kofi Annan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="125"> The future of the UN, to give the impression that they speak with the voice of reason and the international legitimacy is only identification. </SEG> 
<SEG id="126"> But at a time when the UN in Iraq as well as the one in the fact that the Presidency, which was, in the hope of the errors of the failure of an organisation which has been established. </SEG> 
<SEG id="127"> Organisations are normally not under - and there is certainly much raison d 'budget in order to ensure that the UN continues to perpetuates. </SEG> 
<SEG id="128"> But it is only a shadow of what they should and could be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="129"> The UN of today is nothing more than a word. </SEG> 
<SEG id="130"> On. </SEG> 
<SEG id="131"> Last Thursday to me, the judges at the prison at in Jakarta last Thursday. </SEG> 
<SEG id="132"> I owe, I am, in accordance with the guilty by its possible involvement in an involvement on its, Moreover, I am indebted has been declared by the proliferation of lies stirred tends to have. </SEG> 
<SEG id="133"> Is my case and other similar cases have a reference to the end of a wider short-term democratic experiment in Indonesia? </SEG> 
<SEG id="134"> The "stirred", the "in March last year, as last year, but the two issues, the office of the attacks in to set fire to put it into a staff and violated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="135"> In the attempt to resolve the situation, I was to proceed to the Central to go to Central to my horror but under the control of the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="136"> I was struck and system, while the police. </SEG> 
<SEG id="137"> The good fortune numerous cameras and to help. </SEG> 
<SEG id="138"> The publication of her caused a public outcry, and Parliament to be forced to holding a public hearing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="139"> The police of the country and the country and those of the leaders of the public pressure, public pressure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="140"> However, a police investigation, and just because he claimed that he had without it, knowledge and its approval. </SEG> 
<SEG id="141"> Then he turned around and the tables, the author of the Article, against the, and against me. </SEG> 
<SEG id="142"> The legal proceedings was marked by a number of developments which beneficiaries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="143"> First of all, in the police and built up by Russia, and so that the accused. </SEG> 
<SEG id="144"> The Court, however, rejected our proposal on verfahrensaufschub up legal clarification of the public and the police strengthened case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="145"> The process seems to be against the two officers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="146"> One was the officers of the newly created (and financed by the USA) anti-terror-einheit is promoted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="147"> The other is on a course been sent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="148"> Next, the Summit was appointed by one from which one hour is located. </SEG> 
<SEG id="149"> One of my that it has not happened during the Court did not yet happens is that a Court yet. </SEG> 
<SEG id="150"> Indeed, transport, despite their promotion in another case in the same high level as chairman. </SEG> 
<SEG id="151"> In our Presidency, a Presidency, that a judgment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="152"> In the end, its than when a given to have given. </SEG> 
<SEG id="153"> A volume of; the Court was the who, as well as the who; the official record of the Court was introduced in a phone and came to the conclusion that the vote on the to the end. </SEG> 
<SEG id="154"> The Presidency, however, on the application of the arrest and prosecution, based on the following message to us on what we also did. </SEG> 
<SEG id="155"> The judges the Presidency also our proposal, too, the Court ruling. </SEG> 
<SEG id="156"> In view of such a procedure was my conviction and the few. </SEG> 
<SEG id="157"> However, I am confident that we at the end, if we appeal before that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="158"> The merits of the higher level, and the President of the Supreme Court is a convinced advocate of the democracy and the freedom of the press is a pioneering victory for our democracy, as the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of. </SEG> 
<SEG id="159"> At the same time the decision provides for this and for the environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="160"> No country in the world, it is better than in Indonesia that freedom of expression and freedom of the press, and that the criminalisation of development of authoritarianism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="161"> The Liberal democracy was of a Liberal democracy, the President took measures, with the support of the military drastic measures against the press. </SEG> 
<SEG id="162"> Critical voices were calm, whereby the consolidation of uncontrolled power easy fell in July 1959. "measures by decree had controlled democracy". </SEG> 
<SEG id="163"> In the first years after sukarnos fall in the year in all the standards of a real democracy, including the press once again my (except for the Communists). </SEG> 
<SEG id="164"> But, in the early 1970s started to go forward and, Finally, to the various media and the press. </SEG> 
<SEG id="165"> After the press were brought under control, had also how other political rights, rights and cut. </SEG> 
<SEG id="166"> Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia is the third largest democratic country in the world and the biggest Muslim democracy in history. </SEG> 
<SEG id="167"> Two parliamentary and two direct election - including the final - freely and fairly and peacefully and were proof that Islam and democracy quite thoroughly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="168"> However, to the enemies of democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="169"> Radical Islamic groups operating indiscriminate bombing and groups with strong authoritarian tendencies it up in the values that of President Megawati managed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="170"> However, Mrs Megawati just a defeat suffered during the presidential election. </SEG> 
<SEG id="171"> Will the newly elected President, pursue further and further? </SEG> 
<SEG id="172"> My conviction and the procedures, and if at the end of the hard-won third democracy in Indonesia which prioritises? </SEG> 
<SEG id="173"> The answer lies in the support activists in Indonesia and abroad. </SEG> 
<SEG id="174"> The terrible - a beacon of hope for all potential in the world - would be a terrible defeat. </SEG> 
<SEG id="175"> The moral of the death penalty </SEG> 
<SEG id="176"> The USA to their refusal to abolish the death penalty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="177"> Now our many, the abolition of the death penalty is a prerequisite for a civilized. </SEG> 
<SEG id="178"> Nobel prize-winner Gary Becker conflicts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="179"> The European governments are totally against the death penalty in the European Union, it is completely banned, and the use of the death penalty in the United States as barbaric. </SEG> 
<SEG id="180"> Numerous European intellectual so clear that not only the death penalty, but has no effect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="181"> While Europe with which, in the last 50 years of work for a long time about, to meet a drastic increase in the last twenty years to twenty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="182"> In contrast, these figures in America, partly due to a further use of penalties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="183"> The death penalty. </SEG> 
<SEG id="184"> I am for the execution of convicted persons, because, just as, I believe, that I believe that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="185"> I would not convinced, I oppose the death penalty against the death penalty and others should not serve as the basis for the policy of a State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="186"> The research on the death penalty in the USA with the American study, the figure was in 1975 review was published. </SEG> 
<SEG id="187"> In several successive studies effect is much lower than in others than today. </SEG> 
<SEG id="188"> The existing data are, however, fairly limited, hence its conclusions should not purely on the basis of evidence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="189"> Of course, one can with political decisions on any kind of punishment is not wait until this evidence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="190"> But even this quantitatively other data give reason to believe that the death penalty has a deterrent effect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="191"> Most people, above all, that is the death, especially when he was, and with some certainty after a murder. </SEG> 
<SEG id="192"> David: formulated in his treatise on suicide, that "threw away a to obtain worth the trouble. </SEG> 
<SEG id="193"> Because our natural fear which is so... "also, as follows:" if it then, so that the set of life, the set of death, it will put an end to the person his life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="194"> But the set of death and considerable resistance... " </SEG> 
<SEG id="195"> The opponents of the death penalty, the country would not have the right to take, not even a murderer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="196"> For someone at the deterrent effect of the death penalty ", that is, however, an absolutely mistaken conclusion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="197"> In order to understand the reason we take that for any for everybody to, for example, can be prevented, whereby there is a much smaller number, in a lot of or other jobs on the subject of Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="198"> It follows that any not not executed leave their lives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="199"> Indeed, the government therefore indirectly, if, when the death penalty is not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="200"> The rescue of life for every every person seems to be and, even if only one two could appear as apply lives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="201"> Admittedly, the argument in favour of the death penalty is with a smaller number at a smaller number at. </SEG> 
<SEG id="202"> But even if only one just one lives could be saved, would be a desirable if, when the life much better, as is usually the case, as it might be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="203"> Many people are opposed to strike a balance between the quality of a and one of life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="204"> However, I can see no reason not to employ a comparison. </SEG> 
<SEG id="205"> One thinks of the taxes for several children and a spouse. </SEG> 
<SEG id="206"> We take on, it would be possible, the life of an innocent victim through which it would be criminal to protect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="207"> It is clear to me that it must have more weight, to save the life of life as a criminal life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="208"> We have not, of course, all very so clearly, but the systems in relation to the quality of the two life must be part of any reasonable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="209"> That also helps to explain why the death penalty only in the case of murder, but not for a lesser crime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="210"> If in return for a reduction of the theft far more for a milder form of punishment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="211"> Although tax would rapes a murder quite close to come and a call for the death penalty and, in these cases, I am not in favour of it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="212"> A strong argument with the "significant". </SEG> 
<SEG id="213"> If the death penalty would stand the perpetrators have an incentive to kill themselves, in order not to be taken (this is a reason why the reason the penalties in general to the seriousness of the crime should be linked). </SEG> 
<SEG id="214"> A difficulty is the fact that the death penalty is still going to go further, in order to escape their arrest, whereby increase themselves. </SEG> 
<SEG id="215"> Turkey is, I believe, that the efforts in at the expense of one's own life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="216"> I am, of course, the risk that it might be possible, headache. </SEG> 
<SEG id="217"> My report on the death penalty would strongly undermined if the number of cases of effectively so that, as is often stated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="218"> I believe, however, that in the USA, though, so that, indeed, is not so very, very good, but against, but only, so that, if at all, only very few cases of cases of individuals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="219"> With the development of the 29 this Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="220"> Once again, the discussion about the death penalty is essentially a debate about a debate on its impact in the face of). </SEG> 
<SEG id="221"> I understand that many people who are sceptical about the evidence, although I believe that they are both in this respect, as well as in terms of sound common sense. </SEG> 
<SEG id="222"> The idea was to take the life is alarming, but sometimes extremely awkward measures necessary in order to prevent still worse still, which cost the life of innocent victims. </SEG> 
<SEG id="223"> The people against </SEG> 
<SEG id="224"> I have on the part of Russia ’ s first democratically elected President, Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="225"> Since and and rule over Russia and the justice system, that is, given that its successor, in order to avoid a future criminal prosecution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="226"> But we, the democratic who had the task of someone to Yeltsin, and not for him and his family. </SEG> 
<SEG id="227"> Therefore was quite was and sought not aimed, but in which he introduced in Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="228"> Nevertheless, this idea now, on the basis of us due in danger. </SEG> 
<SEG id="229"> I reject the responsibility for the support, not by me. </SEG> 
<SEG id="230"> We were not close friends, but he and I worked together in situations, and I have never in his sincerity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="231"> The foreign Minister. </SEG> 
<SEG id="232"> The problem is that its remain, including its belief that Russia can only flourish if it is governed by a single machtquelle is wrong. </SEG> 
<SEG id="233"> This is a great mistake with Russia in the political. </SEG> 
<SEG id="234"> It is, of course, nobody in this mistake, without even basic, and this applies especially in times. </SEG> 
<SEG id="235"> Therefore was no exception, but he recognised its error. </SEG> 
<SEG id="236"> As he on new year's eve, 1999, in order for that he had started the war in Chechnya. </SEG> 
<SEG id="237"> Putin and seems unable to recognise its mistake and a policy, a policy that, after your failure for the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="238"> One of mistakes its failure, moral priorities at the top of its agenda for reform. </SEG> 
<SEG id="239"> Russia would Stalinism and Stalinism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="240"> Without exception, the whole nation feeling must regret, as the German since 1945 regret. </SEG> 
<SEG id="241"> This failure is of importance, because it could be that the cause of the State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="242"> In actual fact, the national regret the gulag-Ära as a direct result of the Communist Party and the exclusion of the former kgb-mitarbeiter of political Ämtern strategy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="243"> Although such political Union, in both opferrolle as well as collaboration widespread and the borders between the Member countries is a good solution can be found, as in the Czech Republic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="244"> Nothing was done in the safety and could be a political and, now that they have reached. </SEG> 
<SEG id="245"> The political reactivation of the us and its efforts to the silence, and again in a country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="246"> It is impossible, responsible politicians and independent media of money, which the us his attacks on the so-called "Europe". </SEG> 
<SEG id="247"> Shortly, and as a consequence of this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="248"> The safety which dominate the, but, by removing the as the independent political life in Russia to destroy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="249"> Without independent intellectual bases of a climate of fear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="250"> But it is not only only, it also promotes a bad governance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="251"> Therefore the decision-making from top to bottom, no analysis that, therefore, the relations between citizens and State to reform. </SEG> 
<SEG id="252"> To be that a centralised political system is now, understanding and to correct the mistake, as it was in the red. </SEG> 
<SEG id="253"> As not very constituted and leads to Russia in full and more honesty in the same perversion, the collapse of the Soviet State that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="254"> The people start to realise this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="255"> They recognise that not desire, a strong and effective new State to manage is to become a reality, because a modern State from above, but not governed by informed by their leaders, to cut their mistakes and to hear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="256"> Under the inability of his government appears to have had. </SEG> 
<SEG id="257"> This is one of the reasons why goes forward so aggressively against its neighbour, Ukraine and Georgia, power and during its military presence in the presence of the breakaway region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="258"> By making its influence in Russia of power, does the Kremlin, to be able to persuade the Russians. </SEG> 
<SEG id="259"> In view of the confines of the debates in Russia and the ability of the Kremlin to manipulate elections, a change is the only option for those who want to preserve the democratic idea in Russia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="260"> It is no use at all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="261"> Those who oppose, must decide what they want, and explain that, if the regime does not have the right to have the Constitution, it with the government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="262"> The issue of power in Russia today, can no longer be decided solely at the ballot box. </SEG> 
<SEG id="263"> As in the Ukraine, the Lebanon and in which they will be rejected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="264"> Taxation and expenditure () </SEG> 
<SEG id="265"> An excessive fiscal incentives and reduce the growth of production. </SEG> 
<SEG id="266"> A little too can, however, to the same effect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="267"> Governments, the only on tax, have no money to basic public goods. </SEG> 
<SEG id="268"> What is worse, in poor countries, less and less on low rates lead on and on certain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="269"> On the example shows the importance of a well thought-out. </SEG> 
<SEG id="270"> In tech with networks. </SEG>

<SEG id="273"> For this reason, these companies in their own lines with, have Treaties with them with the water supply and control over their own themselves in the sector. </SEG> 
<SEG id="274"> The State, Israel, because it is not the flop. </SEG> 
<SEG id="275"> The amount in more than 70% of GDP; more than half of the inland revenue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="276"> The debt is not, however, to be spending in the past. </SEG> 
<SEG id="277"> The public spending in India amounted to about 15% of GDP compared to be in an average of 40% of GDP for public spending. </SEG> 
<SEG id="278"> The financial difficulties and a system of tax. </SEG> 
<SEG id="279"> Compared with international standards in the fiscal regulations and rates for individuals and businesses adequately. </SEG> 
<SEG id="280"> Yet in the countries of the Indian government from that only EUR 3.7% of the GDP of the corresponds to and from the revenue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="281"> Approximately a quarter of the GDP is on the agriculture, but not even the wealthy farmers pay taxes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="282"> Export-oriented companies in the software and in other sectors of tax on their profits, although the employees of these companies, very good of numbers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="283"> In spite of tax evasion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="284"> This fraud can occur because the government neither in staff nor in systems for research, which will have to reckon with often enough on their way out of the difficulties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="285"> The French '(' the language on production and are. </SEG> 
<SEG id="286"> Over 60% of the indirect taxes in indirect taxes and share the indirect taxes on taxes and 60%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="287"> The basissteuersatz was with 10% of the produktionswertes a company. </SEG> 
<SEG id="288"> In addition, there are still a number of privileges, exemptions and serves. </SEG> 
<SEG id="289"> So comes in categories as foodstuffs, streichhölzer, baumwollgarn and children a vergünstigter rate of 8% for application. </SEG> 
<SEG id="290"> In addition, a responsibility on cars, of 8 on a ", 8 and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="291"> The "additional" (exchange, not to be confused with the ", which is of particular importance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="292"> In addition, numerous numerous exemptions from excise duty rates in those companies with whole of less than 10 million rupien and companies in difficult or backward regions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="293"> Overall, these exemptions in together in 70, which will in turn, 52 requirements and conditions and 7, which contains numerous points. </SEG> 
<SEG id="294"> Exemptions for abuse. </SEG> 
<SEG id="295"> To a certain extent a, which at the application of the application of the requirements made interpret the provisions of favourable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="296"> Goods, a high rate of research (tax than goods, with a rate, with, for example, for example). </SEG> 
<SEG id="297"> The evasion of taxes is more widespread than those of income taxes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="298"> If a company taxes, and the effective in comparison to the press before an estimate, is also the competition for that, if you want to survive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="299"> France "additional" or "regulations" taxes, and with it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="300"> Just at the direct direct taxes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="301"> The tax officials for a favourable classifications bribes paid, the difference between the value of polished and polished sentence and the silent actual receipts family 'illegal', which in any einkommenssteuererklärung aufscheinen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="302"> The evasion of indirect taxation is not only the country with the provision of basic public goods, but Parliament and also the incentive to introduce the most productive labour processes for a production in order to even style. </SEG> 
<SEG id="303"> In indirect taxes, but now in the operation of many small production units as a great hinterzogen can be economies of scale, are not able to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="304"> In this context, it is worth noting that Indian companies in the software industry, where all companies of indirect taxes are released. </SEG> 
<SEG id="305"> The example of China or India, where the rationalisation of indirect taxes, in 1994 the prerequisites for a large? </SEG> 
<SEG id="306"> Or are coalition in a strong democracy to such reforms in the situation? </SEG> 
<SEG id="307"> In the last year of the BJP dramatic reduction of the public deficit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="308"> Then a working Group has been set up, the necessary changes in tax policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="309"> In July of this year, the working Party which is to raise taxes (and not the other things, among other things, the most complex of indirect taxes to be deleted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="310"> The new government under the guidance of these proposals is to be welcomed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="311"> When the Prime Minister, a far-reaching step for the sustainable economic development of economic development and the presentation on the situation in the tasks which are necessary in order to promote development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="312"> What is not with Turkey? </SEG> 
<SEG id="313"> On 16 December will Orhan Pamuk, one of the authors of the criteria, before a Court in Istanbul, the charge, "the national identity to offend, having to provide for the open discussion of the Turkish at 1.5 million million. </SEG> 
<SEG id="314"> Must with three years in prison. </SEG> 
<SEG id="315"> The efforts of the criteria, those relating to the official line, with fine to line up that I was right, as the accession negotiations for membership of the European country in the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="316"> In December 1999 the European Council gave the European Council of December, which meant that the criteria of the Union to a later, and that would not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="317"> The Council has asked the European Commission then again until October 2004 to decide whether Turkey, the political criteria for membership have sufficiently fulfilled - including democracy, the rule of law and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="318"> This was one of the final decisions, which the Commission under Romano Prodi made of which I was a Member. </SEG> 
<SEG id="319"> Of its 29, 30 Members meant that Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the criteria to continue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="320"> I was the only. </SEG> 
<SEG id="321"> The report of the Commission itself to Turkey, of the time for the enlargement procedure my decision. </SEG> 
<SEG id="322"> This report has mentioned that in the year 2003, asylum requests in the EU in 2003, were accepted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="323"> In other words, the governments of the EU itself yet, that the Turkish government over 2000 against their own citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="324"> Meanwhile, the Commission published a report on Turkey to put that the reforms under the sooner the rather government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, even if in a slower pace. </SEG> 
<SEG id="325"> But the report also presented serious concerns: human rights violations, including torture, were resumed; the impact of the military destruction to large; the speech was not everywhere; then, religious and cultural minorities were discriminated; and violence against women was not high enough to discrimination. </SEG> 
<SEG id="326"> It has not changed since the October began. </SEG> 
<SEG id="327"> Alongside the current persecution pamuks there are plenty of examples of things. </SEG> 
<SEG id="328"> In March 2005, the police force a demonstration of the celebration of international women's day. </SEG> 
<SEG id="329"> In may, the largest trade, because it, the 14 million Kurds in Turkey in mother tongue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="330"> And in fact takes up at the top of the Turkish government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="331"> The foreign Minister Abdullah Gül said, not a Conference in Copenhagen, a journalist in the and the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="332"> Such actions and no October 2004. </SEG> 
<SEG id="333"> But even if these shortcomings, not yet in the EU be taken, because it is not a European country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="334"> Christianity feudalism, the renaissance, education, democracy and to which we have done what we Europeans, but they have not made the requests to what they are. </SEG> 
<SEG id="335"> Therefore, I am not convinced that the reforms in Turkey, to urge the European Commission to be implemented according to the accession of other companies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="336"> I suspect, that they would be withdrawn. </SEG> 
<SEG id="337"> Moreover, Turkey's accession would inevitably result in the Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova to Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="338"> The first three of these countries are certainly more European than Turkey. </SEG> 
<SEG id="339"> Let the three Caucasian republics, without, however, that this would have an EU with approximately 35 Members. </SEG> 
<SEG id="340"> What kind of a Union that? </SEG> 
<SEG id="341"> The EU is not simply a freundschaftsclub. </SEG> 
<SEG id="342"> It is based on the free movement of goods, services, capital and persons. </SEG> 
<SEG id="343"> As guardian of the Treaties of the European Union, the Commission must protect these four basic freedoms, which means it must convince the Member States sometimes and appropriate pressure to change their legislation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="344"> The policy in Sweden, the Volkswagen in Germany and the discrimination against foreign investment in France, in which the Commission has made unpopular. </SEG> 
<SEG id="345"> But they were needed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="346"> As I left the Commission, I was on a batch of 1500 such procedure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="347"> Briefly, the result is that a country, strongly on its internal Affairs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="348"> This will with such different Members will be impossible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="349"> The EU would be victims of what the: Paul describes as "from imperialistic". </SEG> 
<SEG id="350"> The EU would be stretched. </SEG> 
<SEG id="351"> Former, therefore, the former French President, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, that the accession of Turkey to the EU would lead, and, therefore, the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: "the that Turkey would be more than the EU could tolerate." </SEG> 
<SEG id="352"> But the most important reason against Turkey ’ s accession is a question of democracy: the majority of the population want it does not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="353"> Crisis, a crisis intervention </SEG> 
<SEG id="354"> It is in no way a in any country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="355"> Apart from Haiti, it is the poorest in the Union, it suffers and is still greater instability and suffers from a story with over two hundred since its independence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="356"> In a region with a strong in past and a disruptive and isolated criticism is alongside Guatemala, perhaps the only country in Latin America, the indigenous peoples of the majority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="357"> Its topography and religious distribution and autonomous powers and even that national unity than in other countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="358"> Moreover, it is together with together, of course, the only nation on the subcontinent without access to the sea. </SEG> 
<SEG id="359"> It would therefore be extremely imprudent, current crisis on the rest of Latin America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="360"> Generalisations are far too simple: in other countries, the institutions, the poverty in the extreme poverty - has fallen and the fight to natural resources is in large part settled. </SEG> 
<SEG id="361"> Even in countries such as Venezuela with great today and a traditionsbewussten, nationalist government, the current practice of foreign investments in energy resources to admit that the eight-year rule of President possession survived. </SEG> 
<SEG id="362"> Although, in many countries, of Chiapas after "araucania" of ayacucho, movements exist, they are nowhere in Latin America is for the national unity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="363"> Therefore, neither a warning crisis nor “ domino ', both and, as well, as in the case of Bolivia, were or only halfway reasonable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="364"> Nevertheless, current crisis on the 'democratic deficit', the Latin America at present. </SEG> 
<SEG id="365"> At present, Ecuador and Haiti has been elected, for a variety of reasons. </SEG> 
<SEG id="366"> In Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua is either Nicaragua and in Venezuela and Colombia is threatened by these regulations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="367"> None of the other, they are in, or that they had. </SEG> 
<SEG id="368"> The question is, what can be done in this situation, the Europe of the encouraging which, until a few years ago the picture. </SEG> 
<SEG id="369"> At the last meeting of the organisation of American States in took measures in the United States is a good idea of another and between you and by your support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="370"> The history of this Parliament a few years ago, when the foreign policy and the and the United Nations development programme (UNDP) State, a draft for the report on democracy in Latin America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="371"> They came to the conclusion that a system for democratic crises in the region in the region before the things as currently in Bolivia, but under control. </SEG> 
<SEG id="372"> The and the un-team convinced think the Chilean President Ricardo Lagos to take the initiative and with some of his colleagues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="373"> That is not very far. </SEG> 
<SEG id="374"> Even in 2004 UNDP report on democracy in Latin America they took hardly mention. </SEG> 
<SEG id="375"> The USA and the new Chilean Secretary of the OAS, Jose Miguel, after the plan in oas-treffen in Florida again on the table, but it passed one because of the legitimate concerns of the Latin Americans, directed against the idea were to be mixed with the anachronistic fears of the Latin Americans, against the sacrosanct principle of non-interference to citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="376"> Although the continent, not on the principle of some might, in regard to the idea of an early warning system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="377"> At present, there are probably little what the USA concerning the situation in Bolivia to the situation for all some dangers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="378"> Yes, the opposition and the honest and, if not, if a democratic opposition leader in the, but its supporters are completely free of authoritarian? </SEG> 
<SEG id="379"> The possession, and not the other, and nothing in the Affairs of the country to intervene in the almost 40 years ago as a unit? </SEG> 
<SEG id="380"> Perhaps the Bolivian businesspeople of Santa Cruz their threat of a separation is not true, but they are the oil and gas reserves its region than with the indigenous population in the Highlands parts as with celebrated industrial from Sao Paulo? </SEG> 
<SEG id="381"> Before the events of such particular played the OAS (not the USA) should not under any circumstances. </SEG> 
<SEG id="382"> The region is dependent on this time, energy and on a proper democratic basis, a long, that of the traditional and intervention and indifference. </SEG> 
<SEG id="383"> The decline of France? </SEG> 
<SEG id="384"> The reputation of France in the world are concerned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="385"> The French State gives a great deal of money for the propagation of the French language and culture, and yet the French painfully aware that the global position of your country not more of the same value, as previously. </SEG> 
<SEG id="386"> It is therefore no surprise that the publication of a report from the European Commission during the last elections, in which States that France has fallen in the European countries, in a period of ten years from friends on the tenth has fallen to a conscience and that gave rise to controversial, President Jacques Chirac his rivals, Lionel Jospin, the blame on "or" decline. </SEG> 
<SEG id="387"> The OECD and the English European office, this aspect of the debate held by your statement that France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom are all in some of the same standard per head on, however. </SEG> 
<SEG id="388"> The public controversy remained unchanged. </SEG> 
<SEG id="389"> The now disputes with the European Commission on the financial and wrangling with America due to the war in Iraq, get concerned about the French secret 'revived. </SEG> 
<SEG id="390"> The most is a la France, la (France). </SEG> 
<SEG id="391"> 'a wealth of an abundance of quotations from de Gaulle'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="392"> The author of the resolution in its last year in the siebzigerjahren with the introduction of the schnellzuges TGV and Airbus. </SEG> 
<SEG id="393"> He both edge, for their ", to win elections, and to do so for many". </SEG> 
<SEG id="394"> The success of the book is even a reference to a kind of "". </SEG> 
<SEG id="395"> But what kind of abuse? </SEG> 
<SEG id="396"> 'means degeneration is not so convincingly as he does. </SEG> 
<SEG id="397"> So it is, for example, that the jobs in the industry, the means for example. </SEG> 
<SEG id="398"> The case is, however, have in common. </SEG> 
<SEG id="399"> So it is even better than most of its most of the wealthy countries, and it has other than Germany, the United Kingdom or the United States, the share of the market in the sector, it is the beginning of the seventies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="400"> The only candidate, a better measure for competitiveness, it is France, Moreover, very well. </SEG> 
<SEG id="401"> According to a report by the Council for France, in France, in 2001 to EUR 60 billion, almost twice as much as in Germany. </SEG> 
<SEG id="402"> Also want to know about 20%) in the last three decades, by means of which. </SEG> 
<SEG id="403"> The core of the considerable economic difficulties, however, is precisely the fear the loss of loss. </SEG> 
<SEG id="404"> In traditional sectors such as the car industry or in France is still a strong; the markets in which smaller companies, new technologies, it remains, however. </SEG> 
<SEG id="405"> France, for example, only 30 billion dollars per year for the R & d for example, compared with 51 billion dollars in Germany, 98 billion dollars in Japan and 265 billion dollars in the USA. </SEG> 
<SEG id="406"> Briefly, be in the wrong direction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="407"> In the course of the last twenty years has gone through a row: economic and financial liberalisation, the abolition of controls, the end of liberalisation, the introduction of the euro and the euro to the business of the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="408"> The French malaise has nothing to do with all this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="409"> The problem is that it is not time to the new world, of which it is already a part. </SEG> 
<SEG id="410"> The French capitalism is dead and France, it is difficult to deal with its to its. </SEG> 
<SEG id="411"> France, seems to be the only country in which a Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, already a day later in television, for his statement to this case, that "the State is not allmächtig". </SEG> 
<SEG id="412"> There are many reasons for this French, one of the crucial depends, however, with the political events of the past 20 years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="413"> There was in France, there was a clear separation between the right and the left. </SEG> 
<SEG id="414"> We have both the reduced, as well as their Chirac, about the difficult process of adaptation to Europe and to support the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="415"> A round "'à la Margaret Thatcher twenty years have perhaps a new political awareness. </SEG> 
<SEG id="416"> But the implementation of reforms of it by the French, in a world to life and in any other way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="417"> This is one of the crucial reasons for the rates during the election campaign, the Jean-Marie Le Pen before acting Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, the second round of the elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="418"> The rise of the extreme left, the 10% of the votes than of this political failure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="419"> France needs a political rather than a for the sector itself part of this reality is that the answer is "a fear is that the French people themselves. </SEG> 
<SEG id="420"> The value of European values </SEG> 
<SEG id="421"> The governments of the talks on an after this last December off. </SEG> 
<SEG id="422"> Such differences are, of course, to be added, which are to be found. </SEG> 
<SEG id="423"> What, however, we still need to have a clear idea of what is to be achieved with the European Constitution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="424"> The European integration is based on two fundamental principles: solidarity and subsidiarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="425"> Both are at the interface between philosophy, politics, plans and right. </SEG> 
<SEG id="426"> For years, you will find in the legal and institutional framework of the European Union in its term - and in the Charter of fundamental rights (where they are referred to in the preamble), and in the draft Constitution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="427"> So both are thus in history and in the ideals of the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="428"> However, solidarity and subsidiarity actually mean? </SEG> 
<SEG id="429"> If we look at the least can be interpreted in two ways: when, solidarity, it is just about the distribution of income and prosperity and as the concept, the production of income and prosperity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="430"> In the history of European integration after the second world war, in the first phase of the European coal and steel Community - the dynamic, namely, both in the economic development (in the, above all in the Treaty of Rome. </SEG> 
<SEG id="431"> That does not, however, mean that the dynamic solidarity was not given: the European Union is for. </SEG> 
<SEG id="432"> Although some countries, no direct benefit of the introduction of the euro, nonetheless, because of the positive effects of the common currency and goods. </SEG> 
<SEG id="433"> In other words, it is these strategies which aim to promote investment, growth and the creation of jobs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="434"> As, however, the figures for the growth in the EU, the dynamic of solidarity in the last ten years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="435"> Especially worrying in this connection is the backlog of Europe in the areas of research and development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="436"> The implementation of the Lisbon strategy, the Lisbon strategy by the EU from the European Union to create the most competitive economy in the world, is, however, of a European Union is threatened by the high costs for the welfare State and high taxes to its financing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="437"> The Überhandnahme static solidarity lies in the population than the percentage of a structural imbalance in the Budgets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="438"> One of the greatest challenges of the EU and the development of the EU, to be of participating in the old people to change the young people in the centre. </SEG> 
<SEG id="439"> We in the EU cannot afford that the current investment level, that is, the request is, in order to secure peace in the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="440"> The principle of subsidiarity is the concept of solidarity, insofar as it allows two: the vertical and horizontal subsidiarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="441"> The vertical subsidiarity describes the division between the different levels of government and the levels and between the EU, the Member States, regions and local authorities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="442"> The best use of this principle is the same. </SEG> 
<SEG id="443"> In the European Treaties, this is clearly established. </SEG> 
<SEG id="444"> But is that enough about the institutional and constitutional framework of the Union to include? </SEG> 
<SEG id="445"> The horizontal level, describes the freedom of people, and their social and economic relations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="446"> These include the relations between the State, society and the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="447"> Indeed, the company and the market on its own rights and rights which are not granted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="448"> Therefore, the problem arises in the safety of the autonomy of each area. </SEG> 
<SEG id="449"> An example is the European internal market, a new kind of economic freedom and increasing competition between companies created by the mechanisms for these companies were abolished. </SEG> 
<SEG id="450"> Subsidiarity means that the State clearly in the State in the economy, the individual freedom and in respect to respect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="451"> In addition, subsidiarity, that a 'has power sector, where the individual freedom and responsibility is not sufficient for the protection of human dignity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="452"> This support should, however, be implemented in a way that the fight against the company and the single market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="453"> That, however, is only possible if the role of the horizontal level, that is, which is neither in the European Treaties, nor in the Charter of fundamental rights or in the work of the European Convention. </SEG> 
<SEG id="454"> In short, solidarity does today, rather than growth redistribution (so raises the current generation their solidarity with future generations to term) and subsidiarity means today, the distribution of political power and not the careful demarcation between the State of the company and the market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="455"> Today, both are defined, that the State of the beneficiaries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="456"> So, the concentration on growth, as is often the case with the values. </SEG> 
<SEG id="457"> But these values are deeply rooted in Europe and should also be brought to the surface. </SEG> 
<SEG id="458"> The EU should recover their economic dynamism, as it is a model of solidarity and subsidiarity, the sooner the market and the company priority and that the socio-economic impact of State decreased. </SEG> 
<SEG id="459"> Public institutions should be responsible for the provision of public goods (as', as well as social and monetary) society for social goods (such as culture, education and help people) and the market for economic goods (with profit, growth and employment and employment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="460"> In the 21st century, Europe must again on the values and the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, reach, if it wants to achieve the objective of integration: the freedom and prosperity to Europe, the request for the differences and political lines. </SEG> 
<SEG id="461"> In this spirit, the European Constitution must be written. </SEG> 
<SEG id="462"> The policy of the new </SEG> 
<SEG id="463"> The discussion about the American elections has still not big. </SEG> 
<SEG id="464"> As President George W. Bush it managed to three million, more than Senator John Kerry and, Moreover, in both chambers of chambers of the majority vote? </SEG> 
<SEG id="465"> In the answers to little consensus, but two subjects appear in many statements. </SEG> 
<SEG id="466"> That is a figure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="467"> In a time of uncertainty and before the people more confidence in the President, you, as in a whose appeared. </SEG> 
<SEG id="468"> The second subject are worth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="469"> The people voted for a structure of values, and not for a specific policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="470"> Indeed some (so were reported) with kerrys policy agreed, showed their vote, however, and because they deal with its general, a "good". </SEG> 
<SEG id="471"> The United States are currently in view of the elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="472"> In order to advance in the East and West, North called in the centre and in the South. </SEG> 
<SEG id="473"> Furthermore, the Council also at local level. </SEG> 
<SEG id="474"> Constituency, i.e. the Party to a particular political Party limits, are no longer necessary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="475"> The people tend to effectively in areas in which other parts of its values, are they number or politically. </SEG> 
<SEG id="476"> For precisely these values? </SEG> 
<SEG id="477"> They have to do with 'God, guns and "- weapons and weapons. </SEG> 
<SEG id="478"> Religion plays a role and including the also the Bible, when it comes to the genesis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="479"> The possession of a weapon is the crucial test and the use of weapons in wars, is nothing repugnant. </SEG> 
<SEG id="480"> "and", ", as originally refused. </SEG> 
<SEG id="481"> As the politics of policy it as follows: "candidacy is so that you, the majority of society, while the majority to 60 million people, with itself to be satisfied. </SEG> 
<SEG id="482"> Is there or is there not a put in other places? </SEG> 
<SEG id="483"> A response is that the policy of the new Europe as American phenomenon can produce a majority, but this is the circumstances. </SEG> 
<SEG id="484"> Europe and other parts of the world are equally important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="485"> Personality is undoubtedly important, and below the obvious political differences political differences, which is still not yet reach. </SEG> 
<SEG id="486"> However, political differences, which are based on a always play a role in the elections. </SEG> 
<SEG id="487"> For example, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the next big projects, on the card "and" speaks of politics, but it is above all a structure of values of the Middle class. </SEG> 
<SEG id="488"> It talks of "modernisation" or "in the 21st century to arrive, it has not, however, a strange kind of citizenship and change and stability. </SEG> 
<SEG id="489"> It took the Conservative opposition has not been effective response. </SEG> 
<SEG id="490"> Even with issues such as tax and asylum in the measures brought into play as the like this in the USA. </SEG> 
<SEG id="491"> A similar picture results in Germany, where the obvious even less. </SEG> 
<SEG id="492"> The discussion in Germany is part of a political discussion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="493"> If the opposition of the fighting is to fight unemployment, it goes with that, essentially, it is about the values. </SEG> 
<SEG id="494"> But are the political discussion in Britain and Germany as that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="495"> The parties in order to fight those who can bring itself to be satisfied with that, but they do not recognize that it is only partly a question of politics. </SEG> 
<SEG id="496"> It is unlikely that the religion in the European policy to an opinion polls show that show that the rights of religious and one of the few large differences between Americans and Europeans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="497"> We are also a other value in the European conscience to most Europeans see as important in their absence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="498"> In Europe is also a and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="499"> Yet, the subject of political correctness ('gay ") in Europe a now also. </SEG> 
<SEG id="500"> Above all the Europeans, because the "national issue in all European States raised. </SEG> 
<SEG id="501"> This is a by action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="502"> The people want to know where they are going, and against the United States and in Europe, or against Europe and to their own country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="503"> In any case, outside the scope of the political guidelines and even the policy becomes and here. </SEG> 
<SEG id="504"> This is, in any case, the democratic, the democratic countries, because the policy of values is a dangerous development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="505"> In companies, whose greatest achievement was precisely the policy out of the decade. </SEG> 
<SEG id="506"> A discussion public discussion must be about politics by a Group of values. </SEG> 
<SEG id="507"> To insist on, is therefore a primary objective of the policy of freedom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="508"> The formal </SEG> 
<SEG id="509"> One swallow does not make a summer and a normal job growth and increasing prices in the United States does not mean that the supervision of the fear of fear and history have lost. </SEG> 
<SEG id="510"> But the time will come, in the interest of the world will begin to prepare itself to compensate for Central bankers to areas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="511"> When it will be so far - whether in this autumn, in the year 2005 or 2006 or 2007 - Europe and the world will be confronted with financial obligations of the past three years, with regard to the control of it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="512"> The short-term interest rates are low: only 2% in the euro zone, only 1% in the United States and in Japan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="513"> The policy is, however, just as the interest rates on historic low levels - and by all convinced that the loan for a long time in their current State will remain. </SEG> 
<SEG id="514"> The most important result of monetary was with in it: all profits pays a or rents, is more attractive - and thus substantially - if we are very low, and probably will remain very low. </SEG> 
<SEG id="515"> This explains the great disparities between the current prices for areas in the USA, securities in new York and Frankfurt, London and long-term allerorts and what we consider essential for their fundamental values. </SEG> 
<SEG id="516"> So what will happen if the banks to raise interest rates? </SEG> 
<SEG id="517"> In 1994, the increase in interest rates is considerable scope - and falling prices for long-term at least what common prognosemodelle confounded at this time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="518"> Moreover, in the interest of the developing countries, and more than developing countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="519"> The first risk on the one system for the year 2005 and beyond thought needs to do - if we and the interest rates - is in all probability. </SEG> 
<SEG id="520"> For countries like Mexico, Turkey, Argentina, Brazil, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the record of the nineties have shown that, and Brazil, can quickly turn, irrespective of how interest and analyses of large banks, the policy of a country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="521"> The margins are currently are. </SEG> 
<SEG id="522"> International monetary - irrespective of influxes in the USA - are not yet on standards, the one in connection with "the irrational, but this could happen before the start. </SEG> 
<SEG id="523"> These are alarming views, because if the nineties a have taught us, then, the stability of the international, overestimate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="524"> The second risk is due to high within the large industrial. </SEG> 
<SEG id="525"> The prevailing philosophy within the supervision of - with which I agree - consists in the fact that the revolution of the technology continues, that the wachstumstempo the potential produktionsleistung in the USA remains very high, and that is the problem. produktionslücke relatively large. </SEG> 
<SEG id="526"> The conclusion is that we do indeed about a quite considerable will remain low. </SEG> 
<SEG id="527"> If that confidence in the supervision of high and the risk of the loss of inflation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="528"> As a result, we, in the 80s and 90s who remain, and even after produktionsstände again use of their potential. </SEG> 
<SEG id="529"> That is, of course, good news for all important areas, stocks and weapons. </SEG> 
<SEG id="530"> Because the price was precisely the crux of the matter regarding the reduction of interest rates: Finally takes an update of the has an effect on the issues. </SEG> 
<SEG id="531"> The bad news is that, even if a time that we remain indefinitely, they are so low. </SEG> 
<SEG id="532"> With a word: if we go, the assets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="533"> That is precisely the times - especially if assets - and which we - in which we realise how well our, really fulfil their task: the reduction of financial volatility and the promotion of economic stability. </SEG> 
<SEG id="534"> While such periods, we also see that, like many people, the long-term bonds or shares, areas such as this, not because they believe that the current prices in terms of the data, but because the prices in the course of the last few years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="535"> For, is a crucial issue, because those who are long-term assets, based on the knowledge and are also those who sell you again, once the trends. </SEG> 
<SEG id="536"> An than as a reason for the costs of the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="537"> The challenges which the economic and working in the course of the coming years to see other than those with which they since since the bubble. </SEG> 
<SEG id="538"> The risks in connection with inflation are probably less dangerous than those through history. </SEG> 
<SEG id="539"> However, as we have learned, in the 1990s, this does not mean that the forthcoming difficulties simply to be mastered. </SEG> 
<SEG id="540"> Future </SEG> 
<SEG id="541"> I recently found out something in experience: in America have small farmers and national opinions see very different, even conflicting, opinions on the results of the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="542"> The international finance this from a financial, followed by a painful and and if possible in the USA for assessment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="543"> By contrast, the national budget to see a loss of the dollar as a crisis, but as a chance to accelerate economic growth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="544"> The more presented the situation around so: because in future foreign banks will no longer be prepared to buy dollar-wertpapiere en masse in order to support the local currency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="545"> If they stop their the value of the dollar, and landing is hard. </SEG> 
<SEG id="546"> With the depreciation of the us dollar, however, for more attractive and the employment situation in Europe is for. </SEG> 
<SEG id="547"> The development, would be, as in the United Kingdom, as the währungsbindung aufgab and the British Parliament in relation to the German mark was devalued or, as in the USA, the late 1980s when the dollar, the Parliament, the German mark and, above all, against the Japanese yen has been devalued. </SEG> 
<SEG id="548"> The international system in the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="549"> In their eyes, the end of the end of the Central banks, not only to a devaluation of the dollar, but also lead to interest rates in the long-term interest rates in the United States the death of the time and reduce dependence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="550"> Also, of course, expect the economists, including loss of profit, but by the delays in the care of its after the fall in consumption and investment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="551"> The protection of eight to ten million people are what there is in the export and for an increase in the structural unemployment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="552"> Moreover, it could to: for large financial institutions, with their obligations to short-term and long-term it there will be difficult, a sharp increase in the long-term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="553"> This may well be easy to financial pressure and the pressure and the crises in Mexico, and also in the 1990s and, a few years ago, as the imbalance between the in local currency, to financial Überlastungen and ultimately led to others. </SEG> 
<SEG id="554"> If internationally in this scenario, due to the reply that sounds like a case of all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="555"> Why should the American federal reserve Bank, just as there? </SEG> 
<SEG id="556"> Should the which does not in itself and long-term, instead, to a considerable interest in an interest rate, with full employment? </SEG> 
<SEG id="557"> To respond to the farmers, with the reference that the citizens would not have the power to intervene. </SEG> 
<SEG id="558"> If you have the choice between employment and has, then, so the small, will decide on, because the inflation rate of inflation in the 1970s. </SEG> 
<SEG id="559"> As a loss of the dollar, to an increase in the number of the causes and hence a negative, on the increase in Europe, we must not lower and also, but certainly not to buy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="560"> On both sides of this large farmers whom I greatly appreciate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="561"> I am not clever enough to decide which side is right, but I know full well, of which I hope, that it is in the wrong. </SEG> 
<SEG id="562"> My </SEG> 
<SEG id="563"> In the USA, the States must pursue an insufficient budgetary with penalties. </SEG> 
<SEG id="564"> Their at less value than those from the federal better managed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="565"> The higher the 35 years up to a certain degree, as disciplinary measures against the temptation to spend the money. </SEG> 
<SEG id="566"> What the market is not perfect: the anleihenmarkt "," implicit future obligations (as promised pensions) not in large extent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="567"> Nevertheless, this enforced discipline in combination with the individual States with the fact that it is in the United States since the crises in the USA since. </SEG> 
<SEG id="568"> If we now. </SEG> 
<SEG id="569"> Before the introduction of the euro, there was in the individual States of southern Europe budgetkrisen which led to high inflation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="570"> On the basis of the single currency, however, is the way to resolve a crisis over the years, since the European Central Bank (ECB) on monetary policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="571"> Although the European countries their finanzdefizite not more about the rules, you cannot allow the single currency, the schuldenkapazität which the other EU Member States, in order to claim and their ausgabenorgien position for a while, in saus do to life and the political responsibility to vote on later. </SEG> 
<SEG id="572"> These possibilities in order to put a stop to the stability and growth Pact was created: the must be under 3% of GDP. </SEG> 
<SEG id="573"> All the life of the Pact ’ s rules for the fifth time in the extreme and without (large) excuses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="574"> However, was found to understand that it with sanctions, the European Commission against Germany would expect, because otherwise the credibility of the Pact is at stake. </SEG> 
<SEG id="575"> Other than two and a half years ago, but it would not, therefore, against the sanctions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="576"> However, however, it is also clear that it on the basis of the sanctions will 3.4% of GDP largely symbolic nature of penalties, which for the government or sectors associated with significant costs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="577"> The growth and stability Pact is still working days are also so as originally thought. </SEG> 
<SEG id="578"> How? </SEG> 
<SEG id="579"> The willingness of the German government, even more so, and major and minor accumulation, because the market and punishing those States that a common position may your policy? </SEG> 
<SEG id="580"> The answer is "no". </SEG> 
<SEG id="581"> We don the twelve Member States of the euro zone. </SEG> 
<SEG id="582"> The market, it seems, therefore, not to worry that the countries on the freedom to them would be for the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="583"> Willem Buiter of the university of Amsterdam and Anne that of the university of London, believe that the willingness of the ECB, where all levels of the eurozone, the ability of the market as a driving force as to undermine. </SEG> 
<SEG id="584"> As long as a minor part of the German finance as security for a short-term credit or as of the business will be worth much rather be governed by those conditions to which the ECB these as to which, as the true value. </SEG> 
<SEG id="585"> The fact that the ECB all this to the fact that more than all the analyses on the differences in national risks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="586"> In the long term, this development. </SEG> 
<SEG id="587"> A reasonable chance on the need to protect, and it requires. </SEG> 
<SEG id="588"> If the free market in behaviour which, into it at its regulations for future generations to a vote, then, is to be, perhaps not today or tomorrow, but not for a long time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="589"> Over the years, the introduction of the single currency and the kind of how this was made to ever greater national. </SEG> 
<SEG id="590"> The policy in the euro zone is out. </SEG> 
<SEG id="591"> One, to implement it, also for those regions of the position and the already in a recession, if the Bank 's policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="592"> The institutional foundations for a stable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="593"> And now Buiter and that he stated that the more the market too little scope in order to and to punish the squanderers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="594"> Islam and for the next time it is not to be expected. </SEG> 
<SEG id="595"> But if things do not change the ground among the euro very good in motion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="596"> Milosevic and more than farce: </SEG> 
<SEG id="597"> Once once a serious matter. </SEG> 
<SEG id="598"> One of the photographs of Nuremberg, the sitting. </SEG> 
<SEG id="599"> Who interpret. </SEG> 
<SEG id="600"> Nowadays, the proceedings against the leaders of our world to our world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="601"> The process towards Saddam Hussein and his cronies from these up. </SEG> 
<SEG id="602"> The defendants try it with a farce, and the other, and every possible form of special except to show. </SEG> 
<SEG id="603"> It is hard to imagine that, in the eyes of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="604"> The process has itself against Slobodan Milosevic to burial, after four years of the accounts and a waste of more than 200 million dollars. </SEG> 
<SEG id="605"> In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government for almost a decade about how the survivors of the elements of the Khmer Rouge, to make the process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="606"> The mass in the 20th century in which the power if they did not, while they were still in power, while, condemns or for their crimes to be brought before the courts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="607"> Who can be proud of the fact that the last Communist, and through the appearance of a fair trial;? </SEG> 
<SEG id="608"> The formal genuine courts, appears to be better than the arbitrary, even if at the end, in both cases of death. </SEG> 
<SEG id="609"> Today, there are two plausible methods, against a set. </SEG> 
<SEG id="610"> A nation can their former leaders should not, as the in the 1980s with for the disappearance of more than to its citizens, responsible political actions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="611"> At international level, for future processes, under the circumstances, to provide for the dubious circumstances, punishments for penalties for crimes, such as' crimes against humanity '- not, for the time when they were committed, no proper definition. </SEG> 
<SEG id="612"> There was a time in which the values at both national and international. </SEG> 
<SEG id="613"> Before taking place on the local communities, through close involvement in the process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="614"> In addition, the structures and also greater sensitivity in the assessment of the debt, because they were aware of the difficult circumstances under which the under its decisions made. </SEG> 
<SEG id="615"> Argentina's proceedings against the generals, who was a ritual during difficult transition from the military to democracy, but the experience of the experience and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="616"> Even after the generals were still in force for the completion of the processes and then the President by the following. </SEG> 
<SEG id="617"> Yet today is the Argentine policy of by the legal consequences of those 20 years policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="618"> At international level, the decision of the UN security Council for the establishment of the international criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also welcomed with great confidence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="619"> The ICTY made, under the leadership of Antonio Cassese, a series of specific decisions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="620"> Then, however, the Presidency had the misfortune to be able, would, then, the Slobodan Milosevic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="621"> It is not clear how the Serbs in a process in their own country with Milosevic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="622"> Much of the political Party would have been that the Court should have. </SEG> 
<SEG id="623"> On international hands, but at right. </SEG> 
<SEG id="624"> Milosevic process should, more than fair, should a symbol for the fairness of the UN. </SEG> 
<SEG id="625"> So it was allowed itself to and from the point of view of the length of the procedure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="626"> The number of a freely of Serbian aggression and the home. </SEG> 
<SEG id="627"> It will still take months in order to ascertain what, and why the process dragged on more than. </SEG> 
<SEG id="628"> My instinct tells me that the well-meaning Court itself too much of the question by the South African - a model which is proclaimed as the law to as ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="629"> In the South African process was not the most important issue for the future of the accused, but which, in the past, the victims. </SEG> 
<SEG id="630"> Every victim was encouraged, its history, and to tell the defendant. </SEG> 
<SEG id="631"> In the case of the in the course of the twentieth century of the 20th century such a strategy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="632"> The victims, for your encouraging and then that the accused by extoling for political merits of one's results on a recipe for a prescription. </SEG> 
<SEG id="633"> A lesson from the trials against Milosevic and more have learned is that men and women are not in question should, in order to put an end to do. </SEG> 
<SEG id="634"> They are actually in the process, particularly if one allows himself to the justification of the benefits. </SEG> 
<SEG id="635"> One should only if they are defeated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="636"> It was a benefit of the courts, that with the representatives of the committees were victorious. </SEG> 
<SEG id="637"> This has been a constant reminder at Hermann Hess and their accomplices, that the saying goes and the Nazis were defeated. </SEG> 
<SEG id="638"> The punishment of remained. </SEG> 
<SEG id="639"> The tragedy of the trials against Milosevic, and consists of the fact that the "in the story in science. </SEG> 
<SEG id="640"> The fundamental being carried out on the part of the leaders of the persons responsible to competences, the methods, and to make it. </SEG>

<SEG id="643"> The Iraq presents itself as a between protecting all observers, Shiites, Sunnis and State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="644"> But a just basic dividing line of the growing gap between rich and poor, a line which contributed to the current as essential as the resistance against the of the Americans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="645"> As the Iraq was released, poor - people who, above all, hoped, the reality of the everyday life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="646"> These people are in fear of fear and had no idea how the democracy in their society would affect or as society and as a contribution to the composition of the future could afford. </SEG> 
<SEG id="647"> Recently in Iraq, with a new dividing line. </SEG> 
<SEG id="648"> On the one hand, those who had, in a democracy, and its objectives. </SEG> 
<SEG id="649"> They learnt to speak the language of democracy as one in this process to money and on how one independent organisations to benefit rights and privileges. </SEG> 
<SEG id="650"> On the other side of this line, however, the great majority of the line, including as well as or by their men or women of the for them and their children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="651"> For these people, democracy and human rights at all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="652"> They have no education, are poor and ill. </SEG> 
<SEG id="653"> As a victim of more than one which, through you only have knowledge, which could help them in the occupation of the economy to find jobs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="654"> While the reign of Saddam, there was no efforts to improve the standard of living of the poor. </SEG>

<SEG id="659"> Will they stop their men, women? </SEG> 
<SEG id="660"> Through our children? </SEG> 
<SEG id="661"> We will then have a right to divorce, separation of us who have? </SEG> 
<SEG id="662"> My answer to all these questions the "yes". </SEG> 
<SEG id="663"> Yes, the democracy gives you the right to a decent housing, education and work, your children will acquire the nationality and you will your men on an equal footing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="664"> You will have to work hard and every effort must be rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="665"> Discussions with the women: that science to live in fear. </SEG>

<SEG id="667"> In these destitute countries regions, where most of the life of the people, a bitter temptations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="668"> Many of them are not to be the government not to achieve. </SEG>

<SEG id="674"> We must cover the army of unemployed up. </SEG> 
<SEG id="675"> We must offer them the opportunity to contribute to the reconstruction of the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="676"> Every human being is by nature, but, to be a society. </SEG> 
<SEG id="677"> But the culture, which suffered under, convinced that only the only way for making money and knowledge to this attitude it takes time and a dynamic economy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="678"> That in turn means that the excessive power of the new Iraqi government must be limited to the growth of the private sector, to enable a more wide-ranging and understanding of democracy and human rights. </SEG> 
<SEG id="679"> Religious groups are prepared to make a contribution to this process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="680"> We can also the government under Saddam's, restored, so that they too have the chance to get their country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="681"> Not least, we must grant loans, the poor families, the life cycle. </SEG> 
<SEG id="682"> Above all outside the value of democracy and freedom and to convince them to show how important the condition for the implementation of their dreams of a better life. </SEG> 
<SEG id="683"> That is simply not in a country where many people to recognise law-breaking as heroic act. </SEG> 
<SEG id="684"> We have also, however, that that is not in the hands of the establishment of fair and that the fight against all forms of corruption. </SEG> 
<SEG id="685"> If the Constitution as a guarantor of democracy, freedom and security, the Iraqis must learn this fight to their fight. </SEG> 
<SEG id="686"> Identity </SEG> 
<SEG id="687"> One looks today, as the Islam as a political strength; (). </SEG> 
<SEG id="688"> Some, using it as a call to action; - (in the West and elsewhere in the West as a ") is the demarcation and exclusion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="689"> As a Turk I feel this debate on both sides. </SEG> 
<SEG id="690"> The reason why, in the view of the West as a "", is the fact that the request a religion based in the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="691"> Religion is not, of course, from the new, much more, it is the requirement, the religious institutions on the behaviour of the individual. </SEG> 
<SEG id="692"> Religion is in the modern world, a much persönlichere and spirituellere experience than ever before. </SEG> 
<SEG id="693"> But also within Islam was already a process based on experience. </SEG> 
<SEG id="694"> The politicisation of the authority of the religious classes of Islam, the ulema. </SEG> 
<SEG id="695"> As in the West of the country will experience in the West. </SEG> 
<SEG id="696"> One result of this is the interpretation of the text by the individual by part of the political climate and women. </SEG> 
<SEG id="697"> A different opinion, whereby the doctrine of the political objectives, in order to support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="698"> Who decides what is now in Islam, and what is forbidden? </SEG> 
<SEG id="699"> Who has the authority to interpret the texts? </SEG> 
<SEG id="700"> Who can 'one "or" a "one? </SEG> 
<SEG id="701"> In the worst case, a new source of legitimacy, or, or rather on. </SEG> 
<SEG id="702"> Therefore, to decide what Islam does or does not mean, and this without the authority and a special. </SEG> 
<SEG id="703"> These mainly of part of the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="704"> This made it possible for a local and national, local and national, local connection between all Muslims Muslims, where they feel oppressed and everywhere. </SEG> 
<SEG id="705"> I cannot, therefore, following the deeply fell out earlier, other estranged Muslims; and divided; it; and the revolutionary Iran. </SEG> 
<SEG id="706"> At the same time as its believers in the rural areas and in the cities, also in the West has also set in motion. </SEG> 
<SEG id="707"> This development, as somewhat negative, and stress that the people uprooted by what the alienation and for some to terrorism. </SEG> 
<SEG id="708"> However, mobility is also the condition in order to gain a modern perspective. </SEG> 
<SEG id="709"> Of course, the result of a feeling of the distance of, or even a complete break with its social origin. </SEG> 
<SEG id="710"> Therefore, the experience of a new analysis and for all national institutions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="711"> The American to a form of social idea, within which the people a sense, in the new and new. </SEG> 
<SEG id="712"> Not the dissociation of modern life, but the approach at the back on the religious identity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="713"> In fact in groups which, because they have found with the secular forms of political thinking and urban life in the West are familiar. </SEG> 
<SEG id="714"> Through the support they have in their support. </SEG>

<SEG id="717"> They show by each in their vicinity that they face and accurate their religious duties than those of their privacy, on its own. </SEG> 
<SEG id="718"> For example, normally in support of the oppression of women and the Muslim women. </SEG> 
<SEG id="719"> Instead of is a sign of the positive signs of the Islamic identity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="720"> Mohammedanische women in Europe can illustrate this right. </SEG> 
<SEG id="721"> Girls in French and German, French and German to stand in many respects (, namely with regard to the youth and their language consciousness and as their who are tied. </SEG> 
<SEG id="722"> While in Europe in the German public support in this the symbol, the symbol and the role of the Muslim women. </SEG> 
<SEG id="723"> This trend extends far beyond the law. </SEG> 
<SEG id="724"> All Muslims in the West have a double, a double cultural capital. </SEG> 
<SEG id="725"> The traditional, but they also have an extensive knowledge acquired knowledge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="726"> Because they have a double, they can also activities and between the various activities and move, as the youth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="727"> Muslim and Islamist is not the same. </SEG> 
<SEG id="728"> What we are seeing today, is the transformation of the Muslim identity to an Islamic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="729"> The country itself of individual lives shifts sector in the public sphere. </SEG> 
<SEG id="730"> The question whether the figure is whether the search for a question and a wide public acceptance of the religious practices of Islam can be met, or whether in the rejection of modernity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="731"> A new era for the science? </SEG> 
<SEG id="732"> As science and mathematics some one hundred years a phase of the large inventions comrade, stach a region of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="733"> There were the master these disciplines, the rapid progress made and the curious, as the nature of democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="734"> Not surprisingly, this region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="735"> On the other half of the planet were penalised, or even killed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="736"> The USA was as gottlos and absurd outlawed and later on the subject. </SEG> 
<SEG id="737"> The standard was too. </SEG> 
<SEG id="738"> The flourishing region was the near East, while a was further destruction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="739"> Both regions were determined by the religion (in connection with this, and the essence of religions in this context), but which, in only one of the two. </SEG> 
<SEG id="740"> Now, the roles of the East and the West, of course, now. </SEG> 
<SEG id="741"> Since the second world war, the United States, the world leader in the science. </SEG> 
<SEG id="742"> During this entire period the cleverest students from their homelands, their research and better possibilities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="743"> Until recently, is more than half of all university in the USA in the areas of mathematics, science and engineering science. </SEG> 
<SEG id="744"> Of, and both industry and the advantage. </SEG> 
<SEG id="745"> Meanwhile, the fight in an historic phase in the Western influence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="746"> Even in countries in which, even in countries which have not in such investment not encouraged, with the result that their companies is not so far advanced, as it can have. </SEG> 
<SEG id="747"> In recent times, as the technology to invest in, which are clearly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="748"> Such weapons have indeed political conviction, however, which is, is. </SEG> 
<SEG id="749"> The respect, is much more important than when the products of the past. </SEG> 
<SEG id="750"> One of the two, and that much. </SEG> 
<SEG id="751"> Would the political, if, when researchers in a key to combating AIDS and malaria against? </SEG> 
<SEG id="752"> This is a wasted opportunity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="753"> It is, however, still exists, and not only for the companies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="754"> The United States have allowed for in the recent past. </SEG> 
<SEG id="755"> Science was in the entire government by "by", "acquis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="756"> The reports of researchers by political and if the facts of the official. </SEG> 
<SEG id="757"> Through a shift, was the focus of the science on "and". </SEG> 
<SEG id="758"> Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 are less and less is more difficult to get what the influx of young talents. </SEG> 
<SEG id="759"> Large research organisations have protested fruitless. </SEG> 
<SEG id="760"> At the same time, the tax system, as amended in the short term to bring vermögenszuwächse what long-term investment in research. </SEG> 
<SEG id="761"> Half a billion dollars for the war in Iraq was available, a sum which in some of the support for the whole of the last one. </SEG> 
<SEG id="762"> Even if the USA a Middle ages, they clearly the loss of their research. </SEG> 
<SEG id="763"> Japan has the connection between political power and science in the early. </SEG> 
<SEG id="764"> Of the President of Sony, und der held a series of talks, the 1986 in a book with Japan can say no. </SEG> 
<SEG id="765"> In any case, that impact on the world leadership in the science. </SEG> 
<SEG id="766"> The idea was that the military power could be done, if the ",". </SEG> 
<SEG id="767"> The title of the title refers to "no", Japan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="768"> It is clearly possible, through the use of a knowledge-based economy. </SEG>

<SEG id="771"> Thus, for ausbildungsstiftung sein decided to use. </SEG> 
<SEG id="772"> This provided in the Harvard university and 15. </SEG> 
<SEG id="773"> The result is: in the area of air and space is so good, as, in Texas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="774"> Research and in the area of telecommunications, in Texas. </SEG> 
<SEG id="775"> Although the processing industry in the USA in the crisis has one of the strongest economies in the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="776"> There is no reason why the same result could not be achieved in the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="777"> First, the Islamic world, however, their newly and threatens to do. </SEG> 
<SEG id="778"> Iran over Iraq </SEG> 
<SEG id="779"> No country in the Middle East is concentrated more on the events in Iran. </SEG> 
<SEG id="780"> With its Western Iran, a long history of bloody conflicts with Saddam Hussein, the United States in the area and the concern about the policy of the United States in the region. </SEG> 
<SEG id="781"> In view of the continued tensions with the USA is and, above all, in the face of a potentially longer lasting in Iraq, as well as on the part of Saddam Hussein. </SEG> 
<SEG id="782"> It is probably difficult internal debates in Iran to follow, but these discussions there and, even if it is on a major general view is clear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="783"> In this debate on Iraq after Saddam Hussein. </SEG> 
<SEG id="784"> The pragmatists are of the opinion that the Iran with the USA in the basic, even if it is only going to uphold the rights of the area. </SEG> 
<SEG id="785"> For this reason, it should be Iran, that a new im not und. </SEG> 
<SEG id="786"> Further to the fundamental interests of the pragmatists belong to the preservation of the territorial integrity of Iraq and the mark. </SEG> 
<SEG id="787"> The moderate want the Iranian government an Iraq could be) and the organisation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="788"> In return, the Iranian government should their support for the preservation of peace, stability and security in Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="789"> In a word, on an agenda, national issues of Iran is concerned. </SEG> 
<SEG id="790"> This approach is in large part of Conservative forces in Iran. </SEG> 
<SEG id="791"> Another approach, a more active role in the reconstruction of Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="792"> Although the opinion, would actually and institutional infrastructure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="793"> In the United States and the international Community will recognise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="794"> In return for the: in the monopoly of a promise. activities of the activities of the opposition Members. </SEG> 
<SEG id="795"> It is mainly the supporters of this position, however, is that of the American side is guaranteed, that the country is not the aim of the military action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="796"> Briefly, of an open and clear, in the current phase in Iraq and promises, cooperative relations with each of the government, which should come to maintain and maintains that the assurance for a reform of its regional and international standing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="797"> This opinion will, above all, of Iranian reformists - within and outside the government - and the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="798"> For the radical, Finally, the possibility of cooperation with the USA pure fantasy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="799"> They do not fall to undermine the security of Iran and its national interests. </SEG> 
<SEG id="800"> In the eyes of the radicals, the United States and major changes to the Iranian foreign policy budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="801"> In the worst case, so that the Americans, for a change of regime in Iran. </SEG> 
<SEG id="802"> They will remain by Iran and possibly even try to the Muslim world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="803"> This radical regarding the American invasion of Iraq as a part of the American strategy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="804"> In the United States they must Iran with aggressive, its interests to respond to these alliances with Russia and other regional powers and its influence in the Treaties, in order to make a proamerikanische anti-iranische government to prevent in Baghdad. </SEG> 
<SEG id="805"> This approach to the support of all the political groups. </SEG> 
<SEG id="806"> The way the regime was in the Iraq crisis. </SEG> 
<SEG id="807"> Now comes the hard part: peace and stability in the war against terrorism and to win the war against terrorism and that it is not the case, the intention is to occupy take and the Middle East for the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="808"> Meanwhile, the rejection of the USA in the form of suicide attacks and other forms of terrorism will very probably still. </SEG> 
<SEG id="809"> Iran is an important power in the region, because its dynamism and its Muslim identity documents large response in the Muslim world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="810"> What happens in Iraq has a major impact on Iran and the United States would be well advised to face up to this fact. </SEG> 
<SEG id="811"> The American threats or it resentment and frustration and strengthen the radical forces. </SEG> 
<SEG id="812"> If the USA such a development, should they wish to avoid the impact of their own their own and recognise that the American interests in Iraq at best through an extensive cooperation with Iran. </SEG> 
<SEG id="813"> The way out of Iraq </SEG> 
<SEG id="814"> Finally, in Iraq, reached the point at which the: the withdrawal of that country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="815"> The recently from the British Ministry of defence about troop withdrawal underlines this desire. </SEG> 
<SEG id="816"> The only question is how to follow it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="817"> As long as the violence will escalate. </SEG> 
<SEG id="818"> But it will also come to an escalation of the only faster. </SEG> 
<SEG id="819"> The real question is therefore how one arrives at the point at which the Iraq a police and army, the one zutraut, law and order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="820"> There is still a long way to this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="821"> In spite of the army or police, that no one should be surprised if some subjects, which are not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="822"> In Northern Iraq, and be pursued through paid in areas as irbil which traditionally ethnically mixed were a de facto ethnic separation of taxation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="823"> In other areas, the law is enforced. </SEG> 
<SEG id="824"> How can the hopes which one is an effective and impartial enforcement of the law, the law on? </SEG> 
<SEG id="825"> The answer is, to train them, and the 'them'. </SEG> 
<SEG id="826"> But it is not sufficient time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="827"> Other possibilities are necessary. </SEG> 
<SEG id="828"> Without a profound takes the values enshrined in civil society organisations on the basis that the police and army for the environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="829"> This could take various forms, but really it is important that the people at local level, and indeed of the structures of level, at regional and national level, be supported if they abuse. </SEG> 
<SEG id="830"> If there is a whose value is recognised, most Members of the forces and, if they do, and if they do not, they can simply be dealt with accordingly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="831"> This remarkable in Afghanistan, a country that Iraq is in many respects, there are various groups, the work on this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="832"> The cooperation for peace and (cpau) provides a model of how this can be done. </SEG> 
<SEG id="833"> Just as in Iraq, the dismantling of the call for the ordinary people in Afghanistan top priority. </SEG> 
<SEG id="834"> The cpau has in the last three years throughout the country on the Councils. </SEG> 
<SEG id="835"> The initiative it has to do with a culture in the violence, so that in early, while they counted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="836"> The Committee therefore try to all parts of the Union together, teachers, leaders, religious leaders, women, the police, soldiers, judges and businesspeople, in order to find new ways to the peaceful resolution of conflicts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="837"> Although, our practice is not part of the role of the Committee was (this is for the future of), the mere fact that police, army and by the Committee, they belong in contact with the rest of the Community, this provides feedback and creates confidence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="838"> Some are noteworthy results. </SEG> 
<SEG id="839"> In a workshop is enormous and remained at the end for the whole week. </SEG> 
<SEG id="840"> Towards the end of his violent past and in private. </SEG> 
<SEG id="841"> Now to the Bureau of the Committee. </SEG> 
<SEG id="842"> In their present projects such as the humanitarian humanitarian) in meeting a monitoring function to fulfil, while the ethnically mixed population on the possibility of the problems with the solution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="843"> But all too often judicial decisions, even if they were not the result of an organisation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="844"> From the American and British forces has been much good work for the strengthening of civil society. </SEG> 
<SEG id="845"> We hear nothing about the over to the authorisation of women or the successful organisation of local elections in small everywhere in the country. </SEG> 
<SEG id="846"> But the mobilisation of civil society is an enormous challenge, especially when, as in Iraq, quickly and in large extent has to happen. </SEG> 
<SEG id="847"> Incentives are still needed but as incentives for disarmament, including the prospect of economic opportunities, the more than that and blackmail. </SEG> 
<SEG id="848"> Fortunately, the construction of civil society and democratic products as important. </SEG> 
<SEG id="849"> It is entirely in the humanitarian during the annual costs of Nice. </SEG> 
<SEG id="850"> With $10 million could further of, and this would be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="851"> The challenge is to commit themselves to this approach, it is fully behind the courageous people to put the environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="852"> Otherwise, it is unlikely that the Iraqis to obtain them after so many years of suffering so urgently need. </SEG> 
<SEG id="853"> Democracy at Nile came into effect? </SEG> 
<SEG id="854"> The decision of the Egyptian President President Mubarak for an amendment, in which the President shall make should be introduced in Egypt and in the entire Arab world as a whole. </SEG> 
<SEG id="855"> For people in the West, which are accustomed to, it is difficult to understand what a change in a country associated with it could be that for more than 50 years under military occupation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="856"> In the current system in which all citizens only six years on the day of the election in the elections and the single name on the name on or not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="857"> That explains why someone as return each time over 90% of the votes, even though in this election. </SEG> 
<SEG id="858"> Syrian and three from the systems with a still better, but because the names and addresses the voters on any only aufzuscheinen had. </SEG> 
<SEG id="859"> They were long, the democratisation process in the Middle East will not progress until also could fully participating in it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="860"> Egypt could not follow the path of development but, without changing its Constitution, namely the phenomenal powers to restrict its President and its term of office. </SEG> 
<SEG id="861"> It is already in the year of his term as President. </SEG> 
<SEG id="862"> Therefore, the election to provide an important first step. </SEG> 
<SEG id="863"> The regime is perhaps that this process can be of benefit to the course of events, but that is not so easy to monitor, if the people have the feeling, with budgetary matters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="864"> The bottle of democracy would have. </SEG> 
<SEG id="865"> Anyway, is not the only country in this region, which is now on the path towards democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="866"> Turkey on the one side of the Middle East and agreement on the other are already underway. </SEG> 
<SEG id="867"> The real pressure, but it appears from the strict timetables, and the positive results of the recent elections in Iraq, in Palestine, and, to a lesser extent in Saudi Arabia. </SEG> 
<SEG id="868"> With the unprecedented demonstrations against the Syrian occupation in Lebanon, in the wake of the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri there seems to be no end in sight. </SEG> 
<SEG id="869"> But which, in the last two weeks and and other forms of civil disobedience. </SEG> 
<SEG id="870"> Their anger was fuelled by the arrest of health oppositionschefs attacks eiman only at the end of January. </SEG> 
<SEG id="871"> The national government, led to a revival of the national "resuscitation for the end of the process. </SEG> 
<SEG id="872"> Suddenly the widespread in Tunisia, and this aspect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="873"> An Alliance of local, regional and international powers to vote at the Nile. </SEG> 
<SEG id="874"> The latest shock from the population seems to have become the regime. </SEG> 
<SEG id="875"> Only a month: demands for a constitutional reform as ". </SEG> 
<SEG id="876"> But what of necessary, an initiative that should be welcomed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="877"> This is a necessary step towards the first step to the modification of the system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="878"> The government is already mentioned in relation to alibireformen à la Tunisia, where langzeitpräsident its al-abidin Ben Ali the caricature of an amendment which created, in kompetitive elections and, indeed, but to a scheinwahlgang resulted in a few select "shall" office. </SEG> 
<SEG id="879"> During the presidential elections in Ben Ali a 99% of the vote in this election, there were 96%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="880"> We hope therefore that Palestine. </SEG> 
<SEG id="881"> As a must for the immediate release of eiman only arrange and to take action, in order for 20 years from a State of emergency, to conclude a campaign actively. </SEG> 
<SEG id="882"> Furthermore, the demands for a restriction of the term of office. </SEG> 
<SEG id="883"> Confidence-building measures, including measures, including equal access and equal access to the media, which are currently under State control. </SEG> 
<SEG id="884"> I have announced that I intend, during the coming to bring about such a debate on these fundamental reforms. </SEG> 
<SEG id="885"> I would, however, again with pleasure in again, if free and open elections in this autumn be guaranteed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="886"> In spite of equal opportunities. </SEG> 
<SEG id="887"> Together with the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine, for a long überfälliger might of the freedom of the spring. </SEG> 
<SEG id="888"> Elections in Egypt? </SEG> 
<SEG id="889"> All the candidates, also for 24 years, Mr President, President Mubarak. </SEG> 
<SEG id="890"> Although his re-election almost beyond doubt, one which places but with great interest. </SEG> 
<SEG id="891"> This choice to 6 000 national election observers and hundreds of foreign journalists issue this week in Egypt. </SEG> 
<SEG id="892"> Although the external criteria really fair, are important aspects of the credibility, however, in flagrant manner. </SEG> 
<SEG id="893"> Despite the promise is one of equality is miles away. </SEG> 
<SEG id="894"> It prevents disproportionately in the regulation: a de facto monopoly on the on the electronic media, as well as about 85%. </SEG> 
<SEG id="895"> A week before the elections of the service. </SEG> 
<SEG id="896"> It is the responsibility of that with the new one. </SEG> 
<SEG id="897"> According to a judgment of the Court of justice must since the year 2000, the police and the excellent results. </SEG> 
<SEG id="898"> This judgment was an important step in the direction of fair elections, because the judges in the last 50 years of the State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="899"> Therefore, the mubarak-regime on various fall within the foreseeable auszubooten. </SEG> 
<SEG id="900"> One was adopted in the "" also, on which a conclusion in, indeed, but no experience, but so has the genuine with it, because in a protest by to this job once again of the police, because in. </SEG>

<SEG id="906"> Until now, it provides for a stalemate, because the chairman of the electoral Commission has publicly in has stated that he who control by the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="907"> A further interesting development on the eve of the election is the intense public debate about whether its or the now. </SEG> 
<SEG id="908"> Several Members have their population, the choice of protest against the too restrictive, and the other candidates. </SEG> 
<SEG id="909"> On the other side of the strongest in Egypt in Egypt, the Muslim brotherhood, their supporters of the USA and asks you to reach a decision, not by any ",". </SEG>

<SEG id="1344"> Obviously there would be two countries without access to foreign markets. </SEG>

<SEG id="1364"> What many of the participants in the negotiations and other political decision-makers negotiations have not yet understood - it would have it - is that this turn of events enormous repercussions on the worldwide balance of powers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1365"> It will do no other aspect of the globalization of the leaders of our world in the coming decades before major challenges. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1366"> The questions which are diverse. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1367"> The rich countries are our only ready for a our in which they are not less than the developing countries require the developing countries? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1368"> Are you ready for the inevitable flow of power and influence to producers, there? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1369"> How will the China, Russia and the USA, to deal with the fact that important - that of Africa on the Middle East and Central Asia, with with? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1370"> Some self-styled, including the problem than a limited natural resources, in which the world with an alarming pace somewhat critical of raw materials. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1371"> There are nowadays many supporters of the production, which means that we have the upper limit of that the sources and that from now on all only worse. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1372"> However, as the leading Dan historian Dan prophets of doom have already stated, that the world of. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1373"> Every time has been led to this threat. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1374"> At the end of the nineteenth century in which production. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1375"> Today, at the same time the bottom of the sea. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1376"> There has been progress in the area of agriculture throughout the directive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1377"> No, the world does not stand, that their raw materials. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1378"> What happens is that the two and a half billion people in China and India alone) in the world economy, that would be the raw material as well. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1379"> Therefore, at least for the next 50 to 75 years, and perhaps, until the people sometime in the next committed with the mining industry, on the mining. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1380"> Will the formation of a new balance of power? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1381"> The first world war was clearly, partly through the action that would have a far too large proportion of the worldwide material. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1382"> In a similar way in the second world war is similar to the stability of its supply of oil and other natural resources from abroad. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1383"> Similar between the poor China (where even the water) and the request)? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1384"> Fortunately, this is not likely to be pragmatic and pragmatic approach, especially in view of the Chinese leadership to the solution. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1385"> The Chinese themselves in the direction of regions such as Africa and hope to find. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1386"> They do not want that the Americans, not just with the just trade, but they also want. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1387"> Then there are those who speak, the concern to make in terms of energy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1388"> All in all this, however, is a joke: they may be, they never. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1389"> A large part of the Arab world, the invasion in Iraq, as a cornerstone of the stone, the stability of its strategy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1390"> If this is true, it only remains to hope that America on a plan B. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1391"> In the meantime, the while trade Meanwhile. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1392"> Perhaps the true in the USA, to try, so that, in the USA, to make these constrained to hold? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1393"> This is, however, would have. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1394"> Hard line during the elections in Iran </SEG> 
<SEG id="1395"> The Commission, as the Mayor of liner,, the next President of Iran is likely to worsen the relations and the West. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1396"> What the internal matters, and this is still on the Islamic regime certainly better than a moderateres result. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1397"> Clearly, has a broad base of trailers. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1398"> But the fact that it was an election, spoke to help the poor, the achievements of the government and the opposition, almost as a candidate, is irrelevant: it was the choice of the regime, and at the end of the regime, and representatives of the official aid. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1399"> The regime has played its outstanding. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1400"> It was the something a little more, with some of the current political action was not agreed, as a figure of ", and made its own. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1401"> The government used its own power and its own. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1402"> The fact that the last President, was a supporter, even if a also, ultimately achieve anything, just as the rulers of the political situation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1403"> Is a representative of the younger activists and against the Shah before a quarter of a century. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1404"> He was directly to the kidnapping of the hostages in Iran, although the precise extent of its involvement remains controversial. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1405"> It concerns the fact that that the representatives of the most extreme elements in Iran: the greater the guardians of the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1406"> The first is a parallel, an organization, the second organisation and everyone and all the others. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1407"> Nevertheless, the concern that an even more radical solution in Iran came to power, even by two factors. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1408"> Firstly, will probably try to concentrate on internal Affairs and the standard of living of the poorest the lift, with what success is unclear. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1409"> Secondly, the same Group, since the revolution in the power of the policy and foreign policy in the policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1410"> The President has less power, as it appears, and, above all, by. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1411"> What makes quite clearly what kind of a kind of policy and stability in the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1412"> First you indicated, above all, the most extreme elements in Iran and the terrorist into the country (the Lebanese Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad and various small groups against Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Arab countries), that you gave the Green light for attacks. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1413"> They take, in that they supported by what they do. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1414"> For many people, is Iran, relatively cautious but secretly it is the world's leading terrorsponsor. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1415"> Sometimes individual cooperation and perhaps in the basic arranged and certain operations, and now they are still feel free to do this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1416"> Moreover, such represents for the for the production of nuclear weapons. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1417"> Most of the Iranian politicians - at least the difficulties of the government was to support the programme, however, draw a before. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1418"> Would, for example, the construction of economic relations and on an initiative at the nuclear front. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1419"> With, as a President of Iran, it is probable that the weapons on that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1420"> That does not mean that he would fire, but rather that it under any circumstances, for the purpose of the threats. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1421"> Since the increased the risk of a State like their and the USA to combat (and especially on his way to vote on a picture of the American way), has increased the risk of a confrontation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1422"> Finally, and probably the stability in Iraq on in Iraq, and will be in itself encourage radical and officials in Iraq itself. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1423"> Iran has already agents in Iraq, and support for, the country into a clone. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1424"> The Iraqis, including the Shiite Muslims, the direction of Islam, such action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1425"> A militantere attitude will encourage the friction with Iraq, and there may strengthen further anti-American violence. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1426"> In short, the result of the elections in Iran is dangerous, although its exact destabilising effect we will depend on how and how and how much power granted to him. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1427"> Moreover, the dealings with a mass, which is so open and even at the of the regime is, not only for us but also for Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1428"> The European countries try to do so would be identical to rhetoric and a diplomatic solution to the Iran ’ s nuclear ambitions to be found? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1429"> With more, it would have been a real agreement or of a cooperation policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1430"> Yet, with a high degree of appeasement will be necessary in order to even the smallest diplomatic processes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1431"> Some Iranian reformists and that the choice of the argument that the government, its government, the true face of the regime and and all their hopes for a compromise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1432"> However, the success of the success of the regime to reflect the problems over a quarter of a century. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1433"> Whatever the outcome, will mean that everything that has to do with Iran, likely even more difficult. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1434"> The participation of the rich, </SEG> 
<SEG id="1435"> President Bush seems to be going out to America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1436"> With President Bush 's accession so far, that is the one and only budget surpluses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1437"> Today, the budgetary deficits, and as a result of the, the economy of the market and an enormous increase in defence spending. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1438"> It is even worse, because an agreement and, under the leadership of the Republicans went there. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1439"> The damage they cause, is likely to be the USA, and to contribute to the economy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1440"> The State of the Republican Party have for national Budgets. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1441"> The office itself under the government of under Republicans) also recommended at the expense of large deficits. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1442"> President Reagan promised the American population, both for how the military hochrüstung and the continuation of the market or by you and all at the same time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1443"> The result - not surprising - was a series of huge deficits, which again people years claimed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1444"> Both President George Bush, as well as bill Clinton had, in order to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1445"> The increases in taxes were to President Bush 's election. bill Clinton in 1992. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1446"> Nevertheless, but, on the way to a balanced budget, and it did this in part also secured the financing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1447"> In the year 2000, as with the office was the best for decades. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1448"> Then President President George Bush appeared on to President and, indeed, with extensive reductions and the updating and forces or expenses. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1449"> The result was foreseeable. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1450"> In January 2001 was the cumulative result for the years 2002-2011 nor on all veranschlagt billion dollars Überschuss. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1451"> In this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1452"> In view of this and of the situation and the war in Iraq, a war, the Bush administration and Congress under the leadership of the Republicans went with the Republicans. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1453"> But no, you set your top priority to further reductions in the first line. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1454"> At the same time, calls on the government distinct increases in the same. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1455"> Now that, after the presidential elections in November 2004, will certainly be no meaningful deductions on non-military spending programme. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1456"> It appears, therefore, that it is in the EU the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1457"> Even if the internal political issues for the same proportion of expenditure, the cumulative result in the next ten years to a over the next ten years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1458"> But this figure could still be too optimistic, because it takes into consideration the tax is not sufficiently into account, not even a further round of harmony and not at the risk of higher interest rates in the years ahead. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1459"> Why do the worry about the? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1460"> Some voters are cuts for the wealthy, than almost anything else. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1461"> Others believe that high what the impact of State for what they wish. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1462"> The problem is just that the problem of most of the programmes, and they will, therefore, therefore. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1463"> A lot of question: why are the Americans for such political programmes, where they should, but Nevertheless. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1464"> An answer said, many voters simply not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1465"> A better response to the fact that, in fact, the most not voted for such programmes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1466"> The turnout at the elections of 2002 was only 40% of the votes cast. about only half the voters, the only 20% of the voters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1467"> Naturally, the views to be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1468"> The war in Iraq can be prevented. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1469"> The proposed cuts or be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1470"> But I will say huge deficits in the coming years; and a in the USA and in increasing unease about the economic situation in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1471"> Investors from abroad might decide to have not even to America. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1472"> The dollar will probably be weaker and more inflationsängste could forward. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1473"> All this will be the us-politiker less reliable and flexible on the economic shocks by legislation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1474"> The poor, both within the USA as well as suffer most, when President Bush and the Congress of the American people and the world that, because of the large deficits, the problems of poverty, in order to be able to address. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1475"> If the and the up and can take seriously the with a gift of many billions of dollars, regardless of the country and the people in the coming years and will have to bear the consequences. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1476"> Lessons from the policy of the USA </SEG> 
<SEG id="1477"> George W. Bush has more than any other President in American history for everything, the economic policy, and has made. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1478"> In just three, he has destroyed office political consensus, to establish a decade and again had to establish a further could possibly could. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1479"> Europe must have long-term economic health and social stability is at stake. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1480"> In the long-term challenges for the budget, which the USA, from the case can be important lessons for other countries. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1481"> The problem of the financial policy that politicians on tax and an increase in public spending and an increase of the massive public debts, the State. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1482"> This trick can operate a few years; sooner rather than later, however, budget deficits and indebtedness and increasing a political U-turn. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1483"> A politician, however, can be so his re-election and so is the crisis then retirement. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1484"> It should mean that the requests for worldwide, the Union would episode in the last analysis of this type by companies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1485"> And so, however, comes out by: he himself as the massive tax, while at the same time the expenditure on education and health. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1486"> The result is a deficit of more than 5% of the gross domestic product. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1487"> Worse still, the long-term prospects for the next budget already alarming, before its began. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1488"> The age; hence results for the future of public health in the public health and pensions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1489"> Careful calculations show that on the basis of the recommendation of the Tobin tax and erzielbaren the costs of pensions, healthcare and use of the expected public spending are likely to some ten billion dollars below. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1490"> At some point in the future, therefore, a strong increase in taxes, and cuts in public expenditure, or both together, in order to make the actions needed to correct. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1491"> Why, therefore, its policy? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1492"> The reason is that the public can understanding or concern for these consequences, although, in the end. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1493"> The richest, are of course pleased, because they benefit most of these cuts. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1494"> It is unbelievable, but nearly half of the 5% under the taxpayers, and these are obviously also expect that the remaining 95% - and the poor - the largest part of the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1495"> Meanwhile has put many requests from the Middle and means that they can also be pleased - without you to say that you for their small cuts with considerable say in the future must be able to have to pay if the policy of its government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1496"> The Americans have a political were you aware that this tax, eight "in the last 20 years to tax policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1497"> As, however, we were promised tax cuts and a substantial increase in military expenditure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1498"> The result was a huge deficit in the 1980s. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1499"> However, the cuts made and to his re-election in 1984. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1500"> Then it lasted over a decade - of reagans second term about the presidencies of taxes and bill Clinton - about the shortfall again in a budget surplus. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1501"> Of course this is the granting of new taxes, what the cost and the changes to the landscape. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1502"> The story might be allowed back in. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1503"> Some orientated towards the right to believe that the administration deep cuts in public expenditure in the end. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1504"> They hope to a dismantling of social security and the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1505"> In the American public, however, a broad support. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1506"> The strategy of the political rights, rights to lower taxes, in order to force the will fail, and therefore the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1507"> Others within the Bush administration, that is important, for the USA to pull out of recession. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1508"> This argument is wrong. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1509"> The economy would without these cuts recovers, perhaps even substantially. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1510"> An enormous, it is a great mistake, a long-term. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1511"> For other countries, but that arise from it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1512"> The first is that the process of the USA will sooner or later have to be set. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1513"> The Americans have only just because they are not therefore supports it did not have to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1514"> As soon as the Americans themselves have to decide whether they want to finance by higher taxes, are very much will be lower. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1515"> Indeed, it will in the course of the discussion to a discussion about the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1516"> The second lesson is that countries the rising cost of an ageing population, the rise in costs. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1517"> The situation is clearly neither the neither Parliament nor the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1518"> Governments should be obliged, together with their the budgetary situation of the draft, in order to counteract the short-term, politically motivated to counteract the budget. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1519"> The USA can other countries as early as early. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1520"> The White House should the same warning this evening, what their on television to her:, attempts to this House. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1521"> The political </SEG> 
<SEG id="1522"> Many economic and financial analysts complaining that the stock of emerging countries often heavily rigged by their governments would rather than economically and politically. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1523"> In contrast, seems to insist, to insist that the original force of an economic nature and, therefore, its value, with a comparable for her. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1524"> This description of markets in the developing countries is not wrong, only partial, because the same description for that in common rules. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1525"> The best analysts to know that a value of every country and every means, as well as on the stock exchange stock. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1526"> If the United States, with the greatest of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1527"> The general opinion, competitive companies from the government can operate freely and the returns on investments at a us exchange reflect the basic powers of a strong capitalist economic system. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1528"> This is one of the reasons why the United States on from all over the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1529"> However, the American purse, are a sensitive political balance. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1530"> In particular, the influence of changing political pressure in the course of time. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1531"> So, as of the second world war, the political support for large in general and the government has the tax on profits, one and high incomes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1532"> As the second world war thorough relaxation of the worldwide President Roosevelt and a tax on excessive profits, in order to ensure that provide very would not benefit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1533"> In 1980, as there was no war, the exchange, however, however, which, however, a man, the many for the right to very much. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1534"> He demanded - and the highest priority on and high incomes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1535"> Political interference in the stock is not restricted solely to taxes on and high incomes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1536"> Wealth taxes, excise duties and VAT - who, directly or indirectly, of companies - can be paid in erweitertem measure on the stock market and distribution channels. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1537"> Wherever always it is no coincidence that governments for a chance so far, to provide increased taxes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1538"> The policy of the taxes on. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1539"> On the contrary, almost on reach, and in response to the stock. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1540"> According to the market in general the government put out and allowed it to the companies, authorities and their power. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1541"> This policy, the recovery of high unemployment, but even that was not sufficient for the political forces to rein in favour of. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1542"> Equally, it was one of the most important things, the President, who has done, parts of the power of the American trade unions to destroy the to the enterprise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1543"> Reagans risk of fluglotsenstreiks of 1981 was a turning point for the American trade Union movement - and for the stock, whose spectacular börsenhausse in 1982. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1544"> Since the speculative courses prices in the year 2000, in the year 2000, the us administration has energetically, especially through the lowering of interest rates. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1545"> This was, of course, this measure to the economy, not to support the 2000. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1546"> It is, however, a revealing indication of the importance of a us exchange, that the aktienkursverfall for one of the most important factors were held on the economy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1547"> The reaction of the authorities of the limit. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1548"> The economic calculation shows that the tax on company profits (the percentage of profits, which is actually in the form of taxes on the government form% in the first quarter of the year 2000 of the year 2000 and the economy in general - in the fourth quarter of 2003 on the general, as the market had a low. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1549"> This reflects to a large part of the Congress, as well as the opinion of companies that can make in the current economic and political and economic. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1550"> If that was out of the following the crash of 35% to 15% has been reduced, which, as an essential in all the effect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1551"> This reduction was justified, as konjunkturanreiz what one, of course, virtually every action during the discussions at the stock. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1552"> It is, however, the balance of political forces on the credibility of the credibility of Parliament. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1553"> One might say that the same variables, including the negative attitude towards high taxes and the Union in the USA since the last 200 years at work - and we can therefore assume that they will be in the future, and Besides attracting foreign investment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1554"> Those who think that investments in the in the same trend for decades could be maintained, quite right. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1555"> It should, however, realise what one. </SEG>

<SEG id="1614"> No other important Bank after the at the markets up to 7 / 8 June the interests, as, when it acts (the ECB and the Central banks, South and Turkey). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1615"> A further factor is the Ölpreis, between the 22 March and 2 may to 20% and this number of absolute highs failed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1616"> This was an important event, and it is clear that it effects on the stock markets throughout the world. </SEG>

<SEG id="1620"> Stock markets do not necessarily especially, and so could be a delayed reaction. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1621"> As with all the other prices on the financial rise. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1622"> If in the level of the people, the people on the basis of the news and talk about the unacceptable and what an increasing. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1623"> The crisis in the Middle East, which is in the news in may, in connection with the. </SEG>

<SEG id="1628"> This may be the appearance after much further away from the policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1629"> But the public reaction to you, together with the recent rise to it may be a good part of the change. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1630"> The willingness to take over the course of time, and can do as well. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1631"> Such things happened on heavily quantifiable, and should be the analysts in its efforts, the development of the global markets, the remarks that just as much attention as those bernankes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1632"> It does not like the look its attention on the attitude of the public and of, the worldwide. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1633"> Finally, you would admit that historical events that have even less and less as they would like. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1634"> But one such point of a sense. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1635"> What moves and indeed? </SEG>

<SEG id="1660"> If the people to pay for a for a society, because the, have nothing against the big, that the market is distorted. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1661"> Why are you, then, if the consumers themselves decide, the majority of the money, so that they know that without poisonous chemicals in which, by farmers, which it can now afford to waste? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1662"> The small farmers would be if people wanted to help their children and children to $10 for a fairer society not her children of fear, not just the and to help the poor children with food and education is provided. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1663"> That is a possible strategy, however, has certain advantages. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1664"> The farmers know that they provide a product that consumers like, both in geschmacklicher ', as well as in the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1665"> If their product can, they can be proud to have to have in the whole world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1666"> From the point of view of the producers, it is better to got through the sales to receive received, which they did, regardless of whether they whether or not, and whether the quality of the product. </SEG>

<SEG id="1684"> In addition, these that the animal waste or another. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1685"> After protests of organizations, the European Union several years in their scientific veterinary Committee, a report on this type of livestock farming in order. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1686"> In the report of the Committee came to the conclusion that the animals suffer, you do not have to be able to do anything. </SEG>

<SEG id="1692"> In the USA the measures of this kind are in sight. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1693"> If my European friends in the past asked why the USA Europe in terms of animal protection so far behind in, I did not answer. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1694"> The questions were questions, as I had to admit that the fact that the Americans to admit that the Europeans. </SEG>

<SEG id="1703"> In contrast, goes in the United States in the area of concern in the area of the protection. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1704"> Neither still at the level of the individual States, there is a legislation for the protection of animals. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1705"> The reason for this is to be my position, millions of dollars in into millions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1706"> In the area of lobbying and wahlkampfspenden could the tierschutzbewegung despite the broad public support, with these guidelines can. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1707"> In more money than the opinion of the voters. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1708"> Europe is weak and the problem must find the money for their re-election itself, and such elections stand in case it House every two years. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1709"> In Europe, where Europe and not the candidates, but the political parties, should play a role. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1710"> In the USA, where one is on its democratic traditions, pigs and calves, in the only losers. </SEG>

<SEG id="1712"> The aspect of the Afghan interim government (even angezettelte) murder of one luftfahrtministers through a mob shows that the Afghan society is deeply divided. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1713"> The first reforms in one of these divisions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1714"> The defence Ministers in Hamid Übergangsregierung in Kabul has the highest have this new army already appointed. </SEG>

<SEG id="1716"> In his appointments are a danger for the country to unite. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1717"> Afghanistan is a and multi-ethnic State in which the Pashtuns with two case constitute the majority of the population. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1718"> In each case, the population of the population. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1719"> Are now of general in the national officers thirty-seven and a usbeke. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1720"> So any relative service of the fifteen up seventeen million for the Pashtuns, therefore, will serve the almost exclusively from exclusively. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1721"> The language of the Pashtuns differs from that of the exclusively, however, as much as German of Spanish and millions of retracted in wehrfähigen age have no fragmentary knowledge of the tadschikischen language. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1722"> The geographical origin of the new military is just as closely as possible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1723"> Thirty-five officers come from the region of the North of the province of ((where the airport)) and the close to that of the former. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1724"> In other words, this means that for the aid to the new military leadership of the country's locked. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1725"> It may be that a Group could benefit the impression that we are concerned about a clique, nor is it if they at least one representative of more than a. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1726"> However, that is not the case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1727"> Eighteen the highest have come out of the jamiat-e-islami, an Islamic Party, which has for a long time, by the theologieprofessor Mullah burhanuddin Rabbani was stated. </SEG>

<SEG id="1729"> Twice as many Members of the army leadership. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1730"> Sixteen were connected were connected with this Party in the late 1970s years of the last century to the Soviet invasion between 1979 and has led to the cost. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1731"> Today, the Communists in Afghanistan about as popular as Hitler ’ s national Socialists in the Czech Republic and Poland. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1732"> Of course, the people in Afghanistan, as well as many of the Communist Party, for all sorts of reasons, and not at all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1733"> But six of the generals were professional staff of the Communist Party and round the invasion of the red army in the service of the Communists. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1734"> These six men and even three further served in the Afghan army, as have's occupation of the ten years of Afghanistan with the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1735"> One, as the French have reacted if a quarter of the French a after the second world war, during the occupation or with the armed forces. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1736"> In Afghanistan, in itself. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1737"> So, who (which almost all Afghans) shortly on the will of the political knowledge, if you do not do it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1738"> Even this overwhelming evidence for the one-sidedness and selective composition of the population could still be fairly indifferent, if the generals, at least, professionalism and commitment for patriotic values in their work einbrächten. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1739"> Unfortunately, but only thirty-eight of general have on a military background. </SEG>

<SEG id="1743"> First of all, that the Commander of the international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, as well as in Afghanistan, as well as in the case of a meeting with the diplomats, with the Afghan meetings, one for its history and, to a war, the partner with old friends in the red army in Moscow. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1744"> Furthermore, it means that the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, as well as the stabschef and the head of the Communists are also whose loyalties are uncertain and which has caused mistrust. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1745"> Can one with a country with a country again? </SEG>

<SEG id="1767"> To put it quite plainly: the models have contributed to contributed to; the consequence, with its supporters of them on the economic ones, have helped with helped. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1768"> Good science recognises their own borders, but the prophets of models of rational or not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1769"> And that was a leader in the development of the economy is based on the idea that one in the lab. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1770"> One reason for the fact that and that it is less so little so that farmers can carry out no. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1771"> Nature provides experiments, but in the majority of cases, as in so many things so quickly that it is often difficult to was cause for what was. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1772"> We are, in principle, in a laboratory controlled attempts to implement and recover rather sound conclusions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1773"> The critics of the economy to consider that the subjects of into the world of thinking, that they feel that the can therefore not so clean and, hence, as in the natural sciences. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1774"> Nevertheless and economic experiments insight into a number of important items, as the improved management of auctions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1775"> The result was that the irrationality of the participants in the centre of the work has, reiterated in the context of confirmed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1776"> The results of those relating to selfishness. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1777"> It shows, in any case, in that the that are not, as in the case of the small farmers is a Group - the farmers themselves. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1778"> That is because the economy than that, the more, or because the form? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1779"> The answer is, with great security: a bit of both. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1780"> A future research will help the question about the weight of the two other in relation to education. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1781"> The Nobel Prize, how important it is, people and people, as they are, to study and not as we would like it to be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1782"> Only if we understand the people better understanding, we also hope to the effect that our economies work better. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1783"> The </SEG> 
<SEG id="1784"> In one of the surrealeren meetings of this year ’ s world economic forum in Davos declared experts from the Ölbranche that the ice caps melt away, and the faster than anyone had predicted, not only a problem, but also a chance: great Ölmengen are now perhaps accessible. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1785"> Just as this one, the fact that the United States signs (the international Convention, the international Convention, and other rights of raw materials, here we have a risk. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1786"> Yet again they refer to two: to ask the search for the President of the right to ask the right. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1787"> President George W. Bush has a weird talent for the great message to be overlooked. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1788"> For years, it is becoming increasingly clear that at its energy or not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1789"> From a previous energy of the oil industry, even Members of his own Party, that 'it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1790"> While the advantages of the free market, just like approach to Let, even if the USA or the USA. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1791"> There is a failure of the market in energy, but the government should precisely in the other direction, as the government and it has proposed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1792"> The fact that the Americans do not pay the price for the pollution which from their energy, particularly from means that offered, which in turn are excessive. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1793"> The government must promote the protection of the environment, at the interventions in the pricing system - and indeed through taxes in an effective way. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1794"> But instead of environmental protection, a policy to promote investment in the future of dependent on oil. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1795"> It is that up in the prices for many in the Middle East does not do not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1796"> Now, over four years after the attacks of September 2001, and, in reality, the increasing dependence with in the difficult for him, not to say the following. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1797"> Yet again, the of his government in next time only still worse. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1798"> Bush refuses to do something for the protection of the environment, and he has played his constant, that the technology, with very little money. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1799"> What is thus one of the obligation to keep within the Europe of 25 years to 75% irrespective of oil from the Middle East? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1800"> For all the message is clear: research into the development of reserves in the Middle East, well with the costs of the world. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1801"> But without new investment in the Middle East, the energy consumption in the USA, China and elsewhere, that China and somewhere else. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1802"> As if that were not enough, risks and, with its threat to impose sanctions against Iran, that it is in the supply of one of the largest it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1803"> Especially since the almost their full capacity has reached and which is already more than twice as high as the war in Iraq, the report this still higher profits for the fallow there - the only clear winner in the Middle East. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1804"> Nevertheless, we should take that he recognised that there is a problem. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1805"> But, as always, implies a precise extend its proposals on a wider sleight of its government. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1806"> Not enough that he refuses to acknowledge the importance of the global environmental or sufficient resources to promote in the research to stick to change something really, the dependence on oil from the Middle East to advance, less importance, as it appears. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1807"> Because only 20% of the us-Öls from the Middle East, it could be objective by a slight shift its einkaufspolitik. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1808"> But one should remember that the Bush administration must certainly note that, on a global market. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1809"> Even if not to 100% of the might of the oil from the Middle East devastating effects on the Middle East, and on the local economy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1810"> As so often in the Bush administration, there are no a statement for the official policy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1811"> Power and political power, as he and America? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1812"> Or is this not a further example of inefficiency? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1813"> According to what we have seen in the last five years, is the correct answer is more than just a few little game. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1814"> The roadmap </SEG> 
<SEG id="1815"> China is before the adoption of its eleventh new customs way for the continuation of probably most notable economic change in history. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1816"> At the same time, almost a quarter of one quarter of the world, the world of the persistent. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1817"> As is the long-term success of China on its almost unique combination of pragmatism and vision. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1818"> During a visit by the developing countries, the more unrealistic and of the military were urged Russia once again made clear that there is a more durable and better distributed at a standard of living. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1819"> In China, that one has reached a stage of economic growth, in which it is intolerable and unacceptable burdens on the environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1820"> Without changes of direction is the standard ultimately compromised. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1821"> For this reason a centre of the new plan. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1822"> Many of the more backward regions, the increase in pace, which would be a miracle if not other parts of the country still more rapidly growing companies. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1823"> While the poverty could be, however, is the inequality with the increasing differences between town and country as well as. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1824"> This explains the Bank, why not only poverty, but also with a concern and in the plan takes this issue to be resolved. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1825"> The government has over several years of a more harmonious and I describe ambitious programmes, in order to achieve this goal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1826"> Moreover, in China, that the difference between developing and developed countries, not only in a gap of resources, but in a gap of knowledge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1827"> I was in China has, not only in order to close this gap, but also in order to create a basis for independent innovations. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1828"> China's role in the world and the world economy has changed and on this fact is also in this was taken. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1829"> The future growth is not so much on exports, but on the demand, to the need to. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1830"> In fact, China, with one has to struggle with. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1831"> The people in China, China, partly due to the weaknesses in the social security system a strengthening of the social protection of health and the reduction of social inequality, to contribute to the reduction of the current expenditure. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1832"> If this unacceptable and has, up to now, has its own his own almost always expectations, could these adjustments to create unbearable for a world by the huge American budgetary and the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1833"> If, in China, China - and if one of public investment, as part of a broader strategy to the strategy pursued, who will then the deficit of deficit? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1834"> This subject is currently not again, but it soon. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1835"> Despite the clear future lies the challenge in the implementation of the strategy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1836"> Russia is a huge country, and it would not be so far, if there were no problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1837"> However, from the problems and problems. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1838"> To, for example, are a global issue. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1839"> While Europe means that it could not afford to do anything about it, the Chinese and responsible action. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1840"> Within one month after the adoption of new taxes on cars, petrol and wood: China, therefore, based around the environmental problems of the country and the people in the EU. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1841"> The military pressure on growth and jobs to produce will be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1842"> They are subject to the temptation to say, if not an environmentally friendly production already present, as should the then operate in China? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1843"> About visions in action, the Chinese government in its resolutions, such as the legal environment. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1844"> With the development of China in the direction of enterprise, examples of the problems with which the industrialised countries have to fight: individual interests, the selfish arguments behind a weak bear out marktideologie. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1845"> And for the so-called "," to go for a system in which the guidelines from the top down through the poor no concerns, because ultimately will all benefit from economic growth. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1846"> Others are against competition and laws: Let's selection. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1847"> In order to counter the general, will be brought forward, for example, would be our automobile. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1848"> With such growth strategies would not only not only here, but also the overall vision of the future. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1849"> There is only one way to prevent: open discussions on economic strategies and errors and find solutions to the many challenges to find that it is faced with. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1850"> With George W. Bush, the risks and decision and a small circle. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1851"> It is contrary to the tactic conflicting considerable broad discussions and consultations with the Chinese leadership (even foreigners) in their efforts to find solutions for the enormous problems, of which most people in China is not really goutiert. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1852"> Do not by themselves. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1853"> You cannot simply put on them, especially when the advantages to the greatest possible effect. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1854"> The management of a market economy, however, is no easy task. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1855"> It is rather a balance, in which to respond. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1856"> The five-year plan is a roadmap for how these. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1857"> The world looks in deep and hope to China, as the life of 1.3 billion people will continue to change. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1858"> On it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1859"> It seems only reasonable that the world today, 200 years after today, on the basis of the war in Iraq. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1860"> The glory is the fact that the and the triumph of the past, and at the same time, the democracy for freedom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1861"> We should still be parts? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1862"> What a democracy, but not solely as a political power, but as an that the customs and practices of a society in general, so that the concept of a candidate psychological and psychological dimension. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1863"> Democratic systems, so, determine our thoughts, desires and passions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1864"> Just as the renaissance one and, in the 20th century, the "person is" a form of human being. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1865"> What was of the opinion that the effects of the lead that the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1866"> They would then only strict, events and values to assess independently, in truth, however, not the barbarous and simplizistischen opinions of the measures. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1867"> Indeed, what social power on the opinion named in democratic systems, in democratic systems, the increase in the media. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1868"> The thought that there is no change in the long run. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1869"> Neither local democracy nor small companies, the national system nor could the decline of the citizens of the Union, the reasoning which seem to bring democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1870"> Schools could little more than enclaves within the zersetzenden makes the social impacts on the functioning of the urban. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1871"> In a similar way exists, believe that the pursuit of the or even in the sense if a conflict between two and the democratic ideal, be it in relation to the public if they would be. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1872"> In this sense, on intellectual heir to the neomarxistischen explained the Frankfurt Hannah Arendt as well, all of the above all other the dissolution of the purely in modern societies feared. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1873"> Indeed, the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet a recently published book which a democracy against itself). </SEG> 
<SEG id="1874"> The democratic way of life, so, in addition to the "and the" and the ", which is the citizens with the enemies of democracy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1875"> However, while the history of, which is being intimidated, just so that there is greater in such a way that its citizens themselves in favour of an immediate satisfaction and short-term thinking. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1876"> The past is, in spite of a historic moments despite through a looking after the now and for the new. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1877"> Even the ruling class workers is subject to this subject. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1878"> That is at the heart of the democratic spirit is its lack of historical awareness. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1879"> The deficits of the democracy really mean that, as the only realistic but, however, to be open to us which is? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1880"> I think not. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1881"> It means that, in order to combat this growing days. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1882"> The first line of defence is, for an educational system, and indeed by the (nowadays) of the literature, history and philosophy. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1883"> If we want informed and critical, as it does, must stop, in each case, the analytical capabilities and. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1884"> The biggest obstacle to the way this form of education are the media with its cultivation. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1885"> Today, many people spend a major part of her life, the television than in the classroom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1886"> The passivity of the mass media runs counter to that active commitment which distinguishes. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1887"> However, it is difficult to imagine that the media of a apart from an impetus to (a) of the citizens. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1888"> This concern in view of the media is not a bare of. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1889"> The issue is not the popularity of the - in his time enormously, and, just as the rich to the poor, but the refusal of the measures and to challenge. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1890"> This failure is the result of a general indifference and passivity of the public. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1891"> Indeed, media, the ability to think or to further or higher feelings of feelings, for a long time now. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1892"> It is a culture, the culture, the democratic freedoms, because it threatens to any form of sense of responsibility, be it in relation to the company, or the history of the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1893"> It is too late to do something about a culture to companies which, in this way, the spirit of this? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1894"> The despised the elite in its time for its complacency. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1895"> The will of our leaders to take its existing? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1896"> A Europe for all </SEG> 
<SEG id="1897"> At present, Members of the European Union seem at present to the future of the European Union against in the Ukraine with hope and with the European Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1898"> The basic objective of our foreign policy, it is in the making, for the Ukraine has stated that no national unity, but a beginning. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1899"> The European unity is in fact:: if everything, are all. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1900"> We Europeans are caught in a network, our fates are closely interwoven. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1901"> Every aspect of our common culture, if not the last century of suffering, confirms this. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1902"> What is a European country directly concerns, concerns. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1903"> We cannot afford the notion of two of Europe - to that of that and will never again. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1904"> All the on the European continent, may not, they must not be excluded from the Union. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1905"> The present great European peace and the current prosperity depend on that. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1906"> Of course, some people that Europe is not the Ukraine. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1907"> They should come to Kiev, and with the people, the young, as the old, with fabrikarbeitern, bauernfrauen, lawyers, its and teachers, the last winter weeks in the cold and snow and ausharrten ones, in order to defend their freedom. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1908"> They are not connected with which the general de Gaulle in French opposition? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1909"> They are not one with which, in the fight for the Spanish Republic in the Budapest in 1956 and and fascism in Spain and Portugal in the?? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1910"> They are not of the same spirit as Poland and the peaceful before the revolution in? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1911"> This is the true European spirit, and no doubt can break it. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1912"> Those who believe that the Ukraine is to too for a word I say: you are in my country and the related, the late in the evening at work and their children and explain how its children. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1913"> They are to go in every and any city in which young people in Europe, while the French, German and English training. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1914"> Those who are at the fundamental attitude, should understand that Europe is not a question of the question of the; it is that it is freedom, prosperity and solidarity. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1915"> I believe that our future so much as Europe, proud, and that we have not forgotten border, in a troubled region, but that we have of Europe and Europe is. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1916"> Self-determination is not synonymous with isolation, for the achievement of the national independence, the return on the world stage, with a new status. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1917"> New Nations can to their former occupiers a similar fruitful relationship as France, Germany, to build a relationship based on equality and mutual interests. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1918"> Such a relationship during my government in Russia, and when we do that, we can contribute to the extension of the European area in which there is peace. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1919"> It is, of course, more to do, as the high related to the prospect of EU membership with us. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1920"> We know that our part this is not about building. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1921"> We know that the great achievements of the European Union not in documents and explanations, but in the life of all Europeans and ensure their safety. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1922"> It is not easy to be simple, or to the. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1923"> However, the EU itself is social and completed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1924"> We know that this is a great challenge, but the price is worth the effort, and Europe should know that this is our goal. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1925"> The work of the Ukraine is partly out of a partly in order to conclude a battle, fascism and Communism, in the heart of Europe, to gain the upper hand. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1926"> Only a few months ago, our children and parents in towns anywhere in the armed forces, knurrenden dogs and even death. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1927"> Only a few years ago, the young journalist Georgiy Gongadze, the public about the corruption of the old regime - wanted by the thugs at the maltreatment and geköpft. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1928"> However, our Orange revolution of last winter, that the Ukrainian people. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1929"> Therefore, I remain despite the doubts and today's faith in Europe. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1930"> I refuse to accept, as the final answer to the history of the Ukraine to accept. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1931"> I refuse to accept the position that the Ukraine to the of the Communist, that we left the peace and illuminating. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1932"> If the citizens on the place of the Ukraine in Europe, they should have a look at them, they should they themselves but also closely related. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1933"> They should look at the past, the differences in the poverty and social differences, with their tried to extend their will. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1934"> Instead, they should be the face of our President Viktor Yushchenko who, in the last year, led by a giftangriff was flawed, and at the words of the great French André Malraux those for the 'the beautiful faces the which were injured. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1935"> The civil </SEG> 
<SEG id="1936"> The gap between Muslims and all in the Middle East are more than the hostility between Israel and the Arabs? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1937"> In view of the reaction of governments on the decision to Israel that discussions. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1938"> Even as Israeli bombs fell on Beirut and Saudi Arabia, perhaps the Conservative Arabian State of all the actions of the Shiite Hezbollah, which conflict with Israel with Israel. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1939"> Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has a State, itself as the leader of the authority, as so openly. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1940"> In addition, Saudi Arabia with the isolated case. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1941"> Also Egypt and Jordan, the Hizbollah and their leader, leader, and for your for their. </SEG>

<SEG id="1943"> We are witnessing a fundamental change in the relationship between the ratio between? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1944"> Does the of Saudi Arabia and fear and anxiety, as they themselves the Arab unit and the matter of the thing? </SEG> 
<SEG id="1945"> The Arab but also indicate that the gap between the gap in the daily violence in Iraq is already clearly, in the whole of the Middle East to deepen and intensified. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1946"> President George W. Bush's desire, the erstarrten companies to undermine the Arab world, should the modernising influences against the traditional elements in the Arab and Islamic societies soon. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1947"> Instead, it seems atavistischsten powers of the region together unleashed. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1948"> The opening of the opening of a new and a new and new stage, perhaps, it can only be described as "war '. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1949"> The gap between the marsh Arabs and Muslims exists for the beginnings of Islam, but the geographical and religious isolation of the Shiite Iran had this, together with the countries on its of power in the background. </SEG> 
<SEG id="1950"> The tensions in the further course of the "by the Iranian revolution idea, because of the Arabs pushed further pushed into the background, while a general", "a general. </SEG>
