<seg id=1> Our Charter of Fundamental Rights is the first in this millennium.</seg>
<seg id=2> We must ensure that we are able to make the Union of the fifteen Member States, so that we can, in the countries which are knocking on our door, under the proper conditions.</seg>
<seg id=3> In Article 87 of the field of services of general interest must be for social, cultural and charitable interests with important institutions so that they can be protected.</seg>
<seg id=4> Some are of the opinion that we can create a single market in Europe, without fundamental values and principles.</seg>
<seg id=5> I would like to welcome the clear and substantial speech by President Prodi.</seg>
<seg id=6> As you know, it was decided in Amsterdam single-mindedly to separate these two functions. The High Representative is - in contrast to the Commission - not totally, but its role in the coordination of foreign and policies which fall within the competence of the Member States, and we must give greater priority, of course, the intergovernmental method.</seg>
<seg id=7> He has expressed the wish that the Presidency to show the way forward in Nice.</seg>
<seg id=8> It is in fact a more comprehensive and better result offengestanden wish, but I am of the opinion that we have made a good start.</seg>
<seg id=9> I therefore hope that the European Council in Nice will agree with this project and decide to take it as a project, not as a fait accompli, of course, the necessary reforms are now having been decided.</seg>
<seg id=10> I have, however, specifically in the reality of today that we can achieve important goals of the Community method, such as, for example, a more effective approach to the Balkans.</seg>
<seg id=11> Only if we make to the West and Russia in the European Union, we will be able to influence its policy and remain in contact with Russia, and in discussion.</seg>
<seg id=12> Motion for a resolution (B5-0767 / 00) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</seg>
<seg id=13> It is continuing this genocide, and is trying to eliminate media freedom and the rule of law in Russia, which are, in any case.</seg>
<seg id=14> In order to meet the expectations of this rentners would mean Giuseppe Italia, lives in Cremona and the Po sailing with the ship, I voted in favour of the Piecyk report, which concerns the development and the development of sea ports, inland ports and intermodal terminals.</seg>
<seg id=15> The vote of the House, the aim of the directive, which was recognised by all the speakers, and to the Commission and to be made.</seg>
<seg id=16> Mr President, I have, as I have already made during the debate, before the vote, to vote in favour of the report by Mr Skinner venture capital, because I regard as very important.</seg>
<seg id=17> My colleague Mrs Bordes, made it clear yesterday that only a minority of rentenversicherungsbeiträge and to use Community funds to cover unternehmerrisiken.</seg>
<seg id=18> Consequently, the Charter is more likely to reaffirm the current, even retrograde practices of the Member States, and that it is a genuine step forward.</seg>
<seg id=19> Mr President, at long last, a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European citizen is on the table, in which a whole article, Article 25, devoted to the elderly people.</seg>
<seg id=20> But if he would give legally binding and included in the Treaty, as the European Parliament, he would inevitably with the time to uniformity of the national law of the individual European countries. It would mean that the Court of Justice had a disproportionately large the centralisation of power that the European institutions and the independent decisions of each nation.</seg>
<seg id=21> · overloading of the Charter with detailed regulations should be removed and that the secondary law.</seg>
<seg id=22> I shall vote in favour of a Charter by others, I am involved in the demonstrations on 13 and 14 October in Biarritz and in Nice on 7 December 2000.</seg>
<seg id=23> Progress of the 12 candidate countries on the road to accession</seg>
<seg id=24> I believe that a number of Member States have not yet understood that there is this context and that the slow progress of the Intergovernmental Conference will bring us into serious difficulties in obtaining the necessary enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=25> All this, as I have said before, we will be able to succeed in the long term only if in the candidate countries, and also in the European Union policy and the elites and limited - in this regard, I would ask you, Commissioner, to ensure that the enlargement of the European Union is itself.</seg>
<seg id=26> This is the general principle.</seg>
<seg id=27> Let me now turn to the second objective, the Presidency intends to move forward in this half of the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=28> So I propose to work in this direction with the idea that we must examine in 2003, in which candidates are willing to join us on this date.</seg>
<seg id=29> I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his comprehensive report.</seg>
<seg id=30> It is not in any way in the negotiations on the 'if', it is only "how" and "When."</seg>
<seg id=31> But they have done so because the prospect of membership in the European Union are the hopes of the solidarity of the European peoples and because you firm political and economic support.</seg>
<seg id=32> A number of countries are at the second economic criterion of competition in the internal market as well advanced that they are approaching the rapid accession.</seg>
<seg id=33> We are therefore the engst possible coordination with the national governments, the European Parliament and other institutions.</seg>
<seg id=34> Every year, and this will very soon, on 8 November, once again, to be the case, the Commission's opinion on each of the applicant countries with very great interest on the progress that has been made.</seg>
<seg id=35> We have opted for the principle of differentiation, under which each beitrittskandidatenland will be assessed according to its progress and services.</seg>
<seg id=36> This debate is a further opportunity to reiterate my group, that the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries and Cyprus and Malta, the best and secure future for all of us in Europe in the East and the West.</seg>
<seg id=37> This is a matter of the utmost importance that take place in public.</seg>
<seg id=38> Many believe that the time is, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, enlargement was always the same: to five years.</seg>
<seg id=39> The next natural opportunity in connection with the next elections to the European Parliament in 2009, but we want to try to have that as many countries as possible to join in 2004.</seg>
<seg id=40> Moreover, there are six substantive issues, on which we have reservations about the method applied.</seg>
<seg id=41> In reality, it is the elected model of European integration itself, in other words the inclusion of all sectors, regardless of the traditions and characteristics of the parties involved, in this impasse.</seg>
<seg id=42> To express this in Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the 1980s, almost articulated in general sense for us all up to the present day.</seg>
<seg id=43> But to give the things it clearly, there can be no cut-price accessions.</seg>
<seg id=44> It is a great and fine idea that we make the enlargements of the public, and that is the best way to make the enlargement in accordance with the public, in their participation in the elections, because the elections are a form of democracy and the involvement of citizens in the political system.</seg>
<seg id=45> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to comment briefly on the conditions for a scenario which was wanted by several parties.</seg>
<seg id=46> I would be very surprised if they would make no pressure.</seg>
<seg id=47> But as I have already pointed out that all the accession countries are relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id=48> This means that the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products is already agreed, without the collapse of Poland are worried that the Polish agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=49> It has also been burdens, but, on the whole, peace and trade have brought the citizens closer to the countries of the European Union and the Monetary Union will increase this development.</seg>
<seg id=50> The results should be decisive.</seg>
<seg id=51> The only amendment that has been tabled so far is already included in my report, but I am pleased that the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance underlines the importance of the equal treatment of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=52> A law on public service is not just one, but also that there are opportunities for young administrators and appropriate payment.</seg>
<seg id=53> This applies both to Latvia as well as for the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=54> The application of the litas to the euro in the second half of the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=55> . (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, for which I am the rapporteur, is the largest and most important, but, as we know, at the same time, the most difficult of the countries to prepare for accession to the European Union; it is such a host of problems in that it even rumours about a possible withdrawal from the first wave of Poland, that is to say the first group of accession countries.</seg>
<seg id=56> How have given Poland and the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe, too many promises that we have not kept.</seg>
<seg id=57> The point is that, when it comes to the Czech Republic. This is the problem of the Roma.</seg>
<seg id=58> Slovakia was not mentioned in the second group and, consequently, at the same time, I would like to join with the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id=59> Finally, a remark at the same time I would allow the internal policies.</seg>
<seg id=60> Thirdly, as regards agriculture, which is still below the levels of productivity in the European Union, it will be necessary to the agricultural markets fully to the privatisation of land, the modernisation of farms and distribution structures and increasing the necessary capital returns to open up.</seg>
<seg id=61> Bulgaria is very keen on accession to the European Union and NATO.</seg>
<seg id=62> Since 1990, the acute poverty is one of the most serious problems in Romania, but under the current government, that is, in fact, the economic situation for the better.</seg>
<seg id=63> I hope that these issues will be in 14 days constituent priorities of the new Parliament and the Slovenian government.</seg>
<seg id=64> That is a fair and lasting solution to the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council, which is nothing more than the current international law, and the European Union must take account of the underlying principles must be emphasised, however.</seg>
<seg id=65> Malta has, furthermore, stable and democratic functioning of the institutions.</seg>
<seg id=66> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we wish to play our part in this debate.</seg>
<seg id=67> They also need to be implemented. The European Community law is not just a law in the books, but a law in action must also be in the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=68> This change is tough demands upon the people in the applicant countries, their future and the future of their children, but at the same time.</seg>
<seg id=69> Special attention - and here I agree with the previous speaker - on the border regions.</seg>
<seg id=70> The Commission must not be left alone in this context.</seg>
<seg id=71> The applicant countries seek a rapid economic growth, even if this is at the expense of a nature conservation policies have already been laid down.</seg>
<seg id=72> It was a bad habits exchange, including in the field of health.</seg>
<seg id=73> Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and united Europe.</seg>
<seg id=74> The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, which is also in the field of transport and the trans-European networks are aware of the need to coordinate the various sectoral policies in favour of a global policy.</seg>
<seg id=75> However, an indication of the transport infrastructure will be crucial to the success of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=76> Mr President, I would like to join those who see in the forthcoming enlargement, the main task of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=77> In the former planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe considerable pressure on the traditional social values.</seg>
<seg id=78> The PPE Group would not accept the responsibility for the beitrittstempo the candidate countries, as we can make an accession date.</seg>
<seg id=79> The second point is the inclusion of data.</seg>
<seg id=80> There is another reason.</seg>
<seg id=81> Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects depend on the individual countries and for the EU as a whole - which has shown a Denmark - that the social and democratic deficits of European policy.</seg>
<seg id=82> Populism is denigrating the contemptuous of technocrats, the popular will, if he is in a way that suits them.</seg>
<seg id=83> Ladies and gentlemen, you have erholungspause – eat, and there is more at 9 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=84> There will be, albeit in the long term, a common currency for the whole continent.</seg>
<seg id=85> On these issues will be stimulated internal conflict in the individual countries.</seg>
<seg id=86> We are calling on you to fight for a different Europe, a Europe of all the peoples, is exempt from this inhuman stigma, in which all peoples to determine their own destiny and to establish relations between of peace, freedom, brotherhood and cooperation to the mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id=87> I would like to pay tribute to the work of these organisations, such as the Romanian public appeal ', which has its headquarters in Birmingham, and organisations from Ireland, which are supported by many people, including the Irish unterhaltungskünstler Daniel o' donnell committed to a donation of EUR 1 million pounds and this sum has acquired in Ireland and other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id=88> The summit in Nice must, above all, clear whether and how the EU can put itself in a position to fully and in good time.</seg>
<seg id=89> The Poles issues: they will be when we joined us, or we are second class countries?</seg>
<seg id=90> I am sure, however, that a solution for the good will and support of the European Union for the two communities to live together in harmony and live in prosperity, as has been the case for centuries.</seg>
<seg id=91> We have been aware of this but there is also the question of minorities, because the issue of the integration of these minorities, including their linguistic integration in these countries is also important.</seg>
<seg id=92> The conditions for membership is, in fact, the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria.</seg>
<seg id=93> We have heard a lot about the benefits of enlargement, but this is an area in which we can learn from Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id=94> Imagine if we were all!</seg>
<seg id=95> Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to thank Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs and congratulate you, but I would like to focus mainly on Slovakia, in particular to the policy on minorities.</seg>
<seg id=96> I would urge you to set a date in Nice, when do you intend to do with the most advanced candidate countries, without any use of names - to put an end to the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=97> The European Union must continue to Bulgaria is on his way to help in the Union and, of course, that the planning of this aid is more decentralised.</seg>
<seg id=98> The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of society, the government and the Parliament to play an important and - as we say - positive role.</seg>
<seg id=99> We are in the process of creating the division of Europe and not a new.</seg>
<seg id=100> All of that is contained in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, on behalf of our group I should like to thank her very warmly for this report.</seg>
<seg id=101> This understanding that Cyprus should be, in my opinion, this is the issue on Europe's ability to shape policy.</seg>
<seg id=102> I myself live close to the Baltic, which is a common concern for all of us.</seg>
<seg id=103> The political vision remains.</seg>
<seg id=104> We note with particular satisfaction the desire of Klaus Hänsch, who has spoken on behalf of the PSE Group, that the Commission will be a genuine assessment of the impact of enlargement and of the economic consequences, if there is no to enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=105> However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, that it will not be possible without transitional periods in the interests of both parties, and we as Members of a border region, as Mrs Schierhuber on a farm in the vicinity of the Czech border, I am concerned that the common currency areas near without any major problems can be solved and leads to a positive result on both sides.</seg>
<seg id=106> As a Social Democrat, I want to emphasise three points.</seg>
<seg id=107> The questions of the first pillar of the economy in the EEA containing granted applicant countries access to the internal market, youth exchange programmes, scientific and legal but not yet on the other hand, the EU committed to extend its system of agricultural aid to these countries. It would be a positive impetus of the EEA agreement, in particular the economy in the candidate countries - they need for growth, in order to make their society to prepare for accession, as well as for the economy in the EU if the costs of enlargement on two thirds of economic growth that will, in ewr-modell, perhaps even more.</seg>
<seg id=108> Secondly, you approve of big bang, the idea of including many of the candidate countries at the same time, this would run counter to the principle that each country according to its progress.</seg>
<seg id=109> Thirdly, we must do everything to 2003, in order to prepare for the European Union in terms of the excellent speech by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, on the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=110> In this context, I would like to address the relationship between Parliament and the Council on the grounds that there is considerable delays in the reply to written questions.</seg>
<seg id=111> It is worrying that this is happening in a country that wishes to join the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=112> I request that the report be referred back to the committee, which will be prepared to take the necessary steps.</seg>
<seg id=113> Mr President, today we are debating three reports on this subject, including two, and perhaps put it to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=114> That would be at all stages of the food chain.</seg>
<seg id=115> Food safety in the whole chain costs.</seg>
<seg id=116> We must therefore agree with Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and the verschneidungsverbot, so that animal feed will be safer and protect the European consumers.</seg>
<seg id=117> The 1999 directive was well thought out, and it may also have been a success, because costs could be reduced.</seg>
<seg id=118> But then one to simply is not the solution.</seg>
<seg id=119> Very briefly, we must insist on the amendment 37 on the dioxinproblems.</seg>
<seg id=120> In this respect, we are of the same opinion.</seg>
<seg id=121> As a result, we will continue to European consumers buy meat, milk and by-products, which are not on the world markets from the emerging economies limits established by the Union and appropriate feed produced, in other words in a mixed system can be obtained in the raw materials on the world market, where each substance or any preparation freely before the products are introduced into the territory of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=122> Before the second reading, the Commission should inform us of the planned assessment procedures.</seg>
<seg id=123> On the other hand, it would be if, for example, Amendments Nos 39 and 40 will be adopted to intervene as there is for the Member States, in the newly discovered dangers.</seg>
<seg id=124> Consumer protection in the animal feed in the futtermittelinhaltsstoffen declaration, and, finally, the official controls.</seg>
<seg id=125> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Paulsen on undesirable substances in animal nutrition is an important issue, as all the major issues, a highly controversial.</seg>
<seg id=126> The debate on the excellent report by Mrs Paulsen before us today was marked feeling in some respects and, following the debate we must assume that the feedingstuffs industry for a strict conditions, the quality of mixtures, however.</seg>
<seg id=127> Each of these three proposals, both individually and help in common cooperation in order to eliminate the main shortcomings which have emerged from the dioxin crisis.</seg>
<seg id=128> Amendment No 33 futtermittelpartien, the requirements of this directive should not be prevented in the re-exportation of the ausfuhrdrittland.</seg>
<seg id=129> The Commission rejects Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which propose to introduce the possibility of contamination of dilution animal feed raw materials under certain conditions.</seg>
<seg id=130> This should be given our commitment that we will, in the context of the new proposal on the establishment of a food authority, a system for the rapid exchange of information, which will cover the whole of the food and feed chain.</seg>
<seg id=131> Commissioner Byrne, this directive on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs in fact conceal our old problem, namely the question of open declaration.</seg>
<seg id=132> And that is the profit for me this morning.</seg>
<seg id=133> Because if we were to do that if we were to implement it quickly and quickly by means of the codecision procedure, and that is certainly a great asset, and I am sure that we will be very strong and united with the Council.</seg>
<seg id=134> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the future too, it can happen, but at least it is not contaminated feed materials that come into animal feed.</seg>
<seg id=135> The BSE scandal was the worst best-publicised culprit.</seg>
<seg id=136> As the rapporteur has already said, it would be best if we were to have a label with open declaration, to which the ingredients are listed.</seg>
<seg id=137> I think that the professional qualifications and judgment of the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in the field of agriculture, and also in the field of animal nutrition is out of the question, in the sense of a practical and workable solution to the farmers and consumers will be understood and applied.</seg>
<seg id=138> As far as the positive part.</seg>
<seg id=139> I think it is a legitimate right to information, which we must take into consideration.</seg>
<seg id=140> On behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, I would ask you, Madam President, the relatives of the victims and the local authorities of Brittany and Galicia Marín, where most of the victims, the concern of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=141> (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=142> Does anyone wish to speak against - the tabling of this oral amendment?</seg>
<seg id=143> As the rapporteur has explained the situation.</seg>
<seg id=144> Most of the technical proposals deserve our firm support, such as, for example, in the field of food safety, the closure of the nuclear power plants in the first generation, environmental protection, the fight against social dumping, the essential code of conduct for companies operating in the East and in the West, much more. These tasks are enormous and absolute priority.</seg>
<seg id=145> At the same time remain considerable difficulties, particularly in budgetary matters.</seg>
<seg id=146> Enlargement to the 13 countries not only changed the geopolitical context of the European Union, but it also changed the structure, because, on the one hand, the population will increase (+ 28%), but also the number of "'less-favoured regions.</seg>
<seg id=147> That is a competitive agricultural and food-processing sectors in the candidate countries because of their high economic and social importance for the successful transformations- and restructuring process, is of crucial importance.</seg>
<seg id=148> In this context, I would like to express the wish that the outermost regions, which are still six of the seven of the ten poorest of the EU structural funds, not only because of the bip-kriteriums alone, but also on the basis of geographical and demographic and, above all, social indicators.</seg>
<seg id=149> Because we reject this Europe in the interests of the people of France, we can its enlargement to include the countries and peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, which are not just by the Communist dictatorship and do not yet know what the technocratic and totalitarian case them with this step, with a clear conscience.</seg>
<seg id=150> We would have to leave the country reports and in a short but at most concise resolution.</seg>
<seg id=151> The present system of subsidies, subsidies and quotas must be replaced by free trade and adaptation of the market.</seg>
<seg id=152> The importance and significance of the problems created by enlargement cannot be reconciled with the hypocrisy with about this in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=153> To talk about the enlargement is not for me to confirm the participation of some countries to Europe or not.</seg>
<seg id=154> Our neighbour has worked hard over the last ten years in order to meet the accession criteria.</seg>
<seg id=155> Latvia has to give its position in this House, not only because its progress seen him the right to "confidence", which is essential for a successful conclusion of such negotiations, but also, above all, firstly, because it is at home in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=156> I believe that the State of Poland, most of all the candidate countries deserves our support and our commitment, because without the extremely important initiatives of Communism in Poland were not referred to, and we would not be here to deal with this problem.</seg>
<seg id=157> The Polish people, which is still largely from eurosceptic, that may not be in the same way.</seg>
<seg id=158> I appeal to Prague, take this message, this request, this request is dialogue, together with this House, and to ensure that the legacy of a nationalist era can be overcome.</seg>
<seg id=159> I welcome the report by Mr Wiersma, on Slovakia's application for membership of the European Union and can support the bulk of its conclusions.</seg>
<seg id=160> It is with great pleasure that I take this opportunity to offer the elderly and pensioners in the Republic of Bulgaria my special congratulations.</seg>
<seg id=161> If Romania continues to make progress, and the European Union has adjusted their institutional structures and policies in order to be able to cope with enlargement, I see no reason why Romania should not be included in the Union.</seg>
<seg id=162> The report's position is clearly too hard, whatever might be a solution to the problem of the settlers, as well as the transfer of land for both sides is extremely difficult.</seg>
<seg id=163> Unfortunately, some of the statements contained in the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the application by the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union are not help.</seg>
<seg id=164> In view of the lack of goodwill, the Turkish Cypriot community and Turkey, this will not be an easy task.</seg>
<seg id=165> Stenzel report (A5-0243 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=166> Unfortunately, I was the victim of a food poisoning, albeit slight, regrettably, I have suffered in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=167> For all these reasons, I voted in favour of the verschneidungsverbot proposed by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=168> We must ask the ASEM countries in this motion for a resolution to put pressure on the military regime in Burma, to ensure that democracy is restored.</seg>
<seg id=169> We are consistent in our approach and the implementation of our measures.</seg>
<seg id=170> Now is not the time for timidity and hesitancy.</seg>
<seg id=171> A number of important points in the regulation are: firstly, the burden of proof.</seg>
<seg id=172> Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=173> This, then, are the reasons why we need legislation to combat discrimination.</seg>
<seg id=174> Now fachjuristische also because a large number of amendments before us, which is to be ensured by the same level of protection against discrimination on the grounds of race, on the one hand, and on the grounds of religion, disability, age or sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id=175> He had to be in balance, prudence and a good legal technique, and I believe that this report reflects qualities.</seg>
<seg id=176> These Members are also of the opinion that discrimination is not so often that specific legislation.</seg>
<seg id=177> The funding of the programme is not enough to replace the work that has been done in the fifth framework programme and hopefully, continued in other framework programmes. Our task is to ensure that the programmgrenzen is being worked on.</seg>
<seg id=178> The need to combat discrimination, there is general agreement on the extent to which the how and by what means the opinions differ, however.</seg>
<seg id=179> In the committee, I had the opportunity to refuse to say that experts who are not NGOs.</seg>
<seg id=180> We also welcome the richtlinienbestimmung equal treatment for people with disabilities, which also means that appropriate adjustments in the workplace are provided by companies.</seg>
<seg id=181> Only in this way will we be able to combat discrimination in all areas of human coexistence in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=182> All in all, the major Anglo-Saxon democracies also teach us that racism and discrimination, with the help of liberal democracy, and not by the restriction and gradual weakening of freedom of expression, freedom of expression, freedom of association and the economic freedoms, be combated.</seg>
<seg id=183> In a proposal, the equality of homosexuality with the Holy marriage.</seg>
<seg id=184> In this way, the European Union in specific cases in which there are the discrimination or the treatment of its citizens, to adopt a clear position.</seg>
<seg id=185> I would also like to refer to the question of the exception in terms of religion.</seg>
<seg id=186> From various quarters concerns have been expressed about the potential interpretation of the explanatory statement to Article 1, which is still somewhat unclear, but between sexual orientation and sexual behaviour.</seg>
<seg id=187> In this way, a hierarchy of discrimination is emerging.</seg>
<seg id=188> In New Caledonia, it is because of the colour of benefits.</seg>
<seg id=189> Together with the recently adopted directive 2000 this approach of the directive is the desire expressed by the European Union to stand up for an open society, which is, and in particular the patterns in the history of European deep-rooted stigma of racism.</seg>
<seg id=190> So those who say here in this Parliament, the values that we all want to defend, did not need to be enshrined in a European directive, are wrong.</seg>
<seg id=191> This hard-won results cannot be touched.</seg>
<seg id=192> Finally, the media plays an important role in this task.</seg>
<seg id=193> Experience has shown that the promotion of legislative proposals on combating discrimination is essential, but it is not enough.</seg>
<seg id=194> We must prevent a useless would reduce the bureaucratic Europe, only to a purely materialist, politically correct Community without deeper meaning.</seg>
<seg id=195> I believe that this Parliament has been decorated cautious legislation, which wanted to propose to the European Commission to a Christmas tree.</seg>
<seg id=196> Let me begin by thanking the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, for two excellent reports.</seg>
<seg id=197> I can also accept your amendments, which both the importance of prevention and the fight against discrimination should be highlighted.</seg>
<seg id=198> The second category is designed to clarify the text of the proposal by the Commission, while the third category is for a number of amendments with which this proposal is intended to be brought into line with the directive adopted in June last year against racial discrimination.</seg>
<seg id=199> In particular, in Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 to delete the reference to discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id=200> I can endorse your comments in Amendments Nos 21 and 45 to natural and legal persons and groups of persons nichtformalisierte for individuals, because not only is this proposal on employment.</seg>
<seg id=201> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.</seg>
<seg id=202> We can expect no public support for peacemaking operations, if our troops are threatened with the weapons that we have set ourselves.</seg>
<seg id=203> In my home country, I could not cope without permission to me a shotgun, while I need to the opening of the arms trade in my gartenschuppen no approval.</seg>
<seg id=204> Another important point is the ban on the export of equipment, promotion and marketing or know-how that is used mainly for the purposes of torture.</seg>
<seg id=205> Having said that, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Titley, on his excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=206> In addition to the issues of commitment we must extend our reflection on priorities, on the one hand, aimed directly at a military use, for disarmament, conversion, intensification of the work of the police and customs authorities and, on the other, by Mr Wiersma on the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=207> The circulation of supervised, it would be much more difficult to circumvent the provisions on the arms trade.</seg>
<seg id=208> The aim of the annual review is to identify such potential improvements.</seg>
<seg id=209> The European Union is currently examining whether this project can be continued on the duration projects, which expires in November of this year.</seg>
<seg id=210> We have had a methodology and indicators, which will be presented at the next 'Research' Council.</seg>
<seg id=211> Thank you, Mr Busquin.</seg>
<seg id=212> With regard to the problems of the SMEs, we have, of course, ensure that the SMEs, as provided for in the framework programme will cover.</seg>
<seg id=213> This would at least glean from the debate on the budget in Greece, and many even based on the attitude of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=214> With regard to the multidisciplinary nature, I share your concerns.</seg>
<seg id=215> The first point that he makes in his statement, the EU is the participation of national programmes.</seg>
<seg id=216> We could not, therefore, of a European research area, if we fund only 5% of the budget.</seg>
<seg id=217> Thank you, Mr Busquin.</seg>
<seg id=218> On the one hand, due to the efforts to commit the appropriations until the end of the year 1999, at the beginning of this year, the number of amendments to the decision for the financing of new projects in accordance with low.</seg>
<seg id=219> However, I would like to stress again that Portugal has fulfilled all the previous period to our satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id=220> Question No 2 by (H-0730 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=221> The definition of petroleum tax at a high level, the result is not that Community competition rules are not being complied with.</seg>
<seg id=222> Secondly, Mr MacCormick will be aware of the following: the Member States with a particular industrial sector by means of taxation, they violate the rules on state aid, and in this case, fiscal aid amounting to subsidies.</seg>
<seg id=223> A clear case of, for example, is the issue of nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id=224> Subject: the budget line for minority languages which exist in the European Union budget for minority languages by 1995 saw a constant increase in the year and reached its peak with EUR 4 million.</seg>
<seg id=225> Mr President, the Members of this House will know that the Structural Funds - and this is new CARDS, very many resources for cultural activities, because I have tabled together with Mr Michel Barnier, that the structural funds are not only invest in roads and in airports but also in people.</seg>
<seg id=226> The Commission will therefore next year in any further financial commitments.</seg>
<seg id=227> What concrete proposals for financing is concerned, I can adopt a position at this stage, because we must accept the normal procedure.</seg>
<seg id=228> I have different possibilities.</seg>
<seg id=229> And the need to prevent it, because we are talking about millions of small and medium-sized enterprises throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg id=230> The rules on the elchjagd hunting, for example, the treatment of the use of certain meat?</seg>
<seg id=231> If we were to apply the rules in the gejagten meat from animals, so that a disaster for the elchjagd bureaucratic.</seg>
<seg id=232> Following this report, I intend to present proposals to improve the transport of animals. I shall also mention the problem of the poor implementation of the transportzeitbeschränkungen.</seg>
<seg id=233> We have previously discussed this issue at my meeting with the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance.</seg>
<seg id=234> Our question was clear: what measures is the Commission taking?</seg>
<seg id=235> General product safety, the manufacturers to inform their customers on any possible risks.</seg>
<seg id=236> The case ayubi confronting is extremely worrying.</seg>
<seg id=237> Question No 14 by (H-0745 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=238> The EU's position in relation to this meeting in Vientiane, have taken place in order, of course, to the question of whether it should take place and at what level the EU should be represented by the developments in Burma will be until December.</seg>
<seg id=239> One last comment.</seg>
<seg id=240> The elections are an important step in terms of the involvement of the people of Kosovo in the shape of their communities.</seg>
<seg id=241> I can assure you that these elections are democratic and better than elections have been carried out in our countries, in which I have participated often either, or where I was here as observers.</seg>
<seg id=242> However, we saw this as the beginning and not the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id=243> This is a more effective and coherent control of the arms trade and a greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id=244> Now I see that every year more closed supply contracts for weapons and accessories.</seg>
<seg id=245> On the basis of information being of virtual reality, we cannot take any relevant decisions.</seg>
<seg id=246> The scheme, in which these activities carried out by one and the same Directorate-General, should be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id=247> These institutions must have the opportunity to set up an internal auditor, would be to make the financial controller certain minimum requirements in terms of the audit.</seg>
<seg id=248> This proposal, as the Commissioner knows very well, in Parliament not unanimous support.</seg>
<seg id=249> Therefore, I have nothing against an independent internal audit service, for which we are today with the report by Mr van Hulten give the green light.</seg>
<seg id=250> Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=251> We are of the opinion that the modernisation of administration is urgently needed.</seg>
<seg id=252> An independent gegenprüfung is essential to avoid mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=253> The money is to be spent in a more targeted and effective and, of course, be better to ensure that the resources are used for the purposes for which they are determined by the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=254> Now to the proposed amendments, is this: the introduction of this recital is added to the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=255> That is why I would like to thank you for your proposals and their advice.</seg>
<seg id=256> I would like to sum up the proposals in this report which, in my opinion, the most important and most effective. Firstly, set up a working group made up of eminent persons appointed by the Member States in order to contribute to the establishment of universally recognised parameters for the protection of minors in the media; secondly: the introduction of a selbstkontroll-kodex by all TV companies; and thirdly, the possibility of supporting and filtering systems for access to television and the Internet.</seg>
<seg id=257> I cannot agree with the demands of the Liberals.</seg>
<seg id=258> That was, and still is primarily a task for the legislation of the Member States, but what a consensual agreement on certain parameters in any dialogue with all the parties involved at European level.</seg>
<seg id=259> Under these conditions, I believe it is the task of the parents, to preserve their children in the home, programmes of this kind.</seg>
<seg id=260> Parents are dependent on aid, particularly in this area must include the following: parameters for the protection of minors in the media in the entire area of the European Union, the setting up and cost-effective availability of filters, legislation on the protection of minors and the responsibility of media companies and operators in the private and public sectors.</seg>
<seg id=261> If there are some committee debates then say that there is no evidence of the negative impact of the various forms of violence on television on children, I am surprised and believe that this is a fatal trivialisation.</seg>
<seg id=262> As regards the introduction of a selbstkontroll-kodex is concerned, especially in technical terms that broadcasters in some Member States already have a kontrollcode for television, enabling parents to eliminate the television.</seg>
<seg id=263> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=264> Above all, the commendable generalisations through the return of power to be replaced in my report to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=265> This would at the very least, we must ensure that the area of freedom, which is a fundamental right of every citizen.</seg>
<seg id=266> There are delays in payments for the year 1996.</seg>
<seg id=267> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani, for the work he has done.</seg>
<seg id=268> I commend this report to the House and I am in favour of the adoption of the amendments put forward by Mr Evans.</seg>
<seg id=269> Our resources are our sole future in a world in which know everything.</seg>
<seg id=270> And I know a lot more. We will not solve any problems with green, black or white, rotbüchern, but by means of concrete measures.</seg>
<seg id=271> But Parliament has fulfilled its role and pressure, so that the researchers to be included in the text.</seg>
<seg id=272> Your visit today is taking place at a time for the future of European integration.</seg>
<seg id=273> We know, however, that this process is not yet complete, and therefore in danger of losing its vitality.</seg>
<seg id=274> If we do not now, in this difficult and stormy period of European and world history, when will we do then?</seg>
<seg id=275> None of us can now claim to know exactly when and in order to achieve these objectives, but we are all aware that, if we want to believe in them, and we are already behind us half way along the road.</seg>
<seg id=276> We must ensure that women are the nutznießerinnen inferred jobs are not the same as inequalities in the more traditional sectors, not less qualified jobs on a voluntary basis, part-time work, temporary contracts and sometimes difficult access to decision-making positions.</seg>
<seg id=277> The Council will be presented with a proposal on the relevant indicators that progress can be assessed.</seg>
<seg id=278> In short, the fourth pillar relating to equal opportunities means supporting the integrated approach of equality through gender mainstreaming and specific guidelines.</seg>
<seg id=279> I am thinking in particular of violence against women, one of the main themes of my government, and I know that this issue is of particular concern to you.</seg>
<seg id=280> We know that the measures to reconcile work and family life in favour of women, in particular, in the absence of studies on the current situation of the family and the role of women in the family, which is no longer the traditional role, because society has changed, and with it the family structure.</seg>
<seg id=281> Some people sometimes seem to believe some colleagues in this House, that this would be the case, but that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id=282> Mr President, I would like to emphasise in conclusion that equality in their own homes.</seg>
<seg id=283> This position is questionable and zwielichtig, and I think it should be considered in terms of projects you, because it is not certain that we come to practical implementation.</seg>
<seg id=284> In this area there is no equality.</seg>
<seg id=285> The image of the European women, as it does from our reports from our directives, is not in line with the Danish those women who give a rejection of the euro.</seg>
<seg id=286> So I think it is significant that the report stresses, in all areas of society, for example in the labour market, a zahlenmäßiges balance between men and women must be established.</seg>
<seg id=287> That is why it is a missed opportunity, marriage and the family that in this report have been completely ignored.</seg>
<seg id=288> This is also the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, better to heart.</seg>
<seg id=289> We have heard that the Belgian Presidency has restructured the gleichstellungsministerium and abolished.</seg>
<seg id=290> The average wage of women on average 28% below that of men, which will help the women make up the majority of poor people and their participation in social and political life.</seg>
<seg id=291> It is truly excellent.</seg>
<seg id=292> Throughout Europe, a process of impoverishment of working women today, in France, where you have at least 15% less than 3 FF 650.</seg>
<seg id=293> Not all countries have been able to follow their example, and I hope that the example of France will bear fruit in other countries.</seg>
<seg id=294> The history of women go far enough.</seg>
<seg id=295> The betrittskandidaten must be helped in the adoption of the acquis communautaire.</seg>
<seg id=296> But I need your help.</seg>
<seg id=297> That is not the case, but it is a good text, and the Committee on Legal Affairs decided after careful consideration and a detailed discussion, not to present any amendments.</seg>
<seg id=298> The Committee on Legal Affairs, after a long debate came to the conclusion that it is not appropriate to maintain the legal uncertainty for six years, and that the deadline of more than three years is a reasonable period in order to be able to identify with the appropriate resources and an average care whether irregularities were a statement or not.</seg>
<seg id=299> This is Amendment No 15, which relates to fraud.</seg>
<seg id=300> The objective, but, above all, a simplified qualitative communication, however, sufficient flexibility in the basic regulation, improvement of the procedures for the collection of customs duties and adapting the provisions relating to the application of the customs, meets the requirements of the single market, and which was inspired have achieved, even in such a way that many countries that quickly in order to be able to participate in world trade.</seg>
<seg id=301> I would like to thank Parliament, and in particular the committee chaired by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, for the efforts both institutions will be devoted to this issue, and the interest that you have given him.</seg>
<seg id=302> Welcome</seg>
<seg id=303> I do not want to be influenced by the fact that the vote be reviewed but the translation of the French version really needs.</seg>
<seg id=304> Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Evans report.</seg>
<seg id=305> It is recognised that language is a necessary precondition for the mobility.</seg>
<seg id=306> We also believe that the Member States should decide to a large extent on taxation.</seg>
<seg id=307> I somewhat regret that we have not had an opportunity, a majority in favour of the need for a limited period to keep the documents.</seg>
<seg id=308> - (FR) In the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam, we have not had the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination on the grounds of gender, race, ethnic origin, religion or beliefs (sectarian), disability, age or sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id=309> The problems of certain minorities in those countries are all.</seg>
<seg id=310> From the explanatory statement to the amendment states very clearly that the intention is to take action against the Member States in the age of the current provisions, which are, however, completely justified from entwicklungspsychologischen reasons and in beschäftigungsleben meaningless.</seg>
<seg id=311> I also think that all the script in a new Article 12 (a), for others.</seg>
<seg id=312> To religion and faith. The EPLP welcomes the principle of this view.</seg>
<seg id=313> . (SV) We Christian Democrats are generally satisfied with the proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation.</seg>
<seg id=314> However, that is to say something about the personnel of the internal audit service and the financial importance, and hence on the use of such a service.</seg>
<seg id=315> The EU has decided to set up a common military powers to carry out the so-called Petersberg objectives and conflict resolution) (krisenbekämpfung outside the territory of the EU does not have its own defence policy.</seg>
<seg id=316> Without weapons, the world would be much safer.</seg>
<seg id=317> The motion for a resolution does not aim to a drastic reduction in the number of arms sales to promote a policy of abrüstens, but I would simply like to make arrangements to ensure the rüstungskonzernen still profits.</seg>
<seg id=318> In its communication, the Commission recognises the problem, but proposes specific measures, because it is the idea of the liberalisation of the market and of competition. All your proposals do not, in fact, especially for children, the harsh reality of the unaccountability of multinationals, which it is in their profits, what are the consequences of their programmes and products, and any responsibility onto the parents stimulated even to the acquisition of new products, in order to protect their children.</seg>
<seg id=319> As the rapporteur, I believe that the measures for the protection of young people from harmful and violent programmes are not confined to the traditional television, but for all media.</seg>
<seg id=320> With an average of three hours of television in addition to sleep for adults and, in addition to the work - the most important human activity.</seg>
<seg id=321> Furthermore, women occupy often 'flexible' jobs; fixed-term contracts and low wages are typical of the sectors in which women work.</seg>
<seg id=322> They are the first victims of the reduction in the public funds, the privatisation of the health sector, the restriction of the right to health care and medical treatment, which are still substantial cuts, the right to information and prevention.</seg>
<seg id=323> B5-0792 / 2000 by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, on the crisis in Peru.</seg>
<seg id=324> Mr President, I would like to wish that we should, in fact, not only in connection with one or other of the urgency, but a well-prepared debate in the committees, a debate on Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=325> We need to do everything we can to ensure that this objective can be achieved with Peru candidates which are equal to the challenge and the situation of the Peruvian people, the demand for political reform and democracy.</seg>
<seg id=326> The joint debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=327> We now know, Afghanistan is not far from Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium, so that we can imagine, this political role - not only political mafias - in the extension of drug trafficking.</seg>
<seg id=328> The Commission is called upon to carry out an assessment of the humanitarian aid to the Afghan people, so that no one is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id=329> This conflict brings untold suffering.</seg>
<seg id=330> For years, there is a budget line to be financed in the framework programmes for mine clearance and prevention.</seg>
<seg id=331> Let me at this point to the reference made by Mrs Paciotti, I will of course put even today, within the Commission, what has happened to the money for mine clearance and should be done.</seg>
<seg id=332> B5-0794 / 2000 by Mr Medina Ortega, linksohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the abduction of the negotiations jesuiten in Spanish guerrillas in Colombia;</seg>
<seg id=333> We all regret this and would like to speak not about Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=334> The Commission has already offered to coordinate the actions of this package, and the Commission is planning in the next few days, making considerable resources.</seg>
<seg id=335> Once again, therefore, apply double standards, which I think is regrettable.</seg>
<seg id=336> Particularly incomprehensible to me is the behaviour of the Albanian opposition party, but here it is aware of the need for a solution to the Albanian problem in Macedonia.</seg>
<seg id=337> I think it is an extraordinary achievement of the Macedonians to come within their country.</seg>
<seg id=338> That is why I believe that this reconciliation can be kept, but the government, with great courage has found a solution to the universitätsfrage and many other issues need visible signs of success and needs strong support, otherwise the peace in the region as a whole.</seg>
<seg id=339> In the context of the national programme for the year 2000 PHARE funds can also to support the university in coming academic year, 2001 and 2002, to be used.</seg>
<seg id=340> I must stress that all the Greek Members have already expressed in the European Parliament on this issue.</seg>
<seg id=341> Because all these problems concern Greece, which is the largest shipping sector in the European Union, it is basically the security of every kind of shipping throughout the Union.</seg>
<seg id=342> In recent years, many more people have lost their lives in our waters, not only by large passenger ferry disasters, but all too often in our fishing communities.</seg>
<seg id=343> On the contrary, innocent victims must be used now, so that the ship owners can achieve its objectives in its broadest sense.</seg>
<seg id=344> We must be aware that it is also a question of the credibility of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=345> Finally, I would stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the issue of European legislation must be on the safety of passenger ships, a matter of the highest priority in the European Union, and that it is important to ensure that this legislation will be applied rigorously and uniformly throughout the Community.</seg>
<seg id=346> I apologise for the fact that I am late for reasons of which you are aware, I would like to make a brief statement on the two issues on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade and in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general, as well as the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=347> Commissioner Verheugen, as Mr Solana will speak on the two issues on our agenda this afternoon, the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg id=348> We must be prepared to deliver on this promise, as soon as the will of the people is respected.</seg>
<seg id=349> Madam President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I am participating in this debate without reservations. I wanted to that our Parliament in view of the tragic consequences of the new gewaltausbruchs in the Middle East to condemn a month after the here in this Chamber today, only expectations as confident as a judge who is entitled to this or that.</seg>
<seg id=350> Madam President, my contribution today is not based on all kinds of fernanalysen but on my own experience of the last week, because I happened to be in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip, when it came to the violence.</seg>
<seg id=351> The opponents of the violence cannot be the violence of the Israelis and the Palestinians on the same footing.</seg>
<seg id=352> I should like to ask the decisive moment in this Parliament to adopt a declaration of solidarity with the brave people who has defended today in the streets of Belgrade, the freedom to show the same solidarity when we Europeans, only a few years ago, the people of other capitals are fighting for their freedom.</seg>
<seg id=353> Without doubt, the Europeans would do well to take us here in this House by the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council opportunity in the bud.</seg>
<seg id=354> The status of Jerusalem is a difficult point in the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=355> For years, it has managed to deceive with his propaganda machine and brutal pressure on the media, the people in his own country, but also, unfortunately, many in the Western world, believing you a false picture of the reality.</seg>
<seg id=356> Since the curtain falls to this tragedy, it is the duty of this Parliament as a symbol of a united Europe, free to support the masses before the Yugoslav parliament and to help Mr Kostuníca and meeting in the exercise of their mandate.</seg>
<seg id=357> At the same time, it is precisely this tough stance fear the worst - and the events of this moment of these words, which I have noted a couple of hours ago.</seg>
<seg id=358> I wonder whether the Commissioner on this point is already planning steps to show that we are really Kostunica as the legally elected representatives of the Serbian people and as a partner, has to do with the European Union is today.</seg>
<seg id=359> The European Parliament would like to get him at this historic moment, since the tyranny and democracy triumphed, declaring its full solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=360> The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0237 / 2000) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2000 / 24 / EC as regards the extension of the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to cover loans for projects in Croatia (COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000 / 0122 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=361> The following the presidential and parliamentary elections in this country ’ s chosen new political line is to be welcomed.</seg>
<seg id=362> It is a consultative task force, whose objective is to offer Croatia their competence and technical assistance in the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=363> We must not forget that Croatia was until recently a classic example of a completely failed privatisierungsprogramms, with only a few have benefited from the privatisation. This whole process must be supported.</seg>
<seg id=364> The contribution in the form of a eib-darlehens over EUR 250 million for the period 2000 to 2007, this can be a milestone, but carrying aid.</seg>
<seg id=365> That is why it is not quite correct when this report speaks of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id=366> As Croatia and Slovakia half a century ago, have been independent for the first time, in particular, they were the hitler-regimes flunkeys.</seg>
<seg id=367> We can, of course, the issue of security and the question of Croatia in isolation from the debate yesterday evening and development in Belgrade.</seg>
<seg id=368> If it is the case that Milosevic is fled and the will of the people has gained the upper hand, we hope that the accession partnership practical normal relations between Serbia and our Europe of democracies is just days.</seg>
<seg id=369> I declare, 6 October 2000 on Friday session of the European Parliament adjourned.</seg>
<seg id=370> (The House rose and observed a minute 's silence)</seg>
<seg id=371> My question is this: who is entitled to speak on behalf of the European Parliament on the Statute?</seg>
<seg id=372> I would ask you, Madam President, to take all possible measures to speed up the procedure in the Committee on Petitions on the more than thirty social groups and NGOs, the petitioners presented in protest against the current situation in the Community to be in flagrant violation of the radiation protection.</seg>
<seg id=373> Autopsies carried in Georgia has shown that it clearly murder, probably in connection with torture.</seg>
<seg id=374> We have the opportunity to their dream - which, incidentally, is not my - a great step forward.</seg>
<seg id=375> This is the basic legislation and the basis for any other legislation of genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id=376> It is obvious fettnäpfchen from one to the other.</seg>
<seg id=377> (The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.50 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=378> The next item is the report (A5-0291 / 2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council [COM (2000) 379 - c5-0508 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 (COS)], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the social agenda.</seg>
<seg id=379> The importance of this open method of coordination, it does not mean that this method should replace the social legislation in Europe, because we must also dare to establish social rights, minimum social standards and adopt legislation, in the framework of the European internal market.</seg>
<seg id=380> In our opinion, we also call for dialogue and cooperation with civil society and in particular with the women ’ s organisations in the countries which are currently preparing for accession to the European family, because that is where we must start in a harmonious development in theory and practice in the example of the rest of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=381> The communication from the Commission in the areas mentioned, there is broad agreement.</seg>
<seg id=382> On this point in my speech, I would like to remind you of a seminar to be held on this subject on 4 and 5 December in Biarritz, and that I shall be.</seg>
<seg id=383> With regard to the fight against exclusion, we have made on 17 October, the Council of Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs' great progress and appropriate objectives defined in the fight against poverty and social exclusion, which should serve as a basis for the national action plans.</seg>
<seg id=384> I have heard from some quarters that we agree to read the report, although the diagnosis, but not the imposition of prescription.</seg>
<seg id=385> The development of technology and the new forms of cooperation are certainly also for a flexible, the less rigid codes of conduct, but rather on objectives and results.</seg>
<seg id=386> It is precisely this that the best are due to regulate everything, in our view, the old-fashioned views which cannot be blamed for those who expect of a liberalised market.</seg>
<seg id=387> This has contributed greatly to social peace in our country, and foreign direct investors confidence.</seg>
<seg id=388> The method chosen, seems to me to be somewhat questionable.</seg>
<seg id=389> When we talk of a Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the face of a European Constitution, we must not be short-sighted, but open to that all necessary steps, even if it needs to be more accurate rules.</seg>
<seg id=390> I would like to say to the new challenges of health and safety at work, and the employee participation in the labour relations.</seg>
<seg id=391> Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Minister Mrs Péry to this presentation of the social policy agenda.</seg>
<seg id=392> We know that these points be combated by the conservatives in Europe. However, we in our group are concerned.</seg>
<seg id=393> The third aspect concerns the content of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=394> The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=395> The actions of the Commission by a review of the impact of the individual to be supplemented for access to medical care, social security and pension system, as well as a study of the shortcomings in the organization of work, and perhaps the question of a general reduction in working hours.</seg>
<seg id=396> In this way, the women will feel Europe, but Europe will also benefit from the interesting and innovative ideas that will result from the commitment to this programme.</seg>
<seg id=397> We expect an annual report from the President of the Commission, every year, in the context of a debate in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=398> I am also pleased that an improvement of the measures for child care, the reconciliation of professional and family life should be facilitated.</seg>
<seg id=399> My group will take this into account in the final vote.</seg>
<seg id=400> (The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=401> I believe that the new approach by the Commission is very positive, and the proposal for a decision on the programme for the period 2001-2005 well thought through.</seg>
<seg id=402> In my opinion, the many amendments supported by us reflect the common position, the Commission and the Committee on Women's rights in this matter.</seg>
<seg id=403> On the one hand, I have received in the course of the last year by a number of companies which have a certain impotence in connection with the investigation had not least in those cases in which an appeal be appealed against the decision of the Commission, the Court of First Instance.</seg>
<seg id=404> I would also like to take this opportunity to ask Mr Monti, when the implementation of a public register, effective and efficient is on state aid, and when the long in the scoreboard.</seg>
<seg id=405> Furthermore, I would point out to Mr Monti that ought to be given broader area banking in the next report.</seg>
<seg id=406> As I have said, not only in the field of energy policy as a whole, but also for other areas.</seg>
<seg id=407> Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done on the two reports, in which they make a flattering assessment of its activities and the Directorate-General for Competition.</seg>
<seg id=408> I stress this because the market cannot regulate everything and there is in this respect and not unlimited competition.</seg>
<seg id=409> Mr President, nobody denies today - and I do not, of course, that the change the conditions of competition and state aid of evil than they favour the inefficiency of the companies.</seg>
<seg id=410> It was already strange to hear that he denies the reduction in state aid during the period 1994-1998, even though the Commission itself acknowledges this.</seg>
<seg id=411> My opinion is xxix must, of course, the Commission report on competition policy, but let us not to look back at the past.</seg>
<seg id=412> In the time allocated to me, I should like to comment on three issues: modernisation of Community competition law, activities in 1999 to enforce the competition rules and, finally, the state aid.</seg>
<seg id=413> The Commission is always opposed to kartellbildungen and intervention against the abuse of a dominant position.</seg>
<seg id=414> Mr Rapkay, the Commission attaches great importance to the support of your competition policy by the European Parliament, and I do not have the impression that this support is falling.</seg>
<seg id=415> This system can be activated either at the request of a Member State or in accordance with Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, a provision for during the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union to the Member States with a derogation is currently, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.</seg>
<seg id=416> In future the recourse to the capital market should remain the only possible option.</seg>
<seg id=417> I therefore ask that the report in its present version, the approval of the House, and that the European internal market in the area of rebpflanzgutes can therefore be used.</seg>
<seg id=418> That must be changed, it is due to the development of the plant health rules and to scientific and technical progress that has been made, particularly in the in-vitro-vermehrung.</seg>
<seg id=419> By taking the precautionary principle to the possibility of genetic changes, for example, the intensive use of pesticides can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id=420> Finally, I would like to say that we should, in the interest of the precautionary principle, if the amendments I have just mentioned Article and should not be withdrawn as, unfortunately, there are also the view of the wine growers, Mrs Isler Béguin and, therefore, of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and vote in favour of their removal.</seg>
<seg id=421> Mr President, if I may, Commissioner, you could give your opinion on the amendment of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy? this is Amendment No 1.</seg>
<seg id=422> The only controversial point was whether I should take it on the decree withdrawing the mandate of Mr Le Pen immediately after it was transmitted by the French Government to minutes or not.</seg>
<seg id=423> I would remind you that this vote will take place at 12.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id=424> In the field of justice and home affairs, I am optimistic about a solution to the issue of civil judicial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=425> The Convention is fully their task to 19 November, the date of the next ministerial meeting.</seg>
<seg id=426> We need a stimulating climate, such as Mr Moscovici said, and I have with the Heads of State and Government take the very strong feeling of a common, historic responsibility at an historic moment for European integration.</seg>
<seg id=427> It must be respected, not only that we are now in these issues of qualified majority behind the spirit or the climate in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg id=428> The small countries are not the agent of the large countries of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=429> I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council, it would make that point.</seg>
<seg id=430> On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica was an historic event.</seg>
<seg id=431> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, although some progress has been made on closer cooperation, and the extension of qualified majority voting, but more profound disagreement about the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council, as you have pointed out.</seg>
<seg id=432> It seems to me that we are moving in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id=433> Anyone who does not agree with the freedoms of closer cooperation, which has mitfahrers on the back of a vehicle.</seg>
<seg id=434> I do not want to me - and you - in Germany ’ s domestic affairs, but I am of the opinion that this position is totally coherent and in the direction of the Commission, if I am not mistaken.</seg>
<seg id=435> We have started an exchange of views with the Member States on this issue, that all Member States are in favour of maintaining this ceiling after enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=436> This will certainly not be the case.</seg>
<seg id=437> Firstly, we have sometimes had the impression that a certain obsession in Biarritz dominated by the debate between small and large states.</seg>
<seg id=438> In this regard, it is not enough to say, in my opinion, the procedures must be respected.</seg>
<seg id=439> Even after the accession of the candidate countries today, each Member State must retain a junior- or seniorkommissar.</seg>
<seg id=440> The wording of Article 93 is problematic in view of the fact that it will be in the first wave of successful virtually impossible to achieve progress in the direction of a qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=441> The citizens of these countries to the undoubted advantages that any new European Treaty, are convinced.</seg>
<seg id=442> It would be to ignore the fundamental causes of this crisis, we wanted to believe that for generations could have new shocks without a final peace process, which is a prerequisite for a reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id=443> I am concerned, the only right weak response to Parliament ’ s demand for democratisation.</seg>
<seg id=444> This can be blamed for this, but rather the forces that are calling for enlargement before the full implementation of the reforms.</seg>
<seg id=445> On the one hand, the decision by the government of Israel to freeze the peace process because of the use of force in the region and to concentrate its efforts on the formation of a notstandsregierung with the leader of the opposition, Mr Sharon.</seg>
<seg id=446> Of course, we have noted with satisfaction the victory of the Yugoslav people indescribable Mr Kostuníca and the election of the President.</seg>
<seg id=447> I commend Mr Barón Crespo to ask his Italian colleagues but a reason why they participate in Italy with a very communist party in government and preparing with another very Communist party, the della Rifondazione Comunista, moreover, to take part in the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id=448> It should be made through the codecision procedure.</seg>
<seg id=449> The Commission is to give the possibility of simple majority votes in the Commission, this impetus in the future.</seg>
<seg id=450> But now to find solutions to people who are able to identify the problems in the years to bewerkstelligende 3-8 enlargement and answers will be needed in the European Union, a vision which is caught up in the year 2030.</seg>
<seg id=451> Therefore, it is an open conditions of work, not from the top down or enforced.</seg>
<seg id=452> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=453> This fundamental reference is lost, it is not in order, at best, at worst, it brings each other.</seg>
<seg id=454> Democracy is better in Europe, but the ailing European democracy.</seg>
<seg id=455> The European Parliament has made today, on 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, a simple and clear statement: yes to the European Constitution, yes, we want them.</seg>
<seg id=456> Therefore the island is in itself sufficient criterion.</seg>
<seg id=457> I shall confine myself to the heart of the matter, I am going to concentrate on the essential points of the report by the chairman, Mr Gil-Robles, on which I would like to say that I think it is excellent.</seg>
<seg id=458> First of all, simplifying and clarifying the Treaties.</seg>
<seg id=459> I should like to leave it at that, because the report of the University Institute of Florence - at least for me, is not at issue.</seg>
<seg id=460> According to the information available, it is now very technical, you see, I would ask the Presidency, is a clear majority of the language versions, in contrast to the Italian version of the application of the cohesion policy to be made only on the least favoured islands and not on the islands in general.</seg>
<seg id=461> Mr Duhamel, you will agree with me that it will not be a success if Nice, or at least no credibility is no place for considering the future of European integration, at least not in the present framework.</seg>
<seg id=462> It is also in this European Constitution is necessary to clarify the division of responsibilities between the Member States and the European Union and the dynamic of European integration in areas where it is essential to act together, as in the foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=463> It could also be required to persistent blockages.</seg>
<seg id=464> We need a clearer distribution of responsibilities and a clearer principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=465> We know that there are very different views on this in the various Member States, in the various social partners.</seg>
<seg id=466> The end cause of a European Constitution, however, sadly, exactly the opposite, and that is why we cannot accept it.</seg>
<seg id=467> Since the European Parliament there will be increased in the military, monetary and fiscal policy at the table, and the other on the outside.</seg>
<seg id=468> The second version is clearly not correct, because the economically backward regions are already covered by the Structural Funds, and on the other hand, to this interpretation, no reason for the adoption of the Declaration No. 30.</seg>
<seg id=469> Mr President, I shall concentrate in my modest short 60 seconds on the report by Mr Olivier Duhamel, which is an excellent one, because it really call things by their real names. Lyrismus earlier and our rapporteur has convinced us once and for all.</seg>
<seg id=470> In my opinion, the unity of Europe can only be political in nature.</seg>
<seg id=471> We believe that the new Constitution should be available for the next European elections and can enter into force.</seg>
<seg id=472> Consequently, the name 'most disadvantaged' applied to both the island regions, as in other areas, and to be made after the proposal by Mr Barnier must, in accordance with the provisions of the agreement in Vienna, a modification of the Italian text.</seg>
<seg id=473> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=474> As the honourable Member said that they wanted to vote against this amendment is lapses.</seg>
<seg id=475> Mr President, it is obvious that it is a recipe for chaos.</seg>
<seg id=476> I welcome the adoption of the Trakatellis report by Parliament, but he sets high standards of quality and safety standards for blood or plasma derivatives.</seg>
<seg id=477> If the European parliamentary immunity is independent, then the French authorities had to turn the waiver of Mr Le Pen's immunity.</seg>
<seg id=478> I am particularly disappointed by the vote of the European Parliament on the report on the marketing of propagating material of vine.</seg>
<seg id=479> Some believe that alcohol, tobacco and drugs as a product for the consumer and for their fellow human beings, the others see it as a means of creating jobs and a huge number of source of funds.</seg>
<seg id=480> In general, the rapporteur welcomes the proposals contained in the Commission's White Paper on this issue, however, is concerned about the possible impact of the reform, which is, in principle, to decentralise the enforcement of competition rules.</seg>
<seg id=481> In the debate yesterday evening, I gave to Mr Jonathan Evans on his work, but I had to start by my clear criticism of the Liberals, if not ultra-liberal orientation of his report.</seg>
<seg id=482> It is designed to ensure that emphasis in the next three years, half of all new projects in fields jobs being created in the Objective 1 regions.</seg>
<seg id=483> In view of the indignation, which will lead to the consequences of this policy, sometimes manages to defuse state intervention, with the aid of subsidies and other economic or tax incentives, the situation, at least in part.</seg>
<seg id=484> (The sitting was suspended at 14.06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=485> We are now in October 2000, on the eve of the decision on the zahlengerüst the budget for 2001.</seg>
<seg id=486> This has not prevented the Council but to reduce agricultural spending as a whole 555 million euro.</seg>
<seg id=487> Furthermore, we must, of course, are not that simple, 400 created simply apply.</seg>
<seg id=488> The Council, I can only say that follow us.</seg>
<seg id=489> That is why the administration for the Members of this House and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id=490> The European Court of Auditors makes us at least.</seg>
<seg id=491> Finally, the budget of the European Ombudsman is to deal with.</seg>
<seg id=492> On the contrary, we are of the opinion that the research should, especially in relation to the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=493> We also propose that Parliament will continue to be informed on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id=494> And if a legislative conciliation procedure on social affairs, culture and the environment - the Commissioner will agree with me - then we set ourselves, the Commissioner for the budget, the Finance Ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets, in order to pray that no financial inconsistency is committed.</seg>
<seg id=495> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your friendly welcome.</seg>
<seg id=496> Indeed, it has already approved at first reading of the budget, which would appear to be justified to him for 2001, without the need for tactical considerations, the objective of adequate resources for the Community institutions to continue.</seg>
<seg id=497> Before they decide on the budget 2001, I would like to highlight a number of objectives, on which there is consensus between the Council and Parliament, which will lead to an agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=498> In structural policy, we are in a similar situation.</seg>
<seg id=499> The conciliation procedure in the summer, Mr Colom I Naval has pointed out - a good result, namely that in the future ausgabewirksamen legal bases for improved information will be made available to Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=500> I would remind you that the whole period in the last year of the financial perspective for the Balkans for 1 850 million until 2006.</seg>
<seg id=501> Once again, I would ask the Commission to examine its proposal on the table, with this proposal, and also to take as an opportunity.</seg>
<seg id=502> The material was both for the programming of the budget for 2001 and for the discharge for 1999 that appear to be very useful.</seg>
<seg id=503> Much as I appreciate, as a Member of the Committee on Budgets, the work of this body, and I pay tribute to the work of the rapporteur and the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets, I do not want to fail, as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but to draw attention to two of the amendments presented in the committee and in the House once again the importance of smaller amounts are not entirely irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id=504> With these measures, we want to make the legal control fully functional, restore confidence in the legal security of the EU and strengthen the European Union as a Community of justice.</seg>
<seg id=505> The Commission's immediate withdrawal of this initiative was a clear violation of the political will of Lisbon and the priority of this House.</seg>
<seg id=506> This decision was very strange and many of us with the feeling that this important programme was simply become the plaything of between the Committee on Budgets and the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=507> My third point is the European agricultural policy as it is now before us in the preliminary draft budget.</seg>
<seg id=508> If employment is a political priority for the Union, then the fisheries must not remain as a sector of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=509> I am particularly pleased that the funding was to be the last year on the Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000 programmes.</seg>
<seg id=510> The arrears in our mittelmeerhilfe, for example, amount to the budgets of several years.</seg>
<seg id=511> Mr President, in the last few years I was the spokesman for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on whose behalf afternoon Mrs Iivari said today.</seg>
<seg id=512> But I would like to say to the Members here this afternoon that we should not lose sight of the fact that the EU uses only 1% of GDP, and a large part of this is administered in the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=513> Let me now turn to the overall strategy.</seg>
<seg id=514> Here I would now be reached in the strategy of my group, because the starting point of our convictions is the desire to ensure that the citizens of Europe as a favourable cost-benefit ratio.</seg>
<seg id=515> On the contrary, we need to work towards a Parliament, committed to transparency, efficiency and an effective democratic control of the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=516> We need to think about how we solve this problem.</seg>
<seg id=517> Do we want to promote democratisation, and we want a balanced relationship between the traditional areas of foreign policy, which we now have before us.</seg>
<seg id=518> The biggest problem in the new budget for external actions.</seg>
<seg id=519> Thrifty economies is necessary, of course, is supported by us, and we should not cheat us.</seg>
<seg id=520> This is an extraordinary initiative, particularly in the first reading, and it is a thankless initiative, as it will find a majority in the current circumstances.</seg>
<seg id=521> Nevertheless, the size of the appropriations for Kosovo poses a number of problems.</seg>
<seg id=522> With the budgetary policy we need to win the confidence of the citizens in European policy.</seg>
<seg id=523> All the measures aimed at strengthening of small and medium-sized businesses are therefore to support.</seg>
<seg id=524> The extent of the implementation of the budget.</seg>
<seg id=525> It maintains this strategic line than approach to this and the budgets for the coming years, this House takes its place in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg id=526> With the transfer of EUR 175 million approximately EUR 25 million are available to us more than we expected.</seg>
<seg id=527> On the subject of MEDA, the Council stated that the commitments are not a problem, because eight years have been accumulated delays in payments.</seg>
<seg id=528> I believe that Mr Duff was here this morning, as we made at the European Council in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg id=529> My answer is quite simple.</seg>
<seg id=530> The last time a defender of human rights activists have been murdered, 25 and the Colombian press recently published plan 100 'of the paramilitary groups, which should be 100 human rights activists.</seg>
<seg id=531> The present attitude of the Council makes me a little more than the July, seems, in fact, the European Union, as we have seen in many international crisis situations to enter a final and to make their voice heard.</seg>
<seg id=532> My question is this, and I will end here, whether there are any opportunity to exert greater pressure, as proposed by the President in his information, and if we want to make the aid which will be different from that of the United States in this respect, it is not the fumigation of plantations, but to the replanting of other cultures and not to the military, but on the social aspects.</seg>
<seg id=533> I and the other Members' questions relating specifically to the situation in Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=534> As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.</seg>
<seg id=535> Subject: taxation of financial transactions, the demand for a tax on speculative capital gains in the last few months. Attac-ausschüsse many (Association pour les sur taxation of transactions were financières et citoyens pour l aide aux used) in France and in Europe and in the French National Assembly and in the Senate amendments.</seg>
<seg id=536> Furthermore, it should also answer the question of what impact they would have on the volatility of the financial markets, in particular at a rate of 0.01%, while the speculators of devaluation of the order of 20 to 50%.</seg>
<seg id=537> In paragraph 26 calls for the establishment of an international schiedsorganisation the cancellation of the debt of the countries of the South.</seg>
<seg id=538> The year was also the case in the euro, regardless of whether they or regrets this.</seg>
<seg id=539> What Danielle Auroi earlier with regard to the countries of the southern hemisphere has said, I would like to add that the estimates of specialists interesting figures, for example, that a tax in the form of the Tobin tax revenue from 50 to 250 billion dollars would provide, according to the calculations of the UNDP $40 billion per year would be a minimum living conditions for the hundreds of millions of people to ensure, in the countries of the third world in particular.</seg>
<seg id=540> In the last few months, the disease has been identified in various parts of France.</seg>
<seg id=541> Now that the representative of the French Presidency is here, I would like to know whether the slaughter of cattle being paid from the EU budget, or from the national budget and whether it considers that it is appropriate to settle it from the EU budget.</seg>
<seg id=542> I would ask you to give their consent, that it can now be answered.</seg>
<seg id=543> The margin for manoeuvre of both government is limited by international law.</seg>
<seg id=544> I cannot see how the Commission can speak in February, which it needs, and the Council in July.</seg>
<seg id=545> If the European Union is in the name of subsidiarity, such an approach to absolve you in fact one of the exercise, as it has done in the last few weeks, both in Northern Italy and Spain.</seg>
<seg id=546> I can accept as a Member of the European Parliament, this majority, that will be spent 11.5 billion pounds from British taxpayers' money - that is the current annual contribution, if the general public is behind this?</seg>
<seg id=547> With a flexible attitude on the part of the Council, a second reading agreement could be reached in order to complete the budget.</seg>
<seg id=548> If someone must be convinced that he look at the evidence.</seg>
<seg id=549> Mr Joan Colom I Naval, the Vice-President responsible for buildings, has presented this strategy.</seg>
<seg id=550> As Mrs Schreyer has already mentioned, this year's draft budget many political messages. The reform of the agricultural policy, structural programmes, new and better implementation of structural policy, the implementation of the decisions of the Lisbon Summit, to create a stronger and more competitive EU and to combat social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=551> The NATO war has destroyed too much and too great suffering.</seg>
<seg id=552> In spite of the agreements, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to achieve this objective within the framework of the existing budget constraints, without undermining the agricultural budget, which is in favour of a sustainable agricultural sector in the present Member States is essential.</seg>
<seg id=553> And I have told you quite plainly: koštunica must get its opportunity, and we hope, will make in the next few weeks or months for an amnesty, although I am very much in favour of the introduction of these two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, political conditions are at a political level and with regard to the budget.</seg>
<seg id=554> The elections in Yugoslavia shows two things: people have enough at the dictator Milosevic, and they have confidence in Professor Kostunica.</seg>
<seg id=555> I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners are released soon.</seg>
<seg id=556> We do not do this, it will inevitably lead to a 'financial planning', redistribution and cuts in general, both social and environmental expenditure and the cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=557> Measures to solve the major social problems, such as unemployment, asked.</seg>
<seg id=558> I, of course, is a fact as enormously important, namely that we have started, with Category 4. But it is not entirely clear whether there is a solution, because the Council is not willing to cooperate.</seg>
<seg id=559> In every budget, it is important to set priorities.</seg>
<seg id=560> This is with a view to the expiry of the Treaty in the near future, but it would be very serious concern that, in the framework of the ECSC should be able to continue with such practices.</seg>
<seg id=561> This leads to my third point, which is now before us.</seg>
<seg id=562> The new financial agreement. This is not a vote of no confidence against the politicians in the EU, as I have heard.</seg>
<seg id=563> Give credit where it is due.</seg>
<seg id=564> All the institutions concerned the dialogue has enabled an unprecedented cooperation which will allow us, I fervently hope, to reach an agreement at first reading.</seg>
<seg id=565> We are in favour of European values in a country eu-skeptischen, now have a further argument for the European Union: a more effective protection of personal data, which is for the citizens in the modern society is of major importance.</seg>
<seg id=566> I have noted that a change in the law should be carried out in my own country on personal data which, through the influence of Members in the decisions of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=567> In a number of other points, we also see problems. The verdict of the practice must be seen to be safe.</seg>
<seg id=568> . (FR) The Commission would first like to refer to the commitment that we all have to the citizens, the protection of personal data processed by the institutions.</seg>
<seg id=569> With this statement, the Commission accepts that the scope of the regulation to be restricted exclusively to the activities in the framework of the first pillar.</seg>
<seg id=570> In accordance with the political agreement reached with the Council, the Commission and the rapporteur for adoption at first reading, it will therefore reject any additional amendment, which is not in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, approved Paciotti report, apart from Amendment No 69 of Amendment No 41.</seg>
<seg id=571> Therefore, the staff of the interservice group will be increased within the General Secretariat of the Commission immediately, so that we can all the proposals of legal acts with general scope for their attached to the Commission, on the basis of Article 299 (2) it is essential for a thorough impact assessment.</seg>
<seg id=572> From the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market, I am keen to emphasise that we really can only deal with this matter, which is the same.</seg>
<seg id=573> In view of the importance of fisheries for the outermost regions, I am saddened by this very much.</seg>
<seg id=574> Since an interservices group was set up under the presidency of Mr Delors for the outermost regions, we have travelled a long and fruitful path, and I should like to thank the group so far, this has led to the deepest thanks to the Europeans living in the outermost regions.</seg>
<seg id=575> So while the Treaty of Rome contained a reference to the French overseas departments, but it took until 1989 and to the treatment of the programmes, to solve the problems specific to remoteness and insularity, intervention by the European Union finally realised that the immutable character of the combined approach and the structural disadvantages of outermost regions justify special treatment in comparison with other regions of the Community.</seg>
<seg id=576> I have no doubt that the proposals which the Commission will put to the Council will be characterised by these characteristics.</seg>
<seg id=577> This question is all the more relevant, as is the enlargement of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=578> This right of differentiation is nothing more than a result of the principle of equality, which is also to deal with what is different.</seg>
<seg id=579> It is a document that my team and I regard as rich in ideas and proposals, the cuts to the heart of the problems and issues that are not moving in the outermost regions, a source of concern.</seg>
<seg id=580> In her report, Mrs Sudre, the need for a permanent action rightly emphasises.</seg>
<seg id=581> In the recovery of economic diversification, we have made substantial progress in several areas.</seg>
<seg id=582> It is important that a large number of projects proposed within the framework of the DOCUP parallel to this activity, but on the ground, we must analyse the specific needs, the specific access each of these outermost regions.</seg>
<seg id=583> Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg id=584> I will, of course, inform the President of your comment.</seg>
<seg id=585> I am concerned about a number of equipment that might be and the decisions of the House called into question because of a lack of the necessary rules for such a case.</seg>
<seg id=586> Both the authority and the legislative proposals that aim to guarantee food safety, will receive the support of this Parliament, Mr Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=587> The main focus of its activities is scientific advice, because the debate on food safety must be equally on an objective basis.</seg>
<seg id=588> Mr President, I should not like to miss this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and for his willingness to take into account the opinions of the other committees.</seg>
<seg id=589> When we are faced with a potential risk, the precautionary principle must be applied.</seg>
<seg id=590> What are still controversial question concerns the extent to which we in the remit of this authority should also include issues such as food and the advice and support of the bodies, to carry out risk management, we are of the opinion that this authority should be for food standards in all matters of food safety, at least the possibility of giving an opinion and to offer its support.</seg>
<seg id=591> Of key importance for the preservation of the rich traditions.</seg>
<seg id=592> This recognition is not through legislation, not through legislation, but by scientific excellence, integrity and independence, accountability, transparency and clarity.</seg>
<seg id=593> Good scientific knowledge is essential if we are to assess the risks associated with the food chain, from farm to table.</seg>
<seg id=594> Mr President, there is no doubt that the creation of a European agency for food safety, as our rapporteur call in general.</seg>
<seg id=595> If the who-programm continue to receive the necessary resources and the necessary support, we do not need any additional agency. This applies especially to an agency with the 15 Member States of the European Union so limited scope.</seg>
<seg id=596> Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers who want to eat healthily and we must concern.</seg>
<seg id=597> If we do not get a new framework directive, we will have a great deal in the area of food safety, only smile.</seg>
<seg id=598> Consequently, the Treaty changes are necessary to ensure that the Commission has been in the hands of sanctions in the food sector, as these are already in the field of competition.</seg>
<seg id=599> I support all the partners involved, whether in political, administrative or other trägerschaften who work on the strategy 'food for everyone. "</seg>
<seg id=600> I do not agree with this statement when a person is more than just a body.</seg>
<seg id=601> The authority must be the head of the coordination of the network of national agencies, which, in turn, to express a network of centres of excellence for food safety at the level of the individual regions and coordinate.</seg>
<seg id=602> Their Amendment No 11 and Amendment No 17 would therefore be perfectly in line with each other.</seg>
<seg id=603> The reform of the food legislation in the European Union should take place at the level of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=604> In his report, not so much amendments have been tabled, as a set of priorities.</seg>
<seg id=605> In the report we have made this request, which I welcome.</seg>
<seg id=606> The creation of a European food safety authority is, however, extremely positive.</seg>
<seg id=607> In the interests of all European citizens that these criteria are applied to it.</seg>
<seg id=608> I believe that specific periods must be defined, within which the European Commission is to inform the justified concern.</seg>
<seg id=609> The EU must guarantee their citizens the highest possible standards in the area of food.</seg>
<seg id=610> The Commission is now proposing the setting up of a European food authority.</seg>
<seg id=611> I am concerned that Europe is running the risk, once again, to have a bloated bureaucracy that is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id=612> The more we create new levels of bureaucracy and the more money we spend, the more can be done.</seg>
<seg id=613> They prevent similar and work in several institutions.</seg>
<seg id=614> However, we must ensure that the White Paper is in the shadow of the debate about the fear of the public from a bureaucratic Europe, which refers to the quality of the products, without the effective fight against deception and harmful to mislead the consumer.</seg>
<seg id=615> As you know, the strategy for food safety in the Commission has the highest priority.</seg>
<seg id=616> The Commission will approve a proposal for a regulation, which will form the framework for future health protection measures in the area of food and which will be laid down the general principles and objectives of food safety.</seg>
<seg id=617> Thank you very much, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=618> But now to our report, I take a positive view of the Commission's proposal, and I have to say that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation of Parliament have done some excellent work, in order to improve it as possible, especially in certain areas.</seg>
<seg id=619> As our colleague, Mrs Bonino, clearly and explicitly mentioned has been done with the proposal of the Commission, is a further step forward.</seg>
<seg id=620> We believe that the proposal for a regulation for the Commission too vague.</seg>
<seg id=621> It is essential that the allocation will be organised in accordance with reasonable for mine clearance and that we will be able to finance research and räumungsarbeiten detention for instruments to be used in a simple way, so that they are in the developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=622> In the last eight years we have provided more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget for the fight against landmines.</seg>
<seg id=623> We can, however, not punish the people for their incompetent government.</seg>
<seg id=624> As I have already said, I think it would be a good thing, but it is wrong and counterproductive to sign up to the Ottawa Convention to be compulsory and immediately condition for support for mine action by the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=625> I am opposed to Amendment No 19.</seg>
<seg id=626> Secondly, the international community must improve the coordination at a global level and, particularly in the countries concerned.</seg>
<seg id=627> Mr President, the Socialist Group agrees with the comments made by Mr Van Orden and is also proud of the role of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=628> Let us recall the Soviet spielzeugbomben in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=629> Thank you very much for an excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=630> Mr President, the people of Cambodia mines as the eternal.</seg>
<seg id=631> With regard to the uniform people have a legitimate suspicion that has built up over many years of war.</seg>
<seg id=632> Mr President, I am pleased that there is a European legislation in the form of a regulation on anti-personnel mines and that is before us today is a very good report by Mrs Bonino on this regulation.</seg>
<seg id=633> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are faced with a very sad.</seg>
<seg id=634> It is not by chance that the mines are mainly in crisis regions, in other words in areas where different initiatives could be taken to deal with this crisis.</seg>
<seg id=635> In two kilometres away from the Bosnian village a sign to the minengefahr points in a field as in 1999, however, that is not a small boy.</seg>
<seg id=636> It is tragic that the civilian population is suffering the inability of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id=637> Please allow me, ladies and gentlemen, it is in the name of our institution, its special relations with the country in the context of our common project to build an area of prosperity, security and peace in the Mediterranean, to be very welcome.</seg>
<seg id=638> All mines are in storage.</seg>
<seg id=639> Mr President, I agree with almost all of what has been said by my fellow Members, I do not wish to repeat it.</seg>
<seg id=640> The concept of open cooperation is synonymous with a relapse into the institutional system dominated by Commission officials.</seg>
<seg id=641> We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close to those affected as possible.</seg>
<seg id=642> However, as the main amendments tabled by the PPE Group just managed to find a substantial majority, I voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg id=643> Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz, for two reasons: firstly, because I had the opportunity to vote on paragraphs 2 and 5, in particular, and to express my opposition to the two.</seg>
<seg id=644> In other words, on the table of the common European House some would dine à la carte, while others have to be content with the einheitsmenü.</seg>
<seg id=645> The democratic control and must not, in our view, the main problem of the European Union is not on the list of these rights and its inclusion in the Treaties.</seg>
<seg id=646> The instrument of the referenda and the amendments to this report have already been addressed.</seg>
<seg id=647> At the elections to the European Parliament in 1999, the turnout was only 40% if the countries with wahlpflicht and those who carried out at the same time, with the European elections, account national elections.</seg>
<seg id=648> In order to achieve the desired objective of a European Constitution, it is not advisable to impose strict rechtsfiguren and methods, which would be disastrous consequences which fail to achieve the desired objective.</seg>
<seg id=649> A real social constitution should adapt the important achievements of the world of work, in favour of women, immigrants and to the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=650> . (PT) I have voted in favour of it, although I do not a laudable intention, highlighting the strengthening and deepening of the European Union and the simplification of the texts, which is necessary for its citizens, not abspreche.</seg>
<seg id=651> The distribution of competences</seg>
<seg id=652> In my opinion, it is crucial that the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the EU is a response to the Council of Europe Convention.</seg>
<seg id=653> The report by Mr Gil-Robles, however, is to help, because it contains a proposal that some Member States of the European Union in certain areas and sectors and areas of voting on a common approach.</seg>
<seg id=654> If ever more important issues should be decided by a qualified majority, basic standards of democracy are being violated.</seg>
<seg id=655> Today, it is attempting to impede the flexibility of closer cooperation, and will also be subject to this.</seg>
<seg id=656> This report is intended to clarify the position of Parliament's resolution of 13 April 2000).</seg>
<seg id=657> We are, on the whole, a so-called flexible cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=658> The British Labour Members of the Socialist Group welcome the acceptance of its contribution to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference on the issue of closer cooperation, even if they do not agree with all the details.</seg>
<seg id=659> These islands must feel as an active part of the European Union, which, I hope, a paradise for tourists will, as well as for the local population.</seg>
<seg id=660> In the Middle Ages, these areas and their people do not belong to Europe, and today they are not really European.</seg>
<seg id=661> In fact, the specific features of these regions, which are generally their island status and their distance from mainland Europe, but also from its chronic dependence on a few products or a single product, that appropriate, specific measures will be taken to overcome these obstacles.</seg>
<seg id=662> Mr President, please excuse me if I aufhalte the Bureau and the interpreters, so listen to my last explanation of vote, and I would particularly like to express my solidarity with the translators our explanations of vote, in my case, the Italian ornella buson.</seg>
<seg id=663> It is clear from these texts that this Agency is aimed at restricting the paralysis of the national schutzbefugnisse or, to put it in the service of the kommissionsziele.</seg>
<seg id=664> This does not mean, however, that the Commission and Parliament, to call this institution as' European authority ', although this description of the philosophy behind this institution is perfect.</seg>
<seg id=665> This is not exactly the same as what is proposing the Bowis report, where one has the feeling that the food safety will be seen as a pretext, essentially by means of which it wants to promote the well-known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission to the detriment of the national institutions and the security of the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=666> I therefore believe that it is appropriate to this statement on behalf of the European Parliament, which has always argued for the respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all faiths to condemn these appalling deeds.</seg>
<seg id=667> Madam President, I understand the interventions of the rapporteur, but with the amendments of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is not just about money, but it also vote on a particular direction.</seg>
<seg id=668> I should also like to ask you to take that line, we will a-206 acquisition of property, according to which amendments adopted, so that we do not exceed our own limit of 20% of total administrative expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=669> Before the vote on Amendment No 929</seg>
<seg id=670> Section VI - Economic and Social Committee</seg>
<seg id=671> Report (A5-0276 / 2000) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation with additional technical measures for the recovery with the cod stocks in the Irish Sea (ICES zone VIII (A) (COM (2000) 0190 - C5-0219 / 2000 - 2000 / 0071 (CNS))</seg>
<seg id=672> (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=673> The export subsidies by the EU will be brought to the lebensmittelüberschuss dumped on the world market, which in turn leads to serious distortion of the food industry in many developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=674> Release sufficient financial resources for additional humanitarian operations in the Balkans, the Member States must reallocate resources from the existing budget.</seg>
<seg id=675> Nevertheless, Parliament has managed to a number of important tasks - not least in relation to step up our efforts in the fight against unemployment and poverty, a number of important environmental and gender equality, etc., we voted against the attacks on the right to life and the European Women 's lobby.</seg>
<seg id=676> With regard to travel expenses for Members of the European Parliament, we firmly believe that this must be paid only for reimbursed on the actual costs incurred.</seg>
<seg id=677> I assume - and I hope that the Commission constructively with appropriate solutions - that we will be able to fill the three years between 2002 and 2005, with a transitional period.</seg>
<seg id=678> In order to have a real beyond the national parliaments, the European Commission in its proposal for a regulation and liberalisierungswut has a binding regulation, rather than a directive, which will be presented in a genuine hauruckverfahren EUR by Parliament and the Council of Ministers, should compete on 31 December of this year.</seg>
<seg id=679> We therefore support the reform of the Commission and reject the other preferential treatment in this sector.</seg>
<seg id=680> They were in heavy dependence on external borrowing.</seg>
<seg id=681> Nicholson report (a-0276 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=682> The misappropriation of funds for military targets must be avoided.</seg>
<seg id=683> We have always taken the view that the costs for the reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the first place, that is to say, the actual perpetrators of big business, and will be at the expense of their super profits.</seg>
<seg id=684> The Moreira da Silva report (A5-0271 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=685> This money should be used, by the expenditure for research to be put to the vote in all 15 Member States of the European Union and coordinated.</seg>
<seg id=686> In order to take precautionary measures, it is right to give us clear on these substances.</seg>
<seg id=687> That concludes voting time.</seg>
<seg id=688> It is to replace the national Eminence already used everywhere.</seg>
<seg id=689> The zahlungsbilanzstatistische loss as a result of this amendment is minimal.</seg>
<seg id=690> Just imagine that small and medium-sized enterprises are primarily affected.</seg>
<seg id=691> We urge the efforts towards harmonisation for years.</seg>
<seg id=692> I believe that this report is of crucial importance in order to increase the citizens truly to integrate the small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro zone and the acceptance of the Economic and Monetary Union.</seg>
<seg id=693> In the free movement of capital with the single currency or no obstacles must be greater differences.</seg>
<seg id=694> Nevertheless, the European Parliament and the Commission the great attention.</seg>
<seg id=695> I support the twin-track approach of the rapporteur, with the aim of the banks hesitant to move.</seg>
<seg id=696> We cannot force the banks to verlustträchtigen business, but we as politicians can be the amendment tabled by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs, for the support they have tabled for the PPE-DE Group, before the end of next year, what measures and, ideally, the existence of standards in the introduction of the euro notes and coins.</seg>
<seg id=697> The amendment by Mrs Peijs and bring the banks to me, is not to requirements in the direction, but because we are able to increase the pressure on the political side.</seg>
<seg id=698> In fact, if the handling of cross-border payments remains as expensive as today, the credibility of the new münzen- and banknotensystems will be called into question.</seg>
<seg id=699> In our view, this form of the collection of statistical data on the internal transactions a relic of the past, which is integrated in a single area affected and the proper functioning of the internal market.</seg>
<seg id=700> When I listen to the speeches of some of my colleagues in the committee, which I, in this House, I have the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, of the European Parliament, for the fourth time in this category.</seg>
<seg id=701> I thank you in advance for your support for my report.</seg>
<seg id=702> If you withdraw but at European level, then we must give the regions more opportunities.</seg>
<seg id=703> SMEs are the first in the creation of jobs, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and in this way, to play a key role in social cohesion and regional development.</seg>
<seg id=704> Through the careful study of the proposals and the vote with many interested parties you have contributed to the clearer wording of the programme and the best possible preparation.</seg>
<seg id=705> Thirdly, we need to have a European added value.</seg>
<seg id=706> It follows that it is small and medium-sized enterprises only when unemployment is low, and if the public budgets are at all levels of debt and sufficient resources for this in the investitionshaushalt.</seg>
<seg id=707> Businesses need clarity.</seg>
<seg id=708> Above all, if a one-man operation or an operation with fewer than 250 employees has a project, it is not only with seizures of land with an assurance 120% possible, but it should also be possible to be funded by a good idea.</seg>
<seg id=709> The nation states and the regional or local authorities are already acting as a huge finanzpumpen which are there to pump money, i.e. the taxpayers of the majority of the population, including the poorest, eingetriebenen sums of money in the pockets of the large companies and their owners and shareholders.</seg>
<seg id=710> Small and medium-sized enterprises create thousands of delicate plant to serve big business as seed for human heart and ideas.</seg>
<seg id=711> I would like the Commissioner in connection with all the measures proposed here represents a priority that a quicker and easier access to aid and information, so that those who are to use these companies, the information effectively.</seg>
<seg id=712> You will all find their place in the multiannual programme.</seg>
<seg id=713> Finally, I also welcome the idea that we meet again in the year to draw up a balance sheet on the implementation of the programme.</seg>
<seg id=714> The recent actions against the Greek minority in himare areas more forcefully to democratisation, measures to strengthen the institutions and the protection of human rights in Albania.</seg>
<seg id=715> A considerable number of Albanians to leave their homes due to the uncertainty in your country, the social problems, because of the prämodernen social and family structures.</seg>
<seg id=716> We need measures relating specifically to Albania, which constitute an assistance for building and reconstruction of the country, in order to allow a decent standard of living in the region.</seg>
<seg id=717> The documents will be postponed by a body, on the other, and, for example, the European Commission is refusing to publish the report, including the Albanians, customs assistance mission (cam).</seg>
<seg id=718> Let us look the truth in the face.</seg>
<seg id=719> Mrs Karamanou, my congratulations on the broad and comprehensive ïhorizon tour of her report.</seg>
<seg id=720> This is a very important issue, due to historical, social, political and economic situation.</seg>
<seg id=721> The real number of deaths, we will never know.</seg>
<seg id=722> Common business create peaceful relations.</seg>
<seg id=723> However, what I find totally unacceptable in this report and which I would like to point out is that cause and effect, illegal immigration with a process of weighted visas and, therefore, of migrationsmöglichkeit confused. It is exactly the opposite.</seg>
<seg id=724> The Treaty of Amsterdam derived from the major institutional reforms have consequences for the treatment of problems of refugee and immigration policy.</seg>
<seg id=725> Thirdly and lastly, the action plan and its implementation must be considered on a regional basis.</seg>
<seg id=726> But, of course, this also calls on us to save European regulations.</seg>
<seg id=727> The strength of the Community actions must be emphasised just now.</seg>
<seg id=728> Moreover, I would argue that the EC changes to existing legislation to be codified, the proposals are reflected in the amendments to the existing directives or regulations.</seg>
<seg id=729> The principle of subsidiarity, has understood correctly, would be in both directions: to take decisions at the lowest level, but that the lowest achievable level can sometimes be a very high level, when it is a question of general values whose loss, if they do not all equally protected.</seg>
<seg id=730> The report is a perfect example of clear, concise and I hope colleagues will take it very seriously.</seg>
<seg id=731> The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market has not enthusiasm among its members.</seg>
<seg id=732> I have referred to in the report on the slim-vorhaben, because the Community legislation with Mr Medina has read an article of the Treaty have been a test for experts even difficult to understand.</seg>
<seg id=733> That is why some aspects of the report, I have little enthusiasm, because I would have liked to have seen a more "vergemeinschaftenden 'report, in relation to the internal market, and it is quite clear that the report is not exactly full.</seg>
<seg id=734> The European institutions, it is important that we have a strong commitment to improving the quality of legislation, in particular with regard to subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=735> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=736> The persistence of this situation could attitude and influence the acceptance of the citizens against the euro.</seg>
<seg id=737> Mr President, we have been prepared with very great care in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Karamanou report.</seg>
<seg id=738> But as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to take advantage of our oral question and in this debate, both sides, our motion for a resolution is addressed to both sides, to make a few comments, and I would like to do so with great caution.</seg>
<seg id=739> This is the demand of the peoples of the Union, whom we represent here.</seg>
<seg id=740> A great deal of water has gone down the river, the agreement expired, and has not been replaced.</seg>
<seg id=741> I can understand the reasons for the Commissioner, but not the Director-General.</seg>
<seg id=742> We could say that we 11 months after the decommissioning of vessels in the previous agreement and the previous figures for the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id=743> Mr President, a similar debate we had a year ago, and the fact that it has taken a year before negotiations, shows how difficult it is to find stocks for our extensive EU fleets.</seg>
<seg id=744> The second agreement, the situation was clear.</seg>
<seg id=745> But we must understand that everything is at long last, the fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id=746> That is why I am particularly keen to clarify that the PPE-DE Group has not only to support the fisheries agreements to defend and promote determined, but also its extension.</seg>
<seg id=747> Thirdly, the exploitation of the fanggrundes Sub-Saharan Africa has continued for the suspension of the fisheries agreement by Community fleets and others, which are subject to the supervision of the Commission by the Member States: it is a particularly important fleet in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id=748> I understand this very well, because the fishing industry was a source of income and created jobs, in terms of a European conditions, poor region.</seg>
<seg id=749> Another aspect I would like to emphasise is the expiry of the transitional aid to fishermen and vessel owners at the end of the month, which served as compensation for this year. This situation is unsustainable, because everyone wants to make it work rather than aid.</seg>
<seg id=750> I am Andalusian parliamentarians for a year to negotiate in the corridors, in the Bureau, in the Committee on Fisheries and in the discussions with the Commissioner and to propose initiatives, so that the special nature of the Andalusian fishing fleet, which should be taken into account in the Moroccan fishing.</seg>
<seg id=751> Spain has the difficult relationship, which has been repeatedly in the past between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco, in a very positive way.</seg>
<seg id=752> As a Spanish Member of Andalusian and I call on the right of thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families to preserve and protect their jobs, for almost a year, and we also have to protect from this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=753> We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=754> Almost a history full of kanzleitrost twelve-year-old, delaying tactics, hopes that placebos personal suffering for the people affected, the defence of tough old rights for citizens who have wanted nothing more than their right.</seg>
<seg id=755> As you know, the matter is extremely complex and employees of 25 around 700 Italian universities.</seg>
<seg id=756> If the Italian law is reformed and changed, as was the case for the hochschulpersonal, in our opinion, the Commission cannot intervene as long as European citizens have the same access to all categories.</seg>
<seg id=757> The reason is that two people will do the same work, work side by side, but paid and have different working conditions.</seg>
<seg id=758> The worst thing is, I think, if we have to draw attention to the fact that there may be a court to only a few reassuring words and for their life is of no significance.</seg>
<seg id=759> I expect an answer from the Commission to the point that it is in accordance with the decision of the Court of Justice in the case allué against is Article 48 (2) of the EEC Treaty, if the duration of contracts of fremdsprachenassistenten restricted in the legislation of each Member State to one year, with the possibility of renewal, while in relation to other teachers in such a limit.</seg>
<seg id=760> Now, I believe that these matters are the very essence of the European right associated with the fundamental principles of freedom of movement and, in particular, of these principles, there can be no exceptions.</seg>
<seg id=761> We have, as today's debate shows that very many shackles, very many obstacles to the internal market, not only in this case.</seg>
<seg id=762> We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=763> (The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=764> In a letter of condolence to the Austrian President Klestil and Chancellor Schüssel I have expressed on behalf of the House, to the families and the entire Austrian people at this difficult time our sympathy.</seg>
<seg id=765> Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg id=766> I support the proposal of Mr Ceyhun, and would be very grateful if the Council could say whether it intends to present a new proposal on this matter.</seg>
<seg id=767> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group considers this to be so important that we believe that it would not be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</seg>
<seg id=768> With Mr Barón Crespo, I have the impression that you, if I have understood you correctly, this explanatory statement.</seg>
<seg id=769> Madam President, some time ago, we had a debate in this House on the sanctions against Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=770> It is essential that we carry out even before the adoption of the amendments by the British authorities a debate, and the Commission has clearly to the legal provisions in this matter.</seg>
<seg id=771> (A5-0314 / 2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the conclusion of an agreement on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, particularly in the area of the fight against organised crime, examining money laundering practices with regard to the proceeds from crime and crime (10213 / 2000 - C5-0394 / 2000 - 2000 / 0815 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=772> The declarations of intent must be followed, so that the proceeds of crime, be frozen seized and confiscated.</seg>
<seg id=773> The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot be left in the hands of a specialised body under the exclusive control of the national governments.</seg>
<seg id=774> On the other hand, Article 8 of the draft agreement restricts the reasons for the refusal of mutual assistance in legal matters, on which a Member State can ersuchter on the essential interests.</seg>
<seg id=775> I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Marinho on his work, and I should like to point out that the efforts made to combat crime but also prudent support.</seg>
<seg id=776> If terrorists and drug traffickers arms and money laundering, which of course must be prosecuted and punished.</seg>
<seg id=777> It is our task to distinguish the proceeds from organised crime, to freeze, and to recover.</seg>
<seg id=778> It is these points in the amendments and, to judge by the debate in committee, I am very confident that Parliament votes in favour of it.</seg>
<seg id=779> It seems to me that this list of initiatives in a direction which is in Article 6 of the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, perhaps the protection.</seg>
<seg id=780> In reality, however, things are not as simple as that.</seg>
<seg id=781> Finally, the PPE Group supports the compromise amendment on the activities of the lawyers, at which we have arrived with Mrs Roure.</seg>
<seg id=782> The second measure, the second instrument is the harmonisation.</seg>
<seg id=783> This is a Portuguese initiative, to which several speakers have already said.</seg>
<seg id=784> The aim of the joint meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the Ecofin Council on 17 October this year was.</seg>
<seg id=785> The best way for a strengthening of parliamentary and judicial control of Europol is the full involvement of the Europol Convention, in the framework of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=786> A step in the right direction, which the European Parliament has for a long time, is the creation of a preliminary stage on judicial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=787> That is the purpose of the guarantees, namely in the development of this aspect of freedoms.</seg>
<seg id=788> And the European Parliament is the supranational Community body. These relations in my contribution, I would like to ask you to commit itself to the foundations of our rapporteur and to give their consent.</seg>
<seg id=789> Only when clarity on the institutional model and the rules for the future European judicial area, to the citizens and the European Parliament on the various measures proposed by the Council.</seg>
<seg id=790> Eurojust is a logical part of the efforts to provide the citizens with the fight against serious organised crime, an area of freedom, security and justice, as well as a high level of safety.</seg>
<seg id=791> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we can only Mrs Gebhardt on her excellent report, presented in the implementation of a decision taken by the Council in Tampere.</seg>
<seg id=792> But as with Eurojust we talk about coordination at the level of national public prosecutors and judges to combat all forms of serious crime - and here I agree with the approach of the rapporteur - it is an extension of the approach: we are not talking here only about cooperation in purely cross-border crime, but cooperation to combat criminal acts.</seg>
<seg id=793> We will already have from 1 January 2001 to engage in this interim unit on judicial cooperation. But the Commission intends to give to the discussion on the nature of the final eurojust-stelle recovery.</seg>
<seg id=794> It was taken from all sides honest position - I believe - without, however, in frontstellungen rigid.</seg>
<seg id=795> The problems in connection with the expenditure for the Committee on Fisheries, were not very worrying; other areas are of greater interest.</seg>
<seg id=796> It is really unacceptable that we have no clear objectives and the results are not measured. There is no other body.</seg>
<seg id=797> My second point is this: in the area of the hierarchy in the anweisungsbefugnis here is really unacceptable interference, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=798> I want to make it clear that the programme has played a positive role in some areas.</seg>
<seg id=799> It is obvious that this work will lead in consortiums do not automatically lead to division in the joint financial responsibility. The problem is more complex.</seg>
<seg id=800> We have argued for this really getting 3.4 million, and we can say that we have managed to do more than 90%.</seg>
<seg id=801> Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg id=802> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, following neunmonatiger work and fight for a long time now, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European consensus on the draft.</seg>
<seg id=803> I hope that this Parliament will be upheld, even if only to say 'yes' to this Charter of Fundamental Rights, in the next few weeks, there is no doubt that the Council, on the legal force of the Charter and that this Charter must also open up access to the European Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id=804> This position is, as you know, the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Biarritz, who have unanimously approved the Charter and unreservedly. I can therefore only urge, on behalf of the Council to endorse this position, by setting out a number of reasons.</seg>
<seg id=805> Above all, however, I believe that the Charter will be content with a role, I would like to say - epoch-making importance.</seg>
<seg id=806> The European Trade Union Confederation has on the complaint - as he calls it - there are gaps, such as the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id=807> Irrespective of this, a number of people, and, in particular, some members of the European Parliament, to include an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, already contains a reference to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=808> Our group agrees with the exception of the British delegation of the Charter.</seg>
<seg id=809> We in the European People's Party and unanimously together to ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be included in the Treaties as soon as possible, so that direct force it to the people of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=810> You have shown that it is close to the European issues in a new and exemplary nature, which is due to their democratic, open and transparent way and the possibility of participation in the form of the Intergovernmental Conference.</seg>
<seg id=811> The right to health, social security, housing or to a lack of income or are in the area of solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=812> Fourthly, the Charter, and I think this is very important - is the indivisibility of civil and political rights and social rights.</seg>
<seg id=813> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this Charter is simply to produce the umpteenth demonstration of the capacity of the Union to bedeutungsleere texts and declarations of intent.</seg>
<seg id=814> The representative of the Court of Justice has already indicated that it will be inspired by the Charter, and the representative of the Commission in the Convention in Turin legal significance attaches great importance to the document.</seg>
<seg id=815> The next time the market so that perhaps the time has come for the Europe of rights. The concept of citizenship in the European Union is a relatively new concept.</seg>
<seg id=816> The Charter is, in fact, as drafted a text that is legally binding.</seg>
<seg id=817> I am proud to say that a representative of my parliamentary group in my own country, Mr Gunnar jansson has played a very important role in the drafting of the Charter.</seg>
<seg id=818> As I said yesterday evening, and I do so again today, in this respect, there are still too many shortcomings across the European Union. It will succeed in our quest for judicial and police cooperation are not always to eliminate certain side effects of crime and to prevent innocent victims to be passive.</seg>
<seg id=819> Madam President, the draft resolution of the European Parliament on the Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the same uncertainty as to the work of the Assembly.</seg>
<seg id=820> The Italian Constitution provides for, for example, the limit of morality and the Convention on Human Rights, the rights of others, or public order.</seg>
<seg id=821> Mr President, in the vote at 12 noon today, we are coming to the end of a process that was started in 1984, when this Parliament has been calling for the draft of the Treaty on European Union, which has already been adopted a declaration of human rights, and which has been pursued in 1989 with the resolution de Gucht.</seg>
<seg id=822> The Charter will have consequences, whether they be enshrined in the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=823> This is to be welcomed and fear, as Mr Bonde seems to think.</seg>
<seg id=824> Obviously the neigende century, with all its fight for the liberation of disadvantaged classes, passed useless and has taught us nothing.</seg>
<seg id=825> The Charter will fight a gap in the EC law and the protection of individuals with regard to the European police force, with the public authorities, fraud, and the competition authorities.</seg>
<seg id=826> The rejection, however, which is based on the shortcomings of the Charter, I cannot understand.</seg>
<seg id=827> Mr President, I can continue where Mr Gahrton has left off.</seg>
<seg id=828> Allow me to make a third comment on the rights of third country nationals.</seg>
<seg id=829> The European Council has, in addition to the Court of Human Rights also gained a lot of experience with such forms of monitoring, on which we can build.</seg>
<seg id=830> In view of the text of the Charter, which we shall be approving today, as I hope, by a large majority - it is clear that we shall achieve our Charter of Fundamental Rights, and more than a zeitgemäßeren would have provided the accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=831> That is why we need to move forward.</seg>
<seg id=832> I believe that we should pursue this objective if we are to achieve the necessary support for the charter by the citizens of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=833> After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will serve as analyseschema for this report, as far as I and my personal intellectual potential and the human resources available to me, I will make a right and countries untergliederte analysis of the implementation of the Charter in the fifteen Member States of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=834> Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to concur with the words of Mr Moscovici and acknowledge the important contribution made by Members of the European Parliament on the debate in the Convention, and in particular the role of Mr Mendes de Vigo, he has played in the Praesidium of the Convention in the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=835> I would just like to comment on some of the most striking points in this debate.</seg>
<seg id=836> The Convention established rights arising from the various instruments of the Council of Europe, the Treaties and the constitutions of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=837> The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:</seg>
<seg id=838> As things stand at present, our Parliament has to make clear to the Turkish people that there are at least three prior conditions for its accession.</seg>
<seg id=839> This could also be made not only by means of a decision of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=840> Therefore, I have noted the comments made by Mr Morillon on the conditions for the accession of Turkey, which deserve a great deal of interest.</seg>
<seg id=841> I am pleased to say that the Turkish Government has in the meantime, this accession partnership recognised as a basis for further cooperation, so that we can have a legitimate hope to achieve precisely what we wanted to achieve with our policy, which is to help the forces of reform in Turkey give new impetus to the reform process and drive it with regard to the membership of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=842> For me, the most important thing is that a debate is after Helsinki in Turkey, caused in the Turkish public opinion about the conditions of Turkey ’ s accession to the EU, a debate which supports the forces of the country and calls for.</seg>
<seg id=843> This text before you on the opinion.</seg>
<seg id=844> It is now time to give the necessary impetus for future accession.</seg>
<seg id=845> I would, however, ask - I do not know how the vote goes, Turkey to take this issue seriously.</seg>
<seg id=846> The European Parliament will work for the reception and foster relations with the political parties, the NGOs and the press and an improvement in their difficult and sometimes tense relationship with the Grand National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id=847> Mr Morillon, your report is, in my view, very realistically and responsibly.</seg>
<seg id=848> On the occasion of the visit to Turkey in March, you have mentioned the problem of the Kurdish people, and today, with at least.</seg>
<seg id=849> At the same time, it is a great naïveté and arrogance, accept that the Europeans to the Turks - and I quote - 'a radical change in their habits and its'.</seg>
<seg id=850> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report fills me with great concern.</seg>
<seg id=851> Recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the adoption of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487 / 1 / 00 - C5-0570 / 2000 - 2000 / 2233 (AVC))</seg>
<seg id=852> In any case, we must look at the next occasions when we are discussing the power of the data, aware that a thorough and, hence, the citizens more legally certain control is required.</seg>
<seg id=853> The Duff / Voggenhuber recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=854> We wish to highlight the following points:</seg>
<seg id=855> The rights contained in the Charter are already enshrined in the national constitutions and defended by the national parliaments, which are the peoples and their cultures.</seg>
<seg id=856> 1, which provides for: "collective expulsions are prohibited, not that this ban can be suspended in times of war or in cases of severe public order in Article 52 (.</seg>
<seg id=857> Subsequently, we will be able to give a brief explanation of these three reasons, in that order.</seg>
<seg id=858> The right of the government to the arbitrary suspension of its own constitution is characteristic of a tyranny.</seg>
<seg id=859> Today, however, I would like to repeat, we have every reason to be proud of the way we have completed this important stage for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=860> A society that is only right, but not duties is a selfish society.</seg>
<seg id=861> This fight is a priority, so that the fundamental rights proclaimed on the political choices to be made more concrete.</seg>
<seg id=862> The Convention method is very interesting and efficiently to the drafting of a basistextes, which requires a broad consensus, but it can in no way justify to the European Parliament, as representatives of the European peoples and the opportunity to amend the text.</seg>
<seg id=863> This Charter must be improved, and our Parliament must propose a strategy to update and wealth.</seg>
<seg id=864> It should therefore decided at the European Council in Nice and not be declared, but by the Summit of impetus should be given for a European debate on the Charter.</seg>
<seg id=865> Fortunately, the tendency seems to prevail in the national governments to continue along the path of reason, i.e. the adoption of a charter with a purely political and not binding.</seg>
<seg id=866> The Cologne summit as' body ', this itself in favour of the' convention ', a term that is fatal mid-way way and another Convention to bear responsibility of the French Revolution in the form of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id=867> The procedures and the uncertainty regarding the exclusion of the nature of the text, however, have a clear light on the new totalitarian approaches, which are at the very heart of the European integration process.</seg>
<seg id=868> Fortunately, the European Parliament has in this area to the full implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, only a consultative role, but it means, so that the right decisions will be delayed.</seg>
<seg id=869> The opinions on the way but differ.</seg>
<seg id=870> It was a century ago, and after it had been pushed into the background, it is now fully.</seg>
<seg id=871> In any event, what we want is the opportunities which allow criminals, through the back door to the internal market.</seg>
<seg id=872> We also support the creation of a future kooperationsstelle to support the fight against organised crime and money-laundering as well as the various measures proposed in order to achieve these objectives.</seg>
<seg id=873> In other words, it will be a provisional unit of judicial cooperation, which is made up of a representative of the public prosecutor's office, judges and police officers with prosecuting powers of our 15 Member States.</seg>
<seg id=874> Mr President, as a Member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I have dealt with the accession of Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=875> Even Turkey's conduct in Cyprus is unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=876> However, we support the rapporteur's concern about the lack of an effective evaluation of the loans from the EIB and the lack of transparency and public control of the activities of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id=877> Despite their differences, and Turkey is an integral part of the European reality.</seg>
<seg id=878> The accession of Turkey to the European Union has become an issue that is more topical than ever.</seg>
<seg id=879> Mr Morillon says that Turkey should be trouble, do not want the European Union to be exclusive Christian club, they exclude Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=880> Turkey will then become a fully democratic state, if they will learn to live with their past, just as it has the democratic Germany, which requires the same, we managed to live with its past.</seg>
<seg id=881> As soon as the government in Ankara has understood that the status quo for Europe and the rest of the world is not acceptable, great progress possible. The island reunited and could be a comprehensive, just and lasting solution can be found to the law.</seg>
<seg id=882> Why are we not mentioned as all these issues in the report of the European Commission?</seg>
<seg id=883> In this balanced framework, we must continue our work to promote the rapprochement between the Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=884> If it is the Armenian issue in connection with the accession to the Union - please note of what I am saying: the Armenian issue in connection with the EU, then, is the project on which we have discussed today, not as simple as that.</seg>
<seg id=885> That is why we have so much to ensure that years of implementation of the Barcelona process to a conclusion the first five in Marseilles, so that we are able to establish the necessary guidelines.</seg>
<seg id=886> But we have managed to maintain the dialogue and also to address sensitive issues such as stability, terrorism, immigration, human rights.</seg>
<seg id=887> Quite apart from that, the Council was concerned, particularly since 1995 for the Mediterranean to allocate more resources, which are the objectives of the partnership.</seg>
<seg id=888> This is indeed a very important matter, and I would also like to say, as someone who comes from Central Europe.</seg>
<seg id=889> Mr President, as you know, there is a saying in English, which show a star without a hamlet-aufführung digging without first.</seg>
<seg id=890> We are talking here about the combination of policies on internal market questions and a consensus on the introduction of the cumulation of origin and conclusion of sub-regional free trade agreements between the partners and the adoption of harmonised protocol on the cumulation of origin.</seg>
<seg id=891> We also have the intention of the Commission to give new impetus to the Barcelona process, noted with satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id=892> I have highlighted this, because it is the key to the relaunch of the political process and the Barcelona agenda must be added.</seg>
<seg id=893> That is why our task must be to guarantee the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean, and we must do everything in our power to ensure that this cooperation and ensure the promised funds, on the basis of, say, we will be used efficiently selfish generosity of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=894> These are important and specific questions that I would like to ask, and I would like to thank Mr Brok, who has just before this debate enables the work of the Presidency and the Commission on these issues.</seg>
<seg id=895> The world is, however, a globalisation and in such a scenario in large, an organisation in the vast field of international competition, the main players operating reactors is required.</seg>
<seg id=896> It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries of the EUR 4.7 billion have taken up in the MEDA I programme, which ran expired in 1999, barely a quarter.</seg>
<seg id=897> Therefore, the Commission proposal is a new impetus, and we fully agree with the priorities that Mr Patten mentioned in his speeches and reaffirmed here this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id=898> This is a wake-up call for the European Union to play a much more active role in the Mediterranean, our European continent historical and cultural has enriched and strengthened.</seg>
<seg id=899> But it is even worse is that, at the same time, because we share in this House very different positions, sometimes more Palestinians.</seg>
<seg id=900> Aid for reconstruction</seg>
<seg id=901> We should not, however, in December, the resources for the implementation of this regulation will contribute, today we leave out empty straw.</seg>
<seg id=902> But we can and do not want to ignore the role you have played, and I hope that the Member States do not.</seg>
<seg id=903> The media in the region are often responsible for the tragedy; we need a completely free media, acting in accordance with the rules in force in our democracies.</seg>
<seg id=904> I am also a happy man because the European Parliament, as I believe that by constant pressure to address a situation that could be described as originally, not just for the better.</seg>
<seg id=905> Once again, unnecessary expenditure for unnecessary meetings must be avoided.</seg>
<seg id=906> We must look not only to Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id=907> The fact that a number of programmes of the so-called performance reserve, the 'performance reserve', have been included, is regrettable.</seg>
<seg id=908> In Feira, he has given to the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process the status of potential candidates for accession.</seg>
<seg id=909> Once again, I refer you to the main objectives of the CARDS programme: the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction and regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=910> It was right that the European Union has responded to the rise to power of President Kostunica positive.</seg>
<seg id=911> A first meeting was held on 6 November.</seg>
<seg id=912> What initiative in accordance with the request of the European Parliament, in its resolution of 16 March 2000 does the Presidency intend to take to play a more active role, so that the full implementation of the un-friedensplans and restlose is guaranteed?</seg>
<seg id=913> As that this process can be done without the settlement of this conflict?</seg>
<seg id=914> I can tell you that France and Germany - and here I am speaking as President-in-Office of the Council - raised these issues in a bilateral summit last week in vittel and decided on the establishment of a working group for the solution to this problem.</seg>
<seg id=915> At the same time, the Union continue to provide substantial aid to these countries, through its various programmes, in particular the TACIS programme.</seg>
<seg id=916> The presidency would like to refer the honourable Member to eliminate some ambiguities.</seg>
<seg id=917> Let me add the accuracy of both texts: the aim is to strengthen the criminal framework for combating organised gangs of human traffickers.</seg>
<seg id=918> In the report, the Council has adopted on 21 September this year, reform the legislative changes are contained in section several projects: the inclusion of measures to increase the effective equality between men and women in the sozialpädagogischen area in the civil code; greater control of violence within the family; better condemnation of this violence by setting up special familienrichter and a ban on the possibility of a strafnachlasses to commit crimes passionnelles crimes.</seg>
<seg id=919> The Presidency has to be no answer.</seg>
<seg id=920> Next week will take place in France at my invitation to a meeting of the European Conference, in other words with the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=921> They think that the model, namely Austria will be bilateral majority voting, in future, to be an instrument of the European institutions over decisions and to create a new institution or a new group in order to circumvent the unanimity in the Council?</seg>
<seg id=922> The Council has not been submitted to this letter, but the Presidency has given, of course, Mr Cem. The wording of this response has been transmitted to all Member States.</seg>
<seg id=923> And what he thinks the statement made by Mr Cem, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Moscovici has not responded, in his opinion, the Cyprus issue in the further consideration of the accession partnership between Turkey and the European Union are not taken into account?</seg>
<seg id=924> We must be aware that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is far more than a simple agreement on fishing and that could be that this agreement should not happen, as he knows, a deterioration in the relations between the European Union and Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=925> I must therefore express my scepticism, what the result.</seg>
<seg id=926> With regard to the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council that the strengthening of cooperation between the Member States, but also the protection of individual rights to allow.</seg>
<seg id=927> The supplementary questions must be asked by other Members.</seg>
<seg id=928> Moreover, the Commission has announced in the communication adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union's oil supply, that you will be presenting the Gothenburg European Council a plan for energy savings and the diversification of energy sources, which will help to strengthen the energy efficiency in buildings and, particularly in the transport sector.</seg>
<seg id=929> It is in this spirit that we have, during the vote on the resolution on the embargo in the framework of the Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 November, an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with the international human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id=930> It is therefore up to the NATO, to take the measures which it deems necessary to ensure this does not happen again.</seg>
<seg id=931> (The sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=932> If money is, is the privilege of that money is to define the political objectives are clear, and the Commissioner has done so again.</seg>
<seg id=933> His visit will send out a signal and the policies that we pursue, a perspective.</seg>
<seg id=934> If we see in a region, in the political arguments are possible, we are wrong.</seg>
<seg id=935> The second request is made by the two rapporteurs and must be supported by all of us, is the regular information and consultation of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=936> The government also emphasized the Union's determination to accompany this process by means of technical and economic assistance.</seg>
<seg id=937> It was this Parliament, which has supported the Commission's proposal to create a European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=938> As the House knows, we think that an explicit reference in the regulation.</seg>
<seg id=939> The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=940> The Asia-Europe cooperation for 2000 participants agreed an enlarged and updated framework, which is the working programme for the coming decade.</seg>
<seg id=941> I think that this reminds us in Europe, which we have for Asia, and not only in terms of economic and trade, though, at this point, it should be pointed out that Asia is due to the recovery of its economic situation of, for example, the fact that we have kept our word and our markets were also in the last two years Asian exports.</seg>
<seg id=942> I think that was a very good political commitment, but we still have a few problems.</seg>
<seg id=943> As you know, the Commission is ASEM very seriously, and we also support the Commission in this regard.</seg>
<seg id=944> It is necessary to improve the existing mechanisms for implementing Community law in order to increase legal certainty and to overcome the current slow pace.</seg>
<seg id=945> Therefore, it should encourage the creation of new regional organisations and starting where there is already a presence of the Community, such as the western and southern Pacific.</seg>
<seg id=946> This is a prerequisite for a truly sustainable fishing industry.</seg>
<seg id=947> I believe that the future of fishing in international waters of these organisations and all the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, is still too low. In order to defend the position of the UN, both in the Convention and in the 1982 mentioned here, in New York, that we must have a very active presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing.</seg>
<seg id=948> That is why I also believe that the Commission has a particularly important role. It is the fishermen to cooperate and to propose solutions which we could all agree.</seg>
<seg id=949> In addition, the Commission has also have many tasks in connection with negotiations to be conducted in the context of the regional fishing organisations.</seg>
<seg id=950> Mr President, I have the same problem as Mr Nicholson, much more acute.</seg>
<seg id=951> As far as the proposals of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</seg>
<seg id=952> Sometimes we have already asked us to what extent the cyclical crisis is perhaps even by speculation of the structures, in this way, the control of the sector according to their interests.</seg>
<seg id=953> The additional eu-beihilfe proposed in the Garot report, I think it is unreasonable at a time when the reform of the CAP with Agenda 2000, and the forthcoming enlargement with central and eastern Europe on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=954> I consider it absolutely essential for a sterling piece of work, which has made the rapporteur here, which shows what can be done with administration, listening to a specific objective, and it is clear here.</seg>
<seg id=955> On the one hand, the largest producers and those who are going to be integrated with companies, far from this instrument and the systems, which you have already: individual savings bank loans, compensation fund.</seg>
<seg id=956> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me say from the outset that I basically welcome the Commission proposal to set up a compensation fund for the sake of the Austrian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=957> I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.</seg>
<seg id=958> I understand that there is a market organisation for animal husbandry and a reduction in agricultural policy, where it is bodenabhängig, bodenabhängige production.</seg>
<seg id=959> The schweinemarktordnung there, and we should not make the mistake of the existing schweinemarktordnung, in principle, the work in question.</seg>
<seg id=960> The Commission believes that it is justified to subject only to the farmers who join the compensation fund, even a discipline, because these wars, a degree of income support, while others do not do not join the income support.</seg>
<seg id=961> (The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=962> Based on the VAT revenue from 36% and 15% of the total amount amongst the traditional own resources.</seg>
<seg id=963> Another part of the reform, which is very much in line with the Court of Auditors have a priority area for the increased importance of erfolgsmessung result-oriented and within a system of resource allocation under the proposed priorities and clearly defined, quantifiable objectives.</seg>
<seg id=964> That is a good thing, and I would like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, the members of the Court of Auditors and the services of the Court of Auditors, that you, with your report supporting the reform of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=965> I hope that this proposal will be put at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice is not simply buried or swept under the carpet, but that you look seriously.</seg>
<seg id=966> The reality, as it is described in the annual report is rather sobering.</seg>
<seg id=967> The number of errors that have arisen is a guarantee that this could be taken on board.</seg>
<seg id=968> The figure for construction and drops at 240 million has been set too low.</seg>
<seg id=969> I could imagine the report of the Court of Auditors also something more user-friendly, complemented by a clear recommendations, for example, or two a chapter.</seg>
<seg id=970> In 1995, an agreement was adopted on the protection of the financial interests of the Communities.</seg>
<seg id=971> The Commission and the Member States should be seen in this light and make use of the results of the report as a tool for improving the management of the financial resources of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=972> I am aware that this report and the work of the European Parliament in the context of the discharge procedure, which will contribute to greater vigilance with regard to the spending.</seg>
<seg id=973> And now, Madam President, I would like to mention and wait for someone comes from the Council.</seg>
<seg id=974> Has the Court of Auditors, as well as in previous years, no precise details about the errors which are described.</seg>
<seg id=975> Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union, and the Court of Auditors' report that is to be done in the candidate countries is a lot.</seg>
<seg id=976> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have recently reached an agreement with the Court of Auditors on the question of whether we can already for the secret kämmerchen received from the preliminary hofbericht and also agreed that we should keep silent about.</seg>
<seg id=977> I would like to address to the Council and to ask the question why the decision on Article 24 of the financial regulation.</seg>
<seg id=978> Perhaps a little common sense can help from the European Union to solve the problem and George Bush give its rightful place in the history, namely the müllkorb!</seg>
<seg id=979> It is not our task to make scapegoats, either in our institutions and in our countries.</seg>
<seg id=980> I am pleased that the members of the European Parliament are of the opinion that the situation with regard to the procedure for the presentation of the annual report in Parliament and in the Committee on Budgetary Control was satisfactory than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id=981> We will have the opportunity to speak on all points.</seg>
<seg id=982> If it is important from the point of view of the auditor, we must give all the facts.</seg>
<seg id=983> Ladies and gentlemen, as you will have noticed, the last part of the intervention of the President of the Court of Auditors has been affected by a fatal virus crept into its contribution and this House.</seg>
<seg id=984> Some amendments, such as Nos 1 and 18 in connection with issues which affect mainly the United Kingdom, and it must be pointed out that all the representatives of the United Kingdom, have defended from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European People's Party and the Greens, with great commitment, and you were adopted in the Committee on the environment.</seg>
<seg id=985> Mr President, we adopted in March of this year, the directive on Passenger cableway installations.</seg>
<seg id=986> We are of the opinion that the trade in these cases must not be burdened with the herstellerpflichten of produktsicherheitsgesetzes.</seg>
<seg id=987> We have heard the arguments for them and for the resumption of the arguments which have been used in the Industry Committee.</seg>
<seg id=988> It should be enough if the vendor can be the general information on the products and the lack of information and documentation on these points.</seg>
<seg id=989> Finally, a small request to the European Commission to Article 4 on European standards and the question of whether these be published.</seg>
<seg id=990> The voluntary organisations and non-profit organisations stores of exemptions and derogations to the markets or the boot second-hand goods sold me.</seg>
<seg id=991> The reliability of service of product safety and increase the value of the European label in a particularly difficult and significant moment.</seg>
<seg id=992> If we call on the Commission to submit elsewhere in the near future, a proposal on the safety of services, so there is no reason why we should regulate the aspects of the services here and now, rather than waiting for the Commission's proposal, because it is already that abgrenzungsschwierigkeiten between the various regulations that the legal uncertainty and will increase over time.</seg>
<seg id=993> I should like to explain briefly the main points of this proposal.</seg>
<seg id=994> We also make it possible for the opening of the system to third countries, in particular the applicant countries: we have the procedures for the implementation of measures at Community level, so that we will immediately after the recommendation of a regulatory committee.</seg>
<seg id=995> This new provision will not these shops significant additional responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=996> The proposal in Amendment No 11, to replace the word "manufacturers' by service providers', would not create clarity, but rather confusion, because the directive does not contain a definition of the term 'service providers'.</seg>
<seg id=997> The Commission is in favour of the rapid establishment of such a network, but it must be put to the vote again between the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=998> Such certification can be used as evidence, however, it does not 100% safety.</seg>
<seg id=999> I explained in detail now, which is why the Commission, Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 and 30, 32, 33 and 34, 36 and part of Amendment No 7, and the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of Amendment No 27 and 34. However, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31, 35 and part of Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, since the present proposal by the Commission is enhanced by these amendments and more clarity.</seg>
<seg id=1000> It is obvious that the Italian Socialist Mr Crespo and do not belong to the Group of the Party of European Socialists.</seg>
<seg id=1001> I believe that there is no contradiction between Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37.</seg>
<seg id=1002> I will leave the decision about the order in which the President, and I would remind you, however, that I am in any case against all three amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1003> The Mediterranean countries belonging to the EU in terms of economic development with serious problems, particularly because of the constant tension in regional inequalities.</seg>
<seg id=1004> As far as respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, to a harmonised European immigration policy as well as appropriate legal instruments to ensure a fair treatment of these immigrants are also instruments for financial support to all those young people who want to return to the completion of a technical or higher education in the European countries in their country of origin, in order to work.</seg>
<seg id=1005> I would like to highlight a factor which I consider to be really decisive in this issue: the lack of equality in the labour market.</seg>
<seg id=1006> . (PT) late, but the Commission still has a programme to support the Community framework strategy for equality between men and women (2001-2005), submitted by the previous programmes and, above all, of the fourth framework programme, which expires at the end of this year is striking.</seg>
<seg id=1007> On the one hand, a number of improvements have been taken into account in my group and, on the other, there have been calls for studies, which refer to the situation of women in the national labour markets and the lack of access to the insurance systems, for which we need to aussagefähigen statistics, geschlechterbezogenen data.</seg>
<seg id=1008> (EN) My party has serious reservations about the application of the Community rules on the sale of consumer goods, instead of the concept of the mutual recognition of standards.</seg>
<seg id=1009> It is now, and the amendments tabled by labour offer the guarantee that the shops remain untouched by industry and are exempt from the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1010> Amendment No 15, the Commission will have a free hand in terms of the language arrangements in the Agency, which we believe is a very worrying development.</seg>
<seg id=1011> The simplification of the decision-making process, the establishment of decentralised operational centres (not only in Pristina, what would be the separation of Yugoslavia) and the solution to the problem of dual structure with management board and could prove positive actions in favour of reducing the considerable administrative shortcomings within the European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=1012> We are therefore voting against the Commission proposal and Parliament's report.</seg>
<seg id=1013> The adaptation of existing Community legislation in this area can therefore be seen as valid.</seg>
<seg id=1014> Furthermore, the fund offers the possibility of cofinancing will be granted by the Member States in the form of more or less covert state aid.</seg>
<seg id=1015> . (EL) Despite its serious shortcomings in the Morillon report clearly goes further than the Commission's proposal on the partnership between the European Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1016> On the other hand, we have voted against it.</seg>
<seg id=1017> We must recognise, just like the rapporteur, that Turkey has made progress in a number of areas and that there are positive signs.</seg>
<seg id=1018> Our Parliament has fought for this, since 1987 and the adoption of this amendment is evidence of the coherence of Parliament on this issue.</seg>
<seg id=1019> The Union must put forward concrete proposals and develop the enlargement to include Turkey as an essential geopolitical strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1020> Such ulterior motives are not worthy of Europe and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1021> I can see for several years as a Member of the delegation for relations with Canada) the operation of these regional organisations, the NAFO (Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, with the States in the region, including Canada, and all those who use traditional fishing zones in the region, such as France, Spain and other European countries.</seg>
<seg id=1022> They will only be satisfied if their own kanonenbootflotte under the sternenkreisbanner gets its fisheries policy.</seg>
<seg id=1023> The most important thing is not to satisfy the supremacy of the Commission by weakens the European position, which is a proper implementation of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=1024> A final result was achieved after laborious negotiations, which deserves to be defended.</seg>
<seg id=1025> With this proposal, which seeks to replace three directives on waste incineration, the aim is to improve the quality of the air, water, soil and public health, by reducing the emissions of schmutzpartikeln in connection with the incineration and co-incineration and, in particular, the emissions of heavy metals, dioxins and furans.</seg>
<seg id=1026> I think it is also important to highlight the innovation that is now no longer only emissions into the air, but also into water and the soil.</seg>
<seg id=1027> During the discussion of the proposal has been made.</seg>
<seg id=1028> The introduction of stricter stickoxidgrenzwerte much new co-incineration in cement, such as, for example, is a step forward that will provide an incentive to reduce emissions, even though the proposed standards do not reflect the most modern technology.</seg>
<seg id=1029> Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry you in particular, Mr Blokland, I have a few minutes late.</seg>
<seg id=1030> Finally, I would like to say that this directive is an important contribution to the reduction of the negative effects on the environment and the risks to human health.</seg>
<seg id=1031> It would be the European Parliament would give credit if it on behalf of the rejection of any form of discrimination, the fight against exclusion and the responsibility of the individual new impetus to the implementation of a system that allows the concrete implementation of the essential solidaritätsprinzips.</seg>
<seg id=1032> From country to country, big differences are to be found, and there is a lack of detailed and comparable statistics reliable information which system where, in what way is the best results, where its weaknesses, etc. It is precisely for this reason that I, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs opinion stresses the need for the Commission to give me any prior to the definition of the universal rules for the zusatzkrankenversicherung a Green Paper in which all these from the relevant information and data are identified and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id=1033> This was a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id=1034> The danger that healthy citizens and the elderly ensure not only because of its high risk due to the private sector can gesellschaftsentwicklung is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1035> The second approach, as the rapporteur said in his introduction and supported by many of the Members, provides for the promotion of the necessary rules and codes of conduct for the introduction of forms of mutual costs between insurers to guarantee all the provision of high-quality public services and to counter the threats of discriminatory practices and a risk and kundenauswahl.</seg>
<seg id=1036> In my opinion, it cannot be right that anyone who is on the way the money is high.</seg>
<seg id=1037> The new proposal of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is right to begin by stock in the form of a Green Paper, and only then to decide whether we need a directive or a recommendation.</seg>
<seg id=1038> In the Netherlands, is now being discussed on changes to the system.</seg>
<seg id=1039> On this basis, the Commission should take the initiative and specific points as guidelines for the health systems of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1040> An absolute there can be no solution to the insurance.</seg>
<seg id=1041> I therefore believe that we should allow Mr Rocard on his report, in which he called on the Commission to service, a Green Paper, which for us an insight into the current state of insurance in the Member States and, at the same time, the future direction and agree with him.</seg>
<seg id=1042> Both are based on a dreisäulenmodell: the State, the business and the private sector.</seg>
<seg id=1043> With regard to the supplementary pensions, the European Union has already produced certain rules. It has presented a Green Paper in which the proposal for a directive is based.</seg>
<seg id=1044> Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Rocard, and congratulating him on his report, and also Mr Marinos, I should like to congratulate the opinion of its committee.</seg>
<seg id=1045> This study will then form the basis for a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament, will be proposed in the initiatives and measures.</seg>
<seg id=1046> With regard to the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets, I am happy that they have all been adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1047> We have voted in favour of the key figures of the programme, to which the multi-dimensional approach to the phenomenon of the actions in the areas of health, education and housing, consistency and complementarity with other neighbouring areas and the participation of non-state bodies, but also the social exclusion of the people themselves.</seg>
<seg id=1048> This means that we must use the cyclical periods, in order to create a balance or surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1049> I only need to remind you that the Ecofin Council has asked the Commission to start from next year this long-term aspect of public finances in relation to the ageing of the population in the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id=1050> One of the positive features of the programme of the Netherlands special consideration - as I said at the beginning, the consequences of the ageing of the population on the budget for the years ahead.</seg>
<seg id=1051> That is why the accounts for the year 2000 in Germany a surplus of one and a half points of the gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg id=1052> If we add to that the wechselkursentwicklung of the euro and the dollar, we have a clear negative effect in terms of inflation.</seg>
<seg id=1053> To continue to make a public pay-as-you-go system into line with private kapitalbildungssystemen, and they are clearly compatible with aid for the creation of specific investment funds, which can perhaps long-term tax and a solution to the problem of the ageing of the population, are helpful.</seg>
<seg id=1054> Third, the key principle, the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg id=1055> It is worth remembering that a number of proposals for legislation, which are currently being discussed all the efficiency and effectiveness of Community rules and, therefore, I hope, will strengthen the confidence of consumers.</seg>
<seg id=1056> But this relatively low incidence is no cause for complacency.</seg>
<seg id=1057> To be honest, I was extremely disappointed that the positive role of Community law has not been in yesterday's statement by Prime Minister Jospin recognised in recent years.</seg>
<seg id=1058> Of course, the increase of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States, statements.</seg>
<seg id=1059> The Veterinary Office of the Commission as regards the safeguards against BSE, the controls in the Member States already high priority.</seg>
<seg id=1060> With regard to its security, I would like to repeat that there is already a whole series of controls to ensure that meat and bone meal in the transmission of BSE is no threat.</seg>
<seg id=1061> Yes, we can hardly believe it, it has taken four years to agree to a measure that I consider essential for the protection of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1062> Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would urge that the Council finally stated its opinion on the TSE regulation.</seg>
<seg id=1063> In the current situation, the only way to break the cycle of circulation is to ban the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs.</seg>
<seg id=1064> In this context, I would like to mention that we in the Liberal Group have tabled an amendment which I hope will be adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1065> The policy must bring about changes, so that the really responsible for this crisis will be confirmed with practical decisions and a first step towards the end of this dramatic crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1066> They must be restored.</seg>
<seg id=1067> On the labelling of beef, which is a mindestetikettierung, which has only been in force for two and a half months ago, a proper traceability of animals, and that we have banned specified risk material far too late.</seg>
<seg id=1068> The citizens must be fully informed about the characteristics of which I have mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=1069> Mr President-in-Office of the Council, they have done nothing, or almost nothing, just like their colleagues about the consequences of Chernobyl, the AIDS epidemic, or the contaminated blood products are inactive. The reason given was that we did not want to give the public in panic.</seg>
<seg id=1070> The French ban on a massive bedarfssteigerung the supply of raw materials, but this is limited.</seg>
<seg id=1071> Consumers have lost their confidence, and to prevent this phenomenon, compulsory BSE in cattle and sheep.</seg>
<seg id=1072> More importantly, meet the highest safety standards and bone meal to work, is now, in the spirit of the Commission's proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1073> Otherwise, I am - just this once again - is completely in agreement with what my colleagues, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs Grossetête said.</seg>
<seg id=1074> Since that time, the Council and the Commission have a sufficient financial basis and can now implement a vigorous policy.</seg>
<seg id=1075> We must tackle this problem.</seg>
<seg id=1076> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am very pleased to hear in this House that the CAP is at any price.</seg>
<seg id=1077> We have the soil, the climate and the necessary know-how to replace animal meal by genetically modified pflanzenproteine immediately, and yet we have the right to grow up on our own soil for our animal feed and food security of the people, while at the same time we need to pflanzenproteine finance set-aside land. This is why our group has tabled an amendment in which the Council and the Commission are called upon to find ways to increase in Europe that pflanzenproteine, represent a suitable substitute for prionenhaltiges meal and American genetically modified soya.</seg>
<seg id=1078> Foodstuffs must the people of safe food.</seg>
<seg id=1079> I think it is an example that France has managed to take this step.</seg>
<seg id=1080> But you do not help the gentlemen!</seg>
<seg id=1081> That is why I am surprised that, under these circumstances, or processed carcasses.</seg>
<seg id=1082> In the United Kingdom recently published the phillips-untersuchung on BSE.</seg>
<seg id=1083> I would like to suggest to the European Commission to apply the precautionary principle in beef from France.</seg>
<seg id=1084> We have to know with certainty and is not therefore need, as the scientific facts and what action is required.</seg>
<seg id=1085> In addition, I have of course taken note of all the proposals, for which I am very sensitive.</seg>
<seg id=1086> If citizens to come from the Member States and tell me that legislation would not properly or not fully implemented, then we should perhaps once again, but not because the scientists tell us that it is necessary, but because it is in the European Union of the rule of law.</seg>
<seg id=1087> If you do not want to hear us, it invites us best.</seg>
<seg id=1088> The Commission is of the opinion that the readmission agreements for the coordination of these actions and an important role and, at the moment, the negotiations on the first readmission agreements with Russia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=1089> What proposals does the Commission, on the basis of Article 31 of the Treaty on European Union?</seg>
<seg id=1090> (The President cut off the speaker)</seg>
<seg id=1091> The aim in this period was the reduction of the public deficit in order to achieve a good monetary policy, lower interest rates and a higher growth.</seg>
<seg id=1092> I always say that the euro is introduced on 1 January 2002, we already have in our pockets; we have it in a different way, but we have it in our pockets.</seg>
<seg id=1093> The current limit values for nitrogen dioxide and lead were not exceeded, not even the ozon-schwellenwert in the inner city in accordance with Directive 92 / 72 / EC. But it is said that the hochsommer measurements.</seg>
<seg id=1094> Subject: State aid for the audiovisual sector at a seminar on the subject of cultural industries of the French Presidency was a representative of the Directorate-General for Competition in the European Commission believes that the legal investitionsverpflichtungen channels were imposed on it, that they have been laid down by the legislator, constitute state aid.</seg>
<seg id=1095> It must be respected and protected.</seg>
<seg id=1096> But this does not happen, because this is a very inegalitär new growth and, as we see in the United States for almost a decade, be accompanied by constant phenomena of insecurity, of exclusion, poverty and urban ghettos.</seg>
<seg id=1097> The governments of the Member States do not have accepted this definition, which is a little too easy and meaningless.</seg>
<seg id=1098> The resulting in the harsh climate, there are more and more people, who will not be able to compete and excluded.</seg>
<seg id=1099> Mr President, in this House, we often hear a litany of how the European social model and the social market economy, for which many of my form a chaotic, contrary to the model of the United States of America.</seg>
<seg id=1100> (technical disruption)</seg>
<seg id=1101> That is a huge amount of money.</seg>
<seg id=1102> In addition, we must all political levels.</seg>
<seg id=1103> I agree that it is necessary to know the causes of poverty. I am in favour of preventive measures through innovative and practical responses involving the social partners, local and national administrations and the joint action of the citizens against exclusion as a result of mergers, restructuring and relocation of companies in the rural and urban areas.</seg>
<seg id=1104> We had a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and the role of social and structural reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1105> This is a legal problem, because the text of the Treaty, not only on social exclusion and poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1106> These proposals are, I think, a pragmatic answer to your request.</seg>
<seg id=1107> However, agreement on the strategy does not necessarily mean support for the detail.</seg>
<seg id=1108> If we define a clear and binding framework for the Member States, the different systems which meet these requirements should, of course, have a longer period of effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id=1109> Renewable energy sources are not a panacea for solving this problem. But there is no doubt that they can contribute considerably to alleviate and diversification of energy sources and to reduce our dependence on oil and gas, which we would also well.</seg>
<seg id=1110> I want to reiterate three of our demands.</seg>
<seg id=1111> The setting of realistic zielrichtwerte can only increase the confidence of the citizens in the energy policy to be adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1112> In my view, a consistent policy in the field of renewable energy sources has a Europe for the future of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1113> These agreements, the Member States of the European Union must demonstrate that it will contribute to achieving the Kyoto objectives.</seg>
<seg id=1114> It would be a pity if a category would contribute to the production of energy from waste in small projects or as part of the accounts.</seg>
<seg id=1115> The formation of peat in the assimilation and waldstreuentstehung resembles that of other vegetable biomassen.</seg>
<seg id=1116> I would like to inform Mr Chichester that modern wind farms in my own coast at sea were already in place. It is a project that is certainly very soon.</seg>
<seg id=1117> The dispute over the phasing-out of nuclear power, which will be held in Sweden and Germany, for example, has shown that the debate without visible environmentally friendly and at a competitive price to energy alternatives in the sand.</seg>
<seg id=1118> That is why the Member States must establish binding objectives.</seg>
<seg id=1119> That is why I am optimistic, as regards the zukunftspotential of renewable energy sources, as long as the right incentives.</seg>
<seg id=1120> I believe that it is a great deal of courage to put the renewable energy so that it deserves.</seg>
<seg id=1121> A very strong rise in oil prices is undoubtedly aware of the problems with greater rigour with our dependence on fossil energy sources.</seg>
<seg id=1122> We can therefore not accept Amendment No 28.</seg>
<seg id=1123> However, it is very important that the terms used are not constitute interference in its right of initiative and that they may not be compatible with the internal electricity market.</seg>
<seg id=1124> In the Commission for the reconstruction of Tajikistan, where 25 000 lives under 26 participants widows, was a woman.</seg>
<seg id=1125> Although the proportion of women has been relatively low, studies have shown that the presence of women in the UN peacekeeping troops will lead to an improvement in relations with the local population and the general morality.</seg>
<seg id=1126> The report is in this area in detail and duplication, which we as a group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats to take in terms of an official document.</seg>
<seg id=1127> In political terms, I can this Amendment 19, rather than tactical defeat or tactical indicate withdrawal values as the compromise, and we should really be a problem for women.</seg>
<seg id=1128> They were held.</seg>
<seg id=1129> Including Portugal, where women were given only after the aprilrevolution 1974 access to diplomacy, has recently with our ambassador in East Timor and Indonesia, Mrs Gomes, the role of women and their awareness of the problems and the suffering of a people that has 25 years in his struggle alone, the whole world and especially here in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1130> So far we have done very few of them, two or three, I understand.</seg>
<seg id=1131> That is why this dimension must in future in the implementation of the policy of the European Union to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id=1132> Unfortunately, the terms are not defined and there is no distinctions.</seg>
<seg id=1133> Please pass on to the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1134> They are people with other experiences, the experiences of governance and, in particular, to the settlement of conflicts.</seg>
<seg id=1135> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1136> Secondly, if the sector is to be regulated by law must, of course, a number of points.</seg>
<seg id=1137> In the last few weeks I have noticed that there is a great deal of interest, both in international gewerkschaftskreise and certain national trade unions.</seg>
<seg id=1138> My second comment is this: are you also that housewives remuneration?</seg>
<seg id=1139> All those who are working in black and white, received a work under decent social conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1140> There are also often result from this project two or three families and budgetary support.</seg>
<seg id=1141> We were in a plenary session during the first October part-session, when we learned in our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia by the courageous response of the Serbian people, and, as you will remember, ladies and gentlemen, the lifting of international sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=1142> Europe has shown that the vitality of its civilisation in the history of the world and its political creativity in shaping the future entwicklungswegs.</seg>
<seg id=1143> There can be no doubt that the issue of the status of Kosovo is a question of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1144> On the other hand, we would like to have a chance to show that we in Europe are in force and the principles of democracy, the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg id=1145> I must say that I was with you - as I said - very impressed, as this very difficult situation meisterten and determined as they were.</seg>
<seg id=1146> This is expressed in the next protocol in order, Mr Watson.</seg>
<seg id=1147> Access to documents and information on the activities of the institutions will allow the citizens to take on the responsibility of the decision-making bodies and proposes to more efficiency.</seg>
<seg id=1148> The fifth amendment, it is important, in my view, the annual reports on the documents which have to remain secret or at least still secret.</seg>
<seg id=1149> It is an open question, and there is a possibility that arrangements which restrict the greater transparency, remain in force and, amongst other things, we have tabled amendments on this point.</seg>
<seg id=1150> The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is opposed to the proposal on documents, the external security, and as a whole or automatically exclude from the principle of openness.</seg>
<seg id=1151> If we want the citizens to exercise their rights, we need these contact points in particular trained staff who take the citizens with information, and called for by the complex labyrinth of institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1152> Registers are essential if we do not want a insider-öffentlichkeit from the public.</seg>
<seg id=1153> It is very gratifying that Parliament has managed to create a broad majority in favour of more transparency.</seg>
<seg id=1154> Mr President, I should like to begin by expressing my thanks to the rapporteurs for their excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1155> Mr President, openness and transparency in the European Union are in a good light.</seg>
<seg id=1156> This should be the case, then that is a disappointment, because what is at stake is the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1157> The document currently under quite different things and we want to ensure the widest access to many dokumenttypen in various forms.</seg>
<seg id=1158> Mr President, the Commission's attitude to the right of access to documents is clear from the internal manual on 11 October, which have been distributed to the staff of the Commission and in which they are to be told how they treat requests for access to documents by Members of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1159> This legislation must be abolished or at least complements the duty of a hierarchy.</seg>
<seg id=1160> The normal way of international cooperation with the diplomatic traditions and rules, for example, all behind closed doors, does not fit for modern forms of cooperation, as they have been developed by the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1161> We should not confuse it with the role of the European Parliament or with future interinstitutional agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1162> We have taken a step forward in the use of the right of the citizen to information and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1163> However, it is not the only one, and I would like to express my thanks, I should also like to thank Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen from the PPE-DE Group, which is due to the Hughes procedure consolidated co-author of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1164> Transparency is one of the pillars of the activities of the European Union as a whole, but the right to take the documents for the implementation of the transparency alone are not enough.</seg>
<seg id=1165> The European Parliament therefore calls for the European security and defence policy in the future will be incorporated into the structures of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1166> As President Prodi wrote on 3 October to Parliament, he spoke of the institutional triangle and pointed out that the smooth functioning of each institution in a European system of checks and balances in the common interest.</seg>
<seg id=1167> I must admit that the great challenge in this regulation is the precise definition of the documents.</seg>
<seg id=1168> I would like to emphasise that, when the time comes, the Commission could accept practically all of the amendments, such as amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1169> In some cases, I would like to vote for the Commission's proposals, and the Members of Parliament would have the list with the amendments which the Commission can support, and with the amendments which they do not want to have to support.</seg>
<seg id=1170> Own resources of credit institutions</seg>
<seg id=1171> Finally, and this was the most controversial point, the committee strongly called for an accelerated procedure for the implementation of this legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1172> These amendments to a number of other proposals in the report to be rejected in the vote and likely to be replaced by the new amendments, which are the result of this consensus.</seg>
<seg id=1173> Mr President, in view of the excellent outcome of the vote in favour of this report and the response of the Commission this morning is obviously, if you look at all the aspects on which we have voted - that we should postpone pursuant to Rule 69 (2), the vote on the draft legislative resolution, with the Commission and the Council in successful negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=1174> Mr President, I am sorry to have to say that the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats (PPE-DE) in favour of the postponement of the vote, but I must point out that your coordinator has come to me to tell me that you wanted to postpone the vote until the November II part-session, will vote this evening.</seg>
<seg id=1175> I would suggest is another reason why a postponement of the vote - Mr Goebbels has said, this is a very important matter.</seg>
<seg id=1176> I do not know what a roll-call vote costs, but it is certainly a few thousand francs or Belgian francs from our budget.</seg>
<seg id=1177> I know that whole herds have been slaughtered in France, and that does not seem to be the best solution.</seg>
<seg id=1178> Removal of bonemeal in animal feed, and not only for cattle and sheep, but also for pigs and poultry,</seg>
<seg id=1179> That is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1180> Such provisions are likely to restore the confidence of consumers and the farmers, the message we want to send them.</seg>
<seg id=1181> It is urgently necessary to go further - and to make changes to the common agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=1182> The ban on the use of meat and bone meal as animal feed is only the first step in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1183> We regret, however, that the amendments tabled by our Group were not approved.</seg>
<seg id=1184> I think it would be logical to reduce the working hours of work in the environmentally harmful.</seg>
<seg id=1185> In conclusion, I want to emphasise once again that the public dissemination of hazardous waste recycling, we should not allow ourselves to put up with the production of such waste.</seg>
<seg id=1186> If, for example, the pensions would not be so low that it is not sufficient for the living there would be less poor.</seg>
<seg id=1187> The report provides for funding to the tune of EUR 100 million for a period of five years to reduce poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1188> The proposal to introduce a second Luxembourg process in the area of social exclusion, the guidelines and national action plans, receives my unqualified support.</seg>
<seg id=1189> The report calls for the establishment of qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1190> With the presentation of its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion is the Commission of the invitation of the Council by June 2000 ',' A 'initiative for the cooperation in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1191> Mr President, I have a very specific reason abstained from the vote on this report, I think that the progress made in ecological terms, which I had hoped for and wanted.</seg>
<seg id=1192> I hope that this system will find in all European cities.</seg>
<seg id=1193> Some of the proposals of the European Parliament are unrealistic and not have my approval.</seg>
<seg id=1194> It must also be better in the future, to make bestpractice publicly known.</seg>
<seg id=1195> Umweltbewusste fiscal given the opportunity, in a liberalised market voluntarily to a cleaner energy, while the other is the same for all.</seg>
<seg id=1196> The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1197> It concerns the following three reasons for this: firstly, this proposal is in line with the process of consolidating democracy and the increased demand for respect for human rights, particularly in relation to the indigenous peoples.</seg>
<seg id=1198> In this debate, we would, as previous speakers have said, the solidarity and support for our institution to the Central American Parliament. This is happening at a time when we are working to ensure that the external relations of the European Union with the countries continue to enjoy priority will be reinstated.</seg>
<seg id=1199> I have no reservations with regard to human rights, which was our colleague and dear friend, Mr Seguro, President of the delegation responsible for authorising the relations with countries of Central America and Mexico.</seg>
<seg id=1200> Finally, the Commission has also repeatedly in the dialogue with the American authorities to the importance that we attach to the regional integration as an instrument for the consolidation of democracy and development in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1201> To cling to power, he has not hesitated to conquer the senseless debate on the Ivorian birthright ", which gave rise to a wave of hatred and xenophobia, on the other, the foreign burkinabé or the malinesen, many of whom live for very many years ivorischem soil and work.</seg>
<seg id=1202> A precondition for the creation of a real democracy in Côte d'Ivoire is the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry on the crimes committed and the formal commitment to respect for human rights and the internal peace.</seg>
<seg id=1203> Some believe that democracy is of relative importance if it is Africa, these are complex procedures and we should work for the time. On the other hand, I am of the opinion that there can be no compromise on democracy and that today the same question arises in Côte d'Ivoire, for example in Guinea, where we know that people are imprisoned and there is no democratic system.</seg>
<seg id=1204> Finally, allow me to say one more thing: dictatorships are only possible because there are people who live in poverty, which do not have access to knowledge and information.</seg>
<seg id=1205> It would be illogical if the European Union is today called for new presidential elections, in which this time could all the candidates.</seg>
<seg id=1206> In many parts of Africa, we are dealing with very different ethnic and religious blends.</seg>
<seg id=1207> In these elections, the representation of national political parties must be allowed, which were excluded from the presidential election in order to compensate for the shortcomings of this first choice only in part.</seg>
<seg id=1208> On the situation in Burma</seg>
<seg id=1209> It is a large-scale offensive against the Shan and Karen and, as the un-berichterstatter said, there is no sign of a dialogue between sdpc and the NLD.</seg>
<seg id=1210> We therefore stress the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1211> I hope that the European Parliament by the handling of this matter in the topical and urgent debate the Burmese people a clear signal that the desperate situation is not to forget that we recognise that the situation in Burma is worse rather than better, and that we are determined to do something about it.</seg>
<seg id=1212> It has been a long time coming.</seg>
<seg id=1213> In Asia, the danger is that economic and political reforms will say that there can be no economic progress and economic liberalisation and deregulation in the political field without strengthening the rule of law, although I am of the opinion that subsidies and trade, investment in the long term without a functioning state under the rule of law.</seg>
<seg id=1214> Mr President, I agree with the previous speakers in many key respects, because much of what is happening today in Vietnam is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1215> The human rights organisation Human Rights Watch, which Mr Swoboda has also mentioned, now declared Vietnam has just made on the question of human rights in recent times, in order to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id=1216> This top secret documents give us a rare look behind the scenes of the policy of the Vietnamese government.</seg>
<seg id=1217> The Commission is still convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation can only through dialogue between the military regime, the elected democratic opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg id=1218> There is also a clear pressure by the Vietnamese authorities in the direction of self-censorship of the press.</seg>
<seg id=1219> The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1220> We also need the help and support of the EU, not only in the south-west of England, but in all the areas concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1221> I would ask you all to support our resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1222> It is imperative that the European Union is not limited to exceptional aid after the entry of disasters.</seg>
<seg id=1223> In this context, the Commission has two initiatives.</seg>
<seg id=1224> Mr President, it is a purely linguistic, there has been a mistake in the adoption of the amendments in the joint resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1225> To postpone the vote, to postpone the mandate given to the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1226> (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1227> The report is the statement that a growing proportion of medicine in Europe is covered by zusatzkrankenversicherungen.</seg>
<seg id=1228> I find it somewhat strange that the Commission now wants to tie the hands of a proposal for a directive but, at the same time, calls for a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and krankenzusatzversicherungen by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1229> In view of the fact that the proportion of elderly people is increasing in the population, it is important that the improvement of health care for the people of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1230> We cannot go along with, of course.</seg>
<seg id=1231> Mr President, there is a strong case for an accelerated procedure in the implementation of the results of the Basle revision of the kapitaladäquanz-regelungsrahmens.</seg>
<seg id=1232> What is the sense of urgency, which has draufgesetzt Mrs Villiers on which the Commission gave feeling the need, calls for the adoption of the measures under a fast-track procedure, that is to say that the rapporteur himself acknowledges that these arrangements will have no influence on the anti-competitive practices, which are, unfortunately, in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1233> Of course, we have to be careful that Basel does not, in addition, the capital requirements for banks still higher a second disadvantage.</seg>
<seg id=1234> Having said that, I would like to point out that the operators of the approach I believe these are seen as satisfactory, the rules on the capital, the abstützen issues relating to the risk.</seg>
<seg id=1235> These are some of the initial ideas on how we could achieve within the current rules of the Treaty, would be to monitor the legislation quickly and efficiently.</seg>
<seg id=1236> It is now the time has come to recognise that the institution of the European Ombudsman is big enough to 'has been sufficient evidence that it has now for the maturity of its own budget.</seg>
<seg id=1237> The PPE-DE Group supports the view of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the powers of the Ombudsman should be extended, the sooner the better, especially as regards the decision laid down in Article 3 of the Ombudsman's investigative powers.</seg>
<seg id=1238> The Ombudsman is, of course, be, but it is important for the citizens of Europe to know that he or she can as Ombudsman be given access to the files remain closed the other citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1239> The starting point of this report was to allow followed by the Ombudsman to the recommendation by the Commission, with the corrections organised competitions access to their own auditing work applicants.</seg>
<seg id=1240> We believe that the procedures of the Community institutions should go, and indeed all of the recruitment, with maximum openness and transparency, in order to avoid any suspicion of partiality, injustice or incompetence of the administration.</seg>
<seg id=1241> I am referring, for example, to an amendment concerning the demand for the indisputable evidence orally.</seg>
<seg id=1242> Mr Bösch has already referred to the amendments to the report.</seg>
<seg id=1243> When I put two questions to the Commission on the implementation and organisation of the last internal competition, I received a precise and detailed answers.</seg>
<seg id=1244> So processes open and transparent.</seg>
<seg id=1245> Firstly, to be carried out by the Commission and the corrections anonymously.</seg>
<seg id=1246> It was clearly July 2000.</seg>
<seg id=1247> Votes</seg>
<seg id=1248> (Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote)</seg>
<seg id=1249> With regard to the assessment of the directive on own resources must be assessed from various carefully in conflict with each other possible interests.</seg>
<seg id=1250> The idea of a European police college is to be created for the Member States of the European Union and in the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=1251> The position of the rapporteur, and the European People's Party shares.</seg>
<seg id=1252> The social situation in most of the Member States of the European Union is now actually cross-border cooperation between the different police forces.</seg>
<seg id=1253> Most of the speakers appear to believe that it is essential that the College is only a permanent seat.</seg>
<seg id=1254> For the umpteenth time, but not widerrufliche decision with which the Council is usually a small gift for our Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1255> The rapporteur also wants to know, prevention of crime provision of services, innovation and monitoring of the borders and the protection of internal security in line with the maintenance of public order.</seg>
<seg id=1256> These were the ideals you suggerierten us, and the state, for they were.</seg>
<seg id=1257> A levelling down of standards in certain Member States of the European Union, I would welcome.</seg>
<seg id=1258> Since the initial considerations in this matter, which has been given to the initiative of the European Parliament at European level, the Commission has committed itself to the Member States to take action with a view on the road towards building something that we could consider European polizeikultur based on the highest level of professional ethics, respect for the rights and freedoms of the citizens and the effectiveness of the fight against crime.</seg>
<seg id=1259> This is a development of the police academy primarily at government level.</seg>
<seg id=1260> For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.</seg>
<seg id=1261> - (SV) I have voted against the creation of the European police college.</seg>
<seg id=1262> There is no doubt that many of our courts are very slow and cautiously, and it is very difficult to persuade them to a rapid action on these issues.</seg>
<seg id=1263> Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, since it is based on the Brussels II regulation, which applies for children of separated parents living and unmarried.</seg>
<seg id=1264> My mother, played such a divorce and kidnapping 85 years before, and it still is today.</seg>
<seg id=1265> I would therefore like to say to the House that the Commission has proposed in the action plan on the mutual recognition of civil law decisions - which I hope - before the end of the year, the extension of the scope of the Brussels II regulation and also to this regulation on the recognition and top priority, so that they are married same-sex couples, without distinction for children as well as children of cohabiting couples.</seg>
<seg id=1266> We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=1267> In the meantime, sport is, it must be said - closely with other sectors, for example with companies of the audiovisual sector or the advertising industry and the sportartikelverkauf.</seg>
<seg id=1268> What we need is an intelligent and flexible interpretation of the current rules.</seg>
<seg id=1269> In fact, it is an attack on democracy, we object to see things from this angle.</seg>
<seg id=1270> The Commission therefore shortly expecting an answer to your request for detailed information on the measures envisaged by the British Government.</seg>
<seg id=1271> The proposal was presented by the Finance Ministers in connection with a preliminary draft budget half a year before the declaration on the budget in the spring of 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1272> I also think that what Mr Simpson has said in extraordinary way to confirm in view of the probable intentions of the government of the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id=1273> Not only by traffic jams, we lose a lot of time, not only to high costs, but this is a very serious problem for the environment, and that is why I believe that if the British Government the money to solve all the problems, in particular, for all the citizens of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1274> We are more or less the only oil producers in the European Union and the highest petrol and diesel, have, however, in all the countries of Europe - £1.20 figures, we in the United Kingdom of a litre of diesel.</seg>
<seg id=1275> That concludes this item.</seg>
<seg id=1276> The European Parliament has a duty to assure you that it is on your side. Once again, I would ask you to observe a minute 's silence to express our solidarity and our concerns.</seg>
<seg id=1277> Madam President, I would like to support this proposal, because I am one of those who have asked for this item.</seg>
<seg id=1278> We have made good progress.</seg>
<seg id=1279> The EU will continue to develop its relations with the main groups and also as quickly as possible with the new government in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1280> In the light of what a surprise - enthusiastic about the report by Mr Prescott - deal with which he has negotiated, I cannot understand why he not only by Mrs Voynet, but, I believe, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, also rejected by almost all the other European environment.</seg>
<seg id=1281> Now there is a risk that we have lost the impetus, the American negotiator change their position, and we may have to start from scratch.</seg>
<seg id=1282> The big issue were the forests.</seg>
<seg id=1283> A constant warming of the earth in some EU countries that share of their territory or versteppt flooded.</seg>
<seg id=1284> They have a high level of prosperity and low prices for petroleum products.</seg>
<seg id=1285> I would like to congratulate Commissioner Wallström on her efforts in the Hague and wish her more success.</seg>
<seg id=1286> There is no doubt that it is better to be no agreement as to a bad, because the American proposal was totally inadequate and for Europe is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1287> Climate change in the developing countries have far-reaching consequences.</seg>
<seg id=1288> I would like to repeat it in English: forest turns from being carbon sinks to carbon sources.</seg>
<seg id=1289> Only if the European Union is credible, it can in the discussions and the actual measures on the cop6- "B" in Bonn, to take the initiative.</seg>
<seg id=1290> We must make our own assessment of the events and to prepare documents, with the various parties and, of course, come to the umbrella-gruppe '.</seg>
<seg id=1291> Of course the step after the forthcoming COP 6 or the continuation of the COP 6 is that the agreement will be ratified in the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1292> We in the European Council, in other words, Pierre Moscovici on Sunday and I hold a klausursitzung at ministerial level, to which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, and on Monday, at the meeting of the General Affairs Council will be held a meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference.</seg>
<seg id=1293> The minimum number of participating countries should be set at eight, while the possibility to require a unanimous decision by the Council, which is currently a de facto veto, by means of a anrufungsrecht replaced.</seg>
<seg id=1294> We may regret that, but I must say that fact.</seg>
<seg id=1295> The European Council will also deal with the progress of the negotiations and, therefore, with enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1296> The Lisbon European Council adopted guidelines for the promotion of innovative and competitive Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1297> Consumer protection is, for obvious reasons, which I must not go a bedeutenderes concerns of Europeans.</seg>
<seg id=1298> We must prepare for this unprecedented enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1299> This is in fact the criterion that ultimately we assess the Nice Summit.</seg>
<seg id=1300> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1301> Firstly, the candidate countries must adopt and implement the acquis communautaire. This is also our task.</seg>
<seg id=1302> We are very much in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and we do not want it to be the only one.</seg>
<seg id=1303> However, the text could be improved, but it can also be clarified and improved after Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1304> I find it unacceptable that some governments have swept aside the issue of the inclusion of a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1305> They want to incorporate it into the Treaties, which is proof that this text should be done this.</seg>
<seg id=1306> Within the WTO, we are unhappy with a common voice.</seg>
<seg id=1307> I believe that the burden of the Intergovernmental Conference with a more complex and controversial issue would be given the rather gloomy prospects no wise move.</seg>
<seg id=1308> I strongly urge the French Presidency to make the greatest possible effort to ensure that this gap is closed, because it is highly destructive.</seg>
<seg id=1309> To trade policy, the Commission has drawn up a proposal which will need to be carefully examined.</seg>
<seg id=1310> Although some progress has been made with regard to the extension of the formula could with the previous Treaty the crazy formula, the codecision procedure has been set up, including the unanimity on matters of nationality, social security, the reception and exercise self-employment and of cultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=1311> The fact that this issue is in itself a clear evidence of the failure of a policy to strengthen the ties of mutual trust between the countries of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1312> That is the situation in which we are engaged in the Intergovernmental Conference for months, because nobody will be toys.</seg>
<seg id=1313> The experiences of this year should lead us to conclude that when we have the progress achieved after Nice, with a view to the future of Europe in the konstitutionalisierungsprozess of confidence in the Union, not only between the now exhausted method of intergovernmental negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=1314> The qualified majority is not the rule, then just now, Mr Prodi, is that Mr correctly pointed out, blocked the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id=1315> This aspect of subsidiarity has been mentioned in this debate, however, is of great importance.</seg>
<seg id=1316> We have made it so that the process of enlargement has taken place, there was the judicious reflection group chaired by Carlos Westendorp, Amsterdam, and now we will have in Nice and on the same point, Mr President: We the institutional issues, without coming up with solutions which give us the opportunity to fulfil a very challenging task of enlargement to 27.</seg>
<seg id=1317> Let us not the disappointment of the Nice Conference, if it ends, and also the great disappointment of the peoples of our Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1318> In the past, we have demonstrated that it is possible, and as a citizen of a Member State which has benefited from an orderly transition to membership, I look forward to an enlarged and peaceful Europe with great expectations.</seg>
<seg id=1319> But even if we have a right of veto, it must be made clear that this has to apply for all the others.</seg>
<seg id=1320> First, however, a change in the Parliament to be elected in 2004 will be necessary, because some Member States will come before the election, or at least 2004-2009 as early as during the parliamentary term.</seg>
<seg id=1321> The President-in-Office of the Council has raised the question of enhanced cooperation, to be moving in this matter to reach a consensus.</seg>
<seg id=1322> Mr President, at first sight it is Nice leftovers in the light of enlargement and the necessary adjustments.</seg>
<seg id=1323> We could also have a shred of mentality, insofar as we went to adverse developments in our part of the world and less emphasis on which more positive processes, then we would be happier than is currently the case.</seg>
<seg id=1324> We should not only involve the movement of goods, but also the associated services, investment, intellectual property and competition in the majority of the Council of Ministers and the Article 133 (1) of the treaty change.</seg>
<seg id=1325> An initiative of the European Parliament but also in this highly sensitive political issue to arbitrariness.</seg>
<seg id=1326> We must therefore be able, as one of you said, to the American optimism and by the way in which the Americans are, what is what.</seg>
<seg id=1327> I would also like to say that, in my view, it is not a problem of large and small countries.</seg>
<seg id=1328> We have done a lot, but we always come back to the old problem, and I do not believe that a development that would be only a single country, because it is, I repeat, to do with very strong national, political, democratic realities in twelve of the fifteen countries.</seg>
<seg id=1329> Mr President, Mr Védrine, you have stated that, perhaps to a climate spannungsgeladenes here, and you also mentioned a degree of pessimism.</seg>
<seg id=1330> I should also like to ask you to do everything possible to tighten up the requirements in a proper way, so that such an incident does not happen again.</seg>
<seg id=1331> I believe that we have to see to it that we must have taken far from being that the guests of this Parliament can feel in this House as guests and have not fear of threats.</seg>
<seg id=1332> In this respect, hospitality hospitality and there too.</seg>
<seg id=1333> Thank you very much for your comments, Mr Tajani.</seg>
<seg id=1334> The best way we can do that lluch Ernest and his life is to follow his message in Catalan - it is dìaleg. We can all give the dialogue in the Basque country a chance?</seg>
<seg id=1335> On the other hand, of course, everyone can express his opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1336> (B5-0549 / 2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Council on the political situation and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan;</seg>
<seg id=1337> When I speak of organisation, then I believe that the European Union, the great effort should be responsible for this.</seg>
<seg id=1338> Secondly, you will see in the resolution on the clear will of Parliament and the security and defence policy on two pillars: the balanced and civil crisis management in the event of a failure to military crisis management, and these two pillar complement each other.</seg>
<seg id=1339> Mr President, given the late and that the commitments which I have today, I shall try to reduce the speech I had prepared.</seg>
<seg id=1340> These relations are particularly meetings between the North Atlantic Council and the copsi and meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European countries and / or produced the allies.</seg>
<seg id=1341> By way of example to the events in the Balkans, where we can say that everyone has its role to the full.</seg>
<seg id=1342> During this period, the United States, we have kept fully informed of developments in the context of the European security and defence policy, which is an essential condition for its harmonious development, as is currently the case.</seg>
<seg id=1343> The second annual report of the European Union was presented on the rights of the European Parliament, and a human rights will take place on 13 December in Paris.</seg>
<seg id=1344> This policy, they are not, to be the competitors of the Atlantic Alliance, which today is the basis of the collective defence of its members, or to establish a European army.</seg>
<seg id=1345> If I have mentioned the figure of 100 000 men, this does not mean that we want to act in Helsinki objective, but that we have a reserve of different qualifications and specializations is guaranteed, so that the objective of the Council which can be achieved in all relevant 60 000 men working conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1346> Let me now turn very briefly, on a large number of our public accepted real political meaning of this new role for Europe to become a real instrument of political influence.</seg>
<seg id=1347> However, we are also faced with the problem that we have to ensure that, when we talk of the consolidation of liberal democracy in Europe, the continent as a whole, because that is what is at stake in the enlargement process and the process of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1348> Three areas we need to combine the coherence of Community policies, the CFSP, including the ESDP and national measures of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1349> Despite the costly procedure within the Commission, we do not need a strong force of 60 000 soldiers to achieve our goals.</seg>
<seg id=1350> It must therefore be urgently found a way to provide humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id=1351> I do not agree with those who say that they have a Europe which is no use. However, it is true that the rapid reaction force will not be in many situations.</seg>
<seg id=1352> The EU should not be its defence of troops.</seg>
<seg id=1353> In conclusion, I would like to express the concern of my group on the worsening situation in Afghanistan and the Commission and call on the Council, where it is possible to step up their efforts to achieve a peaceful solution and a support for the civilian population, especially now before the onset of winter.</seg>
<seg id=1354> In very simple words: to say where, when and how the European rapid reaction force should in future be used?</seg>
<seg id=1355> It shows how the appalling record of these two months is now the Intifada, amounts to 270, mostly Palestinians dead, and nearly 10 000 for life often disabled people injured.</seg>
<seg id=1356> That is why it is also trying to keep a schrecklichster arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.</seg>
<seg id=1357> On the other hand, contrary to what has been said by the previous speaker, I do not know whether it would be possible and desirable that the European Union, in the light of the conflict and the escalation of violence in the Middle East is doing more than before, especially now, during the transition period in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1358> Mr President, in my speech I would like to comment on the report by Mrs Lalumière, which I believe is very good and clear.</seg>
<seg id=1359> But there is no real political concept, and there is still no common foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=1360> The EU has only a problem, namely that it has not so far been the öffentlichkeitsinteresse for such actions, although this considerably more and more effective.</seg>
<seg id=1361> Another point is, of course, the question of the distribution of the budget.</seg>
<seg id=1362> I do this in spite of the large number of clear assurances on this issue, as in the last few days to happen again.</seg>
<seg id=1363> Our potential is still very limited. The Member States should reconsider their defence spending, which differ from country to country.</seg>
<seg id=1364> Even those who question the usefulness of the decision, for example, the creation of the so-called European army, must recognise the important political content of this decision and its influence on the cohesion of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1365> The first is a Minister in our Parliament as historic, that we have to set aside the night sitting, so that the impression of our Members is not too great.</seg>
<seg id=1366> For all of these conflicts is a civil crisis prevention rather than a military action.</seg>
<seg id=1367> Russia wants to be, in the long term, of a political unionspartner undemocratic regimes?</seg>
<seg id=1368> Europe is not a new military alliance, as some have suggested - I believe - as well as a result of inadequate information.</seg>
<seg id=1369> I have received, pursuant to Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure, to wind up the debate, a motion for a resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1370> Given the scale of the task of four committees have been hit, and a new procedure was used in the preparation of four simultaneous reports.</seg>
<seg id=1371> The measures proposed in the White Paper, in its entirety, must serve the whole operation of the Commission to modernise and become more effective.</seg>
<seg id=1372> It would be appropriate, therefore, to take the reform to limit its intervention in areas which do not involve expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1373> That bewertungsunterschiede are not just political in nature, but, above all, a reflection of the cultural differences between the fifteen Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1374> The task of the new internal audit service, which you, Mr Kinnock, the Vice-President responsible for reform is the analysis of the internal control systems and in the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1375> The cooperation has made great play of, and I think that the process, to give the Commission an important reform which for the future of the European Union is so important, has acquired deep and wealth, because we have been four.</seg>
<seg id=1376> They should expect to be seconded to the other European institutions, national governments or to work in the private sector.</seg>
<seg id=1377> That is why our committee once again highlights the importance it attaches to a strong, independent, efficient, transparent and responsible political Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1378> As the Committee on Budgets, we are of the opinion that the drafting of the budget for activities is due to the low profile of the spending and because of our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=1379> It is the will of Parliament, to ensure that the reform of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1380> Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for the work they have done.</seg>
<seg id=1381> This is shameful, in view of the fact that the EU itself champion of the modernisation of the economy.</seg>
<seg id=1382> Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteur to support the work of the Commission, it remains a fact that of independent experts to the recommendations of the Committee will be given a comprehensive and consistent response in terms of the quest for a real government policy and not just for a better management of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1383> The change in attitude is expressed in a transparent administration.</seg>
<seg id=1384> In my view, there are no structure in the world with a larger and richer than the 15, 20 or more countries tomorrow, an entire continent. The most industrialised pulsiert part of the world in the Union and by the Commission on their structures.</seg>
<seg id=1385> Changes are never easy.</seg>
<seg id=1386> The Socialist Group in the European Parliament was of the opinion, however, that the management of Community law currently working effectively.</seg>
<seg id=1387> We know the outcome, and that is why the number of Members of the Commission and its administration have dealt with this issue in depth and expertly.</seg>
<seg id=1388> Thousands of projektanträgen already be a year of evaluation.</seg>
<seg id=1389> As we have seen, the debate is not so much a question of principles, objectives and opportunities of the reform, but rather about procedures, speed timetable possible problems or undesirable consequences of their implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1390> First of all, I should like to inform the House that, as Mr van Hulten has already pointed out, at the meeting of the College of Commissioners adopted a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement, in the context of an advisory group on rules of behaviour in the public service 'Action 1, as provided for in the action plan on the White Paper.</seg>
<seg id=1391> Mr van Hulten has picked up this point again in the course of this debate, as far as I know.</seg>
<seg id=1392> The main aim of the reform is a simplification, the increase in transparency, the strengthening of the principles in concrete terms this means that fewer exceptions, less incomprehensible, and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg id=1393> It is also very profitable for the Commission when treaties are so that cost X, Y costs for 20% to 30% to be replaced, and often the evidence of kleinstbeträgen and examined.</seg>
<seg id=1394> The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission in these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI)).</seg>
<seg id=1395> The latter relate to aspects, in particular the NGOs.</seg>
<seg id=1396> Of course, this is not enough, but that will protect us in any case exaggerated the weakness of our development aid.</seg>
<seg id=1397> We will be coming back, because this is a reasonable framework.</seg>
<seg id=1398> Mr President, I am now returned from Mozambique, where the European Union has done excellent humanitarian aid for the tsunami, but wiederaufbau-projekte are once again, for which we have already asked the money, because not all signatures meeting in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id=1399> In the face of this situation, a greater commitment and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment.</seg>
<seg id=1400> We now have a harmonised system for the production of country strategy papers and indicative programmes for cooperation in all developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=1401> Moreover, the establishment of SEM no solution to this imbalance of eight bloated verwaltungskörpern.</seg>
<seg id=1402> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have attached particular importance to be present here for this debate on the first package on maritime transport in the European Parliament, because they will deal with three important texts, is the first essential step in this area, which, unfortunately, highlighted by the recent events so much in the public eye.</seg>
<seg id=1403> From the point of view of the Presidency, the opportunity to discuss with the Member States, in order to make proposals on the basis of an agreement in the Council and adopt the text at first reading, with a qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=1404> This rapid and effective action and that its results are two Erika packages six proposals, has given rise to an enormous dynamism.</seg>
<seg id=1405> The lesson for this Parliament this morning, should lead to the conclusion that the law of the sea in the world in a shameful situation and it is time that we get it right.</seg>
<seg id=1406> To vessels which do not meet the standards, must give a clear signal that ports in European waters or in European not tolerate.</seg>
<seg id=1407> In the lower tonnage there we have entered into a compromise between the 5 000 tonnes, the limit value of the IMO, and 600 tonnes of sustainability, the ceiling proposed by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1408> This information must be made available to the European public, and the port authorities and the public.</seg>
<seg id=1409> The grenzenübergreifende nature of the marine environment, the pollution of an area of greater region can spread, calls for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution.</seg>
<seg id=1410> In the cooperation at local level, environmental organisations are involved.</seg>
<seg id=1411> The amendment of the directive in the sense of a stricter application, a harmonisation of the legislation, particularly as regards the selection of ships is now coming up for review and the scope of the various überprüfungsformen, is of course a good thing.</seg>
<seg id=1412> I should like to point out once more that the request for urgent procedure, for which it is not.</seg>
<seg id=1413> I think that needs to be considered in the haftungsgrenze classification societies, between the Council and Parliament, of course, once again, regardless of what is being decided today.</seg>
<seg id=1414> A tachograph, a black list, with all these things, we are in full agreement. Nevertheless, I would like to make a couple of points.</seg>
<seg id=1415> In view of the disastrous situation in maritime transport and anarchic Europe responded to the challenge and eleven months after the wreck of the Erika, the European Union will be able to demonstrate a process that was not dealt with as quickly as ever.</seg>
<seg id=1416> So you can see to what extent the liberal logic incompatible with a high level of safety in maritime transport.</seg>
<seg id=1417> What technical measures to be taken, one of the main sources of uncertainty will continue to exist as long as one does not stop in the English Channel and the North Atlantic the exponential growth of transport because of the strangulation of North Sea ports.</seg>
<seg id=1418> The President-in-Office of the Council, it would be good to see if he would create order in his country.</seg>
<seg id=1419> Mr President, since the break-up of the tankschiffs Erika under political pressure put together a package of measures to improve the safety of ships at sea.</seg>
<seg id=1420> Greek ships were simply in the region, Mr Gayssot storm.</seg>
<seg id=1421> Thirdly, should be when we talk about such issues that we continue to use fossil fuels, on the other hand, no link between, on the one hand, and the fact that the way things hang together generally.</seg>
<seg id=1422> We should finally summon up the political courage to implement our environmental ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1423> This means that, in this area, we have a great responsibility and, as seems to me that any institutional eigenliebe.</seg>
<seg id=1424> In Finland, for example, it is essential that Russia is involved in this agreement.</seg>
<seg id=1425> This relates to both the stricter requirements for the design of oil tankers, better rules for the more stringent rules on port state control and classification societies, which will also be a result.</seg>
<seg id=1426> Mr President, we are talking today about the safety at sea, based on three reports, on which I congratulate the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=1427> As far as the three new proposals to safety at sea is concerned, there is an urgent need to congratulate the three rapporteurs, who have done in a very short space of time, the proof that our Parliament is determined to adopt new measures to increase maritime safety, to strengthen controls and reinforce the design standard, and that in future such disasters unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1428> Madam President, a series of high level of maritime disasters involving oil tankers, above all, in the recent past, our continent has hit hard.</seg>
<seg id=1429> More than 80% of accidents are due to human error, but the reasons for human error which are social.</seg>
<seg id=1430> Someone spoke of 'traceability'.</seg>
<seg id=1431> With the directive on port state control and compliance with international standards should not be introduced new provisions.</seg>
<seg id=1432> In Amendment No 18 port state control will put to rest periods of seafarers. In the implementation of the provisions on seafarers' hours of work is already covered by the existing Directive 99 / 95.</seg>
<seg id=1433> I am happy to see that the rapporteur in Amendment No 21 has included a reference to the system for assessing the conditions, and we are in agreement with the proposed thrust, but something still needs to be done to improve the wording in order to make this clearer.</seg>
<seg id=1434> Amendment No 4 and the 'C' recipient in Amendment No 18 is unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1435> I can assure you that a ship owners, to register on these flags of convenience, the intention is that, once again, our proposal is in force.</seg>
<seg id=1436> The Commissioner has spoken 18 minutes and at this time dozens and dozens of articles and reflect the position of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1437> Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on a package of measures on the trans-European network, preparation for the collection and dissemination of statistics within the Union and movement of goods (EDICOM) (COM (2000) 0458 - C5-0401 / 2000 - 2000 / 0201 (COD)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)</seg>
<seg id=1438> I would like to withdraw the motion for a resolution, but I would like to express the conviction that our Parliament can make its voice heard, it would have been better if in relation to the meeting of the European Council in Nice, a specific and separate motion for a resolution on the important and difficult issues to the Intergovernmental Conference, not in the context of a single, all the other items on the agenda of the summit comprehensive resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1439> (More than twelve Members raised from their seats, does not take account of the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1440> Report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission in these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI))</seg>
<seg id=1441> I have done it as a sign of protest because the European Union to intervene in this area has still not as it should be.</seg>
<seg id=1442> Although the proposal to amend the existing directive on port state control, the Watts report real ambitions it contained a number of aspects that represent a step in the right direction, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1443> It is therefore regrettable that the idea was not in the Commission proposal, a genuine European küstenüberwachungsbehörde following the model of the United States' coast guards. "</seg>
<seg id=1444> A prerequisite for the safety of ships, the protection of life at sea and the environment, the fight against the unaccountability of shipowners, strict measures to control the condition of vessels, the harsh punishment of schiffsgesellschaften which infringe the safety regulations, the improvement of the working conditions of seafarers, targeted training and composition of the occupation, so that it can be increased requirements of ships.</seg>
<seg id=1445> Unfortunately, the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, the exact opposite.</seg>
<seg id=1446> The wreck of the Erika in December 1999 was the question of safety at sea, on the political agenda of the Community, and the Commission has these texts on which we have voted today, almost a year after the terrible accident, proposed, at the insistence of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1447> The current compensation funds are not adequately equipped; this was only too clearly the Braer disaster, the fishing industry of the Shetland Islands was compensated for their losses.</seg>
<seg id=1448> Madam President, I have already mentioned that I am in danger.</seg>
<seg id=1449> The rapporteur's proposals towards harmonisation at European level, can only be positive.</seg>
<seg id=1450> The area concerned is very important, as it concerns the schiffsklassifikationsgesellschaften.</seg>
<seg id=1451> This would be a great success, because on the eve of enlargement, we need a rigid hierarchy and supranational Europe, which is remote from the citizens, but a flexible, close to the peoples of Europe, founded on the respect for the national democracies.</seg>
<seg id=1452> The public is becoming increasingly ausgetragene power struggle between Member States with a view to allow many possible compromises.</seg>
<seg id=1453> In Nice, the most important task is to ensure that the institutions of the European Union to work effectively.</seg>
<seg id=1454> Personally, I look forward to the summit, which will take place in a week hopeful.</seg>
<seg id=1455> I am not in favour of a mechanical link of qualified majority voting and codecision here, and I also believe that any decision must be taken to extend the power of codecision, case by case.</seg>
<seg id=1456> The amendment of Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extend qualified majority voting in the Council, which currently apply to trade in goods, in other areas, such as public services, intellectual property, health or education.</seg>
<seg id=1457> This Parliament is deprived of the right to remain silent and influence, in deference to the parteilichkeiten, duty and the national governments and forgets its obligations towards the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1458> In addition, I have voted against a text that calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty, which will be adopted in Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1459> It is a mistake to divide Europe into two classes. That is why I cannot accept that a third of the Member States to progress more quickly.</seg>
<seg id=1460> His new role heralded the end of the traditional neutrality, Sweden, Finland and Austria.</seg>
<seg id=1461> In this report there are a lot of the British Conservatives cannot give their support. This is particularly true in the emphasis placed on the enlargement of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1462> The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament support the report on the creation of a common European security and defence policy.</seg>
<seg id=1463> But also against the peoples of the European Union to the new military expenditure, to which the report refers, in any case, finance and do not have the guarantee that these forces are not used in the name of the 'one day of maintaining order "against itself.</seg>
<seg id=1464> As the proposal that a State that does not want to participate in a task will be obliged to make a financial contribution, which will be divided between the States involved in this war.</seg>
<seg id=1465> By military means from the outside, there is no solution, because it does not address the root of the conflict, they lead to a shift in public opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1466> Military operations that are to be financed from the budget line for the Community and the Member States should make a financial contribution to such tasks, even if they want to involve (paragraphs 49 and 50).</seg>
<seg id=1467> On the other hand, the EU would do well to reverse the priorities of the Petersberg tasks and concentrate more on civil and humanitarian lösungsmodelle.</seg>
<seg id=1468> I support this report by my colleague, Maj-Britt Theorin.</seg>
<seg id=1469> But the needs of this group are used only to the call for the 'tax deductibility of household services (s) "and" adjustment of prices and costs to the financial resources of private individuals'.</seg>
<seg id=1470> It is truly amazing that, in the 21st century we should recommend that the Member States should guarantee for domestic workers are entitled to social security and pensions.</seg>
<seg id=1471> For many young people, undeclared work is threatening to become the first contact with the labour market.</seg>
<seg id=1472> The worst thing, even if it concerns women from distant countries that have adopted this work and forced to see no other way to make a decent living.</seg>
<seg id=1473> The reform of the Commission will be judged by its results, hence the need for the Commission sachstandsberichte regular throughout the programme and the importance of full assessment expected December 2002.</seg>
<seg id=1474> Not so long ago, it was as a result of all kinds of scandals and management weaknesses in March 1999, the resignation of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1475> Finally, I believe it is essential to remember that we expect from this for the future essential reform at the same time, greater consistency and greater transparency of the Commission in their day-to-day administration, but also a greater sense of responsibility by strict restrictions on the delegated powers.</seg>
<seg id=1476> The Conservatives support the statement in paragraph 7 of the report that democratic control is to guarantee and make the system of the three pillars.</seg>
<seg id=1477> (The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=1478> We have received the information - and I can say that I do not believe that the French President and Members of the Council will be only 30 minutes to speak.</seg>
<seg id=1479> I therefore I support a full and reasoned opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1480> We should vote in any case, and I personally am in favour of a resolution, as Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others have proposed.</seg>
<seg id=1481> This also applies to the texts which stimmenaufteilung representation in the Council and seats in Parliament to work through the night.</seg>
<seg id=1482> Madam President, I would like to have certainly ask to delete the de Roo report from the agenda, because it is very well prepared. In the past, during the French Presidency, quite a common position next Monday and Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id=1483> Thank you very much, Mr Parish.</seg>
<seg id=1484> In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, its chairman, for it often smoke.</seg>
<seg id=1485> The political basis is clear: harmonisation of the market with a high level of consumer protection and public health, and on the basis of existing legislation, and the new scientific findings.</seg>
<seg id=1486> It is about their living conditions and lebensauffassung where the health become ever more important.</seg>
<seg id=1487> This can also be applied to all the time, but not in the consumption of drugs is harmless, if no other than the drugs konsumierenden will this person.</seg>
<seg id=1488> Just yesterday, proceedings against multinational tobacco companies in the United States with a condemnation of poisoning and false information on the safety of products.</seg>
<seg id=1489> With regard to the cigarettes are banned in the EU for health reasons, but be exported from the European Union, we are of the opinion that the end these exports is the only right and consistent.</seg>
<seg id=1490> Instead of the lessons from the failure of 9 October of this year in Luxembourg, we are still in a position which is not legally tenable.</seg>
<seg id=1491> I listened very carefully to what the Commissioner said to him: 'No massive job losses in this sector.</seg>
<seg id=1492> It is the European Parliament and the Council, which has to approve this proposal for a directive, for example, and to take the appropriate legal base.</seg>
<seg id=1493> I do not believe that we should take a narrow path, because, regardless of the contents, which is, as Mr Maaten and other expressed the danger that this Parliament, the Council and the European institutions are bound, in its entirety, provided that this Parliament and the Council will accept the chairman of the Group of the European People's Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi proposed restrictive interpretation, in the legislative work of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law, and their feet.</seg>
<seg id=1494> Its weakness lies in the fact that the focus is on the promotion of free competition.</seg>
<seg id=1495> To conclude: since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has the power to coordinate matters of environmental and consumer protection, and in this respect it will work closely, of course, with the Council and the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1496> In fact, this has nothing to do with tobacco, but the ruling by the Court of Justice could just as well to a ban on the advertising of alcohol or go to a ban on chocolate, sugar can be damaging to health.</seg>
<seg id=1497> I simply do not understand that a majority of this Parliament wants to introduce more generous rules, as it is intended by the governments of the Member States, the national governments, but also the many sectors will be represented, pointed out.</seg>
<seg id=1498> It has been proved that 80% of smokers want to stop the tobacco industry has to offer, but only a few strategies to help these people.</seg>
<seg id=1499> If we insist on other countries, to the effect that we should put our sensible proposals to extend the internal market in exports, we have the excellent work by Mr Maaten in question.</seg>
<seg id=1500> We support the implementation of this tests in a country with a akkreditiertes testlabor after a uniform method recognised throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1501> The effects of smoking on health are now widely recognised, and the general public as legislators and have come to the conclusion that it is time to introduce strict rules and regulations on this product.</seg>
<seg id=1502> The EU will therefore be very well in the future international rules and, therefore, the risk of the birth of barriers to strengthen consumer protection and, at the same time guaranteeing a high level of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1503> Instead, we should wait until the whole question of additives in the first report of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1504> With regard to the amendment on laboratory tests is the approval of superfluous, as laid down in Article is that only such goods to be placed on the market, with the provisions of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1505> Madam President, this report is very clear: the duration of directives is limited to summer-time to just five years, then it must be submitted to Parliament once again.</seg>
<seg id=1506> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a Directive on summer-time arrangements which we are considering today, I believe, is a good proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1507> I therefore believe that we should not stop us in this House with this issue for far too long, but also the Member States and the people of the summer-time arrangements have been accepted, and it has been recognised as part of our jahresrhythmus.</seg>
<seg id=1508> I am in favour of questions regarding the time zones and harmonisation of the summer-time arrangements, as proposed in the power of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1509> It more talk to end the period at the end of September, some six months after its beginning.</seg>
<seg id=1510> We are in favour of appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report to be drawn up in 2007, as mentioned in Article 5.</seg>
<seg id=1511> It is clear that interventions in the human germ line cannot be accepted.</seg>
<seg id=1512> We will, if we accept this compromise, still have a regulation that the therapeutic progress and guarantee the protection of patients in Europe will not be just as it is, and that is why I call for this compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1513> These groups must continue to fall within the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1514> I am glad, though, that we have managed to put a stop to this germ gene therapy.</seg>
<seg id=1515> I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on his report and thank him for his efforts to achieve a compromise, given the differences.</seg>
<seg id=1516> These programmes relating to the fight against cancer, AIDS, the prevention of drug dependence and the promotion of health termination. It would mean the end of plans and the work of the networks created.</seg>
<seg id=1517> It is very good to prepare the ground in advance and to proceed as quickly as possible, even if a second reading will need to approach as far as possible to the point at which a decision.</seg>
<seg id=1518> We must also take into account, given that both the promotion and prevention and monitoring are becoming increasingly important, and that is why you are more important and a higher budget.</seg>
<seg id=1519> Madam President, on the occasion of the Trakatellis report on the extension of the current European action programmes in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about the direction in which European policy is in the area of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1520> I understand that the Council has indicated his agreement in principle.</seg>
<seg id=1521> The paradox in the European Union is now that the borders have been abolished for the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, but still 15 borders are maintained in the fields of police and justice. Their removal is made more difficult by the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1522> Finally, it remains the case that the initiative is a real and important step forward in the creation of a European strafrechtsraums. If it is also covers only limited areas and, it is to the real needs of many European citizens who have not, to date, as if they were outside the territory of the country of residence of the victim of a crime.</seg>
<seg id=1523> What have we asked for these people?</seg>
<seg id=1524> At the same time, the experts, the direct contacts with the victims, a specific training must be ensured.</seg>
<seg id=1525> Victims must not be victims, victims of crime and then of the system.</seg>
<seg id=1526> In this context, it is also important that the members of the family of the victim, can be informed discreetly and professionalism of the issue and, if necessary, also count on the support and that they must have not everything from the press.</seg>
<seg id=1527> This is regardless of the type of crime.</seg>
<seg id=1528> We must not move ever at national level or at the level of the fundamental principle that an individual must always take responsibility for its own actions.</seg>
<seg id=1529> In other cases, it may be necessary to obtain the necessary information in a language of the Union, which is not their own.</seg>
<seg id=1530> I welcome the favourable response by Parliament on the basis of these initial text on such an important issue, that of the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building for our fellow citizens, particularly in situations in which we can manage often only with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id=1531> Vote on request for urgent procedure</seg>
<seg id=1532> (Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)</seg>
<seg id=1533> We have agreed on the night of 23 on 24 November with the Council on the basis of a budget that is failure, but certainly not reasonable.</seg>
<seg id=1534> That is why the Commission proposed a revision of EUR 300 million. The Council has fought tooth and nail against.</seg>
<seg id=1535> But I know from conversations that it is much more difficult to formulate a non-negotiable Council ’ s position to obtain a mandate and lead to national egotism in the event of a reasonably sensible and workable pan-European decision.</seg>
<seg id=1536> I hope that the work for a common recruitment office, as it neudeutsch means that a European recruitment office, so that we can make progress, the problems which, in the next few years to all the institutions - the Council and the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions - namely the staff in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id=1537> The Council refused this revision, we should now have the data - and I would like to warn him: to use the flexibility instrument for two consecutive years, in less than 15 months and the first time less than six months after the adoption of the financial perspectives, which weakens the flexibility instrument financially, since it prevents the restoration and it is possible that up to a sum of EUR 600 million.</seg>
<seg id=1538> This considerable amount, which is due to the need, in particular in the year 2001 can be financed through the use of the flexibility instrument in the sum of EUR 200 million.</seg>
<seg id=1539> In the light of this new situation, the Council has adopted a budget at second reading, which is an increase of 2.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1540> Before you pass this budget, I would like to highlight the importance the Council attaches to compliance with some fundamental budgetary rules concerning the sums in the reserve, the legal basis and the classification of expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1541> In contrast to Nice, and I believe that all three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, with the outcome of the bottom line.</seg>
<seg id=1542> Ladies and gentlemen, the recent discovery of cattle bse-erkrankten also made the necessary budget for immediate action, namely the protection of health, consumer protection, but also with regard to the aid for farmers affected by this situation.</seg>
<seg id=1543> In addition, the Council has set for the framework programme to support the reconstruction of the Western Balkans a mehrjahresbetrag only as a guideline, but is in line with the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1544> With würgen herausgeschlagen and we still have a few million euros more.</seg>
<seg id=1545> My sincere thanks to Mrs Haug.</seg>
<seg id=1546> I therefore think that this is used to 1% of the budget of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1547> If I have understood you correctly, you said that we should not use the reserve, because it is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id=1548> I therefore think that we have seen among other things that I cannot at this time because of the very good things.</seg>
<seg id=1549> While the expenditure, which account for almost half of the entire budget, taking account of the letter of next year to grow over 5%, growth is only 3.5% of the entire budget.</seg>
<seg id=1550> We now see a great risk that the debate will increase in the next few years, mittelmeeranrainerstaat-projekten between MEDA and the Balkans, although we all know that there are urgently needed money.</seg>
<seg id=1551> Pleased to overcome the difficulties, the auftürmten on the road to the aim to fulfil the commitments made in Helsinki with candidate countries, to blow up without the European Union, and to enable the future of Europe to continue to act efficiently.</seg>
<seg id=1552> But there are real progress, progress has been made, even if this has not going as far as the presidency - which, as I would like to say, national a great openness demonstrated - would have liked.</seg>
<seg id=1553> For the statute for European political parties, a new legal basis, and gives Parliament the right to sue in accordance with Article 230 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1554> In recent months, three important steps have been taken forward.</seg>
<seg id=1555> This is the aim of the Nice declaration adopted in this respect and the deliberations to coordinate the fight against doping at European level.</seg>
<seg id=1556> The environmental risks - as is well known, global warming.</seg>
<seg id=1557> In Nice, the European Union has for the provision and the leadership of a common foreign and security policy necessary permanent bodies: a political and sicherheitspolisches Committee, a military committee and a European military staff.</seg>
<seg id=1558> For this cooperation, for their support and also for the inclusion of thanks to you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency.</seg>
<seg id=1559> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1560> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1561> We now need to examine the text in Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1562> I would, by the way, Mr President of the European Council, the costs are borne by the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id=1563> I see it as a failure, not only in terms of the European Union's declared ambition to change and to improve the efficiency of the institutions of the European Union, in order to include the new members, but also in relation to another important aim, which was perhaps too little emphasis, in relation to the approach of the European Union and the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1564> The right questions are, in our view, those that the impressive, which was zusammengeströmt people from all over Europe, on the eve of the summit in Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1565> First of all, the Fifteen have signed hastily in a tränengasgeschwängerten grundrechtecharte atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id=1566> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1567> My group is disappointed by this Treaty and on the future, he is worried. That is why we will fight it with all our strength.</seg>
<seg id=1568> Mr President, you have the floor.</seg>
<seg id=1569> Finally, I would like to reply to Mr Hager that the instrument of closer cooperation is, in my view, useful, in order to make Europe more dynamic and explore the way, as I said earlier, I believe, Romano Prodi. For my part, I am in favour of this.</seg>
<seg id=1570> Mr President, I would like to know whether the authority of the European Parliament is a new achievement for the period after Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1571> Far through the complexity of clinical trials abgeschreckten perhaps by the pharmaceutical companies are encouraged by the Member States, as well as our Parliament clearly expressed wish to develop the market for paediatric medicines, even if this is not big enough to guarantee the profitability of investment.</seg>
<seg id=1572> . (FR) The summer-time regime, at the time of the oil crisis for reasons of energy saving and introduced by 2001 was extended to continue?</seg>
<seg id=1573> The position of crime victims is not always protected in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id=1574> This European initiative will therefore be many passengers and holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id=1575> Mr President, I would like to welcome the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, who is here with us, and the Presidency is entering the Chamber, and emphasise that probably never has shown such unanimity in this House in the evaluation of the results of a summit.</seg>
<seg id=1576> The Europe which is moving forward, that is, which has done under the French Presidency in six months, it seems to me that, despite all its work in six key areas.</seg>
<seg id=1577> Above all, however, I fear that the United Kingdom, France and Germany will now be able to disrupt the over decades between Member States of different sizes and the delicate balance between the institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1578> It is difficult to see how the Nice decisions to facilitate the enlargement of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1579> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief.</seg>
<seg id=1580> For all this, I can only draw the conclusions that I will be, if a vote on the Treaty of Nice, a "no 'vote.</seg>
<seg id=1581> Mr President, the most important result of Nice was that an agreement is reached, and now in place for the candidate countries can be created.</seg>
<seg id=1582> The real winners of this conference is Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, who say 'no' to Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1583> Therefore we forget Nice and we turn our eyes on the post-Nice process, I hope you will allow me to put to the Belgian Presidency has announced its intention of a Convention, since it has been demonstrated that we must find new ways, we need a new method, we need to speed up the history, because 2004 is too late, is too distant, too many dangers.</seg>
<seg id=1584> Instead, the spirit of Nice was obviously to ask how we can block, how can we intergouvernementalisieren, as we cannot allow itself to celebrate as defenders of national interests, rather than making progress with the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1585> What are we to Amsterdam and Nice, is a Europe of imperial potentates, a Europe of national administrations and not the Europe of the political agreement.</seg>
<seg id=1586> In the main, we can stop on qualified majority voting.</seg>
<seg id=1587> It is true that I am here - in the words of Mr Bayrou - since I sit here this morning, first on the side of the President of the Republic, in a personal capacity, and coming from all sides, moderate, friendly criticism, it seems to me, but in any case.</seg>
<seg id=1588> We must not forget that it is in fact the first time since 1957, that this system has been reformed or changed.</seg>
<seg id=1589> We are dealing with constitutional systems, and therefore the competences cannot be mixed.</seg>
<seg id=1590> Thank you, Minister.</seg>
<seg id=1591> But it is not included in the Treaties, there is still a reference to the Charter in Article 6 (2) of the Treaty on European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1592> Finally, for example, to bring the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty, Article on political parties and the Statute, the right of the Parliament, the other institutions of the Court of Justice is still some positive aspects - an important factor of political control, the new formula for the European Commission, the inclusion of the so-called 'lex Prodi' in the Treaty, the strengthening of the President and the new composition of the Commission. All of this is a reasonable compromise, which I accept and which will be put to the test.</seg>
<seg id=1593> Mr President, we have already made a clear assessment of what happened in Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1594> If we look at things: the Charter was not included in the Treaty, not even a reference.</seg>
<seg id=1595> We want to show the government that we can do better.</seg>
<seg id=1596> Despite the eigenlobs the French presidency this morning, the Intergovernmental Conference has not just been brought to a successful conclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1597> Mr President, it is not so easy to criticise the French Presidency, since he is not here.</seg>
<seg id=1598> Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the model of the Intergovernmental Conference.</seg>
<seg id=1599> 2001 budget (continuation)</seg>
<seg id=1600> But that does not mean that we would not have been able to do a lot more and better.</seg>
<seg id=1601> These ceilings will oblige the Commission to put in the context of a limited budget priorities, such as this must do any authority.</seg>
<seg id=1602> In this debate to the vote following a long and difficult process of decision-making is on the European Union budget for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1603> That is why we are as follows: action by recourse to Article 272 we have avoided a meltdown. The financial perspective has been maintained, despite the use of the flexibility instrument.</seg>
<seg id=1604> The Council, I would like to say that we are in this game as quickly and that we will have the balls until we have achieved the desired result.</seg>
<seg id=1605> We do not want the resolution contains a Colom already underway for the coming year, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we share his criticism that a solution with regard to the financial unterausstattung heading 4 in this way distorts the multiannual nature of the major objectives of the external action of the Union and the definition of the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1606> In order to achieve all this, fulfil our obligations in the long term, it is also necessary to set priorities in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1607> Only then will the money we have for our fellow citizens, it is only right and proper.</seg>
<seg id=1608> If we have to provide for the supplementary budget, then it will be almost 8%, whereas in all the other areas - the education policy, it is the whole area of internal policy, including research, of foreign policy, the administration of pre-accession aid, a growth rate of only 1.1%.</seg>
<seg id=1609> Cooperation is good in the supplementary budget, we will then have been able to continue.</seg>
<seg id=1610> We also welcome it, if not regulated relations between Russia and the Baltic States to the still criticism.</seg>
<seg id=1611> We take interest in the social and political developments in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1612> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1613> Even if President Putin to guarantee the democratic development of his country, he does not automatically guarantee a stable and democratic Russia. Nor democratic order is not a living reality in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1614> But we should not do secretly, we need to build a Europe of economic cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1615> As far as the Caucasus is concerned, Mr Van Orden is absolutely right.</seg>
<seg id=1616> Anyone who sees Russia from outside and then also be immediate reactions from the country itself and Russian partners, is in danger of selective quickly explain to the reality of the country, which is in its russland-bild.</seg>
<seg id=1617> In the political field, a common strategy with Russia is proposing to enter into a dialogue on politics and security and the creation of a permanent mechanism.</seg>
<seg id=1618> I would like to stress that we must make it clear that Russia is indeed a political union with Belarus.</seg>
<seg id=1619> Are you prepared, Commissioner, to support such a project?</seg>
<seg id=1620> As the honourable Members know, a wide-ranging dialogue was at the last summit between the European Union and Russia of Romano Prodi to energy issues.</seg>
<seg id=1621> I very much hope that, at the beginning of next year I will have the opportunity to visit Kaliningrad itself, not only because Immanuel Kant has spent his whole life there.</seg>
<seg id=1622> I would like to congratulate the honourable Member once again turn on an excellent report on a very important subject, which we have repeatedly in the coming years in this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1623> You have put me in a difficult position.</seg>
<seg id=1624> Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is very necessary, because of the BSE crisis has an enormous impact on feed on production and imports of animal feed.</seg>
<seg id=1625> The Council has expressed on numerous meetings with Russia, its concern at all levels, in particular, to the Russian Government to avoid excessive use of force and a possible extension of the conflict, independent and effective investigations of the human rights of the OSCE support group in fulfilling its mission and to ensure that, finally, for the delivery of humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id=1626> Mr President, on a point of order: it is customary in this House that questions that cannot be answered orally, cannot be made in writing.</seg>
<seg id=1627> (Interruption from Mr Posselt)</seg>
<seg id=1628> This directive, which dates from 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1629> And in this sense, we have to work.</seg>
<seg id=1630> These groups are not, however, been included in the new proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1631> The presidency and some Member States have already given by the association of the European sugar industry a number of letters to the Commission 's proposal, taking into account in its deliberations.</seg>
<seg id=1632> Question No 6 by (H-0886 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1633> First of all, I must say that the President-in-Office of the Council has answered the question, in my opinion, Mr Korakas.</seg>
<seg id=1634> We must set up this authority, and I believe that the European authorities are fully aware of the problem and that we have to move forward.</seg>
<seg id=1635> To put it in a nutshell, the representative of the Presidency, in this case the French ambassador in Algeria, has met with Mr Ahmed taleb M.?</seg>
<seg id=1636> In this connection, we welcome the proposed by the General Assembly and the preparatory committee for the provisions of the accreditation of non-governmental organisations and the preparations for the special session on children in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1637> The text on the partnership agreement contains a number of references to the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</seg>
<seg id=1638> As the Council has already pointed out to the honourable Member in his last answer, the process of mutual recognition of criminal judgments will allow a better protection of the rights of individuals.</seg>
<seg id=1639> I would like to insist, however.</seg>
<seg id=1640> It is, in particular, the political control and the strategic use of military crisis management.</seg>
<seg id=1641> I would just like to remind you that the system of the Treaty makes a difference between the treatment of indirect taxes, and their harmonisation for the establishment and the functioning of the internal market, as it says in Article 93 - and the approximation of legislation, in accordance with Article 94, which directly affect the establishment and the functioning of the common market and the direct taxes.</seg>
<seg id=1642> I would like to say a few words on these three key areas.</seg>
<seg id=1643> If the pattern that everyone is against any doubt, that this could be the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, based on regional cooperation, blow.</seg>
<seg id=1644> We need the cooperation with Yugoslavia, a mutual cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1645> Mr President, our group supports the work of Mr Baltas in connection with the report on the possibility of the negotiation of a stabilisation and association agreement with the Republic of Croatia.</seg>
<seg id=1646> Mr President, in the years when I was President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I had the opportunity to monitor, many Croats in their efforts to freedom and prosperity, the gleichsetzten, like other peoples of our continent, with its integration into the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1647> On the basis of the development of this year, I am convinced that we should be able to submit a straffes pace, because that Croatia has done over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id=1648> In any event, this is the approach adopted by us, and the speed with which we have put us in recent months on developments in Croatia, confirmed this.</seg>
<seg id=1649> We owe it to the people in Croatia, that we will support you and your government fully in the years to come, and we are very grateful to the honourable Member that he calls us to continue along the path chosen.</seg>
<seg id=1650> In this context, it is incomprehensible that in the spring of this year, thousands of supporters of the Laskar Jihad have been able to draw on the Moluccas, also to the conflicts.</seg>
<seg id=1651> In East Timor militias deny the return of the refugees and workers are threatened.</seg>
<seg id=1652> On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would just like to comment on three points.</seg>
<seg id=1653> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate our colleague Mrs Maij-Weggen for her excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1654> So it is no exception.</seg>
<seg id=1655> Continued violence in the Moluccas, in Aceh and Irian Jaya express great suffering on the people.</seg>
<seg id=1656> Tomorrow, the formal presentation of the Sakharov Prize here will take place.</seg>
<seg id=1657> Because of recent reports from the Indonesian archipelago, however, the question is not whether the situation is even more serious, for President Wahid and its supporters or even more serious, as described by the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=1658> If we want to help Indonesia, then we must do so now, with money and action. Words alone are not enough.</seg>
<seg id=1659> I think that the report before us makes important clarification on this point.</seg>
<seg id=1660> It is obvious that the difficulties of the country to overcome today, not tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id=1661> Protection of the financial interests of the Communities.</seg>
<seg id=1662> The obstacles to its independent work, particularly in the personalrekrutierung structured, and in its construction.</seg>
<seg id=1663> The Commission must therefore take advantage of internal reform process, at last, your announcement that fraud will not be tolerated and any fraud.</seg>
<seg id=1664> I think that this is what must be the consequence of Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1665> We welcome negotiations between the Member States on the approximation of legislation in the field of crime, but we would like to suggest that none of our countries eu-anklagebehörde federal.</seg>
<seg id=1666> In addition, I would like to know why the publication of the Commission document on this subject has been postponed until the day after the Danish referendum on the euro.</seg>
<seg id=1667> I have asked for these countries in particular, because I think that it is time to ask it.</seg>
<seg id=1668> In fact I am sure that OLAF is keen to make the choice of more transparent management.</seg>
<seg id=1669> However, we must ensure that we focus on the problems of the Commission, after all, our own quite considerable problems. We also have problems.</seg>
<seg id=1670> We are trying to extinguish the fire and stifle the smoke.</seg>
<seg id=1671> No one can understand that, and I do not.</seg>
<seg id=1672> If this objective is to be achieved in every respect, I would like to highlight four issues which, I believe, play a vital role in the work of the budgetary control authority.</seg>
<seg id=1673> For the Parliament itself, the problem lies in the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1674> It is true, Commissioner, if the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, to respect the rights of Members.</seg>
<seg id=1675> He has the opportunity, for a certain period of mittelüberweisungen not to approve the budget lines in question, particularly those which are intended to increase the appropriations in the budget, completed by further investigations. It could even be said to ask the Commission to demand the resignation of Commissioners to the serious problems - a sort of eu-kaiserschnitt.</seg>
<seg id=1676> The report calls for detailed inventory of the operational activities, thorough monitoring of budget lines and irregularities and internal Commission evaluation of performance.</seg>
<seg id=1677> Commissioner, the starting point of the transmission of information to the European Parliament and of the EC Treaty is not the interinstitutional agreement.</seg>
<seg id=1678> The result of this common position, but it would be if he would not have changed, that, in the end, we will not only in relation to North America, but not a level playing field within Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1679> I do not know why it should not be here, as all the other directives, succeeded in bringing about a compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1680> It is a proposal that has come a long and, I fear, technical way of some of the existing problems.</seg>
<seg id=1681> The first amendment relates to Article 4, in which the issue of the competent authority in the supply.</seg>
<seg id=1682> On the other hand, the proposal before us now would cause confusion and a search for the best and potential to create a competent court procedures during the adoption of a company is very sensitive time.</seg>
<seg id=1683> In the United Kingdom has proved its worth in the voluntary code of conduct controlled by the übernahmeausschuss takeovers. It is a good example of how, with a very complex issue, which are less good legislation is a pragmatic approach.</seg>
<seg id=1684> Far more important that it should allow us to move forward in Lisbon, the task of creating a competitive, dynamic European economy.</seg>
<seg id=1685> It is for us here in the European Parliament at the end of the great spannungsfelder takeovers law in, for example, versus the shareholders of major shareholders versus small businesses, versus the capital market, in a mindestform at European level.</seg>
<seg id=1686> Through a number of amendments proposed by Parliament, the text of the common position of the Council's text by on aspects that could lead to difficulties in interpretation and called for a rapid implementation of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1687> It is not that the proposed definition of a reasonable price is better than another, because the different definitions currently in force in the Member States are all very informative.</seg>
<seg id=1688> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1689> In addition, has a auskunftsrecht artists to express its rights, within a period of up to three years in a professional dealers in what is sensible because they must conduct on the book and sales.</seg>
<seg id=1690> Consequently, the Austrian legislation is needed and to attack the European legislator, not only creates the conditions for artists and auction houses positive.</seg>
<seg id=1691> In addition, we are faced with the need for a common position, all the greater because this alone will enable the European Union, at international level, that the interests of artists in the world are protected in the area.</seg>
<seg id=1692> I trust in the wisdom and foresight of this House.</seg>
<seg id=1693> Only 274 by 7 000 people who had gone their rights, the resale right, with 40% of the amount was in 1998 and administrative costs erhebungs- benefited in Germany.</seg>
<seg id=1694> In short, there is no harmonisation in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1695> A similar amendment was rejected at first reading.</seg>
<seg id=1696> If it had been assumed that the translations could despite this very tight schedule and difficult to be made.</seg>
<seg id=1697> We are now so that we can unfortunately not postpone it.</seg>
<seg id=1698> We have proposed in the committee to do this one year earlier.</seg>
<seg id=1699> Naturally, this Parliament supported these values and will continue to defend it.</seg>
<seg id=1700> As a result of the technological developments and changes in the markets will inevitably be a change.</seg>
<seg id=1701> Since we cannot find any rechtsgrund, in order to avoid competition.</seg>
<seg id=1702> The reduction of the core of the universal service in the postal sector, the transport of mail, up to a weight limit of 50 g in the national postal services seriously the danger, no universal service at a reasonable price for the entire population in all regions.</seg>
<seg id=1703> May I remind my colleagues of the Conservatives in this House on the mess that you anrichteten in the United Kingdom, as if they were going to privatise the British Post Office.</seg>
<seg id=1704> From the safety net for the postal service, we have made a hängematte these large companies for the postal services, the rest is and will continue to do so, which will allow them.</seg>
<seg id=1705> I am very pleased with this result, because we wanted to ignore special services with the concept of the new technologies in the field of the universal service.</seg>
<seg id=1706> Madam President, Commissioner, we cannot and will not tolerate this.</seg>
<seg id=1707> The European Commission is proposing for the second stage is the complete liberalisation of the postal services.</seg>
<seg id=1708> I would also like to such a future for other countries in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1709> Mr Bolkestein has recently accused in the Dutch press, a unliberale the French position, at least, to paraphrase a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id=1710> This could say something that Spain has set up such a fund and used, in other words, it might be to the uncertain legal bases of the Fund to the virtual criteria of its composition and the ermessensentscheidungen in its application.</seg>
<seg id=1711> We vote tomorrow, I hope, for the amendment tabled by Mr Atkins, of Mr Sterckx, because otherwise I would have led me to vote against this report.</seg>
<seg id=1712> Royal Mail is involved in this competition and my letters in Malmö, Sweden.</seg>
<seg id=1713> What have we learned from the debate or from the controversy that Commissioner Bolkestein has with its follow-up triggered a liberalisation of the postal services in the absence of any assessment of the first stage and in violation of the rules laid down in this directive? we have learned that, under the guise of progressive and aufwertender concepts, such as modernisation, liberalisation or support for technological development, can hide the dismantling of social quality of a country.</seg>
<seg id=1714> The protection of the universal service by setting up a compensation fund, on the private operators contributions to the financing of the universaldienstpflichten postanbieter in remote areas, will not be.</seg>
<seg id=1715> These shortcomings, and this delay have also contributed to the debate and in the end are often confused.</seg>
<seg id=1716> Madam President, in the discussion of the issue we are talking about the economic and social cohesion.</seg>
<seg id=1717> Madam President, allow me first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, because, of course, a delicate, difficult work he has carried out, in which he had to try, the balance between very different positions and proposals, and zielpunkten.</seg>
<seg id=1718> I fear that the result will be that the current monopolies can strengthen its position at the taxpayers' expense and new ones will be set for the sights still higher.</seg>
<seg id=1719> I am pleased that our Liberal Party support from other European countries, the position of the British Liberal.</seg>
<seg id=1720> I believe that the liberalization of desirable and welcome the advantages for consumers will derive from it.</seg>
<seg id=1721> The right, because it is part of the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union, through the completion of the internal market, the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id=1722> The provision of such a service is the cornerstone of Community policy in this field, and all our activities are focused on improving this service.</seg>
<seg id=1723> The special services are a further important area in the modernisation and innovation must be speeded up.</seg>
<seg id=1724> He went on to say that the opening up of virtually the entire postal market by the end of this decade is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=1725> I propose that the obligation to provide a universal service is irreversible and guarantees in the future.</seg>
<seg id=1726> For this reason, I cannot and do not wish to stand idly by when the future of this sector is at stake, because we do not fulfil the tasks that have been entrusted to us all in Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id=1727> Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.</seg>
<seg id=1728> I would remind you, however, that the main objective of this common organisation of the market to ensure their products guaranteed access to the Community market.</seg>
<seg id=1729> I am pleased that we were able to achieve unanimity in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Fernández Martín, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation for their support.</seg>
<seg id=1730> For example, we must also continue to express our concern about the banana production in certain ACP countries, the small countries in the West Indies and in some countries, which are traditional suppliers in the banana market and to whom we have obligations, we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id=1731> I would therefore ask that this report will be supported in its entirety, as well as in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, of the Members of this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1732> The historical reference periods of the United States were rejected, in the meantime, a solution, with its own historical referenzzeiträumen.</seg>
<seg id=1733> Strong interests, especially those of the Americans, who are not themselves, but the banana growers have invested capital in the American businesses, play a role.</seg>
<seg id=1734> Sometimes, it seems as if the Commission is still on the proposals for the deregulation of the market and of agricultural production on an international scale even further away than the Cairns Group.</seg>
<seg id=1735> Unfortunately, the Commission and the Council on a solution which would seriously jeopardise this production insistence, especially after 2006.</seg>
<seg id=1736> In the various WTO, it does not mean that we must not allow our traditional suppliers preferences.</seg>
<seg id=1737> The transitional period should therefore be fifteen years at least ten years. But must also include a compensatory income support for the producers and the distribution of production in the outermost regions, which therefore help to the institutions of the market in bananas.</seg>
<seg id=1738> I hope that it is now our arguments, because the system proposed by the Commission of the tariff preferences, even if it is set at EUR 300, is in reality a rather ineffective, as the ACP producers to be served by the so-called slowed down.</seg>
<seg id=1739> Votes</seg>
<seg id=1740> (Parliament approved the Commission proposal)</seg>
<seg id=1741> The Commission cannot accept the other amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1742> Before the vote:</seg>
<seg id=1743> (Parliament accepted the oral amendment)</seg>
<seg id=1744> Report (A5-0383 / 2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the reform of the budgetary control and -instanzen (2000 / 2008 (INI))</seg>
<seg id=1745> Most smokers are neither on the full risk on the consequences of their activities.</seg>
<seg id=1746> I have in my long parliamentary life 35 years from now.</seg>
<seg id=1747> However, I fear that these hopes in vain.</seg>
<seg id=1748> This is our last attempt, by means of labels and the photographs on cigarette packets to demonstrate the real consequences of smoking.</seg>
<seg id=1749> Lehne report (A5-0368 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1750> This is a view that I believe is relevant and correct. I therefore voted against the report in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id=1751> The Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market, is absolutely right when he insists on the rejection of the ceiling on a minimum amount, and should not be less than 7%.</seg>
<seg id=1752> With your vote against this directive, my group would also like to give a political marker down in so far as we in the European Union must not stop to impose unnecessary rules.</seg>
<seg id=1753> Of course, the former Stalinist dictatorship must be condemned, but how can we listen to Mr Putin, even the slightest confidence, the deaths of the Chechen people, the godparents of various mafias, the Head of State, who would like to any opposition and civil society, political parties (trade unions), in order to strengthen its own power?</seg>
<seg id=1754> In Indonesia would not have such an intensification of relations, particularly in the last few years, the authorities of that country have marked by a high degree of democracy or to a great deal of credit, but we also need the Indonesian citizens, which is why we welcome the intensification of relations and this aid.</seg>
<seg id=1755> This unity must only deal with crimes committed by Community pupils poses a problem.</seg>
<seg id=1756> . (FR) the Theato report on the fight against fraud will allow us to say that the European Central Bank, the famous certainly better proof of its independence, the agreement on the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) is not considered appropriate.</seg>
<seg id=1757> That concludes the vote.</seg>
<seg id=1758> We must realise that there are only two options: either we are part of this, or we do not.</seg>
<seg id=1759> Ladies and gentlemen, please let us know no reason for a change of name.</seg>
<seg id=1760> The mere tariff system is an important element, which provides for the balance of the Commission's proposal and it is an important basis for this, so that we can make any progress at all in the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1761> Measures for the marketing of these bananas also find in the national and regional programmes promoting the development of rural areas.</seg>
<seg id=1762> Europe and the United States work together in defence of our common values.</seg>
<seg id=1763> We are going to talk about a new WTO round and the effects of the many new bilateral trade initiatives in this round, which is currently being discussed in the American cities.</seg>
<seg id=1764> He pointed out that the transatlantic relations have been increased in the last ten years, and this is on the American side, above all thanks to the efforts of President Clinton. I think, however, that will be recorded in the history books one day that Europe has also done to these new relations with the 1990 Transatlantic Declaration and the transatlantic agenda under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995, which was an important contribution to the success of this crucial relations.</seg>
<seg id=1765> Therefore, it will be important to set a new course, and indeed to write a transatlantic agenda for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1766> I should like to quote the words of representatives of the Dominican Republic: "the WTO was an impartial arbitration service, which will ensure that the rules are complied with and that the countries can make the free world trade.</seg>
<seg id=1767> Secondly, we can be pleased about the collapse of the Communist sham, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union is only a single superpower, the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1768> I know that he is a successful and very constructive dialogue with Parliament and the committees involved in these issues.</seg>
<seg id=1769> The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:</seg>
<seg id=1770> The main objective of these objectives, and the secondary objectives, will be the test must be judged by the specific proposals put forward by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1771> As you know, such a solution - in a country with only could lead to the provision of services in the European Union as a whole - an avalanche in those countries with lower taxation.</seg>
<seg id=1772> The standard rate is not allowed to fall below 15%, but the Member States would be given the right to apply one or several minimum rates of no less than 5%, and in this case we have now proposed derogations.</seg>
<seg id=1773> We called on the European Commission to monitor, in order to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and that the Council and Parliament will be informed.</seg>
<seg id=1774> In short, the aim of this proposal is correct, but the method is wrong and has been drawn up, if we really want to support the European economy, it would be a VAT exemption of our own e-unternehmen and not attempt to our problems with others, to give the right signal.</seg>
<seg id=1775> In order to be able to meet the demands for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, we need to take all possible measures to limit.</seg>
<seg id=1776> The only case where a tax, which is yet to be supplied from a third country in the European Community.</seg>
<seg id=1777> Positive discrimination of air transport must be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id=1778> Companies from third countries, on the other hand, will not be taxed.</seg>
<seg id=1779> CDs are not very old-fashioned, but should be taxed, while available on the Internet programmes should be exempted from tax.</seg>
<seg id=1780> However, the solution proposed is not technically feasible and as a barrier to the development of the internet-transaktionen praying for in the European Union, even though all the expansion.</seg>
<seg id=1781> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the Union will lose toothless and concentration.</seg>
<seg id=1782> We should consider how we can promote the e-commerce directive, and not to new methods, how can we impose it.</seg>
<seg id=1783> The Liberals support the principle of 'state' as little as possible, while the United States are mentioned as an example.</seg>
<seg id=1784> The Primarolo group has drawn up simple rules, which must be implemented.</seg>
<seg id=1785> As my objection is in this Parliament's Group of the view that the fact that should be corrected, normally the reduced rates of VAT on newspapers, while reducing the digital newspapers cannot be applied.</seg>
<seg id=1786> A tax on kerosene there can therefore only in international consensus to guarantee competition.</seg>
<seg id=1787> In particular, I welcome the fact that the report has one of the most important underpinned by me in my report for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, was taken in this Parliament a few months ago, we, as long as it is, without doubt, politically, to an international agreement on the taxation of aviation fuel, at least in the short term to alternative instruments to achieve the same effect, including a emissionsabgabe.</seg>
<seg id=1788> Indeed, the industry to 100% by flugsicherungsabgaben and on their infrastructure charges for 1998, which amounted to USD 4 billion - in contrast to other modes of transport, such as rail and road transport, which continues to be subsidised.</seg>
<seg id=1789> The current situation is.</seg>
<seg id=1790> In this context, it has to be said, unfortunately, that there is a problem with the emissions from aviation, if that is not the case, but it is growing in percentage terms, and that is why we should not talk down.</seg>
<seg id=1791> This plan will be for the development of SMEs within and outside the Union, especially in view of the proposed reduction in the limit for an exemption from the tax on a low level of an annual turnover of 40 000.</seg>
<seg id=1792> If we are to beflissen in the issue under discussion, we risk jeopardizing the future of electronic commerce is important for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1793> The starting point for a service providers of services is based in a third country, which provides for a customer in the Community, only to register a single unit does not lead to a shift from tax revenues between the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1794> Since the debate in the Council is still in progress, and in light of the desire of the Commission to bring the issue of VAT and electronic commerce in the short term to a successful conclusion, it seems to me that, at the moment, it is best to accept Parliament 's amendments not formally but, as far as possible, to try to get it through in the discussions in the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1795> That is why I cannot accept the proposed amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1796> Thank you very much for having accepted this week in all these different issues.</seg>
<seg id=1797> For its part, the Commission is only three months after the accident and its responsibility, a first package of measures, which was approved by the European Parliament on 30 November.</seg>
<seg id=1798> It is, in fact, more than 15 existing directives or regulations urgently necessary to standardize the practices and greater control of the application of the Community rules, in order to prevent the unacceptable and, if necessary, substantial differences in the field of maritime safety in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1799> Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs de Palacio for her long-term commitment in the area of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1800> I would like to remind you that the ladies and gentlemen in the air safety in Europe and the United States in the field of the compensation, not with the sums used in other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1801> Secondly, I would like to say to you that it is the French courts, which would have the possibility to confiscate the resources of a particular company or freeze, to pay compensation for damages, or else could establish a liability, which goes beyond the amount which is in accordance with the criteria of the current international system on pollution by hydrocarbons.</seg>
<seg id=1802> The Commission is of the opinion that these are steps in the right direction and to create a fairer abgabensysteme incentives for a more rational and more efficient use of the road network.</seg>
<seg id=1803> In the light of the criticism, especially from Ireland and France, it came to this amendment, and now the matter by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer obtains a completely new phrase: it is now presented as a consumer levy for all, and therefore also for British lorry drivers.</seg>
<seg id=1804> I am obliged to ensure that the food available to consumers, whether they come from the European Union or from outside the highest demands.</seg>
<seg id=1805> I do of course understand the concern of the honourable Member.</seg>
<seg id=1806> Commissioner, I must say that your answer is not enough.</seg>
<seg id=1807> The point raised by the honourable Member is very important.</seg>
<seg id=1808> In Nigeria Chevron is accused of the Community, the ijaw inciting violence against people and even pays, Nigerian soldiers to bomb the naval base warri demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id=1809> In her report, which was adopted on 15 November the Commission came to the conclusion that no solution to the problem of the Korean preispraktiken in operating aid in accordance with the Regulation 1540 / 98.</seg>
<seg id=1810> I believe that the intentions in its entirety is very reassuring that the reality is that close our shipyards.</seg>
<seg id=1811> Question No 38 by (H-0868 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1812> Commissioner, I can understand that you do not want to change its decision, although ten Member States oppose this.</seg>
<seg id=1813> This initiative is based on a Council regulation amending Regulation, which lays down the current GSP.</seg>
<seg id=1814> I represent several sugar beet farmers and am very concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1815> This work will take place in committee, it had to be this week on a balkanreise Poul Nielson.</seg>
<seg id=1816> We are working on the safeguard clause, and if Mr Clegg needs arguments for dialogue with its sugar beet farmers, it can at any time to me.</seg>
<seg id=1817> I would like to thank Mr Liikanen, for an absolutely excellent and very positive answer.</seg>
<seg id=1818> I will raise this issue with my staff, the issue is clear as soon as the budget for next year.</seg>
<seg id=1819> My services and I are now trying to limit the geographical distance between the parties involved and the future Court thereof.</seg>
<seg id=1820> Just as much as the courts in Düsseldorf, Munich and elsewhere have specialised in Germany to patent law, and there is also such a specialised Court in London - should have a court of the Community, which is meeting and decide on the Community patent cases, be very specialised.</seg>
<seg id=1821> In order to prevent such a provisional situation cannot continue, the Commission reminded us, in a letter dated 13 July last year, the Member States of their duty to appoint national Community trade mark courts.</seg>
<seg id=1822> As the honourable Member knows, the lodging a complaint has no impact on the progress of the project.</seg>
<seg id=1823> Question No 47 by (H-0877 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1824> The Commission is therefore of the legal means at its disposal to make only in the terms laid down in the regulation.</seg>
<seg id=1825> The question is, though, to whom the students are to be able to make sure that this course, students in Britain and the recognition of their right to studienergebnisse.</seg>
<seg id=1826> The temporary King, for example, one of the verdienstvollsten Finnish Members of Parliament could be chosen.</seg>
<seg id=1827> It can also be seen as a question of competition, as in the southern Baltic Sea, in Helsinki, Stockholm - is the tax-free-verkauf, whereas it is between Umeå and Vasa banned.</seg>
<seg id=1828> We must rectify this situation is through the promotion and support of multilingual content, because this is fundamental to the success of the European inhaltsindustrie is absolutely crucial.</seg>
<seg id=1829> I am thinking, above all, to the problem of small investors do not always provide sufficient guarantees and a sound business development.</seg>
<seg id=1830> In order to bring the European econtent-programms this ambitious project to a successful conclusion, the procedures must be simplified and protected.</seg>
<seg id=1831> That is why it must be the aim of the public support for the Community inhaltsindustrie to achieve a high level of education and cultural diversity.</seg>
<seg id=1832> On the other hand, there are the networks, which are dependent on the content to fill their virtual again. They take it for granted to submit to this content to buy and use them without special account of the produktionsregeln.</seg>
<seg id=1833> Mr President, I welcome this e-content programme and I would like to draw your attention to two aspects.</seg>
<seg id=1834> I therefore support the amendments calling for the implementation of specific measures in the field of new technologies.</seg>
<seg id=1835> Firstly, the social and cultural function of digital content, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament stresses the social and cultural aspect of digital content.</seg>
<seg id=1836> Assessment and management of environmental noise</seg>
<seg id=1837> In fact, I am grateful that the Christian Democrats, and a part of the Liberal Group have supported this a specific amendment to limit the aircraft noise is already.</seg>
<seg id=1838> Only now, six years later, and equally to urge the French Government, the Commission presented its proposal for European harmonised noise indicators.</seg>
<seg id=1839> This is a modest proposal. In the Scandinavian countries already apply stricter standards than are proposed for the year 2012.</seg>
<seg id=1840> Orly, shiphol, Barcelona and other airports are already strict standards.</seg>
<seg id=1841> Another important point, which has been tabled by us and in connection with the problem of noise, it is essential that, in addition to the noise indicators mentioned by the rapporteur still be additional noise indicators.</seg>
<seg id=1842> Since there are no common standards in the European Union, there has been a clear distortion of competition between airports and the ungleichbehandelung of citizens of different Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1843> That is why the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange, in my view, are so important.</seg>
<seg id=1844> Mr President, first of all, I must say that I welcome this report.</seg>
<seg id=1845> That was in principle the idea of Amendment No 36, even though I believe that this idea is not carried out.</seg>
<seg id=1846> We should consider very carefully and then at both levels combined approach, limit values for the various sources and, on the other hand, quality standards for emissions.</seg>
<seg id=1847> We need more time, and I regret that we did not have that, although I support the framework directive in general.</seg>
<seg id=1848> As soon as the Member States have submitted comparable information will advise the Commission on the question of gemeinschaftsgrenzwerte and other measures in order to reduce the noise, and will report to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1849> Food additives other than colours and sweeteners</seg>
<seg id=1850> These are the three criteria.</seg>
<seg id=1851> Thank you very much, Mr Hallam. I am similar: they have a dry and I have to say, in a frosch as we have with us, but a little with the flu.</seg>
<seg id=1852> Chronic nutritional problems, increase the risk of cancer.</seg>
<seg id=1853> At that time, was that the Commission did not have the right tools to take appropriate measures.</seg>
<seg id=1854> Tomorrow, the next stage of the plan. It is Mrs Marit Paulsen from the ELDR Group has put in place and the possibility of the directive still further.</seg>
<seg id=1855> The Member States and the Commission is now a better instrument available to ensure that the rules are properly implemented and feed emergencies occur in third countries is a rapid response.</seg>
<seg id=1856> We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities, and until now, these issues have been dealt with in particular.</seg>
<seg id=1857> The planning process must be honest and innovative.</seg>
<seg id=1858> The multiannual programme (2000-2004) for sustainable urban development is an appropriate instrument, and the implementation of Agenda 21 constitutes an excellent means of coordination and implementation of actions.</seg>
<seg id=1859> Less transport and the withdrawal from fossil fuels to local level are essential if we are to achieve a change in the current warming.</seg>
<seg id=1860> Many have said that the budget is too small.</seg>
<seg id=1861> Key partner in this framework should be but the Commission and the networks of the local authorities, which are in the formulation and implementation of actions in the field of sustainable urban development legally responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1862> The Court of Justice of the European Communities, and even the streitbeilegungsgremien of the WTO are of the opinion that the precautionary principle in the field of the environment, or in the field of public health can be applied, there is even the Europeans, as the current procedure for rohmilchkäse.</seg>
<seg id=1863> Do not damage or compensation must be the primary objective must be to prevent damage to the health of people and property.</seg>
<seg id=1864> After all, in 1996, the European Parliament, in accordance with the precautionary principle, a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in the whole of the European Union, but we have only...</seg>
<seg id=1865> Absolute scientific certainty on new substances and products does not exist, and it never will be.</seg>
<seg id=1866> If the precautionary principle is to be applied effectively and credibly, after all, it is important to involve all the main players, including representatives of civil society in the political decisions that are taken in the context of the application of the principle.</seg>
<seg id=1867> And, finally, the public health and the environment in other considerations, especially economic, the priority.</seg>
<seg id=1868> The basic precondition for the use of the precautionary principle is that the fear that it could have damaging consequences, is scientifically justified.</seg>
<seg id=1869> Only yesterday, an American professor George Carlo, instructed the Food and Drugs Administration over the last seven years, with a study on the effects of radiation on human health, in Lisbon, there is the risk that the use of mobile phones, hirntumoren increases the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and hautschäden.</seg>
<seg id=1870> Mr President, the environment and public health are a complicated machine with many roles we monitor and control in order to be able to intervene so that there is no harm is done.</seg>
<seg id=1871> In the implementation of this principle that the innovation and the activities are restricted to show restraint and paralysis in the industry and that competition must be prevented from being circumvented in any case.</seg>
<seg id=1872> The House will be aware that the Commission agrees with most of the issues raised in your motion for a resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1873> The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=1874> In Article 2 is the right to life, and when the terrorism in Spain, the whole of the European Union is being violated in one of its fundamental principles.</seg>
<seg id=1875> We want the legal institutions created not replace, but they are, to protect our rights and our freedoms, without the terror.</seg>
<seg id=1876> Votes</seg>
<seg id=1877> You reminded us of the comments of the Council on the classification of budget lines on the vorruhestandsprojekts with the Commission and the administrative expenditure in connection with the fisheries agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1878> (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1879> I believe that this is no longer acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1880> These 23 428 authorisations will be regarded as too little, welcome the possibilities offered them.</seg>
<seg id=1881> To this end, which was, in the middle of last year - as we predicted, led to a dramatic slowing down the approval of the projects and the implementation of payments. As a result, the annual implementation of commitments was this fund at the end of June 2000, a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id=1882> This text is an ideal for a practical closure of the secretariat of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id=1883> Before I left they said to me: "Christmas is just around the corner and we in the Bergamo celebrate Christmas and the festival of St Lucia.</seg>
<seg id=1884> Our vehement criticism is also opposed to overproduction of agricultural products and, on the other hand, that the EU is information in order to sell this surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1885> Mr President, I voted for the García-Margallo y Marfil report on the equal treatment of erbrachter services electronically.</seg>
<seg id=1886> Mr President, I shall try to create before 2004, with some remarks about Malta.</seg>
<seg id=1887> I would, however, like to say with some ceremony that this was the best of what I can accept in a Europe that is too liberal in my view.</seg>
<seg id=1888> A timetable would encourage the development of postal services, and to modernise their services and facilitate the planning and investment.</seg>
<seg id=1889> They will continue to exert pressure. With the money they deserve in the service of the above if they strengthen its position.</seg>
<seg id=1890> The liberalisation of the postal services in the form proposed by the Commission is neither appropriate nor. That is why I voted in favour of the report and all the amendments put forward in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1891> De Roo report (A5-0378 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1892> We chose to vote against Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31 our reservations, because we are not convinced that they are compatible with the rules of the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1893> On globalisation, which is the most basic human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1894> This would be contrary to respect for the national identity (Article 6 (3) of the Treaty on European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1895> It is worth emphasising that the linguistic minorities have not been crushed by the globalisation of the Internet, but have found new possibilities of cultural and economic openness.</seg>
<seg id=1896> Mr President, in the absence of other results has exposed the haggling in Nice at least the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1897> The underlying tenor of the joint motion for a resolution in this respect is much too one-sided.</seg>
<seg id=1898> The delay in the publication of the written conclusions, which are now four days' - not yet officially illustrates how difficult it is to bring decisions taken in a general confusion, clear.</seg>
<seg id=1899> The only way to avoid conflicts to be dangerous for the future, in the traditional concept that Europe is based on mutual respect for national communities.</seg>
<seg id=1900> The Nice Summit has gone through an agreement on Sunday, producing a draft Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1901> The motion for a resolution to be put to the vote today reflects that Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1902> Finally, a comment on social policy in its Presidency, France wanted to the idea. It is now, in addition to the fine declarations of intent and vague in terms of content, the documents, in view of the problems and of the great dissatisfaction, as it was also expressed by the workers in Nice, are totally inadequate, among a handful of detail.</seg>
<seg id=1903> The really important issues such as taxation, taxation, social policy, asylum and immigration, has remained the same.</seg>
<seg id=1904> Impressive in the debate on Nice, the idea that the Treaty has neither a father, mother, he is no one's children. In the French Presidency has, rather than to the results of the Intergovernmental Conference and the reasons for this.</seg>
<seg id=1905> On the contrary, the influence of national democracies, because the right of veto is further restrictions and the European Parliament more power.</seg>
<seg id=1906> It would have been agreed in the year I was born in mind, therefore, the conclusion of the agreement in Chicago these effects, probably at the time, aviation fuel and other flugzeugbedarf exempted from taxation.</seg>
<seg id=1907> There is no such thing as zero risk, the scientists, or at least the politicians have to apply the criterion of proportionality, unknown risks and consider to be their responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=1908> This Parliament has fought, and also to ensure that this reduction in the resources available to the innovative measures would be compensated for by using the flexibilisierungsrahmens, in a statement on the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1909> In this important area must play a part in this, because it is a global market in which we can move, the new ideas, that they are properly financed, realistic - which will ensure that we in Europe our place at the head of the technical development in the new industries and, in particular, in the communication technology.</seg>
<seg id=1910> On the question of the budget already serious words have been said in the previous speech: EUR 400 million are in fact only a minimum funding and, in the second half of the opportunities offered by the flexibility instrument must additional funding can be used, as has been described in the report.</seg>
<seg id=1911> I think it important, as the report does not automatically go hand in hand with the loss of European added value.</seg>
<seg id=1912> As we all know, unemployment in the European Union is the highest in the economically and technologically less developed regions, especially in the Objective 1 regions. The innovative measures must not only technology, but also of the strong will to promote economic and employment.</seg>
<seg id=1913> Now, when I go back to my own region, eastern England, so that not a single authority in the last period has used this money, then I have my doubts as to whether we have been as effective as we need to be in the future, so that we can welcome new communities.</seg>
<seg id=1914> Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Helmuth Markov for his constructive and very detailed presentation of the draft communication on the innovative measures of the ERDF for the period 2000-2006, and to express my appreciation to him.</seg>
<seg id=1915> The energy efficiency and environmental aspects in these guidelines have their place. They can be the cause of innovative actions to the third issue, which concerns the regional development and sustainable development.</seg>
<seg id=1916> We would, however, that these projects are selected at regional level, as Mr Berend nous has understood very well in his speech.</seg>
<seg id=1917> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1918> That is why we are asking for in this report and in the three amendments which have been tabled, the Commission is stepping up its efforts to achieve an international before the WTO dispute settlement procedure.</seg>
<seg id=1919> It seems to me that the Commissioner responsible of the sector must show that it is doing everything it can to address the external threat to our industry.</seg>
<seg id=1920> Lastly, we expect that the schiffbau-übereinkommen is being discussed at the meeting of the Group of the OECD 6 on 18 December.</seg>
<seg id=1921> It is, however, as the final spurt will always put back a little, so that we never reach the finishing line.</seg>
<seg id=1922> As you all know, the opening of the procedure for six months.</seg>
<seg id=1923> As for the large groups for their political lawyers that the state and its finances are entirely at your disposal means the demand for less State.</seg>
<seg id=1924> To this end, precisely so that the shipbuilding industry and the jobs and the sector can be consolidated by the families, safety, on 31 December 2000 aid is needed, because the market is characterised not by equal opportunities, but by dumping and unfair competition.</seg>
<seg id=1925> Improving the competitiveness of the EU shipyards will be promoted by the Commission, but given the massive make undercutting can be achieved by the Korean shipyards productivity growth is not enough.</seg>
<seg id=1926> The Council stressed that this support should not distort competition within the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1927> The presence of the waters of the nuclear submarine involved in the Bay of Algeciras has now unfortunately at a diplomatic and military nuclear conflict between a Member State and a second category, as the last classification of Nice is not calling for their rights and childish statements.</seg>
<seg id=1928> As the severity of the disease by the medical report, which was mentioned in the country of the owner - which, by the British press - no transfer to another, but a modification of the classification of hospital.</seg>
<seg id=1929> Of course, we await with interest the response from the Commission in order to determine whether the objective has been achieved.</seg>
<seg id=1930> Mr President, I too would like to express to the beginning of the families of the murdered councillor and the members of the Group of the European People's Party and my condolences to my horror at the fascist barbarity of ETA and their accomplices.</seg>
<seg id=1931> I also believe that it is advisable to the submarine Tireless as soon as possible, as soon as the climatic conditions, to the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id=1932> Honourable Members have asked whether the Commission is of the opinion that the Directive 89 / 618 / Euratom on informing the population of a radiological emergency and Directive 96 / 29 / Euratom laying down basic safety standards with regard to this submarine applicable, and what steps have been taken.</seg>
<seg id=1933> We are not in the usual answer was entitled to make this publicly, though we can say, more generally, what it says.</seg>
<seg id=1934> There is one aspect of the Euratom Treaty, which is the transport of waste contamination between the Member States of the European Union. Gibraltar is now but of the United Kingdom, and contaminated waste would be transported from one part of the United Kingdom in another part of the country, without involving any one Member State of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1935> Spain needs only to win the confidence of the people in the rock.</seg>
<seg id=1936> Here we have a Member State, which is, of course, with the public in another Member State, as it did with any other country in the world, as if there were 50 years after the start of the European integration societatis no affectio, as if the European solidarity would not have made any progress.</seg>
<seg id=1937> Indeed, a German operierte submarine in British waters at a certain moment as one.</seg>
<seg id=1938> There is going to be debated, but the citizens are aware of their attention intuitively or to the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1939> As a result of the cuts that have been made by the Labour Government in the defence budget, less money is the purchase of new military equipment available, so that in future is to be strengthened in cases where defects technology must be made for necessary repairs.</seg>
<seg id=1940> The competence of the Community, perhaps even some very, very different wishes extends, however, neither on the classification of ports to carry out repairs submarines in the issues of technical safety of reactors or demands that must be brought to a submarine elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id=1941> In order to be able to help them better still, we should call on the European institutions to increase the financial, human and material resources of the UNHCR.</seg>
<seg id=1942> I call on the Commission to increase the funding required for the UNHCR and the NGOs in all its agreement with the UNHCR as coordinating body.</seg>
<seg id=1943> It must therefore have access to the civilian casualties, and his team, on the ground, must be secure and have the necessary resources to fulfil its mission.</seg>
<seg id=1944> On 22 November the Commission adopted a communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status valid throughout the Union for the granting of asylum seekers, which is laid down in Tampere, the ultimate objective of the common European asylum system.</seg>
<seg id=1945> Finally, I should like to express my appreciation bezeigen for all the work that has been done by Mrs Ogata for the UNHCR, Mr Ruud Lubbers, and wish him every success in his new position.</seg>
<seg id=1946> We think it is important to encourage this return to a political amnesty in Yugoslavia, but also essential to Western powers have also brought in which responsibility is, in our view, that we condemn the attacks and the renewed terrorist activities on the borders between Serbia and Kosovo, Albania in all clarity, because in this way in the incidents during the Kosovo conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1947> In paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of our compromise resolution contain clear demands.</seg>
<seg id=1948> I appeal to the President Kostunica to clarify what has happened with people like Mr Ukshin Hoti, whose fate we have discussed here on many occasions, and whose fate we know nothing.</seg>
<seg id=1949> I also agree with the appeal to the KFOR, to prevent further attacks in the Presevo Valley.</seg>
<seg id=1950> I welcome the steps taken by KFOR to deal with the problem and continue to call on all sides to show restraint.</seg>
<seg id=1951> B5-0916 / 2000 by Mr Barón Crespo and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1952> This clause was adopted in March 1990. Moneda-palast I know, because I had the privilege, on the appointment of the President Aylwin after the referendum, which the regime of General Pinochet, to be present.</seg>
<seg id=1953> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something about the resolution that we will vote for it.</seg>
<seg id=1954> The international community must have the right to exercise democratic control, not as interference in the internal affairs of an independent country, but as a political, sensible and preventive action.</seg>
<seg id=1955> The situation in the prisons and the police stations, where, among other things, abuse and torture are commonplace, is completely unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1956> It is precisely because of the protests in Western Europe, and the Minister hikmet Sami Turk has postponed the transfer, so that a social and political consensus in the whole of Turkey to be drawn up on a contains prison reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1957> The matter is urgent, and that is why we have decided to include this item on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1958> It should be made on 8 January of next year. It accuses him to have taken part in a Tunisian Assembly of opposition in France, which he denies.</seg>
<seg id=1959> If the Members and officials of these organisations are to hold on the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a meeting their homes are surrounded by the police, and on the streets, who is being attacked by men.</seg>
<seg id=1960> The second case is only part of a network of harassment.</seg>
<seg id=1961> My group, like this Parliament, is following the human rights situation in Tunisia and the rest of the world, with particular attention.</seg>
<seg id=1962> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us please moderate.</seg>
<seg id=1963> The negotiations were extremely well, and I am very pleased that we make progress here and I hope that the outcome of the discussions to which the honourable Member refers.</seg>
<seg id=1964> Several Members referred to the situation of the prisoners in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1965> B5-0912 / 2000 by Mr Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1966> We should, I believe, are in this position.</seg>
<seg id=1967> In this context, the power of the military, as always, contributing to aggravate the situation.</seg>
<seg id=1968> This attitude is part of the continuity of the policy of French imperialism.</seg>
<seg id=1969> The Commission is also very concerned about the recent violence.</seg>
<seg id=1970> The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1971> Unfair competition can destroy a good schiffbauklima lead to the loss of jobs and know-how and create a monopoly situation in the long term, which is the world trade.</seg>
<seg id=1972> Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg id=1973> That is why I would like to thank all the Members for their cooperation, and also to the amendments, the Committee of Experts, which has contributed significantly to the motion for a resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1974> On the adoption of the social agenda by the European Council in Nice we are delighted, and we hope that the Member States will use this opportunity to develop and gesundheitsfürsorgesysteme social security for the elderly and coordinate them better, but at the same time to take other measures to ensure their reintegration into the active life, such as lifelong learning.</seg>
<seg id=1975> The promotion of lifelong learning, an issue that has been mentioned in the debate, which I support.</seg>
<seg id=1976> People aged 60 or 70 years can of course do many useful things, but it is not right to link their incomes in this age of the work he has done.</seg>
<seg id=1977> The European Central Bank has its monthly report warned in July 2000.</seg>
<seg id=1978> I believe that the Member States can the problem with the aid of the legislative instruments more effectively.</seg>
<seg id=1979> Thanks to your proposals for an active life in society is also a whole generation.</seg>
<seg id=1980> The promises must be complied with, but the pensions are with the resources to ensure that these countries without payment must be guaranteed at the expense of the common monetary policy of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1981> We have seen the greatest social revolution in the last 150 years, 100 until the age of us has doubled.</seg>
<seg id=1982> It is only the accounting, the extension of the life has been made possible by the medical progress, a sense.</seg>
<seg id=1983> They pay - was involved in society as a whole, then, older workers from resigned, but young workers have not been removed, and there have been many positions.</seg>
<seg id=1984> The family and the fiscal policy should instead, men and women, the family, free to decide whether they want to be worked or not.</seg>
<seg id=1985> My brother and I have worked on it.</seg>
<seg id=1986> Future initiatives in the field of public health are more on health and pflegefragen in old age, and on the promotion of healthy ageing.</seg>
<seg id=1987> 2 and Amendment No 3, which calls for a change to the text and the use of the term "demographic development" instead of "" calls on the ageing of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1988> It is not to be overlap with the advertising and marketing authorisation and the authorities. The emphasis is placed on EU issues.</seg>
<seg id=1989> Mr President, the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal of the Commission are fundamentally positive.</seg>
<seg id=1990> That is why it is very important to find a balance in this area, and which can be developed by the absatzförderungs- and promotion.</seg>
<seg id=1991> I believe that marketing and sales in the training, lifelong learning should be brought more to the fore because the handling of new technologies, the promotion of a modern logistics entirely new opportunities.</seg>
<seg id=1992> First of all I should like to congratulate Mr Dary, on his excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=1993> My next point is that, when we talk of exports and intervention.</seg>
<seg id=1994> It must not sonderzahlungen not provided for nachgefragte products and no publicity campaigns to be carried out.</seg>
<seg id=1995> Everyone has adequate food, and if we campaign for a product that is, of course, against the consumption of another product.</seg>
<seg id=1996> Amendments Nos 18 and 24 from the first part of the frequency, in which the vorschlagsfähigen issues and products will be reviewed from three years to two years, in order to improve the efficiency of the förderungsinstruments.</seg>
<seg id=1997> In the Greek version Mrs Jutta Haug listed as rapporteur, as a man and as the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, as Mrs.</seg>
<seg id=1998> We can see here, as well as with small changes in practice large effects can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id=1999> It is the last Friday in Strasbourg, in other words 12 days Strasbourg cease presence of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=2000> Finally, I would like to say to all, especially the few who found it worth the effort, this Friday, during the last session in Strasbourg, in the year 2000 to be present, wish you all a Merry Christmas and a happy new year, but, above all, wise.</seg>
