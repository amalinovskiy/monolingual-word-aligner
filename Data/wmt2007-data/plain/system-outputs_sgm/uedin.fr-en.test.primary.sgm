<seg id=1> Our declaration of rights is the first that way this millennium.</seg>
<seg id=2> Let us organise ourselves in fifteen in order to be able to welcome in the countries that are knocking at our door.</seg>
<seg id=3> The area of basic public services of social interest, cultural and charitable must be included in Article 87 so that these important institutions can enjoy a sustainable protection.</seg>
<seg id=4> Some are of the opinion that we can create an internal market in Europe without agreeing on values and fundamental principles.</seg>
<seg id=5> I would like to welcome, in turn, strong and substantial intervention of President Prodi.</seg>
<seg id=6> You know that this is a deliberate choice that was made in Amsterdam, to make a clear distinction between the two functions. The High Representative, unlike the Commission, does not independently, but it has to coordinate the common foreign and security policies which are the responsibility of the Member States and we must allow perhaps broad scope for the intergovernmental.</seg>
<seg id=7> He wanted the Presidency trace in Nice the path for the future.</seg>
<seg id=8> We can indeed want more and better, but quite honestly that I believe this is a good start.</seg>
<seg id=9> I therefore hope that the Nice European Council will adopt it this project and will decide the start specifically as a project and not as a fait accompli after having clearly adopted the necessary reforms.</seg>
<seg id=10> However, I have also made it clear that in the current situation, we could achieve the objectives very important by the Community approach, such as more effective action in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg id=11> It is only by linking Russia to the West and the European Union that we can have an influence on its policy and maintain contact and dialogue with it.</seg>
<seg id=12> Motion for a resolution (B5-0767 / 00) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=13> Now it is pursuing this genocide and tries, in addition to destroy freedom of the press and the rule of law that exist only in that country.</seg>
<seg id=14> To try to meet the expectations of this a pensioner, who is Giuseppe Italia, and would like to live in crémone surf the Padania, I voted in favour of the Piecyk report on the development of seaports, inland ports and intermodal nodes.</seg>
<seg id=15> The outcome of the vote of this House forbidden to achieve the objective of the directive, yet accepted and approved by all the speakers and the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=16> Mr President, I voted in favour of the Skinner report, as I said during the debate, before the vote, because I believe that the capital is important.</seg>
<seg id=17> My party colleague Armonie Bordes stressed yesterday in harsh terms that only a minority benefits the commitment of Community funds and contributions to the pension fund for the entrepreneurial risk.</seg>
<seg id=18> Consequently, the Charter will be devoting the current practices, including backward-looking, of national States that represent progress.</seg>
<seg id=19> Mr President, at last we have a Charter of the rights of European citizens whose entire an article, Article 25, is dedicated to elderly.</seg>
<seg id=20> This text may seem painless initially, since it covers all the existing rights. But if it were incorporated in the Treaty with binding force, as the European Parliament demands, it would automatically, in time, to the standardisation of national rights in Europe; it would give a disproportionate to the Court of Justice; it would enhance centralisation around the European institutions; it would limit the scope for independent decision-making of each nation.</seg>
<seg id=21> · we must not overload the Charter with detailed regulations and leave in secondary law.</seg>
<seg id=22> I shall vote for another Charter by participating in the demonstrations in Biarritz on 13 and 14 October and Nice on 7 December 2000.</seg>
<seg id=23> Progress of the 12 candidate countries</seg>
<seg id=24> I believe that a number of Member States have not yet grasped the existence of this link to date and have not understood that a hesitant progress of the Intergovernmental Conference could ask ourselves enormous difficulties in order to impose enlargement in the timeframes needed.</seg>
<seg id=25> We cannot impose, eventually, everything I have mentioned so far that if the political world and the elite of the candidate countries and the European Union - and, in this respect, I agree with you, Commissioner – are finally realize that enlargement of the European Union chose to it.</seg>
<seg id=26> This is the formula adopted.</seg>
<seg id=27> Let me turn to the second direction to move that the presidency during this term of the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=28> What I propose, therefore, is to work in this direction with the idea that we will have to examine, with the prospect of 2003, what are the candidates who are ready to join us on that date.</seg>
<seg id=29> I thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his clear and comprehensive report.</seg>
<seg id=30> The subject of negotiations is not the "if": it is a question of the 'how' and the 'when'.</seg>
<seg id=31> But they have also been because the prospect of membership of the European Union is hope the solidarity of European peoples and provides a solid political and economic support.</seg>
<seg id=32> A number of countries have so far advanced as regards the second economic criterion - competitiveness on the internal market - they are looming of accession.</seg>
<seg id=33> We are therefore seeking closer coordination with the national governments, the Parliament and the other institutions.</seg>
<seg id=34> Each year, and we shall soon again - on 8 November - all the applicant countries are waiting impatiently for the judgment pronounced the Commission on their progress.</seg>
<seg id=35> With reason we opted for the principle of differentiation, that each candidate country is assessed on its own merits.</seg>
<seg id=36> This debate is a further opportunity for my group to confirm that the accession of the Central and Eastern European States, but also of Cyprus and Malta – is the best guarantee of future for all of us in Europe, in the East and in the West.</seg>
<seg id=37> The task, which is capital, has not yet been a lively interest on the part of the public.</seg>
<seg id=38> People plaisantent about enlargement, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, must always speak in five years.</seg>
<seg id=39> The next opportunity any natural, it will be the 2009 European elections, but we want to make efforts to a maximum of countries can join in 2004.</seg>
<seg id=40> In addition, other six basic issues which concern us because of the methodology.</seg>
<seg id=41> In reality, this is the very model of European construction in which we have engouffrés, I mean the simultaneous integration of all sectors of activity whatever traditions or the peculiarities of each other, which transforms itself again trap.</seg>
<seg id=42> The expression of this feeling almost general in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s commits us all until today.</seg>
<seg id=43> But let us be clear: there cannot be accession rebate.</seg>
<seg id=44> There is a powerful idea which is also a great idea: that we do not make the enlargements against the opinions and that the best way to make the enlargements with opinions passes through their participation in elections, since the elections are an expression of democracy and the method of accession of the people in the political system.</seg>
<seg id=45> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak briefly about the conditions making possible the scenario that wanted to several speakers.</seg>
<seg id=46> You should not forget that these people are interests.</seg>
<seg id=47> Nevertheless, I have already indicated that all countries approchaient relatively quickly on this point.</seg>
<seg id=48> That means that it has already decided the liberalisation of trade in the area of agricultural products without fear that the Poles and result in the collapse of their agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=49> Tensions are produced, but overall, peace and trade have established between citizens closer relations, which are still being strengthened by monetary union.</seg>
<seg id=50> This must be the outcome of the negotiations that count.</seg>
<seg id=51> The only amendment which has been tabled at the moment is already covered by this report, but I am delighted that the Green Group wishes to stress the need for equal treatment of all citizens.</seg>
<seg id=52> This does not simply involve a law in the area of public service but also opening up possibilities of appropriate remuneration for young officials.</seg>
<seg id=53> That applies equally to Latvia as the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=54> The litas affiliated to the euro is planned for the second half of 2001.</seg>
<seg id=55> Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am rapporteur, is the largest and most important but, as we know, also the most problematic of countries who are preparing to join the European Union. In fact, there are so many problems that we wish raise voices calling for the exclusion of the first group of countries which will be joining us first.</seg>
<seg id=56> We have done too of broken promises to Poland, the countries of the East, the Postcommunist countries.</seg>
<seg id=57> Remains a point which is regularly when it is a question of the Czech Republic. This is the Roma problem.</seg>
<seg id=58> Slovakia is not condemned to remain in the second group and it is logical that it wants to join the Union at the same time as the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id=59> I would finally allow me a final remark on the internal politics.</seg>
<seg id=60> Thirdly, as regards agriculture, whose level of productivity is lower than that of the European Union, we must open up completely the agricultural markets to capital needed to the privatisation of land, the modernisation of farms and structures for approval and improving yields.</seg>
<seg id=61> Bulgaria is hurry to join the European Union and NATO.</seg>
<seg id=62> In the chapter on extreme poverty - an issue which touches the Romanian since 1990 - we note finally real signs of economic progress under the present government.</seg>
<seg id=63> I hope that these issues are a priority for the new Parliament which will come into operation by 15 days and the new government.</seg>
<seg id=64> But we also stress that the definitive solution, fair and sustainable must fully respect both the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, which is nothing more than the current international law and the principles governing the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=65> Malta has also stable democratic institutions and functional.</seg>
<seg id=66> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we want to make our contribution to this debate.</seg>
<seg id=67> Yet to be applied. The European Community law is not just a collection of laws: it must also be a law applied in the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=68> This change poses difficult challenges the citizens of the candidate countries but also provides, at the same time, their future and that of their children.</seg>
<seg id=69> I agree with the previous speaker: special attention must be paid to the border regions.</seg>
<seg id=70> In this respect, the Commission must not be left to account!</seg>
<seg id=71> The candidate countries are quickly towards economic growth, even if this is at the expense of the protection of nature previously defined.</seg>
<seg id=72> On both sides, we nurture bad habits, most linked to health.</seg>
<seg id=73> . (ES) Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and unified European continent.</seg>
<seg id=74> The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, also responsible for transport and trans-European networks, are aware that it is necessary to coordinate the various sectorial Community policies in favour of a global policy planning.</seg>
<seg id=75> However, once again on the fact that the transport infrastructure are of the utmost importance to the success of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=76> Mr President, I agree with you when you say that the forthcoming enlargement is the main task of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=77> The old traditional own social values planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe have been severely shaken.</seg>
<seg id=78> The PPE does not wish to unload the candidate countries the responsibility of the pace of progress of the accession process: we cannot say no date.</seg>
<seg id=79> The second point is the designation of dates.</seg>
<seg id=80> There is another reason.</seg>
<seg id=81> Thirdly: the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the various countries and for the EU as a whole depend – the example of Denmark is there for us to show this - the elimination of social and democratic deficits of European policy.</seg>
<seg id=82> The term populism it is shameful that the technocrats give the popular will when she speaks in a way that does not suit them.</seg>
<seg id=83> Ladies and gentlemen, it is now the dinner break and we resume at 9 p.m.!</seg>
<seg id=84> We have, even if this is in the longer term, a common currency for the whole continent.</seg>
<seg id=85> These issues cause internal battles in each country.</seg>
<seg id=86> We call them to fight for a different Europe, that of all peoples, free from all these inhumane characteristics, where the peoples will be masters of their fate, develop relations between peace, freedom, fraternity, mutually beneficial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=87> I am publicly praise of their work and, in particular, the work carried out by Romanian I challenge, the headquarters of which lies in Birmingham, and the work of other organisations that Irish supported by a number of people whose Daniel o donnel Irish, the artist, which promised 1 million pounds he has collected in Ireland and other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id=88> The nizza summit should clearly establish whether and how the EU can, for its part, be ready in time for this enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=89> The Poles are wondering whether they will do so when they have acceded countries or whether they will become a second category.</seg>
<seg id=90> Nevertheless, I am convinced that, with some good will and with the help of the European Union, will be found a solution which will allow the two communities to live harmoniously and prosper, as they have done for centuries.</seg>
<seg id=91> We are also concerned about the problem of minorities, for the issue of the integration of these minorities, including linguistic their integration, is also important in these countries.</seg>
<seg id=92> The condition for membership of the Union is basically to fulfil the basic criteria, the so-called Copenhagen criteria.</seg>
<seg id=93> The benefits of enlargement have been mentioned, and that is one of the subjects on which Lithuania can we learn something.</seg>
<seg id=94> Imagine that they are all like this.</seg>
<seg id=95> Mr President, Commissioner, I also wish to congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs, but I would particularly like to limit my remarks to Slovakia, particularly to the policy towards minorities.</seg>
<seg id=96> I therefore invite you at the next summit in nizza to set a deadline for which you plan to conclude the negotiations with the candidate countries the most advanced towards accession, without mentioning names.</seg>
<seg id=97> The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its efforts to join the European Union and, of course, ensure that the planning of this aid is still more decentralised.</seg>
<seg id=98> The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of civil society, the government and Parliament plays an important role in this respect and, as we can see - positive.</seg>
<seg id=99> We are currently bringing an end to the division of Europe into two blocs and not to create a new division.</seg>
<seg id=100> All these elements contained in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne that I thank on behalf of our group.</seg>
<seg id=101> In this respect, I believe that the Cyprus issue is, par excellence, that which will be judged the ability of Europe to see his political face.</seg>
<seg id=102> I myself live near the Baltic Sea, a sea which gives us all an ecological problem.</seg>
<seg id=103> The political vision remains.</seg>
<seg id=104> It was very good to hear that Mr Hänsch, who spoke on behalf of the PSE Group, had hoped that the Commission should undertake a real evaluation of the consequences of enlargement, and the economic effects if enlargement would never happen.</seg>
<seg id=105> However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, whereby the setting of transitional periods is essential in the interests of both parties. Moreover, as an MEP of a border region and, as Mrs Schierhuber - owner of a farm near the Czech border, I particularly want to what the creation of common close economic areas can be controlled without major problems and provide positive results on both sides.</seg>
<seg id=106> As a Social Democrat, I would like to emphasise three points.</seg>
<seg id=107> The EEA which contains the first pillar gives businesses of candidate countries access to the internal market and youth scientists and the right to participate in exchange programmes, but on the other hand, it does not oblige the EU to extend its system of agricultural aid to these countries.</seg>
<seg id=108> Secondly, we must say 'no' to the concept which would be admitted that big bang, but at the same time, a large group of countries, because this would be in contradiction with the principle of the admission of each country on its merits.</seg>
<seg id=109> Thirdly, we must do everything to by 2003, to prepare the European Union for the enlargement process in the direction of wonderful speech by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.</seg>
<seg id=110> In this regard, I would like to address the relationship between Parliament and the Council by emphasizing that there are enormous delays as regards the answers to written questions.</seg>
<seg id=111> It is worrying that this occurs in a country which will enter the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=112> I therefore request that the matter be referred back to the Committee on Legal Affairs so that it can prepare for it.</seg>
<seg id=113> Mr President, we shall be debating today, and perhaps vote on three reports on this subject in total, two of my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=114> All the actors in the food production chain should gain.</seg>
<seg id=115> Safety will cost money to all actors in the food production chain.</seg>
<seg id=116> We must therefore follow Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and adopt the principle of non dilution to secure animal feed and genuinely protecting European consumers.</seg>
<seg id=117> The 1999 directive has been thought and it can already boast a success because taxes have been reduced sensitively.</seg>
<seg id=118> However, allow purely and simply the dilution is not a solution.</seg>
<seg id=119> Very soon, we must insist on Amendment No 37 on dioxin.</seg>
<seg id=120> On this point we agree.</seg>
<seg id=121> Thus, it will mean that we, European consumers, we shall continue to buy on the world markets meat and milk and beef products produced from these animal feed which has no link with the minimum and maximum limits set by the European Union and by a system of animal feed production who buy raw materials on the international markets, free to confuse any principle and composed, before introducing their products on the territory of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=122> We must be able to have, at second reading, in the Commission's view on how to proceed to risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id=123> However, it would be inappropriate, for example, to adopt Amendments Nos 39 and 40, because this would delete the possibility for Member States to intervene promptly against the dangers that we would come to recognise.</seg>
<seg id=124> Consumer protection starts from feed, components of feedingstuffs, declaration and, finally, official controls.</seg>
<seg id=125> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our colleague Mrs Paulsen on the undesirable substances in animal nutrition is an important issue and, as all the important topics, it is highly controversial.</seg>
<seg id=126> Mr President, the debate on this excellent report by Mrs Paulsen has been, on certain points, emotionally very busy, and now that this debate is closed, I think we must assume that the requirements in the animal feed sector are strict, but that we would then be able to ensure that the quality is by mixtures.</seg>
<seg id=127> Individually and jointly, these three proposals aim to fill the considerable gaps which have been highlighted by the dioxin crisis.</seg>
<seg id=128> Amendment No 33 removes the possibility of batch re-exporting do not conform to the country of origin.</seg>
<seg id=129> Nor can I accept Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44 which aim to restore the possibility of watering down, under certain conditions, raw materials intended for the manufacture of feedingstuffs which are infected.</seg>
<seg id=130> They should be enough, given the commitment we have made to establish, within the framework of the new proposal on the Food Authority, a rapid alert system covering all products and of the food chain.</seg>
<seg id=131> Commissioner Byrne, behind this directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs, is essentially a problem we have for a long time, namely the open declaration.</seg>
<seg id=132> And for this reason alone, I have already learned something.</seg>
<seg id=133> Because if we put into practice quickly this measure and if we start quickly the codecision procedure, this would certainly be an appreciable gain and I am convinced that, with the Council, we shall be strong and united.</seg>
<seg id=134> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it may be that, in the future, contaminated raw materials can also enter the composition of feedingstuffs, in any case, it is not impossible.</seg>
<seg id=135> The BSE scandal is the worst example known.</seg>
<seg id=136> Common sense – our rapporteur says - and this is obviously have a label to open declaration, which gives a list of ingredients.</seg>
<seg id=137> I believe that the technical skills, as well as the judgement of the members of the Committee on Agriculture are no doubt in terms of agricultural and feed, in order to find a solution geared towards the practical and enforceable which must be applied and understood by farmers and consumers.</seg>
<seg id=138> So much for the positive points.</seg>
<seg id=139> It is, in my opinion, a legitimate right to information that must be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id=140> Madam President, I ask you, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, to send a message of condolence from Parliament to the families of the victims and the local authorities of both Brittany that Marín, city of Galicia, where are from most of the victims.</seg>
<seg id=141> (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=142> Are any Members who oppose the tabling of this oral amendment?</seg>
<seg id=143> It is good that the rapporteur has explained things.</seg>
<seg id=144> Most of its technical proposals deserve to be supported with vehemence, for example on food safety, the dismantling of nuclear power stations in the first generation, protection of the environment, the fight against social dumping, the code of conduct for Western companies when they work towards the East, etc. It is a huge task, and also absolute priority.</seg>
<seg id=145> At the same time, the difficulties to be overcome remain considerable, particularly in budgetary terms.</seg>
<seg id=146> Enlargement thirteen countries not only to change the geopolitical framework of the European Union, but it also changes the structure, since at the time the total population will increase (+ 28%), but also the number of disadvantaged regions' '.</seg>
<seg id=147> In this respect, it must take account of the fact that within the candidate countries, a competitive agriculture and food industry will be of decisive importance to the success of the process of transformation and restructuring, because of its high social and economic weight.</seg>
<seg id=148> In this respect, I would like to see the outermost regions, whose 6 on 7 are always among the EU's poorest 10, have the structural funds, either on the sole criterion of GDP, but also on geographical and demographic and mainly social indicators.</seg>
<seg id=149> Because we reject it in the interests of French, we cannot, in all conscience, approve its enlargement to the countries and peoples, barely released from the Communist dictatorship and who cannot know yet how trap technocratic and totalitarian they want to join.</seg>
<seg id=150> We should confine ourselves at most to a resolution short but intense as regards the reports on the country.</seg>
<seg id=151> The current system, comprising aid, subsidies and quotas must be replaced by free trade and adapting to the market.</seg>
<seg id=152> The importance and the extent of the problems that enlargement raises are not compatible with the double language on them within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=153> To speak of enlargement does not mean penalising the membership or not of some countries to Europe.</seg>
<seg id=154> Our neighbour endeavoured resolutely during the past decade to fulfil the criteria for membership.</seg>
<seg id=155> Latvia has its place in this House, not only because, overall, the right to give him credit "confidence" essential for such negotiations, but above all, and above all, because it is at home in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=156> I believe that the countries which have applied for membership, Poland is the most state which deserves our support, our commitment, as, without the very important initiatives for Poland, the fall of communism would not have taken place and we would not be here today on this problem.</seg>
<seg id=157> It may not be obvious to the Polish people which remains largely euro-sceptique.</seg>
<seg id=158> I invite Prague to seize this, this invitation, this request for dialogue, to respond and to ensure that, together with this House, these relics of a nationalist age can be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id=159> . I welcome the Wiersma report on Slovakia's application for membership of the European Union and I share most of the conclusions of the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=160> On this occasion, I have the pleasure to send a special salvation for the elderly and pensioners of the Republic of Bulgaria.</seg>
<seg id=161> I therefore see no reason why Romania will not be admitted to the European Union, if it continues to make progress at the same pace and once the Union has undertaken the necessary adjustments of its institutional structure and its policies to cope with enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=162> Whatever the solution regarding the settlers, and God knows if the problem is difficult, such as the return of land on both sides, what the report says is too hard not to earn a reserve.</seg>
<seg id=163> Unfortunately, some of the comments of the draft report on the request for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, established by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, are not much help in this respect.</seg>
<seg id=164> This task will not be easy, given the lack of goodwill on the part of the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=165> Stenzel report (A5-0243 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=166> Misfortune, I was indeed a victim of food poisoning, even if it was slight, in the European Parliament, unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id=167> For all these reasons, I voted in favour of the prohibition of the dilution which is proposed by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=168> We must, in this resolution, urge the ASEM countries to put pressure on the Burmese military regime to restore democracy in the country.</seg>
<seg id=169> We are bias in our approach and our way of doing things.</seg>
<seg id=170> This is not the time to be hesitant.</seg>
<seg id=171> I would like to mention some of the key points of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=172> Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=173> That is why we need legislation against discrimination.</seg>
<seg id=174> We are thus now with a large number of legal technical amendments designed to ensure a uniform level of protection against discrimination based on race and discrimination on the grounds of religion, disability, age and sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id=175> We must make an effort of balance, moderation and good legal and technical his report reflects – in my view – all these qualities.</seg>
<seg id=176> Moreover, they are of the opinion that the cases of discrimination are not enough of them to justify a directive.</seg>
<seg id=177> The action programme before us does not provide sufficient resources to replace the relevant work - work of the fifth framework programme, which I hope will guarantee the continuing in other framework programmes - and we must therefore ensure complementarity.</seg>
<seg id=178> Everyone agrees that we must fight against discrimination, but opinions differ when it comes to how, to what extent and with what means.</seg>
<seg id=179> I had the opportunity, in committee, to protest against the fact that the experts can be also outside and NGOs, however, have something to say.</seg>
<seg id=180> We are also very satisfied with the provision of the directive stipulates that equal treatment for people with disabilities also means that companies are supposed to make modifications in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=181> Only in this way that we can fight effectively against discrimination in all areas of life of society in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=182> After all, as we teach the major democracies anglo-saxonnes, racism and discrimination are fighting by liberal democracy, and not by the restriction and the gradual erosion of the economic freedoms, freedom of opinion, expression and association.</seg>
<seg id=183> So we have a proposal which homosexuality as sacrement marriage.</seg>
<seg id=184> We are thus strengthening the European Union's positions on specific situations experienced by its nationals in connection with discrimination and equal treatment.</seg>
<seg id=185> I should also like to come back to the question of the religious derogation.</seg>
<seg id=186> My attention has been drawn to the potential interpretation of the explanatory statement in relation to Article 1, which once again may seem a little obscure, if it makes the distinction between sexual orientation and behavior.</seg>
<seg id=187> What is hiérarchisent as discrimination.</seg>
<seg id=188> In a New Caledonia preference is given on the basis chromatique skin.</seg>
<seg id=189> These guidelines of the directive, added to the fact that recently adopted directive 2000, demonstrate the obvious desire of the European Union to guarantee an open society, free from categories predetermined and, above all, the scourge of racism which has deep roots in European history.</seg>
<seg id=190> Those who say that Europe must not adopt a directive laying down the values that we all want to defend are wrong.</seg>
<seg id=191> Do not touch hard-earned these achievements.</seg>
<seg id=192> Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the media must also play a major role in this task.</seg>
<seg id=193> Experience has shown that the promotion of legislative measures to combat discrimination is essential, but it is not enough.</seg>
<seg id=194> We must avoid confusion paperassières, which will reduce Europe to a purely materialistic politically correct entity but unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id=195> I believe that this Parliament has given too much legislation, after all, "" anxious that the European Commission wanted to propose.</seg>
<seg id=196> I should like to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, for their texts quite remarkable.</seg>
<seg id=197> I also accept the amendments that you have presented in order to highlight the importance of the prevention of discrimination and to combat them.</seg>
<seg id=198> The second category is designed to clarify the text of the Commission proposal and the third is a large number of amendments whose aim is to try to put this proposal into line with the directive on discrimination based on race adopted last June.</seg>
<seg id=199> In particular, Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 propose deleting the reference to discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id=200> I cannot accept the references that you, in Amendments Nos 21 and 45, the natural and legal persons and the unofficial groupings, because this proposal employment applies only to individuals.</seg>
<seg id=201> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.</seg>
<seg id=202> You cannot expect the public support for peacekeeping operations if your troops are threatened with death by weapons that we ourselves have provided.</seg>
<seg id=203> For example, in my country, it must be a licence to have a shotgun but not to install as broker at the back of my garden.</seg>
<seg id=204> Another important point: the export ban, to promote and sale of equipment and knowledge used for the practice of torture.</seg>
<seg id=205> Having said that, I would naturally like to congratulate the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Titley, for his excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=206> We must extend our considerations, on the one hand, the questions of constraint, but also the means other than those intended to use military itself: disarmament, the conversion, strengthening the action of the police and customs authorities and, on the other hand, the applicant countries that Mr Wiersma has just mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=207> The control of financial makes it increasingly difficult bypassing the regulations on the arms trade.</seg>
<seg id=208> The annual report aims to identify potential such improvements.</seg>
<seg id=209> The European Union is to complete the project beyond its expiry date, which will take place in November of this year.</seg>
<seg id=210> A methodology and indicators have been defined and will be presented to the next research Council.</seg>
<seg id=211> Thank you, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=212> As regards the problems of SMEs, of course, we have ensured that, in the framework programme, the SMEs have their part, as envisaged in the budget decision.</seg>
<seg id=213> That is certainly the discussions on the budget in Greece and it must even say that those who put forward the views of the European Union are many. Is it true?</seg>
<seg id=214> As regards multidisciplinarity, I share your feelings.</seg>
<seg id=215> The first is the EU's participation in the national programmes that he mentioned specifically in his statement.</seg>
<seg id=216> We can therefore talk of European research area, if we do, we are responsible for 5% of this research.</seg>
<seg id=217> Thank you, Mr Busquin.</seg>
<seg id=218> Firstly, following the efforts made to engage fully the appropriations to the end of 1999, applications pending at the beginning of this exercise for the financing of new projects were necessarily very low.</seg>
<seg id=219> But I would repeat that things were well made by Portugal in the previous period.</seg>
<seg id=220> Question No 2 by (H-0730 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=221> Finally, set the excise duties on mineral oils at a high level has not been a failure of Community regulations on competition.</seg>
<seg id=222> Secondly, as Mr MacCormick knows when Member States promote an industrial sector given by tax measures, they break the rules on state aid, in this case the fiscal state aid equivalent to subsidies.</seg>
<seg id=223> Nuclear energy, for example, is a very clear example.</seg>
<seg id=224> Subject: minority languages' budget line in the budget of the European Union in favour of minority languages which exist since 1983, have continued to increase until 1995, during which they were the highest (EUR 4 million).</seg>
<seg id=225> Mr President, Members of Parliament will know that very important resources are available in the Structural Funds - and this is new - for cultural activities, because with my colleague, Michel Barnier, we have given the importance of the fact that the structural funds do not just to invest in roads or airports but also in humans.</seg>
<seg id=226> The Commission will therefore not new financial commitments next year.</seg>
<seg id=227> As regards the concrete proposals for funding, it is impossible for me to be here, because we must respect the normal procedure.</seg>
<seg id=228> I thought of several possibilities.</seg>
<seg id=229> It is therefore necessary that something be done in this area, because there is million small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=230> Its regulation couvre-t-elle hunting requirements, for example the impetus, as well as the processing of meat for personal consumption?</seg>
<seg id=231> If we were to apply this regulation to meat that consumes oneself, it would be a disaster for the elk hunters of bureaucratic.</seg>
<seg id=232> I intend, following the conclusion of this report, to table proposals to improve the transport of animals and to tackle the problem of the unsatisfactory application of the restrictions of travel times.</seg>
<seg id=233> We have already discussed this issue in my meeting with the Green Group.</seg>
<seg id=234> Our question was clear: what are the measures taken by the Commission?</seg>
<seg id=235> General product safety also obliges producers to inform consumers of the risks.</seg>
<seg id=236> The case of Maryam ayubi is extremely worrying.</seg>
<seg id=237> Question No 14 by (H-0745 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=238> The EU's position vis-à-vis this ministerial meeting in Vientiane, and even the question of its presence or the level at which the EU should be represented, will depend on developments in Burma by December.</seg>
<seg id=239> One final point.</seg>
<seg id=240> Elections are an important step in the participation of Kosovars to the management of their own communities.</seg>
<seg id=241> I can even tell you the holding of the elections was more democratic, more organised that some of our countries, which I found myself as participating, as observer.</seg>
<seg id=242> But we considered that it was a beginning and not in any case of the completion of the process.</seg>
<seg id=243> It calls for a more effective control of the arms trade and for greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id=244> I now see that the number of contracts on arms and their components continually increasing each year.</seg>
<seg id=245> We cannot take concrete decisions on the basis of information, fictitious realities fictitious.</seg>
<seg id=246> The deal which has been to keep them together in the same directorate-general should be reconsidered.</seg>
<seg id=247> If these institutions must have the opportunity to appoint an internal auditor, it will perhaps enough to impose minimum requirements in terms of auditing the financial controller.</seg>
<seg id=248> The Commissioner is aware, this proposal does not unanimity in this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=249> We therefore have no objection to an independent internal audit service, which we are currently giving the go-ahead through the report by our colleague Mr van Hulten.</seg>
<seg id=250> Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by expressing my congratulations to the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=251> We are of the opinion that the modernisation of the administration is necessary and urgent.</seg>
<seg id=252> An independent contre-vérification is vital to prevent mistakes.</seg>
<seg id=253> Money must be spent in a more targeted and effective in the future. Of course, we must ensure that the money is actually spent for the purposes for which they were affected by the competent authorities in budgetary matters.</seg>
<seg id=254> Regarding the amendments, I would like to briefly make the following comment: the Commission supports this additional recital.</seg>
<seg id=255> I therefore thank you for your suggestions and your deliberations.</seg>
<seg id=256> I would like to summarize the proposals in this report which seem to me to be the most important and specifically operational. Firstly, the creation of a group of experts composed of personalities appointed by the Member States, which should help to define minimum standards of protection of minors in the media; secondly, the creation of a code of self-regulation by all operators in the sector; thirdly, the possibility to encourage and to make available the filtering systems both by television via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id=257> Unfortunately I cannot approve the requirements of the Liberals.</seg>
<seg id=258> This legislative falls essentially within the competence of the Member States and must remain such, which does not, however, a consultation on the search for consensus on certain reference values by way of dialogue with all the parties involved at European level.</seg>
<seg id=259> It is no less true that it is, in my view, parents to ensure that their children disregard this kind of programme.</seg>
<seg id=260> Parents have a particular need them assistance in this area, which must include: specific parameters for the protection of minors in the media which are to apply in the area of the European Union as a whole, the establishment and availability at an affordable price filtering systems, legal provisions relating to the protection of minors and the commitment of the responsibility of the media, i.e. broadcasting companies and companies producing programmes, be they public or private.</seg>
<seg id=261> When I hear during debates in committee, some people say that there is no evidence of the detrimental effects of violence in all its forms, about, on children, I am surprised and I use a euphemism.</seg>
<seg id=262> As regards the introduction of a code of self-regulation, it is noted, particularly on a technical level, that broadcasters in some Member States have already introduced codes of regulation for the television, which must enable parents to cut the course.</seg>
<seg id=263> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=264> In particular, my report replaces the international norm valid giving decisions to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=265> This would be a minimum if we make this area of freedom is a fundamental right of every European citizen.</seg>
<seg id=266> Some payments due in 1996, Mr President, have still not been made.</seg>
<seg id=267> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani for their work.</seg>
<seg id=268> I commend this report to the House and the amendments tabled by Mr Evans.</seg>
<seg id=269> Our human resources single represent our future in a world where knowledge is the most valuable.</seg>
<seg id=270> It is not with the Green Papers, black, red or white that we solve the problems, but with concrete actions.</seg>
<seg id=271> But the European Parliament, and it is in its role, Parliament has exerted pressure for researchers are still included in the text.</seg>
<seg id=272> Today, you make visit at a crucial moment for the future of European integration.</seg>
<seg id=273> But we know that the process is incomplete and that this incomplétude threat vitality.</seg>
<seg id=274> The debate, which each country contributes with its own sensitivity, its traditions, culture is the instrument of the reveal, define and the details.</seg>
<seg id=275> Long live the European Parliament, long live the European Union!</seg>
<seg id=276> We must ensure that women get jobs indirectly, while avoiding a repetition of the same inequalities in the more traditional sectors: less skilled jobs, part-time sometimes not chosen on fixed-term contracts, and the difficulty of access to decision-making posts.</seg>
<seg id=277> The Council will be presented with a proposal indicators to measure the progress in this field.</seg>
<seg id=278> Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar dedicated to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality by gender mainstreaming and specific guidelines.</seg>
<seg id=279> I am thinking especially of the violence suffered by them, one of the priorities of my government action, and I know that this issue is also particularly you.</seg>
<seg id=280> We know that the measures of the reconciliation of professional and family life encourage particularly women, although we still need studies on the current situation of the family and the role that women plays, who is no longer the traditional role given that society has changed, as the family structure.</seg>
<seg id=281> Some people, including Members of this House, sometimes seem convinced that the opposite is true, but it is a mistake.</seg>
<seg id=282> I would like to end, Mr President, by saying that equality begins at home.</seg>
<seg id=283> I find this embarrassing position and ambiguous, and this deserves, I believe, reflection for projects that you propose, because there is no guarantee that we will have to practice through all this.</seg>
<seg id=284> In this area, there is no equality.</seg>
<seg id=285> The image of European women, as we discovered over the pages of our report, our framework directives, with these women in their majority Danish who say no to the euro.</seg>
<seg id=286> I think it is significant that the report is the establishment of a digital balance between men and women in all sectors of society, on the labour market, for example.</seg>
<seg id=287> It is precisely for this reason that the report has missed a major opportunity disguising completely marriage and the family.</seg>
<seg id=288> This is something which the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities should also take into account!</seg>
<seg id=289> We have heard that the previous presidency was first restructured can dismantled the Ministry of equal opportunities.</seg>
<seg id=290> Wages means women continue to be below average 28%, compared with those of men, which contributes to the fact that women form the majority of the poor population and impedes their participation in social and political life.</seg>
<seg id=291> It is a quite remarkable result.</seg>
<seg id=292> We are witnessing a impoverishment of salaried women everywhere in Europe, in France too, where 15% of them live when even with less of 3.650 FF per month.</seg>
<seg id=293> Not all countries have followed this example, I hope that the example of France will be followed by other countries.</seg>
<seg id=294> The history of women is obviously very long.</seg>
<seg id=295> We must help the candidates to reach the level of the acquis communautaire.</seg>
<seg id=296> But, on this point, I would like your support.</seg>
<seg id=297> This is not the case, even if it is a good text. Having thought about, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market has chosen, after a long debate, not to table amendments.</seg>
<seg id=298> The Committee on Legal Affairs, after a long debate, felt that there was no reasonable that legal uncertainty is six years and that three years ago, the deadline, that was a more appropriate for it to be possible to determine, with adequate resources and an average speed, whether or not there have been irregularities in a statement.</seg>
<seg id=299> This is Amendment No 15 on fraud.</seg>
<seg id=300> The objective, namely reaching a simplified communication but also qualitatively, and that sufficient flexibility of the basic regulation by improving the recovery procedure and by adapting the provisions on presentation customs, responds to one of the many requirements of the single market, and this objective is achieved here because many country are inspired to participate quickly to international trade.</seg>
<seg id=301> It would like to thank Parliament and especially the committee chaired by Mrs de Palacio and interest for the efforts made by Parliament and the Commission – in the dossier.</seg>
<seg id=302> Welcome</seg>
<seg id=303> I hope that this does not change the outcome of the vote which will be expressed, but we really need to check the translation of the French version.</seg>
<seg id=304> Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report.</seg>
<seg id=305> It is recognised that the knowledge of foreign languages is a prerequisite for mobility.</seg>
<seg id=306> We also believe that the Member States must be able to decide for themselves, to a large extent, they want to impose taxes.</seg>
<seg id=307> I regret that we have no chance of getting a majority in relation to the need to formulate an expiry date for the conservation of documents.</seg>
<seg id=308> . During the negotiations of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we were pleased with the inclusion of Article 13 concerning discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief not sectarian, disability, age and sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id=309> My final point concerns the budget for this programme, or 98,4 million euros, an amount which is obviously insufficient given the actions envisaged.</seg>
<seg id=310> It is explicitly grounds for amendment provided for in the directive to intervene in the field of regulations relating to age regulations applied in the Member States, which is, however, totally based for reasons of genetic psychology and have no impact on the working life.</seg>
<seg id=311> I also think that we could dispense with everything that has been written in the new Article 12 has).</seg>
<seg id=312> As regards religion / of personal beliefs, the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection proposed in this area.</seg>
<seg id=313> The Christian Democrats believe, on the whole, I welcome the proposal for a directive on the establishment of a general framework on non-discrimination in working life.</seg>
<seg id=314> This, however, is revealing that occupation staff of an internal audit service and not of the financial importance and, consequently, of the usefulness of such a service.</seg>
<seg id=315> The EU has decided to develop common military powers in order to achieve the objectives of the so-called Petersberg (combating crises and search for solutions to the conflicts outside the territory of the EU), but it has no common defence policy.</seg>
<seg id=316> . (NL) without weapons, the world would be a much safer.</seg>
<seg id=317> The resolution does not radically reduce arms sales to promote a policy of disarmament, but only regulate in order to guarantee the profits of industrial groups.</seg>
<seg id=318> The Commission communication recognises the problem but does not propose practical measures, because it is locked in the logic of the liberalisation of the market and competition, and the proposals that it can do not basically a harsh reality - especially for children, the unaccountability enjoyed by the multinationals, which, in their pursuit of profit, do not bothering about the impact of their programmes and their products and transfer full responsibility parents, inviting them to consume new products to protect their children.</seg>
<seg id=319> Like the rapporteur, I believe that the measures to protect young people against the violent and harmful programmes should not be limited to traditional television, but apply to all the media.</seg>
<seg id=320> With an average of three hours per day, it is human activity and the most important after the sleep for adults, the work.</seg>
<seg id=321> Furthermore, women are often 'flexible' posts; temporary contracts or low salaries are typical of the occupying sectors mostly women.</seg>
<seg id=322> To be the first victims of the reduction in public spending, privatisations in the health sector - for the right of access to care and treatment, not to mention the right to information and prevention programmes.</seg>
<seg id=323> B5-0792 / 2000 by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, on the crisis situation in Peru.</seg>
<seg id=324> Mr President, I would have liked to have a debate on Latin America is not solely on the basis of one or other topical problem, but rather in the framework of a well-prepared debate in the committees.</seg>
<seg id=325> We must ensure that Peru to reach the objectives it has set itself with candidates which are equal to the challenge and which are able to fulfil the view of the Peruvian people, namely a renewal policy and a substantial democracy.</seg>
<seg id=326> The joint debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=327> However, we know that Afghanistan is not far, that Afghanistan is the largest producer of opiates -- and thus we know and we can imagine the role that these mafias policies, not only political moreover, play in the expansion of the drugs trade.</seg>
<seg id=328> It calls on the Commission to take stock of humanitarian aid to the Afghan people, so that everyone is forgotten in the territory.</seg>
<seg id=329> The suffering linked to this conflict is terrible.</seg>
<seg id=330> A budget line has programmes to de-mining and prevention for years.</seg>
<seg id=331> Let me respond to the warnings of Mrs Paciotti by saying that I shall ask the Commission today to what has happened and what should be done with resources dedicated to demining.</seg>
<seg id=332> (B5-0794 / 2000 by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnapping of a Spanish sophistry in Colombia engaged in negotiations with the guerillas;</seg>
<seg id=333> We would all wish not to discuss the Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=334> The Commission has already proposed to coordinate the measures of such a package. The Commission already provides in the coming days of considerable resources to this end.</seg>
<seg id=335> So, again, two weights, two measures, and I believe that it is to be regretted.</seg>
<seg id=336> This attitude of the Albanian opposition party knowingly rejecting a solution needed to solve a problem Albanians in Macedonia is totally incomprehensible to me.</seg>
<seg id=337> I think the Macedonians have done a magnificent achievement in managing to resolve them questions of procedure.</seg>
<seg id=338> That is why I believe that this reconciliation can take. However, the government, which has very courageously found a solution to the issue of universities and many other problems, needs visible signs of success and a strong support, otherwise the threatened peace throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id=339> The PHARE funds available for the year 2000 in the framework of the national programme can also be used to support at university at the next academic year 2001-2002.</seg>
<seg id=340> I would like to point out that we all today, Greek MEPs, we now have reacted in this situation.</seg>
<seg id=341> And all this, for Greece, which is the highest in the European Union for the merchant shipping sector, actually concerns the safety of shipping in all its aspects in the Union.</seg>
<seg id=342> In recent years, many other people have died at sea, not just after shipwrecks of ferries, but so far too regularly, within our fishing communities.</seg>
<seg id=343> On the contrary, the innocent victims are used to promote the wider objectives of shipowners.</seg>
<seg id=344> We must realise that this is also about the credibility of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=345> To conclude, I would like to stress that the Commission is firmly convinced that the issue of the European legislation on the safety of ships transporting passengers must be given the highest priority in the European Union and that the important thing is to ensure that these provisions are applied throughout the Community a strict and uniform manner.</seg>
<seg id=346> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, forgive me for being a bit late for reasons which you know well, in order to make a brief statement on the two issues which are on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade and the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=347> Commissioner Verheugen is going to speak, as did Mr Solana, on the two issues that bind us this afternoon, i.e. the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg id=348> We must be prepared to keep that promise, as soon as the will of the people has been respected.</seg>
<seg id=349> Madam President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, it is with reservations that I am taking part in this debate, because I do not want to see our Parliament is only as a judge allowed to apportion blame on this or that, at a time when, after the hopes so strong raised here just a month, we are faced with the tragic consequences of this new outburst of violence in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id=350> Madam President, my speech today is based not only on various analyses of developments, but also on the experience that I have personally experienced last week, as I was incidentally in Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip when the unrest broke out.</seg>
<seg id=351> Even if one is opposed to any violence, it is not possible to put on the same footing violence Israeli and Palestinian violence.</seg>
<seg id=352> I would ask the House at this critical moment to make a declaration of support for the courageous people who have, today, defended freedom in the streets of Belgrade, reiterating the support we have given, we, as Europeans, not so long ago, those who fought for freedom in other cities.</seg>
<seg id=353> Europeans, Madam President, that would be well advised to seize the ball which has been made here by the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council.</seg>
<seg id=354> The status of Jerusalem is a difficult point in the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=355> For years, thanks to his propaganda machine and brutal pressure that we held on the media, it has managed to mislead the people of his country, but unfortunately also a large number of people in the West, to present a false picture of the reality.</seg>
<seg id=356> While this tragedy is nearing its end, this Parliament has the duty, as a symbol of a free and united Europe, to support the crowds outside the Yugoslav parliament and to help Mr kosturica to fulfil its mandate.</seg>
<seg id=357> It is precisely this attitude harsh as stone we fear the worst - and the current situation illustrates the words I have drafted a few hours ago.</seg>
<seg id=358> I wonder whether the Commissioner already provides for steps to show that we consider Kostunica as the legally elected representative of the Serbian people and as a partner with which the European Union will now have to deal with.</seg>
<seg id=359> The European Parliament wishes to express its full solidarity in this historic moment when tyranny is falter and where triumph democracy.</seg>
<seg id=360> The next item is the report (A5-0237 / 2000) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2000 / 24 / EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to cover loans for projects in Croatia (COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000 / 0122 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=361> We must welcome the new policy which is open in this country after the presidential and legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id=362> Between the EU and Croatia, there is, in particular, an advisory working party whose objective is to make available to Croatia his expertise and technical assistance in the negotiation of agreements governing the mutual reports.</seg>
<seg id=363> Let us not forget that Croatia symbolised recently the failure of a privatisation programme which only a few have benefited.</seg>
<seg id=364> The contribution we are debating in the form of a loan of EUR 250 million for the period 2000 to 2007 the EIB cannot therefore be a milestone, but must be a help stimulating.</seg>
<seg id=365> So it is not quite accurate to talk about democratisation in this report.</seg>
<seg id=366> When there is a century, Croatia and Slovakia have become independent for the first time, they were satellites of the Hitler regime.</seg>
<seg id=367> Clearly, we cannot separate the question of guarantees and that of Croatia, nor the debate yesterday evening, nor the developments that have taken place in Belgrade.</seg>
<seg id=368> At a time when it appears that Milosevic has fled and that the will of the Serbian people has prevailed, we hope that the establishment of normal relations and the partnership between Serbia and our union of democracies will shortly.</seg>
<seg id=369> I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 6 October 2000.</seg>
<seg id=370> (The House rose and observed a minute's silence)</seg>
<seg id=371> My question is: who speaks on behalf of the European Parliament on this Statute?</seg>
<seg id=372> I ask you, Madam President, to do everything in your power to accelerate the procedure in the Committee on Petitions regarding a document presented by more than thirty collective social and NGOs in order to protest against this flagrant violation of the Community rules on the radioprotection.</seg>
<seg id=373> The post-mortem carried out in Georgia has shown that it is clearly a murder after probable torture.</seg>
<seg id=374> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the opportunity to take a major step towards your dream - which is not, moreover, mine.</seg>
<seg id=375> This is the basic regulation, on the basis of all the other regulations on GM crops.</seg>
<seg id=376> It is clearly in the flat, one after the other.</seg>
<seg id=377> (The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 17h50)</seg>
<seg id=378> The next item is the report (A5-0291 / 2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Commission communication to the Council [COM (2000) 379 - c5-0508 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 (COS)], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the new social agenda.</seg>
<seg id=379> The right to underline the importance of the open coordination method does not mean that this method must replace social legislation, because we must set, in Europe too, social rights, we must have the courage to define the minimum social and social legislation which is essential in the context of a European internal market.</seg>
<seg id=380> In our opinion, we also support the dialogue and cooperation with civil society, and mainly with women's organisations in the countries who are preparing their integration into the European family, because it is time to ensure a uniform development which will follow the stages and the motives of the rest of Europe.</seg>
<seg id=381> The action areas listed in the communication of the Commission have also been the subject of a general agreement.</seg>
<seg id=382> I would remind you, at this juncture, the holding of a European seminar in Biarritz on this subject on 4 and 5 December, which I will chair seminar.</seg>
<seg id=383> With regard to the fight against exclusion, we have made great progress in defining, on 17 October, the Employment and Social Policy Council, appropriate targets for combating poverty and social exclusion, which will serve as the basis for national action plans.</seg>
<seg id=384> I have heard some people who have read the report say they are in agreement with the diagnosis but not with the remedy proposed.</seg>
<seg id=385> Technological development and new methods of organisation also legitimise a flexible, placing more emphasis on the objectives and achieving results and attaching less importance to the rigid regulations.</seg>
<seg id=386> It is on this side we must seek, in our opinion, the obsoleteness reproached those who do not wait for the brave new world of a market without hindrance.</seg>
<seg id=387> This has certainly contributed to reduce social unrest in our country and encourage investment programmes of foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id=388> However, the method used seems more questionable.</seg>
<seg id=389> If we are talking about a charter of rights and if we look favourably on the drafting of a European Constitution, we cannot be achieved one-sided view, and we must say that we must take all the necessary steps in this direction, even if this request more detailed legislation.</seg>
<seg id=390> I should like to note critically the lack of initiatives on the new requirements relating to the protection of working, consultation of workers and the working relationship.</seg>
<seg id=391> Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Minister, Mrs Péry, for the presentation of the social agenda.</seg>
<seg id=392> These points, we know, are combated by the conservatives in Europe. We are, with our group, particularly attached.</seg>
<seg id=393> The third issue of content is enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=394> The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30.</seg>
<seg id=395> We should complement the measures of the Commission by a revision of the individual access to health care, social security and pension system, the shortcomings of the organisation of work, and perhaps also by a general reduction in working hours.</seg>
<seg id=396> Women feel Europe close to them, and Europe will benefit interesting ideas and innovative taking shape through the report with this programme.</seg>
<seg id=397> We therefore expect an annual report of the President of the Commission in the context of an annual report to the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=398> I also welcome envisions better planning childminders to facilitate the balance between family life and working life.</seg>
<seg id=399> My group will take this into account in the final vote.</seg>
<seg id=400> (The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=401> I find the new approach to the Commission very positive, and the proposal for a decision for the period 2001-2005 programme, very well thought-out.</seg>
<seg id=402> I believe that the large number of amendments which are accepted testifies to the Community of spirit which exists between the Commission and the Committee on Women.</seg>
<seg id=403> Firstly, because I have received over the last year, many requests from companies, who feel a little powerless in comparison to the merger decisions that they should take, particularly in cases where they have had to appeal against the decision of the Commission before the Court of First Instance.</seg>
<seg id=404> I should also like to ask Commissioner Monti when we can expect the publication of a public register effective and valid on state aid and the picture, the expected results.</seg>
<seg id=405> I would also like to point out to Commissioner Monti that it is important that, in the next report, a most important section devoted to the financial services sector.</seg>
<seg id=406> What I have just said does not apply only to the energy sector, but for other areas in general.</seg>
<seg id=407> Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the fine work done in the two reports, which have a judgment flattering on your work and that of the Directorate-General for Competition.</seg>
<seg id=408> I stress this point because the market cannot solve all and, in this sense, there cannot be any competition without limits.</seg>
<seg id=409> Mr President, today, nobody is questioning, and I shall not do so, the fact that state aid alter the conditions of competition and harmful constitute one element which encourages companies to be more efficient.</seg>
<seg id=410> The hearing and deny the fact that the state aid has decreased over the period 1994-1998, while the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction, was already curious, to say the least.</seg>
<seg id=411> Today, we must not, of course, Mr President, to ignore the past, although my opinion refers to the xxixe Commission report on competition policy, and must learn the lessons for the future.</seg>
<seg id=412> In the time I have available, I would like to mention, Mr President, the following three points: the modernisation of Community competition law, the work accomplished in 1999 in the application of competition rules and the issue of state aid.</seg>
<seg id=413> The Commission has continued to intervene decisively in particular by the cartels and the abuse of a dominant position, as in the field of conciliations.</seg>
<seg id=414> Mr Rapkay, it has been extremely important for the Commission to have the support of the European Parliament for its continued competition policy, and I do not have the impression that this support can be watered down.</seg>
<seg id=415> This mechanism can be activated at the request of a Member State or to the terms of Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which remains in force during the third phase of economic and monetary union for the States which are the subject of a derogation, currently Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.</seg>
<seg id=416> The use of the capital market should remain the only option in the future.</seg>
<seg id=417> I am therefore expressing the hope that this report will receive the support of the House in its present version, and the Internal Market also apply from the vine to the sector.</seg>
<seg id=418> Today, its review is necessary given the developments of the regulation phytosanitary and scientific and technical progress, particularly in the multiplication intervened in vitro.</seg>
<seg id=419> I also believe that the reference to the precautionary principle, to the possibility of genetic modification means, for example, reducing the intensive use of plant protection treatments.</seg>
<seg id=420> To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, to observe the precautionary principle, in his mind as in his letter, if by misfortune articles and amendments that I have just mentioned were not withdrawn, there should, as demanded the wine growers, that we follow the opinion of Mrs Isler Béguin, of the Committee on the environment, and vote their abolition.</seg>
<seg id=421> Mr President, if you allow me: Commissioner, can you give your opinion on the amendment of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy? this is Amendment No 1.</seg>
<seg id=422> The only point on which we could argue, is that of whether or not I have therefore take note that the French Government has sent me the decree withdrawing the mandate of Mr Le Pen's mandate.</seg>
<seg id=423> I remind you that the vote took place at 12.30 earlier.</seg>
<seg id=424> In the field of justice and home affairs, I am optimistic about a solution for the civil judicial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=425> The preparatory group will play its full role until 19 November, the date of the next ministerial meeting.</seg>
<seg id=426> We need this climate tonique, as mentioned by Mr Moscovici, and I too have felt, at the level of Heads of State and Government, a very serious sense of collective responsibility and historic at an historic moment for European integration.</seg>
<seg id=427> We must simply, ladies and gentlemen, from now on, in these issues of the qualified majority, not to be below the spirit or the climate of Biarritz.</seg>
<seg id=428> The smaller countries in the European Union are not the subject of the greatest!</seg>
<seg id=429> I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify this point.</seg>
<seg id=430> On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica is an historic event.</seg>
<seg id=431> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, if progress has been made on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting, the disagreements remain on the composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, you emphasised.</seg>
<seg id=432> It seems to me that we are going in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id=433> Those who reject the enhanced cooperation have the same freedom of movement that passengers in the back seat of a car.</seg>
<seg id=434> I am not here, more than you, for German interfering in domestic affairs, but I believe that this position is deeply coherent and is also in the direction of what the Commission wants, if I am not mistaken.</seg>
<seg id=435> We started discussions on this issue, which show that all the Member States wish to maintaining this ceiling after enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=436> I believe that this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id=437> The first: we have sometimes had the impression that in Biarritz, there was an obsession of the debate between small and large states.</seg>
<seg id=438> From this point of view, I believe that it is not enough to say that the Community method must be safeguarded.</seg>
<seg id=439> Even when the applicant countries acceding to the Union, each Member State must retain a junior Commissioner "" or "senior '.</seg>
<seg id=440> The wording of Article 93 is all the more tragic that once the first wave of enlargement, we will be even more successful unable to move towards qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=441> Indeed it is to convince the citizens of these countries clear merits of any new European Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=442> That would have been ignoring the importance of such a crisis to imagine that the fears maintained for generations could do without new blips in the run-up to the final peace, reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id=443> I am also concerned about the weakened response to Parliament's request for democratization.</seg>
<seg id=444> However, the fault lies with those who want to intervene large-scale reforms before enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=445> On the one hand, the head of the Israeli Government's decision to freeze the peace negotiations because of the violence that prevails in the region and to concentrate its efforts on the creation of a concentration government with the opposition leader, Mr Sharon.</seg>
<seg id=446> It is with great satisfaction of course that we heard the victory by the Yugoslav population and the election of its President koštunica.</seg>
<seg id=447> I would like to ask Mr Barón Crespo to ask Italian colleagues to explain why they are in government in Italy with a party that is openly declare Communist and preparing to confront the legislative elections with another party Communist openly, the left-wing per Rifondazione Comunista.</seg>
<seg id=448> Progress is needed on this plan in the codecision procedure.</seg>
<seg id=449> The Commission is better able to provide the necessary impetus in the future by the possibility that it has to vote by simple majority.</seg>
<seg id=450> The European Union does not need today to visionaries who watch until 2030, but people who can identify the problems that enlargement will in the three to eight years to come and which can find solutions to these problems.</seg>
<seg id=451> It is therefore an open work which is not fallen and which has not been imposed.</seg>
<seg id=452> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=453> Without this fundamental reference, at best it is understood more, at worst it is entre-tue.</seg>
<seg id=454> Democracy is better in Europe, but the European democracy, it, is ill.</seg>
<seg id=455> Today, 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, the European Parliament says something very simple and said: the European Constitution, yes, you can, yes, we want.</seg>
<seg id=456> This is why the idea that the island is in itself a criterion enough.</seg>
<seg id=457> I will go to the essential concentrating on the salient points of the report of the President Gil-Robles, I will simply say that I found it excellent.</seg>
<seg id=458> Firstly, the simplification and clarification of the Treaties.</seg>
<seg id=459> I will not go further, because we are not here - at least I am not here – to discuss the report of the Institute of Florence.</seg>
<seg id=460> According to the information - I shall be technical pardonnez-le-moi - was communicated to the Presidency, it seems that a clear majority of the language versions, unlike the Italian version, is referring, for the implementation of the cohesion policy, the least favoured islands and not the islands in general.</seg>
<seg id=461> Mr Duhamel, you will doubtless agree with me that if there is no success in Nice, there will be no place, at least no credibility, for a debate on the future of European integration, at least in the present framework.</seg>
<seg id=462> It is also vital that are clearly defined in this European Constitution the division of tasks between the Member States and the European Union. The dynamic of European integration should be included to cover the areas in which it must act jointly, as for example in the field of foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=463> They could also be required to overcome the persistent blockages.</seg>
<seg id=464> We need more transparency in the distribution of competences and affirming the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=465> Everyone knows that there are very different views on this subject in the various Member States and within the various social groups.</seg>
<seg id=466> Unfortunately the final objective of a European Constitution would be exactly the opposite and obviously we cannot approve it.</seg>
<seg id=467> In the strengthened European house, indeed, there will be people sitting at the table, monetary, possibly military tax and then the other peoples who will in hand.</seg>
<seg id=468> It is clear that the second version is not the correct and that, firstly, because the regions are economically delayed in any case covered by the structural funds and, secondly, that if this interpretation was valid, there would have been no reason to adopt the Declaration No 30</seg>
<seg id=469> Mr President, I shall restrict my poor small sixty seconds on the report of Olivier Duhamel, who is a good report, because it may say clearly, and the lyrical our rapporteur has definitely convinced earlier.</seg>
<seg id=470> In my opinion, the unity of Europe cannot be that policy.</seg>
<seg id=471> We believe that the new Constitution should be ready to enter into force for the next European elections.</seg>
<seg id=472> Therefore, the word 'least developed' applies both to the island regions, regions and, if the proposal by Mr Barnier, we must change the Italian version of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention.</seg>
<seg id=473> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=474> Since the colleague said she would vote against Amendment is rejected.</seg>
<seg id=475> Mr President, the amendment which is requested here we would lead straight to chaos.</seg>
<seg id=476> I welcome the adoption of the Trakatellis report by this House because it provides for the establishment of high quality and safety standards for blood and blood derivatives.</seg>
<seg id=477> If European parliamentary immunity is autonomous, the French authorities should we take the waiver of Mr Le Pen.</seg>
<seg id=478> I am particularly disappointed. The vote of the European Parliament on the report on the proliferation of vine varieties.</seg>
<seg id=479> Some consider that alcohol, tobacco and drugs, is likely to cause great damage to those who consume and others. The others consider instead above all as a source of employment and enrich important.</seg>
<seg id=480> The rapporteur reserve in all welcome the proposals in the Commission's White Paper on this subject, but it has, however, fears about the possible implications of the reform, whose main aim and decentralise the application of the competition rules.</seg>
<seg id=481> . In the debate yesterday evening, I am able to welcome Jonathan Evans for his work, I have had to say from the outset my profound disagreement with the imprégnation too liberal, otherwise ultra-liberal, of his report.</seg>
<seg id=482> Aid Ireland has restructured its activity to draw in the Objective 1 area half of all projects' greenfield jobs over the next three years.</seg>
<seg id=483> Faced with the outcry that cause the consequences of this policy, the speeches, funding and other economic and fiscal incentives state just partially compensate the situation.</seg>
<seg id=484> (The sitting was suspended at 14h06 and resumed at 3 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=485> And we are therefore, in October 2000, on the eve of taking a decision on the numbers of the 2001 budget.</seg>
<seg id=486> However, this has not prevented the Council to reduce agricultural expenditure totalling 555 million euros.</seg>
<seg id=487> Of course, we believe that it is not enough simply just create 400 additional posts.</seg>
<seg id=488> I can only invite the Council to follow us.</seg>
<seg id=489> That is why the administration of this House is for Members and not the opposite.</seg>
<seg id=490> At the moment, it is the Court of Auditors which we less concern.</seg>
<seg id=491> Finally, we must deal with the European Ombudsman's budget.</seg>
<seg id=492> On the contrary, we believe that this area should be strengthened in the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=493> We also propose that Parliament continues to be kept regularly informed.</seg>
<seg id=494> When the establishment of a legislative consultation on social affairs, cultural or environmental - the Commissioner would agree that I am right - we meet with the Commissioner for budgets, the Finance Ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets to ask together to that no mistakes financial errors.</seg>
<seg id=495> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your warm welcome.</seg>
<seg id=496> The Council has voted at first reading the appropriations it seem justified for 2001, without taking account of the concerns tactical serving the objective of good allocation of appropriations that the Community institutions must continue.</seg>
<seg id=497> Before you declared your opinion on the draft budget for 2001, I would like to stress a number of objectives which the Council and Parliament have in common and which can result in an agreement between the two branches of the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=498> We are in a similar situation in terms of structural policy.</seg>
<seg id=499> Mr Colom I Naval has indicated, that the consultation of this summer has also led to a good result: in future, Parliament will have better information on legal bases which have an impact on the expenditure side.</seg>
<seg id=500> Let me remind you that the planned financial planning last year for the Balkans only envisaged EUR 1.85 billion for the whole period until 2006.</seg>
<seg id=501> I ask you again without prejudice to examine this proposal which the Commission maintains and bear in mind that possibility.</seg>
<seg id=502> This material has of course been useful for the preparation of the budget for 2001 and for the 1999 discharge.</seg>
<seg id=503> Although I very much appreciate the work of this body as a Member of the Committee on Budgets, although I believe just as the work of the rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgets, I do not want to fail, as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to indicate two amendments that this Commission will once again in the plenary and whose importance is not negligible, despite the modesty of the amounts involved.</seg>
<seg id=504> By these measures, we want to make the legal control once again fully operational, to restore confidence in the legal security within the EU and consolidate the Community of law that is the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=505> Considering the deletion of this initiative without providing any measure to replace the Commission clearly against the political will expressed at Lisbon and priority expressed by this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=506> This decision was quite astonishing and it gave the impression to many of us that the whole of this programme, very important, was simply become a bubble that refer to the Committee on Budgets and the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=507> The third point concerns the common agricultural policy, as defined in the draft budget.</seg>
<seg id=508> If employment is the political priority of the Union, fisheries, as an economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.</seg>
<seg id=509> I particularly welcome that the funding of the Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000, whose pursuit was agreed at the end of last year, has been assured.</seg>
<seg id=510> As regards the aid to the Mediterranean countries, for example, the backlog relates to the budgets for several years.</seg>
<seg id=511> Mr President, during the past years of debates, I used to travel on the floor on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which we have heard this afternoon Mrs Iivari.</seg>
<seg id=512> Nevertheless, I would like to say to the House this afternoon that we must not lose sight of the fact that the European Union spends only 1% of the GDP of the Member States and that most of this money is managed in the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=513> I now turn to the overall strategy.</seg>
<seg id=514> This brings me to the strategy of my group, because the basis our conviction is the desire to give the European citizen for money.</seg>
<seg id=515> On the contrary, we must do everything to ensure that this House is an example of transparency, efficiency and good democratic control of the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=516> We need to reflect on how to solve this problem.</seg>
<seg id=517> We want to promote the process of democratisation and we want to achieve a balance between the traditional areas of foreign policy which we must address.</seg>
<seg id=518> The biggest problems in the new budget concern external actions.</seg>
<seg id=519> It goes without saying that a careful management is necessary, it has our support and we should not deceive ourselves on this point.</seg>
<seg id=520> This is an exceptional initiative, especially at first reading, and this is a thankless initiative, because it cannot, in the current context, obtain a majority of votes in favour.</seg>
<seg id=521> However, the importance of the allocation for Kosovo is not without its problems.</seg>
<seg id=522> Budgetary policy commands the confidence of the citizen in European politics.</seg>
<seg id=523> We must therefore support all measures to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id=524> The level of budgetary implementation;</seg>
<seg id=525> Bearing this strategic line in the approach to the budgets of this year and the years to come, the European Parliament plays its full place in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg id=526> Indeed, with the transfer of EUR 175 million, we have made an assessment of 25 million more than what was planned.</seg>
<seg id=527> As regards the MEDA programme, the Council has said that the commitments are non-problematic given the eight years of payment arrears.</seg>
<seg id=528> I believe that Mr Duff was here this morning, when we have referred to the European Council in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg id=529> My reply will be very simple.</seg>
<seg id=530> Ramiro Zapata was the last 25 defenders of human rights to be murdered recently and the Colombian press has denounced the 100 'paramilitary groups to assassinate cent defenders of human rights.</seg>
<seg id=531> The attitude of the Council gives me a little more today than in July because, as often in crisis situations, the European Union seems to be the last to manifest itself on the international stage and to make its voice heard.</seg>
<seg id=532> The question, Mr President, and I will end here - is whether there is not a means of pressure stronger than that proposed by the President in his information and if the aid that we shall grant will be completely different from that of the United States, i.e., not directed towards the fumigation of cultures, but to their replacement, and also to the social aspects rather than military.</seg>
<seg id=533> The questions that several Members and I have raised relate specifically to the situation in Colombia.</seg>
<seg id=534> As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.</seg>
<seg id=535> Subject: tax on financial transactions the demand for a tax on speculative capital is increasingly gaining ground in recent months with the multiplication of Attac association for committees (taxation on financial transactions and for aid to the citizens) in France and in Europe, and the amendments tabled to the French National Assembly and the Senate.</seg>
<seg id=536> I should also like an answer to the question of its influence on the volatility of the currency markets, including the effect of a tax of 0.1 per thousand on speculators expect devaluations of the order of 20 to 50%.</seg>
<seg id=537> It is also calling for in paragraph 26 the establishment of an international organisation arbitration to cancel the debt of the countries of the South.</seg>
<seg id=538> This is what has happened to the euro on the scale of a year, either for the regret or wish.</seg>
<seg id=539> I wish to add to what Danielle Auroi said earlier in relation to the countries of the South, that some estimates made by specialists, are interesting figures: for example, ranging from 50 to 250 billion dollars, which could be recovered a Tobin-style tax, while at the same time, the UNDP, figure to a sum of USD 40 billion per year, the amount that could be enough to give a minimum living conditions of the hundreds of millions of people who lack any in the countries of the third world.</seg>
<seg id=540> In recent months, cases have been discovered, in particular, in various places in France.</seg>
<seg id=541> I therefore ask the question, as a representative of the French Presidency is here, whether slaughter these cows will be paid on the Community budget or if you pay one thousand on the national budget and if you feel that it would be a good thing that it pays on the Community budget.</seg>
<seg id=542> I would ask your indulgence and ask you to hear the answer?</seg>
<seg id=543> Therefore the action of the two governments concerned is limited by international law.</seg>
<seg id=544> I do not understand how the Commission can already say in February it needs, and the Council in July.</seg>
<seg id=545> In doing so in the name of subsidiarity, the Union is, in reality, one of its duties, as happened in recent weeks, both in the north of Italy and Spain.</seg>
<seg id=546> As an MEP mindful of this majority, how can I endorse the disbursement of GBP 11.5 billion paid by British taxpayers - it is our current annual contribution - if it does not enjoy a broad approval of the public?</seg>
<seg id=547> A flexible attitude of the Council would reach an agreement at second reading in order to complete the budget.</seg>
<seg id=548> If anyone needs to be convinced, he is simply proof.</seg>
<seg id=549> This strategy has already been introduced by Joan Colom I Naval, Vice-President responsible for buildings.</seg>
<seg id=550> The political messages in the budget of this exercise – and Commissioner Schreyer referred to this - are many: the adaptation of the agricultural policy, new structural programmes, better implementation of structural policies, the monitoring of the decisions of the Lisbon Summit for the creation of a European Union stronger and more competitive and combating social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=551> The war waged by NATO has too destroyed and left behind it too much suffering.</seg>
<seg id=552> Despite what has been agreed, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to achieve this objective within the existing budget without prejudicing the agricultural budget for a sustainable rural sector in the current Member States.</seg>
<seg id=553> And I say to you very clearly: we must give its chance Kostunica and I therefore hope that it will provide an amnesty during the weeks and months ahead; but in the meantime, I hope, however, that, politically and in terms of the budget, the political conditions are linked to the introduction of these two new budgetary lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=554> The elections held in Yugoslavia have shown two things: people have finally had enough of the dictator Milosevic and they have placed their trust to Professor Kostunica.</seg>
<seg id=555> I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners will also be released shortly.</seg>
<seg id=556> Otherwise, we would be in the "inevitable" in the financial engineering redistribution and cuts in social expenditure, both environmental and in cooperation, without being sure provided that the funds allocated to the Balkans are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id=557> In the same context, it is time to solve major social problems such as unemployment, for example.</seg>
<seg id=558> There is, of course, a very important point is the fact that we have started category four, with his approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to solve the problem, particularly because the Council does not wish to participate in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id=559> The priorities are an important element in every budget work.</seg>
<seg id=560> This does not result in the run-up to the expiry of the Treaty, but it would be worrying if the post-ECSC legal framework to maintain such practices.</seg>
<seg id=561> This brings me to my third remark on the task that is now before us.</seg>
<seg id=562> Distrust of EU politicians continues to grow, as I found.</seg>
<seg id=563> I pay tribute to them for that.</seg>
<seg id=564> The provision in the discussion of all the institutions concerned has been exemplary collaboration with which we can - I hope - to reach agreement at first reading.</seg>
<seg id=565> We who are committed to European values in a country eurosceptic, now we will have a further argument for the EU, namely a more effective protection of persons, which is important for the citizens in modern society.</seg>
<seg id=566> I have noted that my own country is preparing to make a change in the law on personal data which is, as it stands, deprives the elected influence on the decisions of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=567> Many other points also cause problems and deserve the judgement of practice to be insured.</seg>
<seg id=568> The Commission would first like to remind you of the commitment that we have all taken towards the citizens to ensure the protection of personal data processed by the institutions.</seg>
<seg id=569> In this Declaration, the Commission will accept that the scope of the regulation should be limited solely to the activities of the first pillar.</seg>
<seg id=570> In order to honour the agreement it has concluded with the Council and the rapporteur to be approved at first reading, the Commission rejects any other amendment that would not be the Paciotti report approved by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, but Amendment No 69, which corrects Amendment No 41.</seg>
<seg id=571> Thus, it is urgent that the staff of the interservice group are very quickly strengthened at the heart of the secretariat of the committee, so that all the proposed act of general scope can be accompanied by the college in their discussion on the basis of Article 299, paragraph 2, a fiche d'impact detailed.</seg>
<seg id=572> The Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market we believe that it is important to stress that we cannot compare that which is comparable.</seg>
<seg id=573> Given the importance of fisheries for the outermost regions, I can only be saddened by this.</seg>
<seg id=574> Since the setting-up of an interservices group for the outermost regions under the chairmanship of Mr Delors, a long and fruitful progress has been made so far and I wish to express the heartfelt thanks of Europeans of the outermost regions to anyone who chaired this group.</seg>
<seg id=575> Indeed, if the Treaty of Rome, reference was made to the French overseas departments, we had to wait until 1989 and the programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature, the famous POSEI programmes, so that the European Union has finally conceded that the permanence and combination of structural handicaps of outermost regions justified special treatment in relation to other regions of the Community.</seg>
<seg id=576> I do not doubt that the proposals that the Commission will the Council will bear the name of these qualities.</seg>
<seg id=577> This question is all the more relevant that we are approaching a enlargement of the Union to the East.</seg>
<seg id=578> This right to difference is nothing else, who is more, that a product of the principle of equality, which requires also addressing differently what is different.</seg>
<seg id=579> It is a document which we consider, my team and myself, as rich in ideas, proposals, which goes to the heart of the problems and issues of concern sidestepping any outermost regions of the Community.</seg>
<seg id=580> Your report, Mrs Sudre, emphasizes, rightly, on the need to act in the long term.</seg>
<seg id=581> With regard to the relaunch of the diversification of the economy, we have made progress in several key areas.</seg>
<seg id=582> Now it is important that a large number of projects is presented in the framework of SPDs, however, alongside this action on the ground, we must consider in depth the needs, access, specific to each of these outermost regions to this information society.</seg>
<seg id=583> Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg id=584> Of course I will communicate your speech to the President.</seg>
<seg id=585> I am concerned about the risk of a general failure of a large number of machinery and rules which would then question the decisions of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=586> This food authority and the legislative proposals that have been presented to us, to guarantee food safety, will have the support of this Parliament, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=587> The main task of this authority will be a task of scientific advice, because the debate on food safety must be "pure" too.</seg>
<seg id=588> Mr President, I would like once again to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and for his openness to the opinions of the other committees.</seg>
<seg id=589> When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to implement the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg id=590> On the issue always controversial to what extent we need to allow it to focus on nutrition, really to give advice and be consulted by those who concern themselves mainly for risk management, we have also said that, when it comes to safety, these matters should at least be the task of consultation of this food safety authority.</seg>
<seg id=591> A central element of this last point is to ensure that the rich heritage traditions which is ours can continue.</seg>
<seg id=592> The elements that will enable this respectability to see the day does call or laws or legislation, but rather integrity, academic quality irreproachable and independence, accountability, transparency and comprehensibility.</seg>
<seg id=593> A good scientific knowledge is certainly necessary to assess the risks to the food chain, from farm to fork.</seg>
<seg id=594> Mr President, the enthusiasm for the establishment of a European food safety agency, as our rapporteur would prefer to call it, is obviously considerable.</seg>
<seg id=595> As the programme of the who is properly financed and supported, it does not seem to be necessary to create a body more, especially not an agency whose scope is limited to the 15 Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=596> Food safety is an essential condition for the consumer; indeed, they want to be able to eat healthily and it is up to us to ensure that it does.</seg>
<seg id=597> If there are no new framework directive, we can only smile about many things in the field of food safety.</seg>
<seg id=598> We must therefore amend the Treaty on European Union so that the Commission has the power to impose sanctions in the field of food, exactly as it can do this today in the field of competition.</seg>
<seg id=599> I support all the actors involved, be they political, administrative or other, working in the context of the strategy 'food for all'.</seg>
<seg id=600> I do not agree with these words, because we can discover that a man is more than a body.</seg>
<seg id=601> It must be the true brain coordination of the network of national agencies, which, in turn, must activate and coordinate a network of centres of excellence food safety at regional level.</seg>
<seg id=602> I am also of the opinion that your Amendment No 11 and my Amendment 17 are perfectly compatible.</seg>
<seg id=603> The reform of the European Union's food legislation should be done at European Union level.</seg>
<seg id=604> His report does not propose both changes that it focuses on a number of elements.</seg>
<seg id=605> We have made clear in the report, and I welcome it wholeheartedly.</seg>
<seg id=606> However, the creation of a European agency on food safety is very positive.</seg>
<seg id=607> It is to be hoped that, in the interests of European consumers, they will be respected.</seg>
<seg id=608> We must, I think, to define precise deadlines in which it must notify the European Commission least causing justified concern.</seg>
<seg id=609> The EU must have the highest standards of food safety for its citizens.</seg>
<seg id=610> The Commission now proposes the creation of a European Food Safety Authority.</seg>
<seg id=611> I fear that Europe is again exposes the risk of giving itself a huge administrative apparatus, unable to act.</seg>
<seg id=612> Indeed, the returns is inversely proportional to the levels of bureaucracy and the level of expenditure incurred.</seg>
<seg id=613> Parallel duplication and prevent the work in several institutions.</seg>
<seg id=614> However, we must avoid that, in the shadow of the debate on the White Paper, public opinion will not grow in fear of a bureaucratic Europe which affects the quality of products without remedy effectively fraud that threaten the health of consumers.</seg>
<seg id=615> As you know, the Commission attaches the greatest importance to its strategy in the field of food safety.</seg>
<seg id=616> The Commission intends to adopt a proposal for a regulation establishing the principles and objectives which will form the cornerstone of food legislation and will form the framework for future health protection measures concerning food.</seg>
<seg id=617> Thank you very much, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id=618> Turning to my report, I believe the Commission proposal and I must add that the Committees on Foreign Affairs and development have done much to improve it, in particular on certain points.</seg>
<seg id=619> As Mrs Bonino has clearly said, there has been a step forward by the Commission's proposal for a regulation.</seg>
<seg id=620> The Commission proposal for a regulation seems to us very vague.</seg>
<seg id=621> It is necessary to organise properly the allocation demining operations and fund research into the work of detection and mine clearance and for the instruments which may be used simply in order to help the developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=622> During the past eight years, the European Union has spent more than EUR 200 million from the Community budget to the fight against anti-personnel landmines.</seg>
<seg id=623> But we cannot penalize the peoples whose government commits abuses.</seg>
<seg id=624> Firstly, as I have said, I think it would be a mistake, therefore a good sense but nonetheless even counterproductive, accession to the Ottawa Convention an absolute condition for granting Community aid for the fight against anti-personnel landmines.</seg>
<seg id=625> I cannot accept Amendment No 19.</seg>
<seg id=626> Secondly, the international community is suffering from a lack of coordination of its efforts at world level and particularly in the countries affected.</seg>
<seg id=627> Mr President, the Socialist Group shares the pride that has just been expressed by Mr Van Orden about the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=628> Remember the Soviet bombes-jouets in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=629> Thank you for the quality of his report.</seg>
<seg id=630> Mr President, the Cambodians call the eternal sentinelles mines.</seg>
<seg id=631> The population has justified suspicion towards uniform forces, whatever they may be, which is explained by long years of war.</seg>
<seg id=632> Mr President, I welcome the fact that there are finally European legislation, in the form of regulation, on anti-personnel mines and that we now have a good report by Mrs Bonino on this subject.</seg>
<seg id=633> - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are in a very sad.</seg>
<seg id=634> This is no coincidence that mines are, firstly, in areas of crisis, in other words in regions which could take initiatives of a different nature to overcome these crises.</seg>
<seg id=635> Two kilometres of a group of Bosnia, in 1999, a sign indicating the presence of mines in an area, which does not prevent the presence on the scene of a boy.</seg>
<seg id=636> It is tragic that the civilian population that suffers from the inability of its leaders.</seg>
<seg id=637> On the eve of the fourth Euro-Mediterranean ministerial conference, which will take place on 15 and 16 November in Marseilles, I am convinced that your work with our delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries, chaired by Mr Obiols i Germà, will allow us to make progress on our draft dialogue and peace.</seg>
<seg id=638> All the mines are stored in deposits.</seg>
<seg id=639> - (DE) Mr President, since I agree with almost everything that my colleagues have said, it seems necessary to repeat it. I therefore refuse to use my speaking time.</seg>
<seg id=640> Your conception of open cooperation is relapsing into the institutional framework dominated by Commission officials.</seg>
<seg id=641> We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken at the closest possible level of those concerned.</seg>
<seg id=642> Since, however, the main amendments tabled by the PPE Group come to find a large majority, I voted for the report.</seg>
<seg id=643> Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the resolution on the results of the informal European Council meeting in Biarritz, for two reasons: the first because I voted separately, by roll-call, paragraphs 2 and 5, which has enabled me to express my opposition frank in relation to these two paragraphs.</seg>
<seg id=644> In other words, around the table of the common European house, some mangeraient à la carte menu and other minimum.</seg>
<seg id=645> We can, of course, always do better, and democratic control must not weaken. But we believe, listing of these rights and their inclusion in the Treaties were not the priority of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=646> There have been discussions about the referenda and amendments which have been tabled on this subject.</seg>
<seg id=647> In the 1999 elections to the European Parliament, turnout has achieved that 40%, if we exclude the countries in which the vote is compulsory, and where this European ballot was combined with national elections.</seg>
<seg id=648> In order to achieve the objective of a European Constitution – what we want - we must avoid imposing rigid and methodologies schemes, which would lead to the failure of the desired objective.</seg>
<seg id=649> A genuine social constitution should bring upwards, the best in the world of work, women, immigrants and the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=650> Without denying the laudable intention to improve, clarify and deepen the European Union, as well as to simplify texts for the closer to the citizens, I did not vote for this resolution.</seg>
<seg id=651> The allocation of powers and responsibilities</seg>
<seg id=652> I consider it crucial to the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU entails membership of the Union to the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=653> But the report by Mr Gil-Robles has to help me, because it proposes for a few subjects, sectors and materials, some Member States of the European Union to agree on a joint action.</seg>
<seg id=654> The determination to make that an increasing number of decisions on important areas should be taken by qualified majority is contrary to the basic democratic standards.</seg>
<seg id=655> Today, he is trying to prevent the relaxation of strengthened cooperation, and it will lose part, too.</seg>
<seg id=656> This report seeks to achieve the position taken in this sense of our Parliament (resolution of 13 April 2000).</seg>
<seg id=657> . (SV) our opinion about this so-called flexible integration is generally positive.</seg>
<seg id=658> . The British Labour Members of the PSE Group welcomes the support given to the contribution to the work of the IGC on closer cooperation, without adhere entirely with all the details of this.</seg>
<seg id=659> These islands must feel part of the European Union which, I hope, will make a paradise for tourists and their inhabitants themselves.</seg>
<seg id=660> In the Middle Ages, those regions and their peoples do not belong to Europe, and today they are not really European considered.</seg>
<seg id=661> Indeed, the special features of these areas, which are in general of the remoteness and insularity compared with the European continent, but also of their chronic dependence on a limited number of products or even a single production, require specific measures adapted to overcoming these constraints.</seg>
<seg id=662> Mr President, I apologize if I still forces the Presidency and the interpreters to listen to my last explanation of vote and would particularly like to express my solidarity with the translators our explanations of vote, I regard the buson Italian ornella.</seg>
<seg id=663> It would appear in fact clear that the Agency has aimed to capture the powers of national defence, or paralyse, to serve the objectives of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=664> This does not mean that the Commission and Parliament to christen this agency 'European authority', which is totally contrary to the philosophy which is supposed to the inspiration.</seg>
<seg id=665> This is not quite what we propose the Bowis report, where one has the feeling that food safety is mainly regarded as an excuse for the well-known process of strengthening the powers of the Commission to the detriment of national bodies and the security of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=666> Also, I think, by this statement, condemn these indescribable actions on behalf of our European Parliament, which has always advocated the respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all communities.</seg>
<seg id=667> Madam President, I understand the criticism of the rapporteur. However, in voting for the amendments of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, one does not vote only appropriations but also for or against a certain direction of policy.</seg>
<seg id=668> I would ask you to support the amendment of the line a-206 purchase property ',', in the amendments which will be adopted, so that we do not exceed our own limited ceiling of 20% of total administrative expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=669> Before the vote on the proposal to amend 929</seg>
<seg id=670> Section VI - Economic and Social Committee</seg>
<seg id=671> Report (A5-0276 / 2000) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of the stock of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES Division VIIa) (COM (2000) 0190 - C5-0219 / 2000 - 2000 / 0071 (CNS))</seg>
<seg id=672> (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=673> Export subsidies for the disposal at low prices on the world market and food surpluses, which creates a serious disadvantage in terms of competition for the agri-foodstuff industry many countries, for example in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=674> To gain the necessary financial means an increase in aid to the Balkans, the Member States must make a redistribution of are available within the framework of the budget.</seg>
<seg id=675> However, Parliament was able to adopt a number of important priorities – including an increased effort in the fight against unemployment and poverty, on a number of important issues relating to the environment and to equal opportunities, etc. We voted against the attack by the right to life programme and the European Women's Lobby.</seg>
<seg id=676> - (SV) We maintain our view of travel allowances for MEPs, namely that only actual travel costs incurred in which fall within the scope of their mission must be reimbursed.</seg>
<seg id=677> I assume – and I hope that the Commission will seek constructive solutions to this effect - that we will have to cover the period between 2002 and 2005 through a transitional regulation.</seg>
<seg id=678> - (DE) obsessive in its desire to regulate and liberalise but mainly with a view to muzzle the national parliaments, the European Commission has tabled a proposal for a regulation with a view to immediate application and compulsory, instead of a proposal for a directive, which must be dealt with in the cravache to Parliament and the Council to enter into force by 31 December this year.</seg>
<seg id=679> We therefore support the efforts made by the Commission in order to reform this sector and we shall oppose any new measures to encourage it.</seg>
<seg id=680> A development which made capital borrowed heavily dependent.</seg>
<seg id=681> Nicholson report (a-0276 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=682> It is important to ensure that the sums allocated to aid are not used for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id=683> Our firm opinion that the reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will mainly be obtained at the cost will have to pay the real polluters (i.e. the major industries), to the detriment of their excessive profits.</seg>
<seg id=684> Moreira da Silva report (A5-0271 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=685> We should spend this money, by harmonising and coordinating expenditure on research policy in all 15 Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=686> If only by the precautionary principle, we have reason to learn more about these substances.</seg>
<seg id=687> Voting time is over.</seg>
<seg id=688> This European format will replace the national format which is already being used everywhere at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=689> The loss of data used to balance of payments statistics which would result from this amendment would be minimal.</seg>
<seg id=690> We must realise that it is mainly the small and medium-sized enterprises, which are affected by this problem.</seg>
<seg id=691> For years now, we are pleading with harmonisation of efforts in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=692> I believe that this report is of crucial importance to a genuine integration of citizens, of small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro zone and to increase acceptance of economic and monetary union.</seg>
<seg id=693> The free movement of capital in single currency cannot accommodate obstacles or disparities.</seg>
<seg id=694> However, the European Parliament and the Commission really attach great importance.</seg>
<seg id=695> I support the dual policy that wants to follow the rapporteur to encourage banks too incapable to act.</seg>
<seg id=696> We cannot compel banks to exert activity unprofitable, but as politicians, what we can do is support the amendment tabled on behalf of the PPE-DE Group by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs for measures to be taken before the end of the year, and preferably that these standards are become reality when we begin to use the euro coins and notes.</seg>
<seg id=697> It is in this direction that is the proposal that I have introduced with Mrs Peijs: the banks around a table, not to impose constraints, but because we cannot strengthen political pressure.</seg>
<seg id=698> It goes without saying that if the cross-border payment systems are also ladies that today the credibility of these new coins and notes will be directly called into question.</seg>
<seg id=699> We are of the opinion that this accumulation of statistical data on the Union's national payments are a relic of the past which is no longer justified in a unified integrated area, and it is an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the market.</seg>
<seg id=700> Listening to the speeches of some of my colleagues in the committee, those who this House for longer than I had the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, which this Parliament is submitting for the fourth time, belonged to that category.</seg>
<seg id=701> Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you in advance for the support that you bring to my report.</seg>
<seg id=702> If it is at European level, we must strengthen the opportunities offered to regions.</seg>
<seg id=703> The main source of job creation, both in terms of quality and quantity, SMEs play a crucial role in social cohesion and for land-use planning.</seg>
<seg id=704> The care and attention that she has brought to the study of the proposals and consultation that it was the desire to hold with many interested parties have been an asset to better define and optimising the implementation of this programme.</seg>
<seg id=705> Thirdly, we must pursue the European added value.</seg>
<seg id=706> It follows that small and medium-sized enterprises can only live if unemployment is weak and if public budgets are free of debts and sufficiently supplied to provide such investments.</seg>
<seg id=707> Businesses need clarity.</seg>
<seg id=708> Above all, unipersonnelle when a company or a society with fewer than 250 employees has a project, it must be possible to receive financing not only with a guarantee to 120%, but also on the basis of a good idea.</seg>
<seg id=709> The national States, even the regional or local authorities are already huge pumps, finance, designed to channel taxpayers' money, that is to say the are levied on the majority of the population, including the most disadvantaged to large companies and consequently to their owners and shareholders.</seg>
<seg id=710> The breeding ground of small and medium-sized enterprises includes thousands of fragile tests which big business in staff and ideas.</seg>
<seg id=711> I expect the Commissioner, particularly among all the measures we have proposed here is that it facilitates and speeding up access to aid and information for the heads of SMEs are able to use information with efficiency.</seg>
<seg id=712> All these occupy a special place in the multiannual programme.</seg>
<seg id=713> Finally, I welcome the idea of giving an annual meeting in order to make an assessment of the implementation of the programme.</seg>
<seg id=714> The recent incidents against the Greek minority of Himara make more imperative that we need to promote measures for democratisation, institution-building and respect for human rights in Albania.</seg>
<seg id=715> An impressive number of Albanians leave their countries because of insecurity there, social problems, prémodernes family and social structures.</seg>
<seg id=716> We need preventive measures tailored to Albania and helping to build and reconstruction of the country in order to be able to live with dignity in this region.</seg>
<seg id=717> That is how the travel documents of a body to another and that the European Commission, for example, refuses to publish the report concerning, among other things, also the Customs Assistance Mission (cam), drawn up by the Albanians.</seg>
<seg id=718> Try to look the truth in the face.</seg>
<seg id=719> Mrs Karamanou, congratulations on the point of view that oversaw the extended concept of your report.</seg>
<seg id=720> It is a very important subject which is shaped by factors historical, social, political and economic.</seg>
<seg id=721> We will never know the exact number of victims.</seg>
<seg id=722> The common economic activities create peaceful links between people.</seg>
<seg id=723> What I find rather unacceptable in this report, and I say this with frankly, is that it confuses the effect and the cause, i.e. the confuses a procedure for granting visas, balanced and therefore the possibility of migration, with the question of illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id=724> The major institutional changes which are the consequence of the Treaty of Amsterdam has had an impact on the management of asylum and immigration.</seg>
<seg id=725> Thirdly and lastly, the action plan and its implementation must be considered at regional level.</seg>
<seg id=726> Of course, this requirement we also invites us to show restraint in terms of European regulations.</seg>
<seg id=727> It is now or never to place particular emphasis on the strength of Community action.</seg>
<seg id=728> I also calls for proposals codified are introduced to change current European legislation to incorporate the amendments in the existing directives or regulations.</seg>
<seg id=729> The principle of subsidiarity, if it is understood, we committed in two directions: take decisions at the lowest possible level, but that the lowest possible level can be a very high level, when the general interests are at stake and threatened if they are not protected everywhere in a uniform manner.</seg>
<seg id=730> This report is a model of conciseness and clarity and I hope colleagues will reflect seriously.</seg>
<seg id=731> The report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market has not caused the enthusiasm of its Members.</seg>
<seg id=732> That is what I referred in the report on the SLIM project, because Community legislation, and Mr Medina has just prove with the reading of one of the articles of the Treaty, is scarcely comprehensible, even by experts.</seg>
<seg id=733> Therefore, certain aspects of the report enthuse me because I would have preferred a more 'communitarising' with regard to the internal market, and, above all, because the report does not go in this direction on this point.</seg>
<seg id=734> What is important for the institutions of the Union, is that we are firmly committed to improve the quality of legislation, in particular taking account of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=735> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=736> The persistence of this situation could have a negative impact on the citizens with regard to the euro.</seg>
<seg id=737> Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Internal Affairs has prepared carefully the Karamanou report.</seg>
<seg id=738> Having said that, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to take advantage of our oral question and this debate to address both sides - since our motion for a resolution is addressed to both parties, and I would like to make a few observations calmly.</seg>
<seg id=739> The people of the Union that we represent here demand it.</seg>
<seg id=740> On water has passed under the bridge, the agreement is, however, reached its conclusion and has not been extended.</seg>
<seg id=741> I can understand why the Commissioner but not those of the Director-General.</seg>
<seg id=742> We could say that, after the eleven tie-up, we continue to pay the previous agreement and prior to the earlier.</seg>
<seg id=743> Mr President, we had a similar debate a year and the fact that it has taken a year to begin negotiations shows how difficult it is to find the resources for the big fleets of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=744> At the second agreement, things were very clear.</seg>
<seg id=745> But we must also understand that nothing is eternal, not even the stocks!</seg>
<seg id=746> That is why I would particularly like to say clearly that if the PPE-DE Group is distinguished from other, this is not only for having supported, defended and promoted the fisheries agreements, but also for pushing their extension significantly.</seg>
<seg id=747> Thirdly, since the fisheries agreement is interrupted, the exploitation of the fishing fleets of the Sahara by Community and non-Community which are not subject to the control of the Commission or the Member States continues, it is above all important fleet in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id=748> I well understand, because fishing is a source of income and employment important for this poor area - compared to European standards.</seg>
<seg id=749> The other point I would like to emphasise is that the temporary aid paid to fishermen and shipowners in compensation for this year without work end at the end of the month. It is an untenable situation for them all, they prefer to work instead of receiving aid.</seg>
<seg id=750> A year ago, as a Member of the Partido Andalucista, I am negotiating and I propose initiatives in the corridors, in the offices in the Fisheries Committee and during the hearings with the Commissioner in order to take into account the special any particular idiosyncrasies of the Andalusian fishing fleet which fishes in Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=751> Spain has developed a remarkably positive the difficult neighbourhood, which has always existed between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=752> As a Spanish MEP and Andalucista, I support the right of thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families to maintain and defend, and that this Parliament also, defend their jobs, which are jeopardised for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id=753> We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=754> A history of almost twelve years, good words spoken by the authorities, delaying tactics, hopes, also personal needs placebos, for the people concerned, unstinting defence of old rights for citizens, who wanted nothing other than their own common law.</seg>
<seg id=755> As you know, the case is very complex and concern approximately 700 people working in more than 25 Italian universities.</seg>
<seg id=756> If the Italian legal order is reformed and amended, as has been the case for the university staff, we do not believe that the Commission can intervene therefore that any European citizen enjoys equal access to all categories of professions.</seg>
<seg id=757> The injustice lies in the fact that two people doing the same job and working side-by-side receive unequal pay and are subject to different conditions.</seg>
<seg id=758> In my view, there is nothing worse than having to warn people that a judgment in their favour could only be a series of reassuring words and have no practical effect on their existence.</seg>
<seg id=759> I remind you, I would remind the Commission that I hope a reaction to the fact that, in the case allué, the judgment by the Court specifies that it is contrary to Article 48 (2) of the EC Treaty that legislation from one Member State limit the duration of contracts of employment of foreign language assistants to a year with the possibility of renewal, if there is any restriction of this kind in principle against the other teachers.</seg>
<seg id=760> I believe, however, that these cases go to the heart of the fundamental principles of freedom associated with European law, particularly freedom of movement, and no exception cannot be tolerated in relation to these principles.</seg>
<seg id=761> As shown in the current debate, we still encounter many obstacles, many obstacles on the path of this internal market, and not only in this case.</seg>
<seg id=762> We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg id=763> (The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=764> On behalf of Parliament, I immediately sent to the President, Mr Thomas Klestil, as well as the Chancellor, Mr Wolfgang Schüssel, the messages of condolence and solidarity in the test that such a tragedy calls for the victims, their families and the entire Austrian people.</seg>
<seg id=765> Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg id=766> I support the proposal of Mr Ceyhun, and I would be very grateful if the Council whether it could inform us whether he intends to submit a new proposal on this matter.</seg>
<seg id=767> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group considers this incident of such importance that we believe that it would not be treated as it should be in the framework of the urgent debate.</seg>
<seg id=768> I have the feeling that you join the motivation, Mr Barón Crespo, if I have understood you correctly.</seg>
<seg id=769> Madam President, some time ago, we discussed in this House the issue of sanctions against Iraq.</seg>
<seg id=770> It is urgent that we have a debate on this subject before the entry into force of the modifications proposed by the British authorities; the Commission must also say quite clearly that this is the right in this respect.</seg>
<seg id=771> (A5-0314 / 2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the adoption of a convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, particularly in the area of the fight against organised crime, the laundering of proceeds of crime and criminality in financial terms (10213 / 2000 - C5-0394 / 2000 - 2000 / 0815 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg id=772> Statements must be matched by action to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.</seg>
<seg id=773> The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot remain in the hands of a specialist agency under the sole control of national governments.</seg>
<seg id=774> On the other hand, Article 8 of the draft Convention restricted solely to the essential interests grounds for refusal assistance that could invoke the requested state.</seg>
<seg id=775> First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Marinho for his work and say how the fight against economic crime deserves not only our support, but also our vigilance.</seg>
<seg id=776> Spot, continue, condemn the money laundering terrorists and arms dealers and drugs: yes, of course!</seg>
<seg id=777> Our task is to detect, to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of organized crime.</seg>
<seg id=778> These elements are in the amendments and, judging by the debates in committee, I am confident that they will be approved by Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=779> It seems to me that this set of initiatives is in a way which is likely to destroy the protection offered by Article 6 of the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</seg>
<seg id=780> But the reality is not as simple as that.</seg>
<seg id=781> Finally, Mr President, the PPE Group supports the compromise amendment which we have reached with Mrs Roure about the activities of lawyers.</seg>
<seg id=782> The second measure, the second instrument, is harmonisation.</seg>
<seg id=783> Other speakers have already welcomed this Portuguese initiative.</seg>
<seg id=784> That was the aim of the joint meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the Ecofin Council of 17 October.</seg>
<seg id=785> The best way to strengthen parliamentary control and judicial control over Europol, is to integrate completely the Europol Convention in the legal framework of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=786> The creation of a Provisional Judicial Cooperation Unit is a step in the right direction, which the European Parliament is not a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id=787> This is the sense of guarantees, namely move this aspect of freedoms.</seg>
<seg id=788> The European Parliament is the Community supranational body to establish this report, and I therefore ask you to support the validity in supporting our rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=789> Only when the institutional model and the rules which will govern the European area of justice will be specified that the citizens and Parliament will decide on the measures that the Council is proposing.</seg>
<seg id=790> Eurojust is a logical step of this work, which aims to give the citizens a high level of safety within an area of justice, security and freedom, strengthening the fight against serious forms of organised crime.</seg>
<seg id=791> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on the excellent report she has presented to us, in the wake of the decisions taken at the Tampere Council.</seg>
<seg id=792> However, as with Eurojust, the coordination of national public prosecutors and judges to combat all forms of serious crime - and here I agree with the approach of the rapporteur - it broadens the concept: we no longer talk only cooperation on purely transnational crimes, we also talk of cooperation for the suppression of criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id=793> We will have the opportunity to engage ourselves in this provisional unit, from 1 January 2001, but the Commission wants to support the debate on what must be the definitive Eurojust unit.</seg>
<seg id=794> On the other side, there was positions frank - I think - which, however, have not led to the oppositions inflexible.</seg>
<seg id=795> The problems at the level of expenditure have not too concerned; other areas were much more worrying.</seg>
<seg id=796> It is unacceptable that we have not clear objectives and we cannot measure the results; this would in any other institution.</seg>
<seg id=797> A second point, Commissioner: as regards the hierarchy of ordering, overlapping unacceptable really have been discovered.</seg>
<seg id=798> I want to emphasise that it has played a positive role in a number of problems.</seg>
<seg id=799> It is clear that this does not work in a consortium duality in joint financial responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=800> Therefore, we have really worked to the recovery of 3.4 million, and we can say that we have achieved more than 90%.</seg>
<seg id=801> Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg id=802> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of nine months of work and a long search for compromise, so the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=803> Even if it is only today to say "yes" to this Charter, I hope that this House will leave no doubt over the next few weeks, on the fact that it requires the Council that this Charter should be legally binding and that the latter must guarantee citizens' access to the Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id=804> This position is, as you know, the position taken by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Biarritz, who have themselves approved unanimously and without reservation, the Charter and I can therefore only urge you, on behalf of the Council, to follow this position, perhaps you indicating a few reasons.</seg>
<seg id=805> But it is above all by the strength of its content that the Charter, I am sure, will be.</seg>
<seg id=806> For its part, the European Trade Union Confederation has been complaining about what she believes to be gaps, such as the lack of reference to the right to a minimum wage for example.</seg>
<seg id=807> It remains personalities, including members of the European Parliament, have proposed that an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be included in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which already reference to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=808> Our group has unanimously approved the Charter, with the exception of the British delegation.</seg>
<seg id=809> As the European People 's Party, we are unanimously in favour of the inclusion as quickly as possible of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties, so that it has the force of law for immediate the citizens of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=810> They have shown that we could work on European issues in a new way and exemplary, superior to that of the Intergovernmental Conference, because it gives these work open character and democratic, enabling citizens to fully exercise their right of scrutiny and to participate.</seg>
<seg id=811> The right to health, social security, housing or minimum income are non-existent or only in solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=812> Fourthly, and this is particularly significant to me the Charter assumes the indivisibility of civil and political rights, on the one hand, and social rights.</seg>
<seg id=813> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this Charter is simply the umpteenth demonstration of the capacity of the Union and our Member States to increase the texts empty declarations of intent.</seg>
<seg id=814> The Commission representative in Turin has added to the Convention document a legal significance.</seg>
<seg id=815> After the market, the Europe of rights is perhaps finally arrived. The concept of citizenship in the European Union is a fairly new concept.</seg>
<seg id=816> The Charter is drafted as a text which can have a legally binding.</seg>
<seg id=817> I also note with pride that a representative of the group to which I belong, Mr Gunnar jansson the Finnish Parliament, has played a very important role in the drafting of the Charter.</seg>
<seg id=818> As I said yesterday evening - I repeat today - there are too many shortcomings, everywhere in the Union and, sometimes, overwhelmed by our desire to develop judicial and police cooperation, we neglect the importance of ensuring that the innocent, do not become the passive victims of collateral damage of the war against crime.</seg>
<seg id=819> Madam President, the draft resolution of the European Parliament on the Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the same ambiguity that the work of the House.</seg>
<seg id=820> The Italian Constitution, for example, the limit of good customs; the Convention provides for the rights of others, public order.</seg>
<seg id=821> Mr President, today, in the vote that will take place at 12 noon, we will put an end to a process that began in 1984, when the European Parliament approved the draft Treaty on European Union, where was the request for a statement of rights, a process that we have pursued in 1989 with the resolution of Mr De Gucht.</seg>
<seg id=822> The Charter will produce effects. It will, it appears in the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=823> It is to be applauded and not to fear seems to believe, as Mr Bonde.</seg>
<seg id=824> It seems that all struggles for the emancipation of disadvantaged social classes of the century which ends have been ineffective and we have learned nothing.</seg>
<seg id=825> The Charter fills a gap in the right, it reinforces the protection of individuals against the attacks they could be the subject of the part of the European police authorities who are fighting fraud and those overseeing competition.</seg>
<seg id=826> I do not understand those who oppose the Charter on the pretext that it does not contain everything they would like.</seg>
<seg id=827> Mr President, I will continue in the same vein as Mr Gahrton.</seg>
<seg id=828> I would like to make a third remark about the rights of third country nationals.</seg>
<seg id=829> As the Court of Human Rights, the Council of Europe has also solid experience as regards such forms of control. We can take as a basis.</seg>
<seg id=830> In view of the text of the Charter that we are going to approve - by a large majority, I hope - today, it is clear that we will have a greater protection of fundamental rights and more up to date, that would have enabled the accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=831> That is why it is necessary to make further progress.</seg>
<seg id=832> This is vital if we are to win the support of the European population to the Charter.</seg>
<seg id=833> After its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be my type of analysis for this report and, as far as my personal resources, intellectuals and the staff who will be given me will allow me, I will make an analysis right by law, country by country adherence to the Charter in the fifteen countries of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=834> Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would first like to join with President Mr Moscovici, and welcome the essential contribution that Members of the European Parliament have given to the debate in the Convention, in particular the role that Mr Méndez de Vigo has played in the Praesidium of the Convention drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=835> I am not going to that some of the main points of this debate.</seg>
<seg id=836> The Convention chose to include of fundamental rights inspired the various instruments of the Council of Europe, the Treaties and the constitutions of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=837> The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:</seg>
<seg id=838> As things stand, it is also up to our Parliament to tell the Turkish people that there are now three conditions for its accession.</seg>
<seg id=839> Moreover, it would not have been possible to establish conditions only by a decision of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=840> That is why I have taken careful note of suggestions made by Mr Morillon on the conditions for the accession of Turkey and they deserve the greatest interest.</seg>
<seg id=841> I am pleased to say that, in the meantime, the Turkish Government has accepted this partnership as a basis for future cooperation, which leaves us hope to achieve our goals, i.e. to help by our policy, the reform-minded forces in Turkey give new impetus to the reform process and the move towards accession sought to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=842> For me, the most important point is that Helsinki was triggered in Turkey, in Turkish public opinion, a debate on the conditions for the accession of Turkey to the EU and that this debate supports and promotes the reform-minded forces of the country.</seg>
<seg id=843> This text is submitted for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id=844> What is meant to do now is to give an impetus in the framework of future accession.</seg>
<seg id=845> I do not know how the vote but I would urge Turkey to treat this issue seriously.</seg>
<seg id=846> The European Parliament will play its role in the promotion of relations with political parties, NGOs and the press, and in the development of its complex and sometimes tense relationship with the Grand National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id=847> Mr Morillon, your report is, in my view, quite realistic and responsible.</seg>
<seg id=848> On the occasion of your visit to Turkey in March, as now, you have at least specifically mentioned the problem of the Kurdish population.</seg>
<seg id=849> There is both very naïve and a large enough to consider that Europeans will bring the Turks, and I quote: 'in a radical change in their habits and mentality'.</seg>
<seg id=850> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us, I have serious concerns.</seg>
<seg id=851> Recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the approval of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487 / 1 / 00 C5-0570 / 2000 - 2000 / 2233 (AVC))</seg>
<seg id=852> Nevertheless, we will, the next time we discuss the power technology, we realised that we must control therefore a broader and more respect for the human person.</seg>
<seg id=853> Duff / Voggenhuber recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=854> Indicative include:</seg>
<seg id=855> The rights contained in the Charter are already enshrined in national constitutions and defended by the national parliaments close to the people and their cultures.</seg>
<seg id=856> For example, Article 19-1, which states that: 'collective expulsions are prohibited', does not specify that this ban can be suspended in the event of war or serious unrest to public order.</seg>
<seg id=857> We give a brief explanation of these three objections in order.</seg>
<seg id=858> The right for a government to remove arbitrarily its constitution is defining characteristic of a tyranny.</seg>
<seg id=859> But, I repeat today, we have every reason to be proud of the conditions under which we have taken this important step for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=860> Knowing that the company rights but no duties, becomes a selfish society.</seg>
<seg id=861> This is our priority for the affirmation of fundamental rights to be implemented in political choices.</seg>
<seg id=862> As the Convention method is interesting and fruitful to establish a basic text, seeking a broad compromise, nothing justifies it deprives the European Parliament embodies the representation of the European peoples, of the possibility of amending, enhance the text.</seg>
<seg id=863> This Charter must be improved and our Parliament should propose a strategy to allow its updating and its enrichment.</seg>
<seg id=864> Therefore, it should not be approved and proclaimed at the Council meeting in Nice: this summit should initiate a European debate on this Charter.</seg>
<seg id=865> Fortunately, the dominant trend of national governments seems marked the stamp of common sense, namely a Charter to the purely political scope and non-binding.</seg>
<seg id=866> Created in both 'House "by the Cologne Summit, it is auto-proclamée' convention ', a name that, of 1793 and terrorist tendencies of the French Revolution implemented by another Convention.</seg>
<seg id=867> However, the method which has been used, the exclusions which have been made and the ambiguity surrounding the nature of this text cast a light enough on the new totalitarian agents which are at the heart of the process of European integration.</seg>
<seg id=868> Fortunately, the European Parliament still has a consultative role, pending the complete application of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but it is the means to play in the wrong direction, stunting the right decisions.</seg>
<seg id=869> As to how, the opinions.</seg>
<seg id=870> In fact, it was a century of here, and after it has been somewhat limited, this right is now a revival.</seg>
<seg id=871> The last thing we want is that the single market to allow criminals to introduce by the back door.</seg>
<seg id=872> We also support the future creation of a Convention, facilitating the fight against organised crime and money laundering, and that the various measures proposed for these purposes.</seg>
<seg id=873> Indeed, it creates a provisional unit consisting of representatives of judges or policemen who exert a judge activity in our fifteen Member States.</seg>
<seg id=874> Mr President, as a Member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I am concerned about the issue of the prospect of accession of Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=875> Turkey's attitude on the Cyprus issue is also unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=876> We agree with the criticism of the rapporteur, who believes that there is at present an effective evaluation of the results of the activity of the EIB ’ s lending, and that there are also inadequate from the point of view of the public right of access to documents and the democratic control of the activities of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id=877> Turkey, despite all its difference, has always belonged and fully-fledged still belongs to the European reality.</seg>
<seg id=878> The accession of Turkey to the European Union has become more than ever on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=879> Mr Morillon declare that Turkey should endeavour not to see the European Union as a 'exclusive Christian club', which would exclude Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=880> Turkey becomes a real democracy, when it will learn to live with its past, democratic as Germany has learned to live with his, and it also, we have asked him to do so.</seg>
<seg id=881> Once the authorities in Ankara will have understood that the status quo is unacceptable for Europe and for the rest of the world, significant progress can be made: the island can be reunited and a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement in accordance with international law will be made tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id=882> In fact, why all this remains absent from the report of the European Commission?</seg>
<seg id=883> It is in this context that we must resolutely continuing our balanced action to promote the rapprochement between the Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=884> If you treat the Armenian issue in connection with the accession to the EU – I would ask you to pay attention to my words: treating the Armenian issue in connection with the accession to the EU, the project which we have discussed today do not sittings. It is as simple as that.</seg>
<seg id=885> This is also the reason for our insistence that an assessment to be made of the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, in Marseilles, precisely so that we can stop the necessary guidelines.</seg>
<seg id=886> However, we have managed to maintain dialogue and sometimes sensitive subjects: stability, terrorism, emigration, human rights, for example.</seg>
<seg id=887> The fact remains that the Council endeavoured, particularly since 1995, the Mediterranean more money, commensurate with the challenges of the partnership.</seg>
<seg id=888> Indeed it is - and I would also like to say, as someone who comes from Central Europe - a very important dossier.</seg>
<seg id=889> Mr President, as you know, there is a saying in the English language when a poster does not appear in a spectacle, it looks like a grave-digger Hamlet representation without the first.</seg>
<seg id=890> We want to see fulfilled the policies on issues relating to the single market and to reach an agreement in order to introduce the cumulative origin, alongside the agreements Sub-regional free trade for all partners engaging in this way and adopting the harmonised protocol on rules of origin.</seg>
<seg id=891> We note with great satisfaction that the Commission intends to give fresh impetus to the Barcelona process.</seg>
<seg id=892> I stressed these aspects because this is the key to the relaunch of the process and we must add to this the enrichment of the political agenda of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id=893> Therefore, our priority must be to guarantee peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we must make every possible effort on behalf of this cooperation and that funds committed is effectively implemented, in accordance with the generosity selfish - let us say - of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=894> This is important and practical matters I wish to raise, and I thank Mr Brok for having enabled this debate before the Presidency and the Commission to discuss these issues.</seg>
<seg id=895> The world is moving in the direction of a globalisation now inevitable. In this context, it is necessary to organize a large blocks acting as actors in the great panorama of global competition.</seg>
<seg id=896> It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries have requested that a quarter of the appropriations of the programme meda-i expired in 1999 and whose grant was 4.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id=897> In this sense, the proposal for a new impetus on the part of the Commission is positive and we agree entirely with the two priorities that Mr Patten has highlighted in his speeches and repeated in this House this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id=898> This is a warning for the European Union to play a more active role in the Mediterranean region, historically and culturally, has contributed to the richness and greatness our European continent.</seg>
<seg id=899> But worse still, at the very time when we exchange in this Chamber calmly sometimes extremely divergent views, ever more Palestinians were killed.</seg>
<seg id=900> Aid for reconstruction</seg>
<seg id=901> If we do not, however, the means, in December, to implement this regulation, this means that the debate we are holding today concerns an empty shell.</seg>
<seg id=902> It is often too bureaucratic and too often complex procedures. But we must not and do not want to turn a blind eye, and I hope that the Member States do not, on the role they have played in this respect.</seg>
<seg id=903> The media in this region have often been responsible for the tragedy that she has suffered; they must be free to work in accordance with the rules in force in our democracies.</seg>
<seg id=904> But I am also pleased, because I believe that Parliament has succeeded, thanks to continuous pressure to bring about a satisfactory outcome to a situation which was not particularly welcome at the outset.</seg>
<seg id=905> I repeat: we must really prevent unnecessarily spending money in meetings superfluous.</seg>
<seg id=906> However, we must not just concentrate on Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id=907> I also regret that a series of programmes have been placed in the reserve, the reserve of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id=908> In Feira, he has recognised the quality of potential candidates for accession to the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process.</seg>
<seg id=909> I recall the main priorities assigned to the CARDS programme: the strengthening of institutions in the sense of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction, regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=910> The European Union was right to respond positively to the accession of President Kostunica to power.</seg>
<seg id=911> An initial examination took place on 6 November.</seg>
<seg id=912> As the European Parliament called for in its resolution of 16 March 2000, they initiatives the European Council Presidency intend to take to play a more active role in order to ensure the full implementation of the UN peace plan?</seg>
<seg id=913> How do we achieve this without settlement of this conflict?</seg>
<seg id=914> I can simply say that France and Germany - here I am no longer speaking as President-in-Office of the Council - have raised these issues during a bilateral summit to vittel last week, and it was decided to set up a working group in order to remedy the problem.</seg>
<seg id=915> At the same time, the European Union continues to provide important material assistance to these two countries, through its various programmes, such as TACIS.</seg>
<seg id=916> The honourable Member's question gives to the Presidency the opportunity to dispel some confusion.</seg>
<seg id=917> And I would add additional clarification: it is particularly in these two texts, the strengthening of the penal framework to combat organised criminal networks of smugglers.</seg>
<seg id=918> In the report that the Turkish Council of Ministers adopted on 21 September as reform programme, appear in the legislative changes several projects: the civil code of measures strengthening effective equality of men and women in the areas: better combat violence youth family; better condemn such violence, by creating specialist family judges and lastly banning the possibility of reducing to death for crimes of honour.</seg>
<seg id=919> Therefore, the Presidency has no answer on this point.</seg>
<seg id=920> Next week, there will be a meeting of the European Conference, to my invitation, in France, i.e. with the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=921> Do you believe that the Austrian model "’ – namely bilateral majority decision-making - will in future an instrument to take decisions by ignoring the European institutions and start a new institution, or a new group, to get round the unanimity rule in the Council?</seg>
<seg id=922> The Council has not received this letter but the Presidency has, of course, replied to Mr Cem. The terms of this answer have been communicated to all the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=923> What it Mr President-in-Office see the position of Mr Cem - Mr Moscovici has not responded to this - who claim that it is not possible to take account of the Cyprus issue, if we want to promote the partnership between the EU and Turkey?</seg>
<seg id=924> We must be aware that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than just a fishing agreement and, as he knows, we were able to reach such an agreement, and all that that entails, it could hide a deterioration in relations between the European Union and Morocco.</seg>
<seg id=925> And it is for this reason that I wish to express my scepticism about the outcome.</seg>
<seg id=926> With regard to the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that this principle must allow the strengthening of cooperation between Member States, but also the protection of individual rights.</seg>
<seg id=927> Supplementary questions must be made by other Members.</seg>
<seg id=928> Furthermore, the Commission, in the communication it has adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union's oil supply, indicates that it intends to submit to the Gothenburg European Council a plan for energy savings and diversification of energy sources, which should help to improve energy efficiency, particularly in buildings and transport.</seg>
<seg id=929> In this spirit, we have launched, during the vote on the resolution on the embargo, within the framework of the Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 November, an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with the international bodies that defend human rights.</seg>
<seg id=930> It is therefore up to NATO to take the measures it deems necessary to ensure that this cannot happen again.</seg>
<seg id=931> (The sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=932> When we talk about money, those who give the money have the privilege to clearly define the political objectives, and that is what the Commissioner has always done.</seg>
<seg id=933> This presence, in principle, can open a new perspective for the whole of the policy that we are pursuing.</seg>
<seg id=934> If we consider the region as a region of political power, we shall misguided.</seg>
<seg id=935> Parliament must be consulted and informed regularly; that is the second request of rapporteurs, request that we should all support.</seg>
<seg id=936> The Heads of Government have also confirmed the Union's determination to support this process by means of technical and economic assistance.</seg>
<seg id=937> It is Parliament which has supported the Commission's proposal to create the European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=938> As the House knows, we do not think it is necessary to include an explicit reference to this subject in the regulation.</seg>
<seg id=939> The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=940> The leaders agreed to extend and update the cooperation framework Eurasian 2000, which is the work programme for the next ten years.</seg>
<seg id=941> I believe that this reminds us, in Europe, the important role that we play in Asia, and not only in the area of the economy and trade, although it has to be said that one of the reasons for the restoration of Asia is the fact that we have kept our promises to keep our markets open to Asian exports over the last two years.</seg>
<seg id=942> I think it was a very good political declaration, but we still have problems to resolve.</seg>
<seg id=943> We know that the Commission considers ASEM seriously, and we strongly support this attitude.</seg>
<seg id=944> It is necessary to improve the existing mechanisms at the level of the transposition of Community law in order to increase legal certainty and overcome the current slow.</seg>
<seg id=945> It should therefore encourage the creation of new regional organisations, starting where there is already a Community presence, as is the case in the Western Pacific and the South Pacific.</seg>
<seg id=946> This will be vital for the sustainability of fisheries.</seg>
<seg id=947> I think the future of fishing in international waters depends on these organisations and all the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, amount to little. To defend the position of the United Nations, both in the 1982 that Convention in New York, which has been mentioned here, our presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing must be very active.</seg>
<seg id=948> That is why I believe that the Commission can play a leading role by going on the spot and encouraging fishermen to cooperate with it and propose a solution that we can all support.</seg>
<seg id=949> Furthermore, the Commission must assume a number of tasks in the field of negotiations which should be conducted within the framework of the RFOs.</seg>
<seg id=950> Mr President, I find the same problem that Mr Nicholson, but in a form still more acute.</seg>
<seg id=951> Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are the solutions advocated by the Committee on Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=952> Sometimes we have to ask ourselves whether the cyclical crisis market is not, to a certain extent, the outcome of the speculative action of corporate structures, thus ensuring the control of the sector according to their interests.</seg>
<seg id=953> EU supplementary aid proposed by Mr Garot in his report is, in my view, contrary to the good sense in these years of Agenda 2000, of enlargement to central and eastern Europe and the reform of agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=954> I think it is quite remarkable that the rapporteur has shown here what can be done with a bit of directors when it pursues a project, which is clearly defined in the report.</seg>
<seg id=955> On the one hand, the biggest producers or those who are integrated with the approval would be excluded from this system, preferring systems that they have already: individual savings, banking loan equalisation fund.</seg>
<seg id=956> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying that, basically, and account of Austrian agriculture, I welcome the Commission proposal to set up a fund regulation.</seg>
<seg id=957> I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.</seg>
<seg id=958> I understood that we want a common organisation of the markets in the sector of intensive farming and a dismantling of agricultural policy insofar as it is part of the territory, where it is part of the territory of production.</seg>
<seg id=959> There is already a COM in beef and pork, and we must not make the mistake of the question then that, basically, it works well.</seg>
<seg id=960> According to the Commission, it is right not to submit discipline that farmers participating in the Fund regulation, because they receive in exchange some guarantee of income, while those who are not part of the funds do not receive this guarantee.</seg>
<seg id=961> (The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=962> The resources from the value-added tax represent traditional own resources 36% and 15%.</seg>
<seg id=963> Another element of the reform is also closely linked to a priority identified by the Court. This is the increased importance given to the assessment of results and performance in the framework of a distribution of resources reflecting predetermined priorities and clearly defined objectives and measurable.</seg>
<seg id=964> It is a good thing, and I would like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, and the members of the Court of Auditors and the Court of Auditors, supporting the reform of the Commission with this report.</seg>
<seg id=965> In this connection, it is also appropriate that I inform you that for the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we have proposed to amend the Treaty so that we can create a European Public Prosecutor to combat fraud affecting the financial interests of the Community. I very much hope that this proposal will not simply be recorded at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice or crept under the carpet, but as we deal with the serious.</seg>
<seg id=966> The reality described in the annual report is rather disappointing.</seg>
<seg id=967> The number of errors is too high for such a guarantee.</seg>
<seg id=968> The amount used for equipment of 240 million is too low.</seg>
<seg id=969> I would also have liked to see the report of the Court of Auditors a little more user-friendly and if he had presented a few clear recommendations - for example, one or two recommendations by chapter.</seg>
<seg id=970> A Convention on the protection of the financial interests of the EU was adopted in 1995.</seg>
<seg id=971> The Commission and the Member States should raise it in this direction and exploit its conclusions in order to strengthen the effectiveness of their methods of management of EU finances.</seg>
<seg id=972> I know that this report and the work that Parliament is on the brink of within the framework of the discharge procedure will contribute to greater vigilance towards the Community expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=973> At the moment, I would like to say, Madam President, and expect that a Member of the Council to come here.</seg>
<seg id=974> As in previous years, the Court has not arrived to identify exactly deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id=975> Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union approach and the Court of Auditors' report clearly shows that there is still a lot of work to be done, even in the accession countries.</seg>
<seg id=976> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have recently concluded an agreement with the Court of Auditors, which was to obtain in advance information on the report of the Court and to remain silent about this.</seg>
<seg id=977> I would also like to harass' 'the Council and ask him why the situation does not progress on Article 24 of the financial regulation.</seg>
<seg id=978> Perhaps a European common sense will resolve the problem and to give George Bush the place it deserves in history – the dustbin!</seg>
<seg id=979> We are not looking for scapegoats, nor in our institutions and in our States.</seg>
<seg id=980> First of all, on the procedure for presentation of the annual report to the Parliament and to the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am pleased to hear that Members believe that the situation is this year is more satisfactory than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id=981> Nevertheless, we shall have the opportunity to examine.</seg>
<seg id=982> When the audit the justified, we mention everything that should be done.</seg>
<seg id=983> Ladies and gentlemen, as you will have noticed, the last part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors has been the victim of an unfortunate virus, which has meetings between his speech and this House.</seg>
<seg id=984> Some amendments, such as Amendments Nos 1 and 18, relate to the fundamental questions of interest to the United Kingdom and it must be said that all groups in the United Kingdom, that they are Socialists, Greens, the popular or have defended with great vehemence and they were approved by the Environment Committee.</seg>
<seg id=985> Mr President, in March of this year, we adopted the directive on the funicular railways for passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id=986> We believe that, in this case, the manufacturer obligations which derive from the law on the safety of products should not burden the trade.</seg>
<seg id=987> We have heard the justification for them and the resumption of industrial arguments raised in committee.</seg>
<seg id=988> When the vendor is in a position to inform each time the buyer of nature of goods and reservations about the information that should be enough.</seg>
<seg id=989> Finally, I have one more small thing to ask the European Commission to Article 4 on European standards and the question of whether these standards must be published.</seg>
<seg id=990> I am satisfied exceptions are made for charity shops and non-profit-making organisations and for second-hand goods sold in markets and in the framework of sales of individuals.</seg>
<seg id=991> The reliability of the safety of products and after-sales assistance represent an added value for the European label at a particularly difficult time and crucial.</seg>
<seg id=992> If we call on the Commission to submit a proposal in the near future on the safety of services, one cannot see why we should and would regulate here and now the aspects relating to the services, rather than waiting for the Commission's proposal, because we can already foresee that difficulties arise delimitation of different regulations and legal insecurity will increase over time.</seg>
<seg id=993> Just a few words about the main aspects of this proposal.</seg>
<seg id=994> We are now the possibility of opening the system to third countries, particularly the candidate countries: simplification of procedures for the emergency measures at Community level in order to be able to provide a rapid response on Council of a regulatory committee.</seg>
<seg id=995> This new demand has no additional important responsibility in the case of this kind of shops.</seg>
<seg id=996> Replacing the word "producer" with the word "supplier ', as proposed in Amendment No 11, generates more confusion than clarity, since the directive offers no definition of the word ‘ supplier'.</seg>
<seg id=997> Although the Commission is in favour of a swift implementation of the network, the procedures must be discussed between Member States.</seg>
<seg id=998> Such certification can still be used as evidence but cannot be regarded as intrinsically reliable.</seg>
<seg id=999> Having explained why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 to 30, 32, 33, 36, 34 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31, 35 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, since these amendments constitute an improvement and a clarification of the Commission proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1000> Of course, for Mr Barón Crespo, an Italian socialist cannot be part of the European Socialist Group.</seg>
<seg id=1001> In my view, there is no contradiction between Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37.</seg>
<seg id=1002> With regard to the next, I leave it to the President to decide and I would remind you that I am against, in any case, on each of the three amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1003> The Mediterranean countries outside the EU, it is true, are facing problems particularly acute economic development. There is a constant tension caused the inequalities between the regions.</seg>
<seg id=1004> As regards respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, in the spirit of a harmonised European policy on immigration, in addition to the legal instruments to guarantee them equal treatment, it should create instruments of financial assistance for all those young people who, having completed a round of higher or university studies, in European countries willing to return to their country of origin to begin a professional activity.</seg>
<seg id=1005> I should like to highlight a factor which I consider crucial frankly to address this issue. I refer to inequality in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id=1006> Albeit belatedly, the Commission has presented a programme for Community strategy in the field of equality between men and women (2001-2005), which has many of the previous programmes, in particular the fourth action programme, which ends at the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id=1007> Despite these reservations, I voted for this report. Firstly because it has been taken on board several amendments from my group and secondly, because this report calls for studies on the situation of women on the national labour markets and insufficient access to social security systems, two problems for which we need relevant statistics broken down by gender.</seg>
<seg id=1008> My party has serious reservations about the regulation of the sale of consumer goods through Community legislation, as it expresses reservations about the concept of mutual recognition of standards.</seg>
<seg id=1009> This misunderstanding is now cleared, labour and amendments can offer a guarantee not to touch of charity shops and should be excluded from the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1010> Finally, Amendment No 15 gives the Commission a free hand to the language regime of the Agency, what we regard as very worrying.</seg>
<seg id=1011> The simplification of the decision-making procedure, the creation of decentralised operational centres (and not only in Pristina, which is equivalent to the separate Yugoslavia) and the management of the dual structure between the Council and the Commission can be positive measures to combat the major bureaucratic shortcomings of the European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id=1012> We are therefore voting against the Commission proposal and Parliament's report.</seg>
<seg id=1013> An adaptation of the existing Community rules in this area can therefore be regarded as justified.</seg>
<seg id=1014> Furthermore, the funds cofinanced by the Member States make aid more or less concealed.</seg>
<seg id=1015> Despite its serious shortcomings, the Morillon report clearly goes further than the Commission proposal on the partnership between the European Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1016> We have voted against.</seg>
<seg id=1017> Like the rapporteur, we must admit that Turkey has made progress on certain plans and that positive signals exist.</seg>
<seg id=1018> Back in 1987, our Assembly itself was committed to the path of the recognition, and adopting this amendment shows consistency of Parliament in this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1019> The Union must make further proposals and design the accession of Turkey as an essential geopolitical strategy.</seg>
<seg id=1020> Such ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1021> For several years, as a Member of the delegation for relations with Canada, I have seen the functioning of one of these regional organisations, the NAFO Fisheries Organisation (the North-West Atlantic), which involves the countries of that region, including Canada, and all those who use this place of traditional fishing areas, including France, Spain and other European countries.</seg>
<seg id=1022> It will only be satisfied when its own gunboats fleet, flying a European flag will respect its policy on fishing.</seg>
<seg id=1023> The important thing is not to satisfy the desire for hegemony of the Commission in weakening the position of Europe, which would be entirely contrary to the correct implementation of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg id=1024> Finally, after difficult negotiations, we reached a final result that it is worthwhile to defend.</seg>
<seg id=1025> Thus this proposal, which aims to replace three directives on waste incineration, seeks to improve the quality of air, water, soil, the health of people, by reducing the emission of pollutants linked to incineration and co-incineration activities, including dioxins and furanes, heavy metals.</seg>
<seg id=1026> But I think it should also be pointed out – and this is a novelty - it is not only a matter of emissions of these substances in the air, it also concerns the emission in water and land.</seg>
<seg id=1027> The proposal has been improved during the various examinations.</seg>
<seg id=1028> The introduction of more stringent nitrous oxides for new installations co-incinerate such as cement kilns constitutes both progress and an incentive for reducing emissions, even if the proposed standards do not reflect the best available techniques.</seg>
<seg id=1029> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, forgive me - in particular Mr Blokland, for a few minutes late.</seg>
<seg id=1030> In conclusion, this directive represents a major contribution to reducing the negative effects on the environment and the risks that they represent to human health.</seg>
<seg id=1031> The European Parliament will, on behalf of the refusal of the fight against discrimination and exclusion, and respecting the responsibilities of each, to give strong impetus to the implementation of a measure which will be essential in practice the principle of solidarity.</seg>
<seg id=1032> We note, however, major differences from one country to another; we lack however detailed statistics and comparable data which would draw up a reliable the situation, to determine in which countries are more efficient systems, and how, what are its weaknesses, etc. It is precisely the reason why my opinion, which was drafted at the request of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs emphasises that it is necessary to introduce a few rules before general value as supplementary sickness insurance, the Commission published a Green Paper marshalling all these data dispersed, which have been dealt with, and that the relevant information.</seg>
<seg id=1033> So far, they were the subject of a certain taboos.</seg>
<seg id=1034> The risk that citizens and less good health and that of elderly people have full access to private insurance because of the high risk they represent is unacceptable to the development of our society.</seg>
<seg id=1035> The other point of view, illustrated by the rapporteur's original and shared by many colleagues, is to promote the rules and codes of conduct needed to build, between insurers, forms of degree of costs guaranteeing all the supply of good quality care and to counter the risks of discriminatory practices and a risk selection and customers.</seg>
<seg id=1036> It seems to me that this is not at all normal money which determines the turn of phrase in a queue.</seg>
<seg id=1037> The new proposal for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is to draw up an inventory of all in the form of a Green Paper then decide whether we need a directive or a recommendation, seems to us to be fair.</seg>
<seg id=1038> A debate is currently in the Netherlands about structural changes in the system.</seg>
<seg id=1039> On this basis, it is up to the Commission to take an initiative and articulate the key as concrete guidelines for the health systems of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1040> It is therefore unacceptable to consider a one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of health insurance.</seg>
<seg id=1041> That is why I think that we need to focus on the content of the report by Mr Rocard - which we welcome - which asks the Commission the provision of a service, the drafting of a Green Paper, which will enable us to know what the current state insurance in the Member States and also look to the future.</seg>
<seg id=1042> The two systems are based on a model three legs, including the state and the private sector.</seg>
<seg id=1043> The European Union has already produced some regulation in the field of supplementary pensions.</seg>
<seg id=1044> Mr President, I would like to thank and congratulate Mr Rocard for his report and congratulate Mr Marinho for the opinion of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1045> This study will form the basis of a communication from the Commission to the Council and Parliament containing initiatives or measures.</seg>
<seg id=1046> As regards the amendments of the Committee on Budgets, I am pleased to say that they have all been accepted.</seg>
<seg id=1047> We have supported the characteristics of the programme, as the multi-faceted approach of the phenomenon, measures in the field of health, education, housing, cohesion and complementarity with other policies, as well as the participation of non-governmental bodies, but also the very people who are affected social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1048> This means that we must take advantage of bottom-up phases of the round to return to a situation of balance or surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1049> I would remind you that the last Ecofin Council asked the Commission that the evaluation of the stability programmes next year contains precisely this aspect of the long-term public finances on the ageing of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1050> One of the positive features of the programme of the Netherlands is the special attention granted - as I said before - to the impact of the ageing of the population on the Treasury in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id=1051> Therefore, in the case of Germany, the budget for the year 2000 will lead to a surplus of 1.5% of the gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg id=1052> If we add to this the evolution of the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, we have a huge negative impact in terms of inflation.</seg>
<seg id=1053> On the other hand, they aim to make compatible the public system of distribution systems with private capitalisation and, of course, they are also compatible with support for the creation of investment funds might give specific tax advantages long-term and help to deal with the problem of ageing.</seg>
<seg id=1054> This is the third principle which guides us: the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg id=1055> We must remember that several regulatory proposals are currently under discussion, which will help to improve the effectiveness and the relevance of the Community mechanism and, therefore, I hope, consumer confidence.</seg>
<seg id=1056> However, this does not justify any relatively low incidence convenience.</seg>
<seg id=1057> Frankly, I was disappointed that Prime Minister Jospin makes no mention of the highly positive role played by the Community in recent years in his speech yesterday.</seg>
<seg id=1058> It is obviously necessary to clarify the reasons for the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1059> The Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission already give the highest priority to supervision by the Member States in connection with the protection measures against BSE.</seg>
<seg id=1060> As regards the safety of animal meal, let me remind you that there is already a wide range of controls to ensure that animal meal do not pose a risk of transmission of BSE.</seg>
<seg id=1061> Yes, difficult to believe that may be, it took four years to get a measure that I consider crucial to the protection of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1062> Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I urge the Council to make known its position on the regulation is finally.</seg>
<seg id=1063> In the present situation, the only way to stop the cycle of transmission of BSE is a total ban on the use of animal meal.</seg>
<seg id=1064> In this connection, I would like to point out that the Liberal Group to which I belong has tabled an amendment which I hope will be adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1065> Politicians must change so that the real culprits of this crisis are penalised and that specific decisions provide a first step towards the end of this dramatic crisis.</seg>
<seg id=1066> We therefore need to be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id=1067> The labelling of beef which has been decided, which is a minimum labelling and which has only been in force for two and a half months ago, does not make it possible to trace the origin of animals properly very late and have banned the specified risk material.</seg>
<seg id=1068> It is important that the public is fully informed on the characteristics of the test which I am talking about.</seg>
<seg id=1069> At the time, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you did nothing, or almost, as your counterparts have done nothing about the consequences of Chernobyl, nothing about the AIDS epidemic, nothing about the contaminated blood, always with the same reason: not panic public opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1070> The prohibition of France will lead to a massive increase in demand, but the offer is not unlimited and prices will be extraordinarily heavy pressure.</seg>
<seg id=1071> Consumers have lost confidence, and to combat this phenomenon, we must increase the BSE tests on cattle and sheep.</seg>
<seg id=1072> It seems more important to move in the direction of the Commission proposal, namely to ensure that animal meal meet the highest safety standards.</seg>
<seg id=1073> For the rest, I totally agree - for once - with what my colleagues, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs Grossetête, have said.</seg>
<seg id=1074> Will, Members of the Council and the Commission, you have a large financial basis for a strong policy.</seg>
<seg id=1075> We must solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id=1076> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I am pleased to hear here in this Chamber, that it must change the CAP.</seg>
<seg id=1077> We have condemned here with Jimmy Goldsmith.</seg>
<seg id=1078> Food must be safe.</seg>
<seg id=1079> I find exemplary that France has resolved to take that step.</seg>
<seg id=1080> But we do not help!</seg>
<seg id=1081> I am therefore surprised that corpses are still used or processed in these conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1082> The Phillips inquiry into BSE has just been published in the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id=1083> I would suggest to the European Commission to apply the precautionary principle to the French beef.</seg>
<seg id=1084> We need to know today, since we are always in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what measures are to be taken.</seg>
<seg id=1085> Furthermore, I have, of course, all these proposals, I am not insensitive.</seg>
<seg id=1086> If European citizens tell me that legislation has not been properly and fully implemented, then we must réenvisager perhaps the question, but not for scientific reasons. We must do so because the legislation has not been respected in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1087> The best way of not hear us, it is not to invite us.</seg>
<seg id=1088> The Commission considers that the first readmission agreements, currently under negotiation with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco play an important role in the clarification and the coordination of these policies.</seg>
<seg id=1089> What proposals does the Commission in this area on the basis of Article 31 of the Union?</seg>
<seg id=1090> (The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg id=1091> During this period, the objective was to reduce the public deficit in order to obtain a more suitable monetary policy, lower interest rates and greater growth.</seg>
<seg id=1092> I always say that the euro will not be introduced on 1 January 2002 but it is already in our pocket; we have with fractionnaires different currencies, but we already have in our pockets.</seg>
<seg id=1093> The ozone limits laid down in Directive 92 / 72 have not been overtaken in the capital, but it should be noted that no action has been taken in the middle of the summer.</seg>
<seg id=1094> Subject: State aid in the audiovisual sector at a seminar of the French Presidency devoted to cultural industries, a representative of the Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission estimated that the legal obligations investment channels were imposed on state aid from the very fact that these investments are made compulsory by the legislator.</seg>
<seg id=1095> It must be respected and protected ’.</seg>
<seg id=1096> However, this is not itself, because this new growth is very unequal and can be, as we have seen in the United States over a decade, persistent phenomena precariousness and exclusion, poverty, urban ghettos.</seg>
<seg id=1097> The governments of the Member States refused to accept this definition, which is a little too simple and far too vague.</seg>
<seg id=1098> In difficult climate and resulting, more and more people are no longer, are marginalised and excluded.</seg>
<seg id=1099> Mr President, we often hear in this House that a tune, the glorification of the European social model, the social market economy that we opposed with pride - as many wild model - the United States of America.</seg>
<seg id=1100> (technical problem)</seg>
<seg id=1101> It is a huge figure.</seg>
<seg id=1102> Moreover, these are all levels policies which must be involved.</seg>
<seg id=1103> I support the need for a better understanding of the causes of poverty, I support the preventive action against exclusion as a result of mergers, industrial change, relocation, urban, rural desertification hyperconcentration, innovative and practical answers, involving the social partners, local and national administrations and the joint action of citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1104> We have witnessed a very interesting debate on the role of employment in the fight against social exclusion and the role of social and structural reforms.</seg>
<seg id=1105> It is a problem formalistic due to the fact that, in the Treaty, it is only referred to social exclusion and poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1106> I believe that these proposals are a pragmatic response to your request.</seg>
<seg id=1107> However, approval of the global strategy does not necessarily mean approval of the proposal in detail.</seg>
<seg id=1108> If we create a clear framework and binding on the Member States, the various systems to meet these requirements should have a longer period test.</seg>
<seg id=1109> Renewable energies will not become a panacea for solving this problem, but nobody doubts that they can contribute to a large extent, to the plug to diversify the sources of energy and to reduce our dependence on oil, which, furthermore, do we would disturb not at all.</seg>
<seg id=1110> Here I shall focus on three of our requirements.</seg>
<seg id=1111> Set realistic targets can only strengthen the trust of the citizen in energy policy to implement.</seg>
<seg id=1112> I believe that a strong policy with regard to renewable energy sources is a symbol for the Europe of tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id=1113> Finally, the European countries must prove through these agreements they will contribute to achieving the Kyoto objectives.</seg>
<seg id=1114> It seems a pity of excluding any category of waste which can contribute to the overall production of energy from waste - whether for smaller-scale projects or within the framework of a more general calculation.</seg>
<seg id=1115> The training of the volume of peat by dioxide and in the production of wood waste is comparable to that of other biomassbased energy.</seg>
<seg id=1116> Finally, I can inform Mr Chichester that off my region, there is already a draft windmills well advanced and that it looks promising. I therefore call on you to come to realize this itself.</seg>
<seg id=1117> The debate on abandoning nuclear energy, Sweden and Germany for example, has shown that, without replacement energies possible environment-friendly and competitive, the discussion is short. This is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=1118> That is why the Member States must impose binding targets.</seg>
<seg id=1119> I am therefore optimistic about the future potential of renewable energy, provided that the appropriate incentives are put in place.</seg>
<seg id=1120> I believe that it requires a great deal of courage to give renewable energy the place it deserves.</seg>
<seg id=1121> There is no doubt that a very sharp rise in oil prices confronts us more brutally with the problems linked to our energy dependency on fossil energy sources.</seg>
<seg id=1122> Consequently, we cannot accept Amendment 28.</seg>
<seg id=1123> However, in doing this, the Commission does not forget that does not prejudge the terms used its right of initiative and that they must be compatible with the single market for electricity.</seg>
<seg id=1124> Participants, the Commission on 26 national reconciliation Tajikistan has only one woman, while the country 25 000 widows.</seg>
<seg id=1125> Studies show that the presence of women in the ranks of the peacekeeping forces of the United Nations, although limited in number, improve relations with the local people and the general moral.</seg>
<seg id=1126> The Theorin report deals with this topic in detail and contains many repetitions ask that we, as the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, to delete to develop an official document.</seg>
<seg id=1127> From a political point of view, I see in Amendment No 19 failure or a retreat tactics rather than a compromise in terms of content, which should in any case be unworthy of women.</seg>
<seg id=1128> They have been held prisoner.</seg>
<seg id=1129> Then a Portuguese example, where the doors of diplomacy are open to women that after the "revolution of April 1974." our ambassador in Indonesia, Mrs Ana Gomes, showed recently in West Timor that the role of women and its awareness of the problems and the suffering of a people, who has addressed only a long fight of 25 years for freedom, can be seen by everyone and especially by the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1130> Very few Member States have done to date. It tells me that there are two or three.</seg>
<seg id=1131> That is why we must also, in future, take account of this aspect in the preparation of the policies of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1132> Unfortunately, the report does not define this notion, nor establishes distinctions.</seg>
<seg id=1133> Please convey our protest to the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1134> They have different experiences, which are essential to the way politics is exercised, especially when it comes to manage crises.</seg>
<seg id=1135> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1136> I will now move on to the second point. If it intends to regulate the sector, we must of course study a number of points.</seg>
<seg id=1137> In recent weeks, I have discovered a marked interest on the part of both international trade union circles that a number of trade unions.</seg>
<seg id=1138> Second objection. You are therefore in favour of the wages paid to women who stay at home?</seg>
<seg id=1139> All those who are currently working to obtain an undeclared employment in decent social conditions.</seg>
<seg id=1140> Furthermore, this project has also enabled two to three families to group together to create employment household help.</seg>
<seg id=1141> We were meeting in plenary in the first October part-session, when we learned at the time of our debate on the situation in Yugoslavia, the reaction of the Serbian nation and courageous immediately, you will remember, ladies and gentlemen, we have asked the lifting of international sanctions.</seg>
<seg id=1142> In this way, Europe has demonstrated the vitality of its civilisation in the history of the world and a forward-looking creative political capacity.</seg>
<seg id=1143> There can be no doubt that the issue of the status of Kosovo is a question of democracy.</seg>
<seg id=1144> Furthermore, we would have a chance to demonstrate to Europe that we are able to develop only constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia, recognising the real democratic principles.</seg>
<seg id=1145> I must say that I had been - while listening - very impressed by your mastery of a situation Oh! how difficult, at the same time that your determination.</seg>
<seg id=1146> This will be done in the next minutes, Mr Watson.</seg>
<seg id=1147> Access to documents and information on the activities of institutions enables citizens to the institutions of the European Union with their responsibilities and therefore stimulates greater efficiency.</seg>
<seg id=1148> A fifth amendment important, in my view, is the one concerning the annual report which must deal with documents are to remain secret, or at least that remain secret.</seg>
<seg id=1149> Things are not clear on this point, and it is not impossible that can also remain in force more restrictive provisions. This is particularly on this point that we have tabled amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1150> The Committee on Foreign Affairs, for its part, is opposed to the idea that the documents relating to issues of foreign and security policy should be automatic and comprehensive way, an exception to this rule of public scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id=1151> If we want the citizens can truly defend their rights, these information places require well-trained staff who are in some way by the citizens to information and research which guides their use within the complex labyrinth of institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1152> These are essential if we want to prevent the so-called transparency amounted to a transparency for beginners.</seg>
<seg id=1153> It is gratifying that Parliament has managed to gather a large majority in favour of greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id=1154> Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1155> Mr President, openness and transparency in the European Union are not favourable.</seg>
<seg id=1156> If that is the case, it would be a bad calculation, are the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens who are at stake here.</seg>
<seg id=1157> The concept of documents takes many forms of our times and we will ensure that access is the broadest possible for the greatest possible number of documents and for the various types of documents.</seg>
<seg id=1158> Mr President, we know the position of the Commission on public access to documents in the internal manual, which was submitted on 11 October, the Commission's officials in order to explain how to handle applications by Members as regards access to documents.</seg>
<seg id=1159> This point of the regulation should be abolished or at least be complemented by the obligation to take account of the interests at stake.</seg>
<seg id=1160> The old models of international cooperation with all their old habits and diplomatic rules of the game, where everything is happening behind closed doors are no longer valid in the type of modern cooperation that has become the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1161> We must not be confused with this objective and the role of Parliament, or with future interinstitutional agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1162> I believe that a step forward has been taken towards the possibility for citizens to exercise their right to information and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id=1163> It is not the only one, however, whom I thank: Mrs Maij-Weggen, itself of the PPE-DE Group, and through the enhanced Hughes procedure is the second author of the report, also deserves warm thanks.</seg>
<seg id=1164> Transparency must become the mainstay of all the activities of the European Union, but the right of access to documents is not enough in itself to make transparency a reality.</seg>
<seg id=1165> The European Parliament therefore ask that the European security and defence policy should be integrated in the future in the structures of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1166> In his speech to Parliament, on 3 October last, President Prodi referred to the institutional triangle and reiterated that, in a European system based on checks and balances, the flow of operation of each institution contributed to the common interest.</seg>
<seg id=1167> I must admit that the great challenge of this regulation is to give a precise definition of documents.</seg>
<seg id=1168> I would like to stress that the Commission could, when the time comes, almost all the amendments, such as Amendments Nos 9, 18 and 21 in part and Amendments Nos 23, 25, 26.1 F, 28, 35, 38, 40.1, 40.6, 41.1, 42, 43.1, 47, 49 and 52.</seg>
<seg id=1169> Sometimes I should vote in favour of the proposals made by the Commission, and for that reason it is essential that Members have a list of the amendments which the Commission can support the amendments and that it does not support.</seg>
<seg id=1170> Banks' own funds</seg>
<seg id=1171> Finally, and this is a controversial issue, the Commission has called with force to use the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.</seg>
<seg id=1172> These amendments replace various proposals in the report, which will probably be rejected in the vote and which will therefore be replaced by the new amendments from this consensus.</seg>
<seg id=1173> Mr President, in the light of the excellent vote to support this report has received, and given the response of the Commission this morning, it appears clear – recital all parts on which we voted - on the basis of Article 69 (2), we should postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution, to enable us to initiate fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1174> Mr President, I am sorry to have said that the PPE-DE Group had also hoped that the vote evening postponed, but it is you, Mr the coordinator, who came to tell me that you prefer to have the matter be deferred until the second November part-session, rather than vote this evening.</seg>
<seg id=1175> The reason why I would suggest that we return the vote is - as Mr Goepel said - that it is a very important issue.</seg>
<seg id=1176> I do not know how the roll-call vote costs, but it is without doubt of hundreds of thousands of francs, or Belgian francs, of our budget.</seg>
<seg id=1177> I know that in France, the principle of slaughter of whole herd has been implemented and that this is not the best way to combat this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id=1178> To remove the animal meal of animal feed, not only that of cattle and sheep, but also of the pigs, poultry, fish;</seg>
<seg id=1179> This is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1180> It is by provisions such as these that consumers will be reassured and that farmers will hear the message of solidarity that we want to convey.</seg>
<seg id=1181> We must go further, as a matter of urgency, we need to change the common agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=1182> The ban on the use of animal meal in animal feed is only the first step in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1183> We very much regret, however, that the amendments tabled by our Group were not adopted.</seg>
<seg id=1184> I believe that it would be logical that the working hours of those who work in businesses polluting reduced.</seg>
<seg id=1185> I shall conclude by stressing once again on the fact that the widespread use of hazardous waste must not lead to the production of such waste.</seg>
<seg id=1186> Indeed, if pensions, for example, were less weak, there would be less poor.</seg>
<seg id=1187> The report envisages an appropriation of EUR 100 million over five years to reduce poverty.</seg>
<seg id=1188> I fully support the proposal to implement a Luxembourg process bis in terms of social exclusion, with guidelines and national action plans.</seg>
<seg id=1189> Indeed, the report calls for the establishment of quantitative and qualitative indicators of social exclusion.</seg>
<seg id=1190> When submitting its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission responds to the appeal made by the Council to present 'by June 2000' A 'initiative for cooperation in this area'.</seg>
<seg id=1191> Mr President, I have abstained for a very specific reason: in my opinion, this report did not from the ecological point of view, the progress that I hoped and wanted.</seg>
<seg id=1192> I hope that such a system is extended to all European cities.</seg>
<seg id=1193> Certain proposals from the European Parliament are unrealistic and cannot receive my support.</seg>
<seg id=1194> We must also arrive in the future in order to identify the best practices.</seg>
<seg id=1195> The high-wage mindful of the environment must be offered the possibility, in a liberalised market, help voluntarily cleaner energy, while for the other, everything still remains as before.</seg>
<seg id=1196> The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1197> These three reasons are as follows: firstly, because it is in the process of consolidating democracy and in the strengthening of the requirement of respect for human rights, especially as regards the indigenous populations.</seg>
<seg id=1198> Mr President, in this debate, we wish to express, as was rightly said the other Members who have spoken before me, the solidarity and support of this House in the Central American Parliament, at a time when we are fighting for keeping the priority in the framework of the European Union's external relations with the countries of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id=1199> I am not the reservations that has been able to express our colleague and good friend, the chairman of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, Mr Seguro, as regards the issue of human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1200> Finally, in its dialogue with the authorities of Central America, the Commission to again emphasise the importance should be attached to the process of regional integration, as an instrument for consolidating democratisation and development of the region.</seg>
<seg id=1201> To hold on to power he has not hesitated to grab for continuing the debate on ‘ ivoirity ’, causing an outbreak of xenophobia: hatred of the other, from abroad, or of the burkinabé Malian, and yet there are many to live and work on the ground of Côte d'Ivoire for many years.</seg>
<seg id=1202> The establishment of a real democracy in Côte d'Ivoire will now be done without the institution of an independent committee of inquiry into the crimes committed and without the official commitment to uphold human rights and civil peace.</seg>
<seg id=1203> Some believe that the importance of democracy is on when it comes to Africa, that these are complex procedures, that we must let time. However, I believe that there is no room for compromise with democracy and the question today for Côte d'Ivoire is the same as that which arises for example Guinea, where we know today that there are people who are imprisoned and that there is no democratic system.</seg>
<seg id=1204> I will end with the following: dictatorships are in place, Mr President, because there are people who suffer poverty, which do not have access to knowledge, who do not have access to information.</seg>
<seg id=1205> It would not be illogical that the European Union requires today new presidential elections which all this time candidate could participate.</seg>
<seg id=1206> In many parts of Africa, we are faced with ethnic and religious brassages very different.</seg>
<seg id=1207> These elections must allow the representation of national political parties have been excluded in the presidential election and compensate and, if only partially, the imperfections of this first election.</seg>
<seg id=1208> On the situation in Burma.</seg>
<seg id=1209> The authorities are fighting a major offensive against the peoples and Shan Karen and, as the rapporteur pointed out of the United Nations, there is no sign of dialogue between the sdpc and the NLD.</seg>
<seg id=1210> That is why, we reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1211> I hope that by giving urgent priority to this issue, Parliament sends a clear message to the Burmese people, meaning that its desperate situation is not forgotten, that are aware of the fact that in Burma, things worse rather than better, and that we are determined to try to change the course of events.</seg>
<seg id=1212> It has taken a long time.</seg>
<seg id=1213> In Asia, the danger that the economic and political reforms decoupled are liberalised and economic progress are without liberalisation policy and without strengthening the rule of law, although I am of the opinion that, in the long term, no rule of law night subsidies to trade and investment.</seg>
<seg id=1214> Mr President, I can support the previous speakers on a number of key points, because many things that are happening in Vietnam today are unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1215> Nevertheless, the publication Human Rights Watch quoted, Mr Swoboda, says that Vietnam has recently made some effort to improve its situation from the point of view of human rights.</seg>
<seg id=1216> These extremely confidential documents giving us a curious light on the wings of the policy pursued by the Vietnamese authorities.</seg>
<seg id=1217> The Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation can only be achieved through a dialogue between the military regime, the opposition democratically elected representatives and the ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg id=1218> The Vietnamese authorities also exert pressure on the press of that country so that it adopts a regime of self-censorship.</seg>
<seg id=1219> The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg id=1220> We also call on the EU to give aid and assistance, not only in the south-west of England, but also all the other regions affected.</seg>
<seg id=1221> I would ask you all to support our resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1222> It is urgent that the Union should not be confined to exceptional measures when disasters arrived.</seg>
<seg id=1223> The Commission has taken two initiatives in this direction.</seg>
<seg id=1224> Mr President, a purely linguistic error has crept in one of the amendments to the joint resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1225> A postponement of the vote would mean postponing the mission entrusted to the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1226> (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1227> The report is based on the observation that a proportion of the disease in Europe is covered by insurance systems supplementary sickness insurance.</seg>
<seg id=1228> I find it a little strange to now force the Commission to a motion for a resolution and ask him at the same time to draw up a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary and insurance supplementary sickness insurance.</seg>
<seg id=1229> At a time when the ageing of the population is well aware, it is essential that we seek to improve the health care system in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1230> We obviously cannot the sanction.</seg>
<seg id=1231> Mr President, there are undeniable arguments in favour of the accelerated procedure for the implementation of the Basel review on capital adequacy.</seg>
<seg id=1232> The sense of urgency that Mrs Villiers has added to the feeling of need to the Commission by calling for an accelerated procedure for the adoption of these measures, one is obliged to note that the rapporteur himself acknowledges that this new regulation will not taken on anti-competitive practices which unfortunately, alas, are widely used in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1233> We must also ensure that the Basle decisions do not result in an increase in the own funds requirements, a second disadvantage for banks.</seg>
<seg id=1234> Having said that, I believe, and I would like to stress, that economic operators are also satisfied with the direction given to these regulations on capital, which strengthen the issues relating to the risk.</seg>
<seg id=1235> These are just a few ideas on how we might reach a swift legislative process, verifiable and effective in the framework of the current rules of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1236> Indeed, it is time to recognise that the institution of European Ombudsman 'has sufficiently lived and that it has already given ample evidence of maturity to have its own budget.</seg>
<seg id=1237> The PPE-DE Group supports the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the joined to assert that the powers of the Ombudsman must be extended, and that the sooner the better, particularly in the area of investigative powers of Ombudsman, set out in Article 3 of the 1994 decision.</seg>
<seg id=1238> An Ombudsman is, of course, subject to the rules of confidentiality, but for citizens, it is good to know that the person who fulfils this office can have access to documents which them, as people do not have access.</seg>
<seg id=1239> The report therefore tabled had recommendation by the Ombudsman to the Commission to allow the candidates and candidates competitions organised by it to consult their corrected papers.</seg>
<seg id=1240> We believe that the Community institutions should carry out their staff recruitment procedures, even in fact that all recruitment procedures, with maximum publicity and transparency, in order to avoid any suspicion of partiality, injustice or administrative incompetence.</seg>
<seg id=1241> I am referring to an amendment concerning the requirement of proof of the conduct of an oral test, for example.</seg>
<seg id=1242> Mr Bösch has already explained briefly the amendments to the report.</seg>
<seg id=1243> I asked two questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal competitions, and I have received its hand accurate and detailed answers.</seg>
<seg id=1244> This is the beginning of a process of openness and transparency of the government.</seg>
<seg id=1245> Firstly, the corrections to the examinations organised by the Commission are always anonymously.</seg>
<seg id=1246> It is, of course, of July 2000.</seg>
<seg id=1247> Votes</seg>
<seg id=1248> (Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)</seg>
<seg id=1249> . (DE) during the evaluation of the own funds directive of credit institutions we must look closely at several interests which are in conflict.</seg>
<seg id=1250> That is how is born the idea of a European police college for the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=1251> This is the position defended by the rapporteur and shared by the European People's Party.</seg>
<seg id=1252> The social situation in most Member States of the European Union is currently of this nature that the need for cross-border cooperation between the different police services is indeed important.</seg>
<seg id=1253> The majority of speakers who have spoken so far seem to think that it is essential that the College has a permanent seat.</seg>
<seg id=1254> The umpteenth decision, but not precarious, the gift that the Council has accustomed to this Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1255> The rapporteur would like to see more crime prevention, aid and innovative developments and border surveillance and also wants to change the internal security to include respect for the law and order.</seg>
<seg id=1256> These were the ideals that we proposed and this is the kind of state for which they found.</seg>
<seg id=1257> I would be in favour of a balance standards in certain Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1258> Since the first thoughts on this issue, which took place at European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission is committed to the Member States to promote action to develop what we could consider a European police culture, based on the highest standards in terms of ethics, respect for citizens' rights and freedoms, and effectiveness in the fight against crime.</seg>
<seg id=1259> It inclines towards the development of a police college mainly with a view to intergovernmental.</seg>
<seg id=1260> For the reasons cited above, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report.</seg>
<seg id=1261> . (SV) I have voted against the report on the provisional establishment of the European police college.</seg>
<seg id=1262> It is clear that many of our courts are very slow and cumbersome and that it is very difficult to act quickly to tackle these problems.</seg>
<seg id=1263> Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, the fact that it is linked to the Brussels II regulation which excludes children whose parents are in a divorce, and designed children outside marriage.</seg>
<seg id=1264> My mother has experienced such a divorce and abduction there is 85 years and it is always.</seg>
<seg id=1265> I should therefore like to tell Parliament that in the action programme on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions in civil matters - which we hope will be adopted before the end of this year, the Commission proposes that the first and the main priority is being given to the extension of the scope of the regulation of key and, therefore, in this regulation on the right to visit, to cover without discrimination children of married couples and children of unmarried couples.</seg>
<seg id=1266> We shall now proceed to the vote</seg>
<seg id=1267> Nowadays, sport - it must be said - is closely linked to other economic sectors such as the audiovisual industry or the promotion and the sale of sportspeople.</seg>
<seg id=1268> What we need is an intelligent and flexible way to interpret the existing rules.</seg>
<seg id=1269> In other words, a genuine attack on democracy, even if we do not look things from this point of view.</seg>
<seg id=1270> The Commission expects therefore soon to receive a response to its request for detailed information regarding the measures planned by the British Government.</seg>
<seg id=1271> The proposal was initiated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a statement before examining the budget, six months before the full budget statement spring 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1272> Again, I thought that what was said by Mr Simpson has really served to reassure us as regards the probable intentions of the British Government.</seg>
<seg id=1273> Traffic jams we are not only lose a lot of time, but they are a problem for the whole of the environment and I therefore believe that if the British Government commits the funds necessary for the resolution of these problems, it is to the benefit of everybody and in particular of all European citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1274> We are more or less the only oil producers in the European Union and yet we are facing the price of petrol and diesel the highest in all the countries of Europe - GBP 1,20 per litre diesel fuel in the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id=1275> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1276> The European Parliament must make them understand that it is on their side, and I suggest, once again, to observe a minute's silence expressing our solidarity and our emotions.</seg>
<seg id=1277> Madam President, it is for the totally support, since I am one of those who have requested the inclusion of this point.</seg>
<seg id=1278> We have made good progress.</seg>
<seg id=1279> The Union will deepen its relations with all the main groups and, as soon as possible, also intends to contact the new American administration.</seg>
<seg id=1280> Given the surprisingly brilliant report by Mr Prescott on how he himself had negotiated, how is it that not only Mrs Voynet but also, I believe, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, most of the other EU environment ministers have rejected this?</seg>
<seg id=1281> What we fear is that the momentum will be lost, that the US negotiators do change and everything is to start in May.</seg>
<seg id=1282> This time, the forests which have proven to be the main stumbling blocks.</seg>
<seg id=1283> If this warming continues, part of the territory of the European Union countries will become at sea or in desert.</seg>
<seg id=1284> The standard of living is high and the low prices of oil products.</seg>
<seg id=1285> I congratulate Commissioner Wallström of efforts in the Hague and wish him have more chance.</seg>
<seg id=1286> Without doubt, it was better to have no agreement have an agreement that is wrong and, in this case, the American proposal was a watered-down proposal totally unacceptable for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1287> Climate change has important consequences in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=1288> I repeat this idea in its English wording: forest turns from being carbon sinks to carbon sources.</seg>
<seg id=1289> Only this credibility will enable the European Union to steer the speeches and the action of the COP 6 "B" in Bonn.</seg>
<seg id=1290> We must make our own assessment of what happened and prepare the documents in order to establish contacts with various parties and, obviously, with the 'umbrella' group.</seg>
<seg id=1291> Of course, the result of the forthcoming COP 6 or the continuation of the COP 6 will be an agreement within the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1292> Before the European Council, we will again next Sunday, Pierre Moscovici and myself, a ministerial conclave, in which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, and a session of the IGC, on Monday at the meeting of the General Affairs Council.</seg>
<seg id=1293> The minimum number of participating Member States should be set at eight while the clause of the European Council, which is currently a genuine right of veto, be replaced by a right to mention.</seg>
<seg id=1294> This may be regrettable, but I am obliged to make this observation.</seg>
<seg id=1295> The European Council will also be discussing the state of progress of accession negotiations, and therefore of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1296> The Lisbon European Council approved the guidelines to promote an innovative and competitive European economy.</seg>
<seg id=1297> Consumer protection is of increasing concern of Europeans, for obvious reasons that I do not need to develop.</seg>
<seg id=1298> We must be prepared for this enlargement considerable.</seg>
<seg id=1299> That is, in the final analysis, the yardstick by which we will have to judge the Nice Summit.</seg>
<seg id=1300> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1301> The first is that the candidate countries must adopt and implement the acquis communautaire. That is the task that they share with us.</seg>
<seg id=1302> We are deeply attached to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we do not want simply preach.</seg>
<seg id=1303> Although the text could have been better, and we can improve it and say after Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1304> I think it is simply unacceptable that some governments have purely and simply brushed aside the issue of the insertion of a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1305> You do not even want to incorporate into the Treaty, which shows that this text should be set aside.</seg>
<seg id=1306> We speak with one voice disgracieuse within the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1307> Given the bleak prospects of success of the Intergovernmental Conference, I believe that it would not be appropriate to add to the agenda this complex subject and controversial.</seg>
<seg id=1308> I appeal urgently to the French Presidency to do everything in its power to bridge this gap particularly destructive.</seg>
<seg id=1309> The Commission, in terms of commercial policy, drew up a proposal which must be carefully examined.</seg>
<seg id=1310> Although the previous Treaty has made some progress in terms of the extension of the formula, it also introduced this formula of the codecision procedure with unanimity for citizenship, social security, the rights of people independent and also the cultural policy.</seg>
<seg id=1311> The simple fact that this issue has been raised in itself shows clearly the absence of a policy of strengthening links of mutual trust between the countries of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1312> It is precisely in this situation that the Intergovernmental Conference drags on for months, because nobody wants to abandon its plaything.</seg>
<seg id=1313> The experience of this year we say that developments to make – after Nice, looking to the future of Europe - the process of constitutionalisation of the Union must not be handed over to the method now obsolete confidential negotiations between representatives of governments.</seg>
<seg id=1314> If the majority does not become the rule, the decision-making process is inevitably a quagmire, as Mr Prodi rightly pointed out.</seg>
<seg id=1315> If this aspect of subsidiarity is very important, we have heard in today's debate.</seg>
<seg id=1316> That is what we have done, enlargement of 1995 was adopted, we have moved the reflection group chaired by Carlos westerdorp wisely, Amsterdam has happened, we are now on the eve of the Nice Conference and the situation has hardly changed, Mr President: we are returning to institutional matters, without finding a solution which allows us to complete an ambitious task, namely enlargement to 27.</seg>
<seg id=1317> Do not add to the disappointment that will naturally cause Nice, if the Council proves unsuccessful, the great disappointment that Parliament would be among the people.</seg>
<seg id=1318> In the past, we have proved that it is possible to achieve this goal, and coming from a Member State which has benefited from a draft planned transition towards accession, I sincerely hope that we will reach an enlarged Europe and peaceful.</seg>
<seg id=1319> However, we must realise that, if you have the right of veto, all the others have too.</seg>
<seg id=1320> But there will have to be a first transition in view of the 2004 elections because a number of new Member States will join us before or during this legislature, which runs until 2009.</seg>
<seg id=1321> The President of the Council has discussed the question of closer cooperation and he said that we move more towards a consensus on this issue.</seg>
<seg id=1322> Mr President, at first sight, Nice relates to the necessary reforms and on the leftovers with the prospect of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1323> If we have only a few features mentality, less if we insist on the things that are going wrong in our continent and a little more on the things that go well, we would be a little more pleased that at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=1324> We must not only extend qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers in the transport of goods, we must include services, investment, intellectual property and competition involved and adapt accordingly Article 133 (1) of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1325> Indeed, the granting of such a right to European Parliament would also the arbitrary nature of the party political ultra sensitive with regard to this issue.</seg>
<seg id=1326> We must therefore also, as one of you, referring to the American optimism and how the Americans speak for themselves, we must also be able to recognise what works and what advance.</seg>
<seg id=1327> I would also like to say that I do not believe that there is a problem between large and small countries.</seg>
<seg id=1328> We have worked hard, but we have the old problem, and I do not believe that this development can be activated by the movement of one country because we come up against the realities, once again, national, political, democratic, very strong in twelve countries out of 15.</seg>
<seg id=1329> Finally, Mr President Védrine, you noted perhaps too tense situation and talked of a certain pessimism.</seg>
<seg id=1330> In general, could you please take measures to strengthen security so that such events cannot happen again?</seg>
<seg id=1331> I think that we should take measures that we have not taken until now, so that the guests of this Parliament feel here as the hosts, and do not have to fear of threats.</seg>
<seg id=1332> Hospitality here, hospitality and respect there.</seg>
<seg id=1333> I thank you for your contribution, Mr Tajani.</seg>
<seg id=1334> The best tribute to Ernest lluch and his memory be respected its message – dìaleg in Catalan. We can all give it its chance in the Basque country?</seg>
<seg id=1335> Of course, on the other hand, everyone can express their opinion.</seg>
<seg id=1336> B5-0550 / 2000 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Council, on the political situation and the humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id=1337> When I speak of organisation, I also believe that if the European Union is making great efforts and which, in my opinion, needs to take responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=1338> Secondly, you will see in the resolution the clear will of Parliament to be based on Security and Defence Policy on two pillars balanced: civil crisis management and, in the event of failure, the military management, the two pillars are complementary.</seg>
<seg id=1339> Mr President, given the delay which has been taken and my obligations, after, I shall try to shorten rather the speech I had prepared.</seg>
<seg id=1340> These relations will take the form of meetings between the North Atlantic Council and the copsi and meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European applicant countries and / or allies.</seg>
<seg id=1341> Take, for example, what happened in the Balkans, where we can say that everyone has played its role to the full.</seg>
<seg id=1342> During this period, we have also kept very informed the United States developments are taking place under the European security and defence policy, which is a sine qua non to develop harmoniously, as is the case at the moment.</seg>
<seg id=1343> The second edition of the annual report of the European Union on human rights was presented to the European Parliament. A forum on human rights will be organised in Paris on 13 December.</seg>
<seg id=1344> This policy, you did not seek to compete with the Atlantic Alliance, which is today the foundation of the collective defence of its Members, and to set up a permanent European army.</seg>
<seg id=1345> On the other hand, if I have mentioned the figure of 100 000 soldiers, this does not mean that we are trying to overcome the objective set at Helsinki, but that we have a reserve in qualifications and different specialities which can ensure that the 60 000 men on the objective of the Council would be achieved, whatever the operating conditions of their jobs.</seg>
<seg id=1346> Allow me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, mentioned in a few words the profound political sense, approved by a large part of the public, of this new task for which Europe becomes a tool of political influence he missed.</seg>
<seg id=1347> The problem we now have is to ensure that, when we talk about consolidating liberal democracy in Europe, we consider the entire European continent, because that is the aim of enlargement and of the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg id=1348> We must integrate into a coherent whole three distinct elements: Community policies, the CFSP (including the ESDP) and the action of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1349> Despite our working procedures, we do not need a force of 60 000 men to meet our objectives.</seg>
<seg id=1350> We must therefore put in place an urgent solution of humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id=1351> I do not agree with the cynics who claim that Europe is a joujou and unusable. It is certainly true that in many situations, the rapid reaction force will not be mobilised directly.</seg>
<seg id=1352> The EU should not develop a defence own staff with fixed.</seg>
<seg id=1353> To conclude, I would like to express the great concern that the members of my group and I are faced with the worsening of the situation in Afghanistan. I should like to urge the Commission and the Council to do everything possible to intensify efforts to achieve a peaceful and come to the aid of the civilian population, particularly at this time, the approach of winter.</seg>
<seg id=1354> To put it very simply: where, when and under what conditions the European intervention force should take action in the future?</seg>
<seg id=1355> It allows us to understand the appalling record of these two months of Intifada: 270 dead, most Palestinians, and nearly 10 000 injured, often handicapped for life.</seg>
<seg id=1356> Hence his relentless efforts to set up an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction we can no longer dismal.</seg>
<seg id=1357> Secondly, contrary to what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it is possible or desirable that the European Union is doing more than it has already done in view of the conflict and the escalation of violence in the Middle East, particularly now, in the period of transition for the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1358> Mr President, in my speech I shall focus on the report by Mrs Lalumière report, which I think is well thought-out and clearly formulated.</seg>
<seg id=1359> But there is no political concept and there is still no real common foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg id=1360> The only problem is that so far, it has not managed to obtain the interests of public opinion for this type of action, despite the fact that they are considerably more sustainable and more effective.</seg>
<seg id=1361> Mr President, there are still, of course, to the budget and the question of how the distribute.</seg>
<seg id=1362> I say this in spite of the mass of apparent miraculously guarantees that have been made on this subject in recent days.</seg>
<seg id=1363> For the moment, the ability we is sadly lacking, and it will, in the end, that the Member States are working on their defence spending programmes which differ greatly from one country to another.</seg>
<seg id=1364> Even those who are questioning that can result on the usefulness of a decision to create this so-called European army must consider the important political aspect of this decision and its influence on the cohesion of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1365> The presence of a Defence Minister for the first time in this House is such a historic event that we have reserved the night sitting for our Members are not impressed too.</seg>
<seg id=1366> For all of these conflicts, a non-military crisis management for prevention is better than a military management.</seg>
<seg id=1367> Russia is, in the long term, remain united in an undemocratic regime?</seg>
<seg id=1368> Therefore, Europe will not be a new alliance, as I have heard, I believe, by a development incomplètement informed.</seg>
<seg id=1369> I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure, to wind up this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1370> Given the scale of the task, four committees were involved and a new procedure has been put in place, with four parallel reports.</seg>
<seg id=1371> All the measures proposed in the White Paper must contribute to modernise and make effective and the functioning of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1372> It is therefore good that the reform is the opportunity to limit their intervention in the only areas which do not involve expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1373> The differences of opinion that have arisen are not only of a political nature, but still reflect more cultural differences between the Fifteen.</seg>
<seg id=1374> The new internal audit service, under your direct responsibility, Mr Kinnock, the Vice-President responsible for reform will main task the analysis of the functions and internal control systems which exist within the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1375> It has been a pleasure to work together, and I believe that the fact that we have all four involved has been thorough and enriched the treatment of a crucial reform process of reform of the Commission, which is essential for the future of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1376> They can expect to be transferred to other European institutions, to be seconded national governments or to work in the private sector.</seg>
<seg id=1377> Also, our Committee on Constitutional Affairs rappelle-t-elle its attachment to a strong, independent Commission, efficient, transparent and politically responsible.</seg>
<seg id=1378> As the Committee on Budgets, we believe that activity-based budgeting is a problem on account of the lack of visibility of expenditure and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament, as the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg id=1379> This will, quite evident, the good will of this Parliament in relation to the implementation of this reform with the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1380> Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1381> This is a disgrace when we think that the European Union presents itself as the champion of the modernisation of economic life!</seg>
<seg id=1382> Mr President, despite the efforts of the rapporteurs to support the work of the Commission, we have not yet made a global and coherent response of the Committee of Independent Experts, which is a policy for the management and not only of better administration of the institution.</seg>
<seg id=1383> This change of attitude should be expressed through a transparent administration.</seg>
<seg id=1384> In my view, there is no structure whose importance is greater. These are fifteen nations, tomorrow twenty or more, an entire continent part of the globe, the most industrialised who live in the Union, and for it in the Commission and its structures.</seg>
<seg id=1385> The change is never easy.</seg>
<seg id=1386> In so doing, however, the Socialist Group believes that the current Community public administration is effective enough.</seg>
<seg id=1387> The result is known and attracts the dedication and the competence of the majority of the members of the committee and its administration.</seg>
<seg id=1388> Several thousands of requests for projects are awaiting an assessment for more than a year.</seg>
<seg id=1389> The debate, as we have seen, is not so much on the principles, objectives and desirability of reform on the procedures, the pace, the timetable, possible problems or unwanted consequences of its implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1390> I would like to inform the House - as pointed out by Mr van Hulten earlier - that the meeting of the College this morning has adopted the proposal for an interinstitutional agreement establishing an advisory committee on standards governing public life, such as the action 1 sets out of the action plan of the White Paper.</seg>
<seg id=1391> I think that Mr van Hulten has once again stressed this point during the debate.</seg>
<seg id=1392> The main aim of this revision is to simplify the procedures, increase transparency and strengthen the budgetary rules, which will result in concrete terms by reducing the number of exceptions and special arrangements incomprehensible, and therefore by greater efficiency in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg id=1393> It is indeed uneconomic for the Commission that the texts stipulate a payment of 20% for the cost X and 30% for costs there and then, there are regrouping and verification of documentation for small amounts.</seg>
<seg id=1394> The next item is the report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of the relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations [2000 / 2051 (INI)].</seg>
<seg id=1395> These latter aspects particularly affect NGOs.</seg>
<seg id=1396> Of course, this is not enough, but this must be to protect the cartoons on the weakness of our development assistance.</seg>
<seg id=1397> We will return to this matter, because this is in itself a framework of quality.</seg>
<seg id=1398> Mr President, I returned today of Mozambique, where the European Union has provided humanitarian aid high-quality following the floods. However, the reconstruction projects for which had already been allocated funds are, once again, delayed awaiting signature in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id=1399> Faced with these realities, the need for greater involvement and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is essential.</seg>
<seg id=1400> We now have a harmonised framework for the elaboration of the country strategy papers and the indicative programmes of cooperation in all developing countries.</seg>
<seg id=1401> What is more, the creation of SEM did not put an end to the disparity that existed between eight volumineuses administrative resources.</seg>
<seg id=1402> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, particularly if I wanted to be with you today for this debate on the maritime first package in the European Parliament, it is because you are going to examine three important texts, which constitute a first, crucial step on a subject that recent events have unfortunately put on the agenda for the topical.</seg>
<seg id=1403> This could allow, moreover, from the point of view of the Presidency of the Council to discuss with the Member States to obtain a Council agreement according to your proposals and to adopt the text at first reading, if necessary by qualified majority.</seg>
<seg id=1404> This rapid response and targeted embodied in the two Erika packages of measures and the six proposals launched important momentum.</seg>
<seg id=1405> The lesson for us within this House in its debate this morning is that we are forced to conclude that the maritime laws are in the world, in a state of control, and that we must get down to the task to put its house in order.</seg>
<seg id=1406> We must send a clear signal to vessels which do not meet standards of safety and mean that we will do more in European waters or in European ports.</seg>
<seg id=1407> For small form, we adopt a compromise position between the ceiling of 5 000 tonnes that set the IMO and 600 tonnes set by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1408> These data should be made available to the European authorities, the Member States and port and the public interest.</seg>
<seg id=1409> The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region, leads to the creation of a Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution.</seg>
<seg id=1410> Environmental organisations are also involved in cooperation at local level.</seg>
<seg id=1411> Amending the directive in the direction of greater rigour in its application, harmonisation of legislation, particularly as regards the selection of ships under inspection, and the scope of the various types of inspection, is clearly positive.</seg>
<seg id=1412> I would also like to mention that the urgency that you mention now has no place.</seg>
<seg id=1413> As regards the limit of liability of classification societies, we must in my opinion that the Council and Parliament to deepen the reflection, irrespective of what is decided today.</seg>
<seg id=1414> A black box, a black list all the things we are active in spite of everything, but I want to highlight a few points.</seg>
<seg id=1415> Faced with this catastrophic situation anarchic and maritime transport, Europe took up the challenge and eleven months after the Erika, the European Union will be able to announce that never procedure has been worked so quickly.</seg>
<seg id=1416> We can see how the liberal logic is opposed to a high level of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1417> Whatever, finally, the technical measures to be taken, one of the major sources of insecurity will remain as long as we do not have rebalanced zone in the English Channel and the North Atlantic, the exponential growth of hypertrophy of traffic in the North Sea ports.</seg>
<seg id=1418> This would be the honour of the President-in-Office of the Council to put things right, also in his own country.</seg>
<seg id=1419> Madam President, since the sinking of the Erika, a package of measures has seen the light of day, political pressure, in order to improve the safety of ships at sea.</seg>
<seg id=1420> Greek ships were sunk, without any storm around, Mr Gayssot.</seg>
<seg id=1421> Thirdly, I think it is becoming clear in such cases, there is no relationship between our supply of oil on the one hand and the fact that we always use of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id=1422> Let us therefore have the political courage to our environmental ambitions.</seg>
<seg id=1423> That means that, in this field more than in any other, our responsibility is great, and we must, I think, silence all institutional self-esteem.</seg>
<seg id=1424> From the point of view of Finland, for example, it is very important that Russia is an integral part of these agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1425> I believe both the strengthening of requirements regarding the construction standards of oil tankers, to improving the control rules for ports, and also, therefore, on tightening of regulations on classification societies ships.</seg>
<seg id=1426> Madam President, we are now discussing maritime safety on the basis of three reports which I warmly congratulate the rapporteurs.</seg>
<seg id=1427> On these three new proposals on maritime safety, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs, who have, in a relatively short period, shown how Parliament is determined to adopt new measures to improve safety at sea, controls, the construction standards and shown that it is no longer tolerable that similar accidents occur again.</seg>
<seg id=1428> Madam President, our continent has recently been struck by a series of wide-ranging maritime disasters, particularly involving oil tankers.</seg>
<seg id=1429> More than 80% of accidents are caused by human error, but there are reasons for human error, which are social order.</seg>
<seg id=1430> A parliamentary or used the term 'traceability'.</seg>
<seg id=1431> The directive on port state control is designed to verify compliance with international requirements and not to introduce new regulations.</seg>
<seg id=1432> Amendment No 18 links the port state control to rest periods seafarers, even if the application of provisions on working hours seafarers is fully covered by the Directive 99 / 95.</seg>
<seg id=1433> I am glad that the rapporteur has introduced a reference in Amendment No 21, the special system of control and I gave our agreement with the main thrust of this approach, but is nevertheless that the wording must be improved in order to clarify matters.</seg>
<seg id=1434> Amendment No 4 and the part of Amendment No 18 on the point K are not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1435> I can assure you that if a shipowner registering a ship under refer to these flags, it would be well advised to think twice in view of our proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1436> The Commissioner spoke for 18 minutes, and during that time she quoted dozens and dozens of articles, and it has rejected the Commission's position.</seg>
<seg id=1437> Proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on a series of actions relating to the trans-European network of collection, production and dissemination of statistics on the deadlines for intra-European and other goods (EDICOM) (COM (2000) 0458 - C5-0401 / 2000 - 2000 / 0201 (COD)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)</seg>
<seg id=1438> By withdrawing our resolution, I am, however, convinced that Parliament would do better to devote its voice, in view of the Nice Council, a specific resolution separate and the extremely important subjects and difficult if the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than treating them within the framework of a single resolution including also all other items on the agenda of the Council.</seg>
<seg id=1439> (More than 12 Members were opposed to voting on the oral amendment was not approved) (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1440> Report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the effects of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI))</seg>
<seg id=1441> I voted against in protest against the fact that the European Union is not yet to intervene as it should do the same in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1442> Although the proposal to amend the existing directive on the control of ships as the Watts report does not meet the real needs, they represent some progress in the right direction. For these reasons, we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1443> It is therefore regrettable that the Commission proposal has not taken up the idea of creating a genuine European supervisory body, on the model of 'coast guards' in the United States.</seg>
<seg id=1444> The safety of ships, the protection of life at sea and the environment require that we tackle the unaccountability of shipowners, very strict measures to control the state of the ship and imposes severe punishment for shipping companies who violate the security rules, which improves the conditions of seafarers, that they are given appropriate training and guarantees of personnel on board that meet the increased needs of vessels.</seg>
<seg id=1445> Unfortunately, the rapporteur Hatzidakis quite the opposite.</seg>
<seg id=1446> The sinking of the Erika accident in December 1999 was at the origin of the emergence of the issue of maritime safety in the Community policy agenda and it is under pressure from the European Parliament that the European Commission has proposed the texts we adopted today, almost a year after this sinister shipwreck.</seg>
<seg id=1447> The existing compensation fund were badly serviced, and this is only too clearly apparent in the case of the Braer disaster, following which the fishing industry of the Shetland Islands was too little compensated compared damages incurred.</seg>
<seg id=1448> I have already said, Madam President, that in the past I have had the opportunity to navigate.</seg>
<seg id=1449> The rapporteur's proposals on the harmonisation at European level can only be positive.</seg>
<seg id=1450> It is an important area since it relates to the classification societies ships.</seg>
<seg id=1451> This would be a great success, because Europe we need, on the eve of enlargement, is not a supranational Europe rigid, disciplined remote, but a flexible Europe, close to the people and therefore, based on respect for national democracies.</seg>
<seg id=1452> The struggle for power between increasingly openly many Member States cloud the prospect of possible compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1453> The Nice Summit will be the main task of guaranteeing the effectiveness of the institutions of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1454> One week before the summit, I have personally confident!</seg>
<seg id=1455> I am not in favour of an automatic link between QMV and codecision, and here too, I believe that any decision to extend the powers of codecision should be examined on a case-by-case basis.</seg>
<seg id=1456> By amending Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extend qualified majority voting, currently in force in the Council for the trade in products, in other areas as public services, intellectual property, health or education.</seg>
<seg id=1457> Thus, Parliament is forbidden to exert an influence, it lays down the voice and quiet on behalf of fidelity and partisan, national government, forgetting and its obligations towards the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1458> I also voted against a text which calls for the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty which will be adopted at Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1459> The share the Union A and B teams is a mistake, and I therefore disapproves allowing a third of Member States to pre-empt the others.</seg>
<seg id=1460> Its new role ended the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.</seg>
<seg id=1461> There are many elements which the British Conservative Group can support in this report, particularly the insistence on the enlargement of the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1462> The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have chosen to support the report on the establishment of a common European policy on security and defence.</seg>
<seg id=1463> But also against the peoples of the European Union which will, in any case, to finance new expenditure of arms advocated by the report and which does not even have the guarantee that these military forces are not a day used against them, in the name of "maintaining order".</seg>
<seg id=1464> It is also important that a state does not wish to participate in a mission should be forced to pay a financial contribution which will be divided between the States participating in this war.</seg>
<seg id=1465> External military means provide no solution, because it does not remove the causes of conflict and do not change the public.</seg>
<seg id=1466> · the fact that military operations would be financed by a line from the Community budget and that the Member States have to contribute financially to the operations even if they do not wish to participate (paragraphs 49 and 50)</seg>
<seg id=1467> The EU would, on the contrary, advantage to alter the priorities set out in the framework of the Petersberg tasks and it should concentrate its efforts on achieving civil and humanitarian tasks.</seg>
<seg id=1468> I support the report by my colleague Mrs Theorin 's.</seg>
<seg id=1469> But we do refers to the needs of this category that to get the request to tax deductibility of domestic services' and a 'adaptation of prices and costs to the financial possibilities individuals'.</seg>
<seg id=1470> It is incredible that we still had to recommend that the Member States should ensure that the twenty-first century domestic employees the right to social security and pension.</seg>
<seg id=1471> For many young people, the first contact with the labour market could take the form of an undeclared employment.</seg>
<seg id=1472> The situation is worsening, when it comes to women distant countries which have accepted this work by necessity and which have no alternative to continue to meet their basic needs.</seg>
<seg id=1473> The reform of the Commission will be judged on coins, hence the need for regular monitoring reports that the European Commission will present throughout the duration of the programme and the importance of the complete expected in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id=1474> . In the recent past, various scandals and problems, in March 1999, led to the resignation of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1475> Finally, I think it is vital to remember that through this reform, which is essential for the future, we expect both more rigour and transparency of the Commission in its day-to-day management, but also a greater sense of responsibility on its part, within the strict framework of its powers.</seg>
<seg id=1476> Conservatives also support the statement in paragraph 7 of the report that we must ensure that the democratic control and the operation of the system by three pillars.</seg>
<seg id=1477> (The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id=1478> We have learned, and I would like to add that I cannot believe - that the President of the Council and of the French Republic will be here tomorrow for thirty minutes, to take the floor.</seg>
<seg id=1479> Therefore, it seems possible that we have a thorough and comprehensive position.</seg>
<seg id=1480> In any event, let us vote, and I am in favour of a resolution as suggested by Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others.</seg>
<seg id=1481> We have worked on these texts in the night, as on the figures for the weighting of votes in the Council and the distribution of seats in this House.</seg>
<seg id=1482> Madam President, I would very much like to speak in favour of maintaining the report by Mr de Roo on the agenda because it was very well prepared and must be the subject of a common position at the last Council of Ministers the environment of the French Presidency, which will be held on Monday and Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id=1483> Thank you, Mr Parish.</seg>
<seg id=1484> In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy - as Mr Brok chair - he smokes in sitting.</seg>
<seg id=1485> The political basis is clear: harmonise the market taking account of a high level of protection of public health and consumers, on the basis of the existing regulations and promoting the scientific point of view.</seg>
<seg id=1486> It is their conditions and design of life, in which the protection of health becomes increasingly important.</seg>
<seg id=1487> This rule can apply to all drugs récréationnelles provided that the consumer but dangerous drugs is the only to run risks.</seg>
<seg id=1488> Yesterday, in the United States, of the trials have been won against the tobacco multinationals for poisoning and lie on the non-toxicité products.</seg>
<seg id=1489> As regards the EU exports of cigarettes banned for health reasons, within the Union, we believe that the only logical and reasonable solution is stopped.</seg>
<seg id=1490> Rather than draw lessons failure in Luxembourg on 9 October we persist in an attitude legally indefensible.</seg>
<seg id=1491> I have carefully examined the statements by Commissioner addressed to my colleague Mr Hume: 'not massive loss of jobs in this sector.</seg>
<seg id=1492> It is up to Parliament and the Council to approve this proposal for a directive and to examine, among other things, its proper legal basis.</seg>
<seg id=1493> I do not think that we can follow a path also restricted, i.e., irrespective of the content of the substantive content - and have highlighted that Mr Maaten and others - there is a risk that, if this Parliament and the Council to accept the restrictive interpretation proposed by the leader of the European People's Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and all the Community institutions are hands tied behind in terms of legislative development of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law.</seg>
<seg id=1494> The weak point of the proposal is that it places great emphasis on the promotion of free competition.</seg>
<seg id=1495> I would conclude that, since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has the power of coordination in the field of the environment and consumer protection, and of course it will work in close cooperation with the Council and the Commission on these matters.</seg>
<seg id=1496> In fact, it has nothing to do with tobacco, but the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Communities have also lead to a ban on alcohol advertising or for chocolate, as it is known that sugar can also be dangerous to health.</seg>
<seg id=1497> I really cannot understand that a majority of MEPs could wish a relaxation of the Rules export compared with the wishes expressed by the governments of the Member States - the governments who are also the many industrial circles concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1498> It is a fact that 80% of smokers want to halt, but the tobacco industry does little to help these policies in place smokers to stop.</seg>
<seg id=1499> If we are beginning to dictate to other countries the public health standards that they should apply in extending our proposals quite sensible for the internal market to exports, we shall endanger the excellent work done by Mr Maaten.</seg>
<seg id=1500> We are in favour of the application of a uniform test method recognised by all the countries of the EU, which must be implemented by a laboratory of tests already approved in one country.</seg>
<seg id=1501> The effects of smoking on health are now widely recognised, and legislators and public opinion share the same feeling that it is now time to adopt the draconian rules and regulations for this product.</seg>
<seg id=1502> Consequently, the Community rules are in harmony with the future international agreements, which we would avoid the danger of trade barriers and at the same time strengthen consumer protection, while ensuring a high level of public health.</seg>
<seg id=1503> It would be better to wait until the whole question of additives is being dealt with in the context of the first report of the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1504> On laboratory tests, the amendment dealing with the approval of the tests is superfluous since another article guarantees the movement of goods which are in accordance with the provisions of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1505> Madam President, this report is all that is more simple: the directives on summer-time have only a period of validity of five years, after which they must come back to this Parliament to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id=1506> The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a Directive on summer-time arrangements in the, which we are debating today, is a good proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1507> I therefore believe that we should not spend too much time on this matter, given that the Member States and the people have already widely accepted the regulation on summer-time and that it has been recognized as an integral part of our annual rate.</seg>
<seg id=1508> I think it is good that the issues of time zones and application of the Directive on summer-time remain the competence of the Member States, as suggested in the proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1509> It would be more reasonable to put an end to the end of September, been around six months after its beginning.</seg>
<seg id=1510> It can nevertheless agree with the idea of making appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report by 2007 mentioned in Article 5.</seg>
<seg id=1511> It has been said that no trial leading to changes in the genetic identity of participating cannot be accepted.</seg>
<seg id=1512> If we approve it, when we have a regulation which guarantees the therapeutic progress and not leave the protection of patients in its current state, but improves it. That is why I am in favour of this compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1513> These groups should remain within the scope of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1514> I am also glad that we have managed to provide safeguards against gene therapy and cell.</seg>
<seg id=1515> I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his work and thank him for the efforts he has made to reconcile opposing views.</seg>
<seg id=1516> These programmes concern the fight against cancer, the prevention of AIDS, addiction prevention and health promotion, and their adjournment would mean the end of the actions concerned and the work of the networks, which have been put in place.</seg>
<seg id=1517> It is very advantageous to iron out the ground in advance, so as to make as much progress as possible, to bring us greatly and, in cases where a second reading would be necessary, to ensure that we are almost at the point to decide.</seg>
<seg id=1518> Furthermore, we must not lose sight of the fact that both the prevention and promoting the vigilance will always be more important and that we must therefore provide them with larger budgets and to give them greater importance.</seg>
<seg id=1519> Madam President, following the Trakatellis report on the extension of some existing European programmes in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about the direction in which the European public health policy.</seg>
<seg id=1520> According to my information, the Council also gave its agreement in principle.</seg>
<seg id=1521> In the European Union, paradoxically, the abolition of internal borders in order to encourage the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is the maintenance of 15 frontiers in the areas of the police and criminal justice, which the Member States have difficulty to ignore.</seg>
<seg id=1522> Finally, the initiative represents significant progress towards the creation of a European criminal justice area still partial and limited, but it responds to the real needs of a considerable mass of European citizens who, when they are victims of an offence outside their country of residence are so far, almost without resort.</seg>
<seg id=1523> What we have therefore asked for these groups of people?</seg>
<seg id=1524> We must at the same time ensure special training professionals in direct contact with the victims.</seg>
<seg id=1525> The victims cannot become doubling victims, victims of crime suffered and victims of the system.</seg>
<seg id=1526> In this context, it is also important that parents close, the victim's family, are informed of the facts so discreet and professional if they have the desire and can also count on the support necessary, avoiding that they learn all the details in the press.</seg>
<seg id=1527> That principle applies whatever the type of crime.</seg>
<seg id=1528> At the level of the Member States, or that of the Union, we must never divert the fundamental principle that everyone must always take responsibility for its actions.</seg>
<seg id=1529> In other cases, it might be possible to obtain useful information in a language of the Union which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id=1530> I am very satisfied with the response of Parliament to this first text on a crucial issue, which allows the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building gradually to offer our citizens a assistance in situations which are often difficult to live.</seg>
<seg id=1531> Vote on request for urgent procedure</seg>
<seg id=1532> (Parliament rejected the request)</seg>
<seg id=1533> Thus, in the night of 23 and 24 November, we have reached an agreement with the Council on the essential points of a budget, which is certainly not brilliant, but which is reasonable.</seg>
<seg id=1534> The Commission had proposed a revision to the tune of EUR 300 million.</seg>
<seg id=1535> But I have also learnt discussions that it is much more difficult to achieve the formulation of a Council position negotiable, to receive a mandate and to lead a purely national self-interest in common European decision slightly reasonable and acceptable.</seg>
<seg id=1536> I hope that the recruitment office work for a common, as we say in German, i.e. a European authority of recruitment, will really, so that we can respond to problems that occur in all the institutions – the Council and the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions, in the coming years, namely the need for staff.</seg>
<seg id=1537> The Council refuses to carry out this review - it seems that we should already have data – and I would prevent: the use of the flexibility instrument two consecutive years - indeed, in less than 15 months and the first to less than six months of the approval of the financial perspective - empty the flexibility instrument because it prevents its renewal and its possible accumulation, which is scheduled to EUR 600 million.</seg>
<seg id=1538> This very significant sum, which responds to the existence of needs very high in 2001, can be financed through the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to the tune of EUR 200 million.</seg>
<seg id=1539> It is taking account of this new element that the Council has voted at second reading a budget increase of 2.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1540> Finally, before you take the final adoption of this budget, I would like to stress the Council 's commitment to respect certain basic budgetary rules on entry in the reserve of appropriations, legal basis and classification of expenditure.</seg>
<seg id=1541> Nice and contrary to the three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission are, I believe, satisfied with the end result.</seg>
<seg id=1542> Ladies and gentlemen, the reappearance of cattle BSE-free makes necessary immediate action in the budgetary context, and precisely for the protection of health, for consumer protection, but also for aid to farmers affected by this situation.</seg>
<seg id=1543> The Council has defined, for the framework programme for reconstruction aid in the Western Balkans, a multiannual indicative amount, of course, which is compatible with the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1544> Struggle, we managed to achieve some millions of euros more.</seg>
<seg id=1545> I am very grateful to Mrs Haug.</seg>
<seg id=1546> We therefore believe that this% of the budget of the European Union is put to good use.</seg>
<seg id=1547> If I understand what you have said, we should not use the reserve because it is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id=1548> I therefore believe that we have seen very good things, in addition to many others, that I cannot mention now because of the short speaking time.</seg>
<seg id=1549> Although the agricultural appropriations, which represent almost half of the total budget increase of more than 5% even taking into account the letter of amendment, the total increase of the budget is only 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id=1550> We can already see now the great danger that the opposition increases in the years between MEDA, the projects for the countries of the Mediterranean and the Balkans, when we all know that there is an urgent need for funds in this area.</seg>
<seg id=1551> Satisfied to have overcome the difficulties which made if close the path towards the objective sought to fulfil the commitments made at Helsinki to candidate countries without undo the Union, to enable the Europe of tomorrow to continue to operate efficiently.</seg>
<seg id=1552> They are real, even if they do not go as far as the presidency - who has shown, I note, at national level, with a greater opening - would have liked.</seg>
<seg id=1553> A new legal basis is planned for the statute for European political parties and Parliament is given the status of institutional requiring provided for in Article 230 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1554> In recent weeks, three important progress has been made.</seg>
<seg id=1555> This is the sense of the declaration adopted in Nice and the deliberations to coordinate at European level the fight against doping.</seg>
<seg id=1556> Among the threats, there is, as everyone knows, the warming.</seg>
<seg id=1557> Furthermore, in Nice, the European Union has put in place the necessary permanent bodies in the definition and the conduct of a common foreign and security policy: a political and security committee, a military committee and a European staff.</seg>
<seg id=1558> For this cooperation, for your support and for your kind welcome, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency thank you.</seg>
<seg id=1559> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1560> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1561> Now we must scrutinise the text to Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1562> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1563> I see a failure, not only in relation to the declared ambition of the European Union to change the institutions in order to be able to welcome the new members in improving the efficiency of the European Union, and I see a failure to another important aim, that we perhaps have too little mentioned, bringing the European Union and the citizens.</seg>
<seg id=1564> The right questions, this is in our view those whose result has been an impressive human tide throughout Europe who has travelled to Nice on the eve of the summit.</seg>
<seg id=1565> First, the Member States have signed hastily and teargas under the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg id=1566> (Applause)</seg>
<seg id=1567> My group is disappointed by this Treaty and concerned for the future which we are also preparing, we would all our forces.</seg>
<seg id=1568> Mr President, you have the floor.</seg>
<seg id=1569> I have already replied on this point, and I entirely agree with what he has said about the need to improve considerably the public debate. I will not repeat what I said, but it is true that, all too often, citizens feel alienated to decisions that are taken in the bodies that they do not know.</seg>
<seg id=1570> Mr President, I would like to know whether the competence of the European Parliament in time were a new conquest of the Nice Summit.</seg>
<seg id=1571> Until then discouraged by the complexity of clinical trials, laboratories may find, in the determination shown by the States that by our Assembly, the courage to develop the paediatric medicinal products market, even if it is not large enough to enable a return on investment.</seg>
<seg id=1572> We must renew the change of summer time which was established at the time of the oil shocks, with a view to saving energy, and which was extended until 2001?</seg>
<seg id=1573> The victims are not always properly protected in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id=1574> Many passengers and holidaymakers will therefore benefit of this European initiative.</seg>
<seg id=1575> Mr President, the time for me to welcome Mr President of the Commission who is and the Presidency of the Council, and to stress that probably never before in this Parliament, has expressed such unanimity on the results of a summit.</seg>
<seg id=1576> That way, is that, under the leadership of the French Presidency, in six months, has, it seems to me, made all her work on six main areas.</seg>
<seg id=1577> However, my greatest fear is that the United Kingdom, France and Germany are now able to reverse the delicate balance that existed between states of different sizes and between the institutions for several decades.</seg>
<seg id=1578> In fact, it is hard to see in this decision of Nice, what is peculiar to facilitate enlargement.</seg>
<seg id=1579> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be very brief today.</seg>
<seg id=1580> As a consequence of this, when we come to vote on the Treaty of Nice, my vote will be negative.</seg>
<seg id=1581> Mr President, the most important outcome of the Nice summit lies in the fact that we are nevertheless reached a treaty, so that we can now prepare their place in the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id=1582> The real winners of this conference, Mr.</seg>
<seg id=1583> So, let us forget Nice post-Nice - and you will permit me to put my great hope in the draft Convention made by Belgium for its Presidency, because proof is made, we must make the nine, we must change of method, we must speed up the story: 2004 it is too late, it is too far, it is too dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=1584> Instead the spirit which prevailed in Nice was instead to ask how making real progress in Europe, to ask how we could block, how we could achieve a decision-making system at intergovernmental level, how we can boast once returned home, having been the defender of national interests.</seg>
<seg id=1585> This before what we are after Amsterdam and Nice, that is a Europe of princes, a Europe of national administrations, and not a Europe of political unification.</seg>
<seg id=1586> We cannot continue without qualified majority decision on the key issues.</seg>
<seg id=1587> It is true that - I paraphraserai Mr Bayrou - I am at this bench since this morning; firstly with the President of the Republic, then by myself and criticism mounts, I believe, moderate, friendly criticism, but even so.</seg>
<seg id=1588> We must not forget that this is the first time, in fact, since 1957, reform and really revise the grid.</seg>
<seg id=1589> We are in the constitutional systems and powers cannot be confused.</seg>
<seg id=1590> Thank you, Minister.</seg>
<seg id=1591> But it has not been incorporated into the Treaties and has not been mentioned in Article 6 (2) of the Treaty on European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1592> Finally, there are some positive elements: the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty, Article on political parties and their status, the right of this Parliament to translate the other institution before the Court of Justice - it is also an important element of political control, the new formula for the European Commission, which is what is known as the 'Prodi' law in the Treaty which strengthens the President and the new composition of the Commission – reasonable compromise that I accept and which will function, with time, and, as my colleague, Mr Tsatsos, pointed out, the road to the future.</seg>
<seg id=1593> Mr President, we have already made a rigorous evaluation of what happened in Nice, but we should remember that Nice is party to a very limited agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1594> See things: the Charter has not been included in the Treaties, it is not even mentioned.</seg>
<seg id=1595> We want to prove to the Heads of Government that we can do better.</seg>
<seg id=1596> Despite its own laudatory statements made this morning by the French Government, the IGC has not ended.</seg>
<seg id=1597> Mr President, the French Presidency is not present in this debate, it is not easy to criticise it.</seg>
<seg id=1598> Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the Intergovernmental Conference method has had its day.</seg>
<seg id=1599> 2001 budget (continuation)</seg>
<seg id=1600> However, this does not mean that we could do more and better.</seg>
<seg id=1601> These maximum oblige the Commission to set priorities within the limits of a certain budget as any authority must do so.</seg>
<seg id=1602> The vote which will follow this debate will conclude a long and complex process of adopting the EU budget for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1603> That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by returning to Article 272; the financial perspective has been maintained, even if we have used the flexibility instrument.</seg>
<seg id=1604> Let me just say to the Council that, on this issue, we still have balloons and that, on this side, we intend to play until we have achieved a good result.</seg>
<seg id=1605> We do not want a proposal for revision for next year is already included in the resolution Colom, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we share its critical view when she says that this way of solving the financial insufficiency in category 4 distorts the multiannual character of the great objectives outside the Union and defining itself of the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1606> For this to be possible, we will have to define the priorities for the future too big.</seg>
<seg id=1607> Only in this way that the money which is available to our citizens, will be used properly and wisely.</seg>
<seg id=1608> If we add to this calculation SAB already coming, it almost seems to 8%, whereas in all the other areas - whether training policy, of the entire area of internal actions, including research, foreign policy, the administration and pre-accession aid, we have only a growth rate of 1.1%.</seg>
<seg id=1609> Since this cooperation is so good, we will still be able to continue in January, at the presentation of the supplementary budget.</seg>
<seg id=1610> The criticism of relations between Russia and the Baltic States which have not yet been satisfactorily resolved we must also.</seg>
<seg id=1611> We are following with great interest the development of society and of internal policy in Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1612> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1613> Even if President Putin guarantees democratic development in his country, he is not automatically the guarantor of a stable and democratic Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1614> We must not be cunning but rather build a Europe of economic cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1615> As far as the Caucasus, Mr Van Orden is absolutely right.</seg>
<seg id=1616> If we look at Russia from outside and receives punctually impressions direct Russian partners, we run the risk of a Russian selectively a reality which is in fact the image has been oneself Russia.</seg>
<seg id=1617> Politically, the common strategy proposes to Russia to engage in a permanent dialogue on politics and security and to create a permanent mechanism.</seg>
<seg id=1618> In this paragraph, I wanted to stress how important it is to stress the fact that Russia is actually political union with Belarus.</seg>
<seg id=1619> Do you support such a project, Mr Patten?</seg>
<seg id=1620> In this context, as Parliament knows, during the last summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi has initiated an in-depth dialogue on energy.</seg>
<seg id=1621> I fervently hope that I am personally in Kaliningrad at the beginning of next year, and not only because Immanuel Kant has spent his whole life.</seg>
<seg id=1622> Once again, I congratulate the honourable Member on his excellent report on a subject of great importance on which I am sure we will look again and again in this Parliament over the next few years.</seg>
<seg id=1623> You put me in a very difficult position.</seg>
<seg id=1624> Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is very important, because the mad cow crisis has enormous effects on food products, on the production and import of food products.</seg>
<seg id=1625> The Council has expressed its concern at the many meetings with Russia, at all levels, particularly to avoid the excessive use of force and a possible extension of the conflict, to carry out independent inquiries and effective on violations of human rights, to support the OSCE assistance group in fulfilling its mission and finally to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id=1626> Mr President, on a point of order: it is customary in this House that when the questions have not been the subject of an oral reply satisfactory, then they should be dealt with in writing.</seg>
<seg id=1627> (Interruption from Mr Posselt)</seg>
<seg id=1628> This directive dates from 1992.</seg>
<seg id=1629> It is in this sense that we must work.</seg>
<seg id=1630> These groups are clearly not exempted in the new proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1631> The presidency and several Member States have already received the Committee of European sugar manufacturers various letters concerning the Commission proposal which they will take account in their deliberations.</seg>
<seg id=1632> Question No 6 by (H-0886 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1633> I would firstly like to say that, in my view, the President-in-Office of the Council has not yet replied to the question by Mr korokas.</seg>
<seg id=1634> We must now implement this authority and I believe that the awareness of the European authorities is strong and that it will be necessary to go ahead.</seg>
<seg id=1635> Specifically, the representative of the Presidency, in this case the French ambassador in Algeria, he met Mr Ahmed taleb?</seg>
<seg id=1636> We welcome the proposed provisions in this respect by the preparatory committee and decided by the General Assembly as regards the way accreditation non-governmental organisations, the preparation process and the special session in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1637> The partnership has several references to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id=1638> As the Council has done to the honourable Member in her earlier reply, the process of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters will better protection of the rights of individuals.</seg>
<seg id=1639> I would like to urge it again.</seg>
<seg id=1640> It is particularly the political control and the strategic direction of a military crisis management operation.</seg>
<seg id=1641> I should simply like to remind you that the system of the Treaty makes a difference between the treatment of taxes and indirect taxes that harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market - that is Article 93 – and the rapprochement, provided for in Article 94, laws which have a direct impact on the establishment and the functioning of the common market, including those concerning direct taxation.</seg>
<seg id=1642> Take a brief look at these three great areas.</seg>
<seg id=1643> If the classic attitude that "in the doubt remain enemies' persists, that could be the Stability Pact of southern Europe based on the principle of regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1644> We also need cooperation with Yugoslavia and more precisely for bilateral cooperation.</seg>
<seg id=1645> Mr President, our group supports the work done by Mr Baltas on the report on the possibility of negotiating a stabilisation and association agreement with the Republic of Croatia.</seg>
<seg id=1646> Mr President, I have had during the years when I have exercised the mandate of President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the opportunity to accompany many Croatians in their efforts towards freedom and prosperity that they could identify with their integration into the European institutions, like other peoples of our continent.</seg>
<seg id=1647> In view of the progress made by Croatia this year, I admit that I do not doubt on our ability to make progress at high speed.</seg>
<seg id=1648> That is what we believe, and the speed with which we have put our policy towards Croatia in recent months in testifies.</seg>
<seg id=1649> We need to Croatia to bring the government and the people of that country all possible assistance in the years to come, and we are very grateful to the honourable Member who has the wisdom to encourage us to continue along this path.</seg>
<seg id=1650> In this connection, it is incomprehensible that thousands of Laskar Jihad have been able, during the spring, go in the Moluccas to stir up again conflicts.</seg>
<seg id=1651> In Timor, the militias are blocking the return of refugees and the rescuers are bullied.</seg>
<seg id=1652> On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I shall confine myself to three points.</seg>
<seg id=1653> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen for her excellent work.</seg>
<seg id=1654> However, in this respect, the country is no exception.</seg>
<seg id=1655> The unremitting violence which are the scene Moluccas, Aceh and Irian Jaya cause great suffering to the population.</seg>
<seg id=1656> Tomorrow, we will be presenting the Sakharov Prize.</seg>
<seg id=1657> The latest news from the Indonesian archipelago compel us, however, to ask ourselves whether the situation of President Wahid and his followers is not even more serious, more critical suggests that the rapporteur's analysis.</seg>
<seg id=1658> If we want to help Indonesia, we must intervene now with money and concrete action, and not just with words.</seg>
<seg id=1659> This report is extremely valuable because he can enlighten us on the development of events.</seg>
<seg id=1660> It is clear that the difficulties of Indonesia will not be resolved in a day.</seg>
<seg id=1661> Protecting the Communities' financial interests</seg>
<seg id=1662> The obstacles to its independence, both in the recruitment of staff and in terms of its structure, must be abolished.</seg>
<seg id=1663> It is therefore essential that by an internal reform process, the Commission finally his declared intention to no longer tolerate any fraud and pursue them accordingly.</seg>
<seg id=1664> I believe that that is the result, and which must also result in Nice.</seg>
<seg id=1665> We want the Member States initiate negotiations with a view to the adoption of uniform legislation in the field of crime, but we reject that our countries depend on a German public prosecutor within the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1666> I would also like to know why the publication of the communication from the Commission on this subject has been postponed to the following day the Danish referendum on the euro.</seg>
<seg id=1667> I tabled an amendment to designate these countries by name, because it is time to state clearly that they are and that they be covered.</seg>
<seg id=1668> I am sure that OLAF believes that it is in its interests to make transparent the choice of its senior leaders.</seg>
<seg id=1669> However, we must ensure that within the European Parliament, not to miss the beam in our force it to concentrate on the mote in it of neighbouring countries, the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1670> We are trying to extinguish the fire, but the smoke suffocate us.</seg>
<seg id=1671> Nobody can understand me either.</seg>
<seg id=1672> To understand this, I would like to highlight four points which I believe are fundamental in the work of the authority of budgetary control.</seg>
<seg id=1673> As for Parliament itself, the problem is the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1674> It is rather worrying, Commissioner, that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties - should be explicitly mentioned the next as regards respect for the rights of Members.</seg>
<seg id=1675> This could for example recommend to the Committee on Budgets to freeze or to reduce the amount of appropriations for the budget lines in the budget for the following year or allow any transfer of appropriations when it comes to increase the budget lines and that, until the end of the internal investigations underway. It can go so far as to demand that the President of the Commission requires the resignation of or the Commissioners concerned by the serious problems that have been identified, European Caesarean sections.</seg>
<seg id=1676> The report calls for detailed inventories operational activities, in-depth studies of budget lines and irregularities and an internal audit of the Committee.</seg>
<seg id=1677> Commissioner, the legal basis for the transmission of information to the European Parliament is the EC Treaty and not the interinstitutional agreement.</seg>
<seg id=1678> Without amendments, the final outcome of this common position would be an inequality of weapons not only with North America but also in Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1679> I cannot really see why we would not here as in all other cases a compromise.</seg>
<seg id=1680> It is a proposal which has come a long - and I fear - weary path to overcome certain problems.</seg>
<seg id=1681> The first amendment relates to Article 4, which establishes what should be the competent authority to control supply.</seg>
<seg id=1682> Now we are faced with a proposal which would lead to a real pagaïe shoot-out just a fair, with its cohort of potential disputes at a delicate moment negotiation.</seg>
<seg id=1683> In the UK, the regulation of occasions, by means of the voluntary code of practice implemented by the Commission of takeover bids, is a real success: this is a good example of pragmatic approach to an extremely complex problem where legislation is less appropriate.</seg>
<seg id=1684> But what is even more important is that it enables us to advance the Lisbon agenda aimed at creating a competitive European economy and dynamic.</seg>
<seg id=1685> The important thing for us here in the European Parliament is finally that the contradictory interests, for example, the executive board versus the shareholders, the large versus small shareholders, companies versus the financial market, minimum form to be regulated at European level.</seg>
<seg id=1686> Some amendments tabled by Parliament are still other improvements to the text of the common position of the Council. They have highlighted the points which may give rise to difficulties of interpretation and insist on a more rapid transposition of the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1687> Indeed, it is not absolutely certain that the definition of fair price which is better than another, because the definitions used in the Member States in all amply sufficient.</seg>
<seg id=1688> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1689> Furthermore, during a period of three years, the artist will have the right to demand of professionals in the art market any information on the amounts which are due, which is sensible because they must keep a register of purchases and sales.</seg>
<seg id=1690> Therefore, it is the Austrian legislator target and not the European legislator creates positive framework conditions for artists and auction houses.</seg>
<seg id=1691> Moreover, in the matter we are discussing, the need for a common position is that only a common position will enable the European Union to influence at international level for the interests of authors can be defended at global level.</seg>
<seg id=1692> I trust in the wisdom and the sensitivity of this House.</seg>
<seg id=1693> In Germany, for example, in 1998, on 7 000 artists who have transferred their rights, 274 only have finally recovered money, not to mention the fact that 40% of the resale right is recovery costs of sums due.</seg>
<seg id=1694> In short, there is no need for harmonisation of this kind in the sector concerned.</seg>
<seg id=1695> A similar amendment was rejected at first reading.</seg>
<seg id=1696> They thought that the translations could follow despite the very tight timetable and difficult.</seg>
<seg id=1697> Only, we have reached a point where we can no longer postpone this debate.</seg>
<seg id=1698> We have proposed in the Commission to carry out a year ago.</seg>
<seg id=1699> Our Parliament is naturally on the side of these values and it will continue to defend them.</seg>
<seg id=1700> Technological developments and the fluctuations of the market will lead to changes in any way.</seg>
<seg id=1701> Here, we cannot find legal justification for an exclusion of competition.</seg>
<seg id=1702> Limiting the universal service - the pillar of the postal sector - to 50 grams risk putting the national governed posts in a difficult situation, in that they can hardly offer a universal service at an affordable price to citizens, regardless of their place of residence.</seg>
<seg id=1703> I would remind my Conservative colleagues the problems they have had in the United Kingdom when they tried to privatise the British posts.</seg>
<seg id=1704> We have either more or less transformed the safety net of users of the postal service in a hamac in which the major players in the postal sector may continue to vautrer and act in complete freedom.</seg>
<seg id=1705> I am very pleased because, even, this notion of special services claimed put new technologies outside the scope of the universal service.</seg>
<seg id=1706> Madam President, Commissioner, we cannot and will not tolerate such a situation.</seg>
<seg id=1707> That is why the European Commission has not proposed, as a second phase, a total liberalisation of this sector.</seg>
<seg id=1708> This is a development of the kind that I wish the other States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1709> Mr Bolkestein has recently condemned the liberal attitude little French in the Dutch press, at least that is what announced the article in question.</seg>
<seg id=1710> In this connection, we could quote Spain, which has been a fund of this type and who uses this to discuss the uncertain legal framework on which the Fund is based, virtual criteria relating to its composition, avals discretionary its implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1711> We vote tomorrow: I hope that the vote will take place before the amendment by Mr Atkins or that of Mr Sterckx, otherwise I shall vote against this report.</seg>
<seg id=1712> Royal Mail participates in competition and distributes my mail in Malmö in Sweden.</seg>
<seg id=1713> Madam President, Commissioner, that we have learned from the debate, or rather the controversy caused by Commissioner Bolkestein in its pursuit of a liberalisation of postal services, in the absence of any assessment of the first stage and in violation of the rules laid down by this directive?, under the guise of promoting and progressive terms such as modernisation, liberalisation, the technological booms, leaning in a social decline in the quality of a country.</seg>
<seg id=1714> The safeguarding of universal service to a compensation fund which would engage in private profits for the benefit of the public service will probably long.</seg>
<seg id=1715> These limits and these delays have also contributed to a debate in which we often confuses the means and ends.</seg>
<seg id=1716> We cannot address this matter, Madam President, not to mention the economic and social cohesion.</seg>
<seg id=1717> Madam President, firstly I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, because he has done a complex, hard work and he has endeavoured to strike a balance between the proposals, positions and points of departure and arrival completely different.</seg>
<seg id=1718> I fear that this proposal does strengthens the current position of the monopolists at the taxpayers' expense and increases the threshold imposed on newcomers.</seg>
<seg id=1719> I am also pleased to see that our liberal friends of the continent show an example to the British Liberal.</seg>
<seg id=1720> Admittedly, I admit that liberalisation in itself is not a problem, and that it can be beneficial for consumers.</seg>
<seg id=1721> Justified, because it fits into the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union, which put forward the completion of the internal market for the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id=1722> Universal service is the cornerstone of the Community policy in this area and everything we do is to create a climate conducive to improve it.</seg>
<seg id=1723> The special services are also a sector where innovation and modernisation must be encouraged.</seg>
<seg id=1724> According to him, by the end of the decade, opening up to competition of almost all of the postal market seems inevitable.</seg>
<seg id=1725> I believe we must firm guarantees in order to preserve constantly universal service and its obligations.</seg>
<seg id=1726> That is why I cannot and do not want silent when the future of the sector is threatened by a possible decision which would not respond properly to the challenges that have been launched at all in Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id=1727> Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.</seg>
<seg id=1728> However, I would remind you that this common market organisation main purpose is guaranteed access to the Community market of its products.</seg>
<seg id=1729> I am glad that we have been able to reach a unanimous vote in the Committee on Agriculture. I thank my colleagues and Mr Fernández Martín, rapporteur for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, for his support.</seg>
<seg id=1730> We cannot fail to express our concern for the banana production of some ACP countries, small producers in the Caribbean countries and some West African countries which are traditional suppliers of the banana market and with whom we have made commitments that we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id=1731> I therefore hope that this report is supported by Members of this House, as was the case in the Committee on Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id=1732> Meanwhile, the United States condemn initially the reference periods historical but advocate keeping their own historical reference periods.</seg>
<seg id=1733> Powerful interests come into play, especially those of the Americans, who are not themselves of banana producers, but who have hidden the American capital in commercial companies.</seg>
<seg id=1734> Sometimes it seems that the Commission, in the proposals deregulation of trade and agricultural production at international level, goes further than the Cairns Group.</seg>
<seg id=1735> It is unfortunate that the Commission and the Council persists in a solution that can seriously compromising this production, especially after 2006.</seg>
<seg id=1736> Successive decisions by the WTO does not say that it is forbidden to accord preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers.</seg>
<seg id=1737> Thus, the transitional period should be around fifteen years and no less than ten years; compensation should include a secure income of Community producers and the disposal of production in the outermost regions. We must also include aid to entities who sell bananas are produced.</seg>
<seg id=1738> I hope that it will listen today our arguments, because this system proposed by the Commission, this tariff preference, even EUR 300, could prove useful in the facts because the ACP producers will be rolled out by the system known as the 'first come, first served'.</seg>
<seg id=1739> Votes</seg>
<seg id=1740> (Parliament approved the Commission proposal)</seg>
<seg id=1741> The Commission refuses to accept the other amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1742> Before the vote:</seg>
<seg id=1743> (Parliament accepted the oral amendment)</seg>
<seg id=1744> Report (A5-0376 / 2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the reform of the institutions and procedures budgetary control (2000 / 2008 (INI))</seg>
<seg id=1745> Most smokers do not know all the risks and do not pay the real price of their choice.</seg>
<seg id=1746> I am always adhered to this principle in my long parliamentary career 35 years.</seg>
<seg id=1747> I fear that their hopes are in vain.</seg>
<seg id=1748> It is our ultimate attempt to put on cigarette packets of labels and images which reflect the real dangers of smoking.</seg>
<seg id=1749> Lehne report (A5-0368 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1750> This analysis seems to me both appropriate and justified, even today, and that is why I voted against this report in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id=1751> It is right that the Committee on Legal Affairs persists in refusing a ceiling and the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be less than 7%.</seg>
<seg id=1752> Oppose this directive is also for my group a means to give a clear political signal: we must not waste our time to create in Europe with unnecessary rules.</seg>
<seg id=1753> It is right to denounce the old Stalinist dictatorship, how can we give the slightest confidence to Mr Putin, the murderers of the Chechen people, the godfather of the mafia, which strives to liquidate all opposition, civil society, political parties (unions), in order to strengthen his personal power?</seg>
<seg id=1754> Admittedly, Indonesia does not merit such a development of relations, because we cannot say that, over recent years, its leaders have distinguished themselves in their great democratic spirit and by their great merits, but we must take account of the Indonesian citizens, and therefore this agreement for developing relations and this aid.</seg>
<seg id=1755> The unit will do that criminal acts committed by officials of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1756> The Theato report on the fight against fraud will discover that the European Central Bank, presumably to prove its famous independence, has not seen fit to accede to the agreement on the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).</seg>
<seg id=1757> That concludes voting time.</seg>
<seg id=1758> Either we are part of the club, or we are not and we must therefore we abide by this decision.</seg>
<seg id=1759> It is therefore not at all - but bananas EEB. Do not cause, ladies and gentlemen, a name change.</seg>
<seg id=1760> The tariff only system is, however, one important element which ensures the balance of the Commission proposal and is an important basis which must enable the Council to make progress.</seg>
<seg id=1761> There are also measures to the marking of these bananas in national and regional programmes to promote rural development.</seg>
<seg id=1762> Europe and the United States are working closely with the defence of the values we share.</seg>
<seg id=1763> We are discussing a new WTO round and the implications for this round of many bilateral trade initiatives which are the subject of debates in the American hemisphere.</seg>
<seg id=1764> It was rightly mentioned that transatlantic relations are much developed these last ten years – in great part, it is true, the American side thanks to President Clinton; but I believe that history will recall that there has also been a European contribution to these new relations – quite fundamental contribution - with the 1990 Transatlantic Declaration and the new transatlantic agenda adopted under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995.</seg>
<seg id=1765> It will therefore be important to undertake a reversal of progress and to compose a transatlantic agenda for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id=1766> I will conclude with the Dominican Republic who said: 'the WTO was supposed to be an honest broker applying common rules and where the various countries could learn to play the game.</seg>
<seg id=1767> Secondly, even though we welcome the withdrawal of the Communist sham, the collapse of the Soviet Union has left the only superpower, the United States of America.</seg>
<seg id=1768> I know that it maintains a constructive dialogue with Parliament and with the committees which deal with these issues.</seg>
<seg id=1769> The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:</seg>
<seg id=1770> These objectives, the overriding goal and secondary objectives, will be the yardstick by which we judge the concrete proposals put forward by the Commission.</seg>
<seg id=1771> It is clear that such a solution - registration in one country with the possibility of providing services throughout the Union - can cause an avalanche in countries where the rate of taxation is weak.</seg>
<seg id=1772> Thus, an agreement was reached in 1992, then regarded as minimum harmonisation, which meant that the standard VAT rate could be below 15%, the Member States having the opportunity to apply one or several reduced rates cannot be below 5%; exemptions being laid down in this case.</seg>
<seg id=1773> We have asked the European Commission to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and to submit a report to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1774> In summary, the aim of this proposal is laudable, but the method is ill-conceived and if we really want to encourage the e-economy in Europe, it would be good to provide our electronic commerce VAT rather than try to impose our problems to others.</seg>
<seg id=1775> If we are to meet the requirement of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, we have to take all possible measures to restrict their production.</seg>
<seg id=1776> The only case for which no tax is a delivery is still seen in the European Community from a third country.</seg>
<seg id=1777> Positive discrimination concerning air transport must stop.</seg>
<seg id=1778> Businesses from third countries which are not members of the European Union are not subject to taxation.</seg>
<seg id=1779> The CDs are not so archaic and should be tax, while the latter are programmes that would move by Internet!</seg>
<seg id=1780> However, the proposed solution can only be technically unworkable and hinder the development of online transactions in the Union, precisely at a time when everyone wants, on the contrary, their expansion.</seg>
<seg id=1781> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the European Union are deteriorating and lose in return.</seg>
<seg id=1782> We should be looking to encourage electronic commerce and not new ways of the tax.</seg>
<seg id=1783> As Liberals, we say that we must state the least possible.</seg>
<seg id=1784> The Primarolo group drew up simple rules which must be applied.</seg>
<seg id=1785> The group that I represent in this House, however, an objection and think that we need to balance the situation between the newspapers, enjoy a reduced rate of VAT, and newspapers, which do not.</seg>
<seg id=1786> A kerosene tax cannot therefore exist as part of an international consensus, in order to ensure the balance of competition.</seg>
<seg id=1787> I particularly welcome the fact that the report highlights one of the key points that I raised in my report for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted by this Parliament a few months ago, namely that since it is certainly politically difficult to achieve an international agreement on the taxation of aviation, at least in the short term, we should use of alternative to get the same tools, including a tax on emissions.</seg>
<seg id=1788> In fact, the industry pays 100% of its infrastructure costs through the air traffic control and airport charges, which cost $4 billion in 1998 - unlike other modes of transport, such as rail transport or by road, which are still heavily subsidised.</seg>
<seg id=1789> The current situation is unfavourable.</seg>
<seg id=1790> On this subject, is that there is a problem with regard to emissions caused by air traffic. Even if the percentage is not so high, it increases significantly and therefore we cannot underestimate it.</seg>
<seg id=1791> This system would be detrimental for SMEs inside and outside the Union, especially if we consider the proposed reduction of the exemption threshold at excessively low level of EUR 40 000 of annual turnover.</seg>
<seg id=1792> If we are too greedy as regards the matter under discussion, we are really in danger the future of electronic commerce, important for Europe.</seg>
<seg id=1793> The principle that suppliers outside the Community and making services to customers within the Community must register in one place must not lead to a shift of tax revenue between the Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1794> Given that the discussion is not yet completed within the Council, and because the Commission wishes to complete the dossier of VAT and e-commerce relatively quickly, I think that the wisest course of action would not yet formally accept the amendments put forward by Parliament, but to try to achieve the greatest possible number of these proposals in the Council negotiations.</seg>
<seg id=1795> So I cannot accept the proposed amendments.</seg>
<seg id=1796> Thank you very much for all the issues that you have raised this week.</seg>
<seg id=1797> Only three months after the accident, the Commission, for its part, has assumed its responsibilities by adopting a first package of measures, that the European Parliament has fully approved on 30 November.</seg>
<seg id=1798> With more than fifteen directives or regulations in force, it is indeed urgent to standardise practices and to exert tighter control on the application of Community rules, in order to avoid possible differences, important and unacceptable, within the European Union in the field of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1799> Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her continuous commitment in the field of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg id=1800> I would like to remind Members that in terms of air safety, compensation applied in the European framework and in the context of North America does not amount to the amounts applied in other countries.</seg>
<seg id=1801> Secondly, I would say that it is the French courts which could confiscate or freezing the funds from one company to compensate some damage or other; it is the French courts which could establish responsibilities beyond those criteria laid down in the objectives of the current international rules on pollution to oil.</seg>
<seg id=1802> The Commission considers that such adjustments go in the direction of the establishment of a fairer tax system which also encourages a more rational and efficient use of the road network.</seg>
<seg id=1803> Criticism, especially those of Ireland and France, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has given a new interpretation: it is now a tax for all users, including the British lorry drivers.</seg>
<seg id=1804> I am determined to ensure that the food consumers responds to the highest standards, it comes from within and from outside the Union.</seg>
<seg id=1805> Of course I understand the concern of the honourable Member.</seg>
<seg id=1806> I am sorry to say, Commissioner, that your reply does not suit me.</seg>
<seg id=1807> The honourable Member's remarks are important.</seg>
<seg id=1808> In Nigeria, the indigenous people all-ijaw accused Chevron to incite violence against them and to pay Nigerian soldiers to draw on the demonstrators in the warri naval base.</seg>
<seg id=1809> In his report adopted on 15 November, the Commission concluded that operating aid granted under the Regulation 1540 / 98 was not resolved the problem of prices in South Korea.</seg>
<seg id=1810> I believe that all the intentions is very reassuring, but, in the meantime, the fact is that our shipyards are closing.</seg>
<seg id=1811> Question No 38 by (H-0868 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1812> I understand, Commissioner, that you do not want change your decision, despite the fact that ten Member States are opposed to such duties.</seg>
<seg id=1813> This initiative is based on a Council regulation amending the regulation which sets out the current GSP.</seg>
<seg id=1814> I represent some farmers and I am therefore very worried.</seg>
<seg id=1815> We are working on in committee, we have not taken this week, Poul Nielson being absent shift in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg id=1816> We are working on the safeguard clause and if Mr Clegg needs arguments, to speak with its beet growers, I have at his disposal.</seg>
<seg id=1817> I would like to thank Mr Liikanen for his reply, which is very positive and welcome.</seg>
<seg id=1818> I will discuss it with my services when the budgetary resources for next year will be defined.</seg>
<seg id=1819> Currently, the efforts made by my services and I seek to limit the consequences of the distance between the parties and the future Court.</seg>
<seg id=1820> Like specialized courts in patent law of Düsseldorf, Munich and other German cities, but also of London, a Community court competent Community patent should be very specialised.</seg>
<seg id=1821> In order to prevent this provisional situation takes a definitive nature, the Commission, on 13 July last year, said in a letter to the Member States concerned their obligation to indicate what are their competent courts in terms of Community trademarks.</seg>
<seg id=1822> As the honourable Member knows, the tabling of a complaint would in itself has no influence on the progress of the respective project.</seg>
<seg id=1823> Question No 47 by (H-0877 / 00):</seg>
<seg id=1824> This means that the Commission makes use of the legal means at its disposal in the direction heard in the regulation.</seg>
<seg id=1825> The question is: who should address these students to understand that, when they are following this round of studies and concluded in Britain, they have the right to have results.</seg>
<seg id=1826> The King, elected for a limited period, could, for example, be chosen from among the most deserving Finnish MEPs.</seg>
<seg id=1827> It can also be seen as a question of competition, as we can continue to practise of duty-free sales in the southern part of the Baltic, on the line between Stockholm and Helsinki, whereas they are banned on the line between Umeå and Vasa.</seg>
<seg id=1828> We must rectify the situation in stimulating and encouraging the multilingual content, given that it is absolutely crucial to the success of European content.</seg>
<seg id=1829> The problem which concerns me most is that small businesses do not always sufficient guarantees, history or commercial established to offer to investors.</seg>
<seg id=1830> To complete the ambitious development of this European programme e-content, procedures must be simplified and secure the envisaged.</seg>
<seg id=1831> It is for this reason that the measures of public subsidies in favour of the content industry of the EU (their usefulness has been proven) must also aspire to a culture and a high-level education and cultural diversity.</seg>
<seg id=1832> On the other hand, there is the communication networks which need constantly to fulfil their content and who see virtual area as self-evident to submit content of the corner and exploited without really production rules.</seg>
<seg id=1833> Mr President, I welcome the launch of this programme -content and would like to draw attention to two aspects.</seg>
<seg id=1834> That is why I support the amendments calling for the adoption of specific actions in the field of new technologies.</seg>
<seg id=1835> Firstly, the Commission welcomes Parliament stresses the social and cultural dimension of digital content.</seg>
<seg id=1836> Assessment and management of environmental noise</seg>
<seg id=1837> Indeed, I am grateful for the support that the Christian Democrats, and indeed also part of the Liberal Group, have brought to this specific amendment, to begin to limit noise pollution caused by aircraft.</seg>
<seg id=1838> Only this year, six years behind, and under the pressure of the French Government, so that the Commission presented its proposal for harmonised noise indicators.</seg>
<seg id=1839> It is a moderate proposal. Scandinavia has already stricter standards than those proposed for 2012.</seg>
<seg id=1840> Orly Schiphol, Barcelona and other already meet strict standards.</seg>
<seg id=1841> Another important point made by us and that will be of great importance in the context of the problem of noise emissions from aeroplanes, concerns the need to provide additional noise indicators in addition to those mentioned by the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg id=1842> By lack of common standards in the European Union, we have seen situations of distortions of competition between airports and lack of equality between the citizens of the various Member States.</seg>
<seg id=1843> That is why I find the amendments of my colleague, Bernd Lange so important.</seg>
<seg id=1844> Firstly, I must say that I welcome this report.</seg>
<seg id=1845> That was the point of principle behind Amendment No 36, although I think that this idea is not yet sufficiently consolidated.</seg>
<seg id=1846> We should verify this carefully and adopt the combined approach in both areas, i.e. set limits for each source of emissions on the one hand and, on the other hand, define quality standards for emissions.</seg>
<seg id=1847> We need more time and I regret that we have not prepared, even if, in general, I support the framework directive.</seg>
<seg id=1848> If the Member States made comparable data, the Commission will take into account the question of maximum values at Community level, as well as other measures to reduce the number of people affected by noise and to refer to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=1849> Food additives other than colours and sweeteners</seg>
<seg id=1850> These are the three criteria.</seg>
<seg id=1851> Thank you, Mr Camre. I am in favour of your question, because if you have a carrot in my throat, I have personally a pig's throat, as the saying goes, but the flu short somewhat here.</seg>
<seg id=1852> Furthermore, if chronic dietary problems, the risk of cancer is increasing.</seg>
<seg id=1853> It is also clear that the Commission did not have the appropriate instruments to intervene properly.</seg>
<seg id=1854> Tomorrow, a new phase is programme. Our colleague, Mrs Paulsen, of the Liberal Group, will then be track and will have the opportunity to further improve the directive.</seg>
<seg id=1855> The Member States and the Commission now have a better instrument for ensuring that Community law on animal feed is properly applied and to ensure that, in the event of crisis situations arise in third countries, the quicker reactions are possible.</seg>
<seg id=1856> We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities and that up to now, the towns which were parents' poor '.</seg>
<seg id=1857> The planning process must be implemented and fair way innovative.</seg>
<seg id=1858> The multiannual programme 2000-2004 for sustainable development in urban areas is an appropriate instrument to achieve this, the implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent means of coordination and development actions.</seg>
<seg id=1859> The reduction of transport and the abandonment of fossil fuels at local level are necessary to achieve a change from the point of view of climate threats as we know it today.</seg>
<seg id=1860> Many voices suggested that this budget was too low.</seg>
<seg id=1861> It is expected that the main partners in this context are the Commission and the networks of local authorities whose legal responsibility is to develop and implement policies relating to sustainable development in urban areas.</seg>
<seg id=1862> The Court of Justice of the European Communities and even the bodies responsible for resolving disputes the WTO consider that the precautionary principle is to apply environmental or in terms of public health, and sometimes even against Europeans, as is the case pending cheese milk believed.</seg>
<seg id=1863> The aim must not be limiting the damage or compensation, the primary objective must be to prevent harmful effect on health or people.</seg>
<seg id=1864> In 1996, the European Parliament has voted in favour of a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only we had listened to.</seg>
<seg id=1865> Absolute scientific certainty on the new products or substances is not and never will.</seg>
<seg id=1866> Finally, if the precautionary principle must be implemented effectively and credible, it is vital to involve all key players, including the representatives of civil society, political choices surrounding its implementation.</seg>
<seg id=1867> Finally, health and the environment must take precedence over other considerations, particularly those economic.</seg>
<seg id=1868> A related essential condition for the application of the precautionary principle is that the concerns about the possible harmful effects are backed up by a scientific basis.</seg>
<seg id=1869> Yesterday, in Lisbon, an American professor George Carlo, which has received a study on the effect of the airwaves for human health by the Food and Drugs Administration, revealed that the use of mobile phones could lead to the emergence of brain tumours, Alzheimer's disease and disability skin.</seg>
<seg id=1870> Mr President, the environment and public health are entitled to a machine which the complexity is such that we must monitor its multiple functions in order to be able to intervene and thus avoid problems.</seg>
<seg id=1871> The application of this principle must avoid at all costs stifle innovation and economic activity, to create the overcautiousness industrial and stagnation, become a means to divert competition.</seg>
<seg id=1872> Parliament has certainly noticed that the Commission agrees with most of the issues raised in the draft resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1873> The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.</seg>
<seg id=1874> Article 2 enshrines the right to life, and whenever Spain terrorism kills one, it is the whole of the European Union feel concerned in what is one of its most important principles.</seg>
<seg id=1875> Our intention is not to replace the institutions legitimately established, but to encourage them to protect our rights and our freedoms without making concessions to terror.</seg>
<seg id=1876> Votes</seg>
<seg id=1877> It also recalled the observation of the Council on the classification of budget lines on the draft retirement of the Commission and on the administrative expenditure of the fisheries agreements.</seg>
<seg id=1878> (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)</seg>
<seg id=1879> I think that this is more!</seg>
<seg id=1880> Recent decide that the number of 23 428 is insufficient, but they will be satisfied with the area of growth which is offered.</seg>
<seg id=1881> This deletion, which began in the middle of last year, as we feared has led to a dramatic decline in the adoption of projects and payments, so that the annual implementation authorisations for this Fund was below 1% at the end of June 2000.</seg>
<seg id=1882> This text is a licence ideal to close down the general secretariat of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id=1883> Before I start, they said to me: 'it is Christmas and we, at Bergamo we celebrate Christmas and St Lucia.</seg>
<seg id=1884> Above all, we are very critical of the overproduction of agricultural products and the use of EU information means to sell this surplus.</seg>
<seg id=1885> Mr President, I voted in favour of the Garcia-Margallo y Marfil report, which concerns the taxation of services provided electronically.</seg>
<seg id=1886> Mr President, I will try, before 2004, to do something in Malta in making a statement in favour.</seg>
<seg id=1887> I say this with a certain solemnity: it is the most I can accept a Europe, for me, too liberal!</seg>
<seg id=1888> The deadline would encourage the posts to develop and to modernise their services and facilitate the planning and investments on the market.</seg>
<seg id=1889> They continue to put pressure. The money they earn with distribution beyond the bounds of 150 grammes allows them to strengthen their position.</seg>
<seg id=1890> The liberalisation of postal services proposed by the Commission is neither appropriate nor consistent, and that is why I voted for the report and all the amendments tabled which expressed this same line.</seg>
<seg id=1891> De Roo report (A5-0378 / 2000)</seg>
<seg id=1892> Not being convinced of their compatibility with the WTO, we also have our reservations about Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31.</seg>
<seg id=1893> A globalisation that disregards the most fundamental rights of the human person.</seg>
<seg id=1894> This would be contrary to respect for the national identity (Article 6 (3) of the Treaty on European Union).</seg>
<seg id=1895> It must be stressed that the linguistic minorities, instead of being crushed by the globalisation of the Internet, have found new openings cultural and economic.</seg>
<seg id=1896> Mr President, if no other results, the haggling of Nice will shed light on the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1897> The tone of the joint resolution is, from this point of view, far too unilateral.</seg>
<seg id=1898> The delay the publication of written conclusions - which are not yet officially available at the moment, four days later - shows the difficulty of produce clear decisions taken in confusion.</seg>
<seg id=1899> The only way to avoid the future of dangerous conflicts is to stick to the traditional view that Europe is based on mutual respect for national communities.</seg>
<seg id=1900> The Nice Summit has concluded Sunday by an agreement which should result in a draft Treaty.</seg>
<seg id=1901> The resolution on the Nice Summit, which has just been adopted, does not reflect it.</seg>
<seg id=1902> Finally, I would like to make a reference to social policy, which insist on France at the presentation of its presidency, but which is ultimately a full of very little, despite the declarations of intent and the titles of the documents to the content very vague and clearly inadequate compared to existing problems and to the enormous dissatisfaction, whose demonstration of workers in Nice will have been an important expression also.</seg>
<seg id=1903> Clearly, nothing has changed for the really important issues such as tax, taxes, social policy, asylum and immigration.</seg>
<seg id=1904> The factor of the debate on Nice is the image of a Treaty finally without father or mother, since there is nobody's son. The French Presidency has confused in excuses, rather than unequivocally shoulder the results of the IGC and their reasons; the political groups, which correspond to the governments of the Member States, have increased their criticisms.</seg>
<seg id=1905> On the contrary, the power of the national democracies is increasingly to restrict the right of veto and of giving Parliament more power for the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1906> If we had been able to foresee these consequences at the conclusion of the Treaty of Chicago during the year I was born - 1944, no tax exemption for fuel and other equipment for aircraft have probably been agreed.</seg>
<seg id=1907> Zero risk scientists do not exist, or at least the policies must apply the criterion of proportionality, judge the risks uncertain and assume their responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id=1908> This Parliament has, however, also fought for this reduction of funds for innovative actions should be compensated for by the use of flexibility, defined in a statement on the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg id=1909> Everyone has a role to play. Indeed, we are engaged in a global market is undeniable, and these are the innovations that will enable Europe to maintain its place among the major technological changes in the new industries and, in particular, in information technology, assuming, of course, that they receive sufficient financial resources and support realistic and relevant.</seg>
<seg id=1910> During the previous speeches, some serious words have been spoken about the budget. EUR 400 million is really only a minimum for the funding and it will, in the second half of the year, additional credits take advantage of the possibilities offered by the flexibility instrument, as the report notes.</seg>
<seg id=1911> In my opinion, this must be accompanied by automatically the loss of the European added value, contrary to the conclusion of the report.</seg>
<seg id=1912> As we all know, in the European Union, unemployment is concentrated on the least-developed territories of technological and economic point of view, especially the Objective 1 regions. We must therefore that the innovative actions are not only a technological nature, but they are from an explicit desire to develop the economy and employment.</seg>
<seg id=1913> When I return in my home region, in the East of England, and I see that absolutely no local authority has used the money that it has received during the last period, I doubt that we have shown the effectiveness which we need in the future to welcome the new communities.</seg>
<seg id=1914> Mr President, my first words to convey to Mr Markov my thanks and my congratulations on the extremely competent and serious constructive presentation of the draft communication on these innovative measures of the ERDF for the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id=1915> Energy efficiency and the aspects of environmental policy are not forgotten in these guidelines. They can give rise to innovative measures under the third issue, which concerns the regional identity and sustainable development.</seg>
<seg id=1916> However, we wish that projects are selected at regional level, as has been well understood Mr Berend in his speech.</seg>
<seg id=1917> The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1918> That is why we are asking for in this report and in the three additional amendments that the Commission multiplies the international efforts to impose the procedure for settling disputes of the WTO.</seg>
<seg id=1919> It seems to me that the Commissioner must show the industry is doing everything in its power to satisfy this external threat to it.</seg>
<seg id=1920> Finally, of course, we expect from the 18 December, in the meeting of the group 6 of the OECD, the "seagoing vessels" arrangement should be examined.</seg>
<seg id=1921> But it seems that the finishing line to be postponed so that every time we meet ever.</seg>
<seg id=1922> As you all know, this procedure will take more than six months.</seg>
<seg id=1923> For the large corporations such as for their political lawyers demand less State simply means that the state and its exclusive funding must be available to them.</seg>
<seg id=1924> But to achieve this, so that the process will consolidate the shipbuilding industry and employment and reassure the families who depend on aid must continue beyond 31 December 2000 because, on the market, we are not on an equal footing, there is unfair competition and dumping practices.</seg>
<seg id=1925> Improving the competitiveness of EU shipyards is encouraged by the Commission, but to massive dumping prices applied by Korea, improving conceivable productivity is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id=1926> It has also pointed out that the existence of this mechanism should not create distortions of competition within the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1927> The presence of nuclear submarine with a fault in the Bay of Algeciras unfortunately has turned into a diplomatic conflict between a military nuclear power and colonial and a second-class Member State, according to the latest classification of Nice, which does not exercise its rights and explanations basks in childhood.</seg>
<seg id=1928> When, through the medical part in the country of the owner - in other words, by means of the British press - discovered that the disease was serious, instead of the change of heart, they changèrent qualification of the centre.</seg>
<seg id=1929> Of course we are waiting with interest the response of the Commission to see whether the objective has been achieved.</seg>
<seg id=1930> Mr President, I too would like to start by expressing my condolences to the family of councillor murdered, and the members of the Partido Popular, and reject this barbarity fascist of ETA and groups which protect him.</seg>
<seg id=1931> I also think it would be good if the submarine Tireless is taken in Britain to be repaired as soon as possible when the appropriate climate conditions allow.</seg>
<seg id=1932> Honourable Members have asked whether the Commission considers that the Directive 89 / 618 / Euratom on public information on measures to protect health and on the behaviour in case of emergency radiological and Directive 96 / 29 / Euratom laying down basic safety standards for the protection of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation apply in the case of the submarine and what measures had been taken accordingly.</seg>
<seg id=1933> If it is best lawyer that our advisers, I look forward to hearing. I shall therefore come back to Article 37.</seg>
<seg id=1934> One aspect of the Euratom Treaty concerns the transport of radioactive waste of a Member State of the European Union to another, but, as Gibraltar is, of course, part of the UK, all shipments of waste will be part of the United Kingdom to another without involving another Member State of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id=1935> This is my opinion. It is simply to win the trust of the people living in the stone.</seg>
<seg id=1936> We see here a Member State which deals with public opinion in another Member State as it would do with any state in the world, as if, basically, there was no affectio societatis fifty years after the start of the European company, as if European solidarity did not progressed.</seg>
<seg id=1937> It is a fact that at one point, the only submarine operating in British waters was a German submarine.</seg>
<seg id=1938> Then we debate but the citizens based on their knowledge and intuition, running their attention towards the European institutions.</seg>
<seg id=1939> It is clear that the reduction of investments in new military equipment linked to the restrictions of the military budget decided by the Labour Government will in future cases of withdrawal of military equipment for repair of substance.</seg>
<seg id=1940> However, it does not extend, contrary to what some people wish, the classification of ports may receive submarines broken down or questions of technical safety of nuclear reactors and the conditions under which a submarine needs to be sent to repair in another place.</seg>
<seg id=1941> We need to help them more, call for the Community institutions to strengthen the financial resources, human and material of UNHCR.</seg>
<seg id=1942> I ask the Commission to raise this aid to UNHCR and also to appoint this last as coordinating body in all its contracts with NGOs.</seg>
<seg id=1943> It must therefore be able to access civilian victims and his staff on the ground should be able to be deployed safely and having the necessary resources to carry out their tasks.</seg>
<seg id=1944> On 22 November, the Commission adopted a communication on the establishment of a common asylum procedure and a uniform status on the granting of refugee valid throughout the Union. This is the overall objective that tends towards the common European asylum system established in Tampere.</seg>
<seg id=1945> I shall conclude by paying tribute to the work that Mrs Ogata has done for the UNHCR and in welcoming Mr Ruud Lubbers in his new post.</seg>
<seg id=1946> We feel it is important to promote a policy in Yugoslavia amnesty for the restoration of democracy, but it is also important to condemn without doubt the resumption of incursions and terrorist activities on the borders between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo because they alarmingly reminiscent of what happened during the Kosovo conflict, where Western powers have had some responsibility.</seg>
<seg id=1947> Our compromise resolution is clear in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.</seg>
<seg id=1948> I would also appeal to President Kostuníca to explain what happened to people like Mr Ukshin Hoti, whose fate, that we do not completely, is of great interest to us.</seg>
<seg id=1949> I also agree with the call for KFOR, in order to prevent any further attempt to violence in the Presevo Valley.</seg>
<seg id=1950> I welcome the measures taken now by KFOR to deal with the problem and I continue to call on all parties to moderation.</seg>
<seg id=1951> B5-0916 / 2000 by Mr Barón Crespo and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1952> This clause was agreed at the besieged palace in March 1990 and I know because I had the privilege of being present at the possession of President alwyn, after the referendum which brought an end to General Pinochet ’ s regime.</seg>
<seg id=1953> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak on the joint resolution that obviously we vote.</seg>
<seg id=1954> The international community must exercise its right to democratic scrutiny, not as interference in the internal affairs of an independent country, but as a political procedure, cautious and preventive action.</seg>
<seg id=1955> The situation in the prisons and police stations is totally unacceptable, particularly because of the ill-treatment and torture are widespread.</seg>
<seg id=1956> This would be exactly treatment similar to that which we see in Western Europe and the Minister hikmet Sami al-Turk, faced with these protests, postponed the transfer, so that social and political consensus on the reform of the prisons develops throughout Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1957> There is urgency and that is why we have decided to put this issue on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=1958> It happening in trial on 8 January. He is accused of having attended a meeting of Tunisian opponents in France, which he denies.</seg>
<seg id=1959> When activists and responsible for these associations want to meet the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, their homes are surrounded by police and those who go there are being attacked in the streets by men in civil.</seg>
<seg id=1960> The second problem is basically only one example of the many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id=1961> My group, like this Parliament, is particularly sensitive to the human rights situation in Tunisia and the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id=1962> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us a little measure please.</seg>
<seg id=1963> The negotiations are extremely well spent, I am delighted that we have made great progress in these negotiations which, I hope, will lead to the conclusion which the honourable Member referred.</seg>
<seg id=1964> Several Members have mentioned the situation of the prisoners in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id=1965> B5-0912 / 2000 by Mr Van Hecke on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;</seg>
<seg id=1966> We cannot be, I believe, Mr President, Commissioner, from this attitude.</seg>
<seg id=1967> The military has seized power in this context, which, as always, has only worsened the situation.</seg>
<seg id=1968> This attitude is in continuity of policy of French imperialism.</seg>
<seg id=1969> The Commission is also very concerned about the recent outbreaks of violence.</seg>
<seg id=1970> The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.</seg>
<seg id=1971> Unfair competition can contribute to downgrade the quality of the working environment in the shipbuilding sector, to reduce the technical knowledge and to create a loss of jobs and lead, in the longer term, a monopoly situation, which would be damaging to world trade.</seg>
<seg id=1972> Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg id=1973> That is why I thank all my colleagues for the contribution they have made, particularly at the stage of amendments, and that the department of the Commission whose help enabled to finalise this resolution.</seg>
<seg id=1974> The adoption of the social agenda by the Nice European Council strongly satisfies us and we hope that the Member States will take this opportunity to promote the development and the coordination of social security systems and care for the elderly and promote other measures that will ensure the reintegration into working life, such as lifelong learning for life.</seg>
<seg id=1975> The promotion of lifelong learning for life - an issue which has already been addressed by another speaker - is an issue that I also support.</seg>
<seg id=1976> Of course, people over 60 or 70 years can still make many useful things, but it is not right to tie their labour income they provide.</seg>
<seg id=1977> In its monthly bulletin of July 2000, the European Central Bank has launched several urgent warnings about this.</seg>
<seg id=1978> For my part, I believe that the Member States are better able to resolve this problem through their legislative instruments.</seg>
<seg id=1979> With its proposals for an active life in old age, society gaining a whole generation.</seg>
<seg id=1980> The promises on pensions must be held, pensions, though, must be guaranteed by the funds in these countries without payment at the expense of the common monetary policy of the EU.</seg>
<seg id=1981> We have experienced a most important social revolutions 100 to over the past 150 years, when our life expectancy has doubled.</seg>
<seg id=1982> It only makes sense mathematically Lengthening life that the medical progress.</seg>
<seg id=1983> They have done subsidizing - all of society has therefore taken part - older employees have left their jobs but no young worker has been committed and many jobs have been lost.</seg>
<seg id=1984> Family policy and fiscal should instead ensure that women and men who have family obligations to decide freely to have a professional activity or not.</seg>
<seg id=1985> My brother and I have joined there.</seg>
<seg id=1986> The next steps in the field of public health apply rather on questions of health and care for the elderly and the promotion of a healthy old age.</seg>
<seg id=1987> Mr President, I have accepted the amendment tabled by Mr Pronk, both the 2 that 3, which requests that the text should be changed and insists on the concept of demographic development, rather than ageing of the population.</seg>
<seg id=1988> It does not duplicate the operations of promotional advertising or operators or with those of the public authorities.</seg>
<seg id=1989> Mr President, the Committee on Budgets was of the opinion that it is, in principle, in favour of the Commission proposal.</seg>
<seg id=1990> That is why it is very important to achieve a balance which can be achieved through measures to promote sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id=1991> I think that as regards the marketing and sale, learning as a framework for life should be placed at the centre of education programmes precisely because the new technologies, research of outlets offer opportunities to a completely new modern logistics.</seg>
<seg id=1992> Firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Dary for his excellent report.</seg>
<seg id=1993> The next point concerns the discussions in the export and intervention.</seg>
<seg id=1994> There must be no special premiums and advertising for products which are not requested.</seg>
<seg id=1995> Everyone has enough to eat, and therefore if we are promoting a product that militera clearly against the use of another product.</seg>
<seg id=1996> Amendments Nos 18 and 24, first part, by which time during which the themes and products to be proposed will be assessed, are reduced to two to three years in order to improve the effectiveness of the instrument of promotion.</seg>
<seg id=1997> In the Greek version, Mrs Haug juta is presented as rapporteur, implying a male and female ferler Mr marcuse as rapporteur, implying a woman.</seg>
<seg id=1998> It is a good example of how small changes in practice can have significant effects.</seg>
<seg id=1999> It is provisionally the last Friday in Strasbourg, in other words, Strasbourg loses 12 days of presence of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id=2000> Furthermore, I would like to wish all of you, and in particular the few who have attended, this Friday, at this final part-session of the year 2000 in Strasbourg, holidays and a new century which is good, but above all wise.</seg>
