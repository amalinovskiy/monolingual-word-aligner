<seg>The divided racial house of Europe</seg>
<seg>The extreme European line is characterized by its racism and its use of the question of immigration as a political divergence.</seg>
<seg>Northern Lega in Italy, Vlaams Blok in the Netherlands, the partisans of the National front of Le Pen in France, constitute all of the examples of parties or movements formed on the topic running of the aversion towards the immigrants and the promotion of simplistic policies to control them.</seg>
<seg>Whereas individuals like Jorg Haidar and Jean-Marie Le Pen can go and (never rather early) come, the racial question will never disappear from the European policy in a near future.</seg>
<seg>A growing old population and increasingly open borders imply an increasing racial fragmentation in the European countries.</seg>
<seg>The dominant parties of the centre left and the centre right faced this prospect by applying the ostrich policy, hoping against any waiting that the problem disappears.</seg>
<seg>It will not be the case, as the racial history of America shows it clearly.</seg>
<seg>The racial relations in the United States monopolized decades since - and always monopolize - the front of the political scene, so much so that racial cleavages occupy a place as important as the incomes, if not more, as determining factors of the preferences and the political attitudes.</seg>
<seg>The first stage to tackle the question of the racial policy consists in including/understanding the origin and the consequences of racial animosity, even if that implies the discovery of truths unpleasant to hear.</seg>
<seg>Such is precisely the objectives mainly by research teams in economic scenes, sociology, psychology and political sciences in the United States.</seg>
<seg>This research shows that the representatives of various races have much less confidence the ones with the others; the White are less inclined to support the expenditure of social security which, according to them, supports the minorities; more fragmented communities racialement have of less effective governments, a corruption and a more important trading of favours, higher rates of crime and less productive public goods per imposed dollar.</seg>
<seg>That does not mean that it is necessary to eliminate heterogeneity and to create communities racialement homogeneous, but it is necessary to admit the reality of these problems in order to start to work out solids public policies relating to the racial relations.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the Americans dispute the methods to be used.</seg>
<seg>Some decide in favour of affirmative action plans which offer to the minorities preferences in the attribution of an employment, the admission at the university and the contracts public.</seg>
<seg>These policies are regarded as a means of offering repairs for the injustices of passed and, more important, of creating models of role and of overcoming remaining and perhaps involuntary discrimination.</seg>
<seg>Others protest against an affirmative action and support that a policy who is not worried a race, associated with the policies with the open market and family values pro, is enough to create jobs for the minorities and to help not to separate the black families.</seg>
<seg>This last point is crucial in any policy because one of the most important causes of poverty in the United States is the diffusion of unmarried parents (include/understand unmarried mother) in the black community.</seg>
<seg>Whatever the good answer, the question is that the determination of the measures to be taken concerning the race represents a problem dominating in the American policy.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the minorities progressed towards more integration and economic success.</seg>
<seg>In the years 1950, the Blacks could not sit down in front of the buses, today two of the main actors of the American foreign policy are blacks.</seg>
<seg>One cannot deny that the American politicians of right-hand side continue to deploy the “racial chart” like a tactical tool.</seg>
<seg>Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, the former assistant of Nixon and Reagan who stood as a independent presidential candidate at the time of the last election.</seg>
<seg>It recently published a book with success entitled “The Death off the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrating Invasion Imperil Our Country and Civilization”.</seg>
<seg>But for each book like this one, there are ten different which comprises a serious analysis of the racial question in America.</seg>
<seg>The analysis and the political debates on the racial relations have a considerable delay in Europe.</seg>
<seg>At most, the question is examined closely in terms of quotas of immigration and restrictions of borders, not in terms of opportunities and social problems created by increasingly mixed Europe racialement.</seg>
<seg>Of course, a clear immigration policy is necessary in order to avoid the accumulation of immigrants in illegal situation.</seg>
<seg>But one should not remain about it there: controls of borders in Mexico do not mean the end of the American policy on the interior problems of race!</seg>
<seg>Europe is rich and its population ages quickly: the Europeans, reinforced by generous programs of social security, are not prepared any more to accept “dirty jobs” in, say, the agriculture and the sector of leather.</seg>
<seg>This attitude makes inevitable the increase in immigration.</seg>
<seg>Europeans are however prompt to criticize the United States for the failures of their policy towards the minorities and for any demonstration of racism on other side of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg>The reading of the European press often reveals a superiority complex towards the United States on the racial questions: they (Americans) have problems with racism; we are immunized against him, except for the skinheads insane néo-Nazis and their similar.</seg>
<seg>What occurred during the last weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, shows that the racial problem in Europe is deeper and, as in the United States, has due the sad truth which the relations racial are intrinsically difficult and which confidence and a co-operative behavior does not travel of course the racial lines.</seg>
<seg>If the dominant parties of Europe do not begin more seriously to include/understand the racial tensions which exist in their country and to place the “race” in the center of their priorities, the individuals such as Le Pen will always try to try to fill the vacuum with their message of hatred.</seg>
<seg>To fight the French exception</seg>
<seg>The attention of Europe east very turned today and with by the way towards widening and the constitution being negotiated enters the Member States.</seg>
<seg>However, the result of several Gallic rows with the European commission will not be less important to determine the fate of new widened Europe.</seg>
<seg>France unilaterally chose to be unaware of the stability pact and of growth while letting run its public deficit beyond the limit of the 3% of the GDP.</seg>
<seg>The French like to speak about the rational rigour of their thought, but where the budgets are concerned, Descartes is not any more setting and confusion makes its entry.</seg>
<seg>France belonged to principal critics of Ireland when, in 2000, the Irish government did not reduce its budgetary surplus, which was then to 4%, that from simple a 0.5%.</seg>
<seg>Other countries did not respect the stability pact, but France is the first country to do it with a small smile satisfies openly scorning.</seg>
<seg>Nothing of that should surprise.</seg>
<seg>France does nothing but apply to the European regulations its practice anchored very well to regard its own culture as an exception.</seg>
<seg>Thus, France systematically opposes its veto to any reform of the common agricultural policy of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>As everyone knows it, the CAP is a quite pretty gift offered to the European farm rich person (particularly French farmers) who do not deserve it at all, at the expense of the farmers in difficulty of the countries in the process of development and the European consumers.</seg>
<seg>France also tries to return from there to the old policies of reinflation of the private companies in deficit and about to crumble with great public money reinforcement.</seg>
<seg>The European Commissioner charged with competition, Mario Monti, cannot lose this battle: he needs the support of those which have faith in the markets and the equal treatment for all.</seg>
<seg>The history is simple.</seg>
<seg>The French government envisages to reinflate Alstom, a company which developed products of high technology, of which the TGV, the train at French high speed, but which recently is in bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg>The French government proclaims that it will never give up its rescue plan for Alstom, a plan which has all the motivations usual interventionists: employment maintenance, protection of the investors, etc</seg>
<seg>Moreover, insofar as Alstom is a company of high technology, the French government plays the development and research card, alleging that the investment in R & D is beneficial with the growth.</seg>
<seg>Sauver Alstom by nationalizing the company is obviously an error.</seg>
<seg>The company is formed various units, unquestionable advantageous, others in bankruptcy: it is obvious that it should be dismantled.</seg>
<seg>The advantageous units, such as that of the TGV, will find easily purchasing; the overdrawn units must be closed.</seg>
<seg>The money of the French taxpayers will be spent better in the temporary costs of reconversion of paid rather than to maintain in life a company which is not advantageous.</seg>
<seg>It is important that the European commission does not allow France to cut laws to measure for itself in the policies on competition, as it seems to be doing it with the budget deficits.</seg>
<seg>The Commission must just like condemn the public finance of private companies in France it condemns the subsidies in any other European State member.</seg>
<seg>The Commission already obtained a certain success on this side, in particular by forcing Germany to cancel the governmental guarantees of the public banks.</seg>
<seg>Alstom in particular and France in general should not make exception and must answer the same standards.</seg>
<seg>If the Commission does not react, the European Union will resemble even more at one playground for the French civils servant.</seg>
<seg>France already took the head of the foreign politics of the European Union with its Foreign Minister, Dominique de Villepin, who acts and resembles more and more a Foreign Minister of Europe.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, France is unaware of essential regulations of common economic policy and governmental assistance for the private companies.</seg>
<seg>Will the European commission lose the little of credibility which remains to him to end up resembling a Parisian district of less importance?</seg>
<seg>To lose on the question of Alstom would have serious effects in Europe and not only for the policies on competition.</seg>
<seg>The war for oil</seg>
<seg>Since decades, so much the Republicans whom the Democrats continue the same objectives in the oil field: to maintain as long as to make may be the stability of the course of oil, to carefully reduce the domestic consumption, to decrease the dependence related to the imports and to diversify the foreign sources of supply.</seg>
<seg>In spite of appearances, these objectives are always the same ones today, under the Bush administration.</seg>
<seg>Many observers believe that with the invasion of Iraq, Bush chose another way.</seg>
<seg>A big raise of the Iraqi production probably increases the oil dependence of the USA.</seg>
<seg>The price of the barrel of petrol will undoubtedly drop with the appearance of a new source of supply, from where an increased dependence of the USA, in particular with respect to the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>It is paradoxical to note that the USA exerted more control on Iraqi oil within the framework of the program “Food against oil” of UNO before the war (it was then UNO and not Saddam Hussein which fixed the level of Iraqi exports) which they will not be able to make it in the context of a future democratic Iraqi state.</seg>
<seg>If the Bush administration sought stable, sure, diversified and cheap tanker sources of supply, it was enough for him to raise the embargo imposed on Libya, in Iran, in Iraq and Sudan and to let run oil.</seg>
<seg>But the interest of America for Iraqi oil is not dictated by the economy or the energy policy.</seg>
<seg>The Bush administration recognized that Iraqi oil is before a whole geopolitical asset.</seg>
<seg>Who controls Iraqi oil, controls Iraq.</seg>
<seg>Saddam owed her capacity with the fact that it controlled the second oil world reserve.</seg>
<seg>It knew perfectly what it owed with the black gold.</seg>
<seg>Confronted with the possibility of the invasion and the defeat, he threatened to put fire at the Iraqi oil fields.</seg>
<seg>The confusion and the plundering of Iraqi oil installations and the pipelines show that practically everyone understood that to control oil, it is to control the country.</seg>
<seg>During the preparation of the invasion by the USA, the security of the oil fields was a priority.</seg>
<seg>The goal was not an increase in the provisioning or a fall of the prices on the US market, but the inversion of Saddam and its replacement by a new government.</seg>
<seg>The future of Iraq is related to the oil production of the country.</seg>
<seg>But being given the whims of the oil market, especially in such an unstable situation, one does not see how the Bush administration will manage to achieve her goals in the years which come.</seg>
<seg>The problem is simple.</seg>
<seg>The USA must use the incomes of oil to reduce the financial expenses of the Iraqi regime change which rests on the American taxpayers.</seg>
<seg>In the long run, any plan of rebuilding depends on the capacity of Iraq to export large volumes of oil.</seg>
<seg>If Iraq does not produce oil, president Bush cannot hold the promises which it made to the Iraqi people, to the American people and at the international community.</seg>
<seg>Before the invasion, Iraq had a production capacity of three million barrels of petrol per day.</seg>
<seg>But it will not be able to return on this level of production in time assigned to establish an Iraqi government.</seg>
<seg>An increase in the production requires the development of oil installations, which requires large investments, a government in place and political stability.</seg>
<seg>Nobody, not even the Bush administration, expects that these conditions are met soon.</seg>
<seg>Political stability is the condition first to increase production capacity.</seg>
<seg>The experiment of Iran, of Kuwait, of Russia and even of Iraq, shows that it takes approximately three years of political stability before production capacity cannot increase significantly and durable.</seg>
<seg>It will take several years for Iraq to work out a new Constitution, to establish a democratic government, to negotiate the distribution of the oil incomes between the various areas, to regulate the investments and to make the economy gravitational to the foreign investors.</seg>
<seg>It will take him also time to negotiate with the multinational oil companies and the adjoining countries the realization of the feasibility studies and the technical studies necessary, as well as the rebuilding, the repairing and the exploration of its oil fields.</seg>
<seg>Also, even a 3 years period appears optimistic, because that supposes that during this time the occupation ceases, the Iraqis set up their own government and that it is put an end to political instability.</seg>
<seg>However reality is likely to be very different.</seg>
<seg>Important tensions can remain during years.</seg>
<seg>And it would not be astonishing that the production of Iraqi oil stops brutally, even with a democratic government.</seg>
<seg>The History shows that the strikes and the social disturbances which can disorganize the oil production occur more easily in a democratic context than under a dictatorship.</seg>
<seg>If Iraq is unable to increase its oil production in the few years which come, it will be a spine in the foot, both for the foreign politics the energy policy of the USA.</seg>
<seg>How the latter be able will to finance the rebuilding of Iraq in the long run?</seg>
<seg>Who will pay for the maintenance of a fragile democracy in Iraq?</seg>
<seg>Will the USA be able to maintain their occupation without ensuring the food of the Iraqi people, the medical care and the other basic services?</seg>
<seg>They are difficult questions there, and one cannot answer it before a democratic regime controls and does not guarantee the Iraqi oil production.</seg>
<seg>To let murderers defend the human rights</seg>
<seg>If it were not also sad, it would be the macabre joke of the millenium: Libya was elected to chair the Commission of the United Nations on the Human rights!</seg>
<seg>When Caligula named its horse with the Senate, the horse, at least, did not have blood on its shoes.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the procedure was perfectly legal: the presidency changes each year of an area of the world to another.</seg>
<seg>This year, it was with the turn of Africa to name the president and it named Libya.</seg>
<seg>Only the United States and Canada voted against.</seg>
<seg>With their infinite shame, the European countries abstained from.</seg>
<seg>This in known as length on the moral bankruptcy of the United Nations which this decision comes at one so delicate time for this organization.</seg>
<seg>President Bush defied the United Nations to express their serious as for their own obligatory decisions concerning Iraq: in the contrary case, they can know the same ignominieux destiny as the Company of the Nations, which appeared impotent in the years 1930 when it was confronted with the aggressive policies of the Nazi Germany and fascistic Italy.</seg>
<seg>The election of Libya to chair an organization of the United Nations charged to make respect the human rights at present hardly contributes to support the legitimacy or the moral authority of the world organization.</seg>
<seg>Remember that Libya is a totalitarian tyranny; its leader, Muammar Ghaddafi, combine a behavior sometimes changing with policies extremists by supporting the dictators of the whole world.</seg>
<seg>It directs one of the most tyrannical modes of the world, in which does not exist any show of election and where the contrary opinions are repressed instantaneously.</seg>
<seg>Under its reign, Libya supported the terrorist organizations of the whole world, from WILL GO until the many Palestinian extremists groups.</seg>
<seg>It always incurs the sanctions of the United Nations for the part which it played in the attack against a flight Pan Am above Lockerbie, in Scotland, ten years ago.</seg>
<seg>During the last decade, the position of the United Nations as a symbol of the ideals of a peaceful world community was regularly sapped.</seg>
<seg>They appeared entirely unable to stop the war in Balkans; and in at least a case, Srebrenica, Dutch forces of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace remained there and attended the worst massacre of Europe of post-war period while the Serb Bosnians massacred approximately 6.000 Moslems without defense.</seg>
<seg>A Dutch board of inquiry admitted later that the Dutch battalion of the United Nations was, in fact, accessory to this war crime.</seg>
<seg>In Rwanda, when the genocide started, the representative of the United Nations in charge of the operations of maintenance of peace ordered the evacuation of the forces of the United Nations of the country, leaving the free field to the bloodiest genocide since the Second world war.</seg>
<seg>The name of this representative of the United Nations is Kofi Annan.</seg>
<seg>It is a depressing and pitiful past which the United Nations try, probably in vain, to repurchase while appearing, in the Iraqi crisis, like the international legitimacy and voice of reason.</seg>
<seg>But at one time when the inspections of the United Nations in Iraq resemble the sending of the Salvation Army to remove a band of gangsters, it may be that the election of Libya to the head of the Commission of the Human rights remains a historical date, that of the final failure of an organization whose creation had raised an immense hope.</seg>
<seg>The organizations generally do not die, and undoubtedly, there is too much reason of State not to guarantee that the United Nations will continue to make obstacle.</seg>
<seg>But they will be only one simple shade of what they would owe, and could, being.</seg>
<seg>The United Nations of today give to hypocrisy a bad reputation.</seg>
<seg>The Partisans of the authority are there</seg>
<seg>Last Thursday, the judges of the central court of Djakarta in Indonesia condemned me to one year of prison.</seg>
<seg>I am guilty, in my capacity as editor association of Tempo Weekly Newsmagazine, according to the court, of slandering towards Tomy Winata, a tycoon of the businesses, to have implied his possible implication in a fire at the market of the textiles of Southeast Asia of Djakarta and to have fomented riots by diffusing lies.</seg>
<seg>Does my case and other similar cases once more predict the end of a short democratic experiment in Indonesia?</seg>
<seg>“The riot” that I fomented is produced in March, last year, when nearly 200 hooligans claiming itself of Winata the offices of Tempo attacked, threatening to set fire to the building, badgering the personnel and wounding a journalist.</seg>
<seg>To try to solve the peaceful situation of manner, I was persuaded to go to negotiate at the central office of police force of Djakarta and there discovered, horrified, that the leaders this clicks it had seized the power at the police station.</seg>
<seg>I was struck punches and of foot while the police force let make.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately, from many journalists came to our help with tape recorders and cameras to record these events.</seg>
<seg>The diffusion of these images started public indignation and forced the Parliament to open a public survey.</seg>
<seg>The persons in charge of the national police force and the police force of Djakarta were called and, because of strong pressure of the public opinion, the leaders of this clicks were accused.</seg>
<seg>However, Winata itself escaped the investigation from police force by declaring simply publicly that its supporters acted without informing some and without its agreement.</seg>
<seg>It carried felt sorry for itself thereafter, against Ahmad Taufik, the author of the article, Teuku Iskandar Ali, the editor, and myself.</seg>
<seg>The audiences of the lawsuit which lasted one year were marked by a series of suspect developments all favorable to Winata.</seg>
<seg>First of all, the file assembled by the police force and the prosecutor contained documents so obviously falsified that the police force accused two officers.</seg>
<seg>But the court refused our application of suspension of the audiences until the clarification of the legality of the file of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg>The file against the implied officers seems not to carry out nowhere.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, one of them was promoted with the head of the new unit anti-terrorist of Djakarta which has just been created (and is financed by the United States).</seg>
<seg>The other has, says one, returned at the police academy to receive a specialized training.</seg>
<seg>Then, after six months of audiences, the principal judge of the panel of the three judges was suddenly promoted to take the head of a municipal court at one Djakarta time.</seg>
<seg>One of my lawyers noticed that in 35 years of practice to the court, he had never seen a judge principal being replaced in the course of business.</seg>
<seg>In fact, in spite of his promotion, the judge continued to chair another business in the same building.</seg>
<seg>A judge who in the past had ruled against Tempo at the time of the suit at law brought by Winata replaced it.</seg>
<seg>Finally, Winata, at the time of its testimony, presented a false witness while denying to be interviewed by Tempo.</seg>
<seg>A recording of the phone conversation was diffused at the time of the audiences, the journalist having carried out maintenance and the two writers who assisted to with it testified under oath, the telco produced the official documents attesting of this phone call like proof of its existence and of the experts attested that the voice of the recording was well that of Tomy Winata.</seg>
<seg>However, the judges rejected the request of Tempo asking for the arrest of Winata so that he is judged for false witness and advised us to carry felt sorry for near the police force, thing which we made.</seg>
<seg>The judges then refused our application of adjournment of the decision making of the court until the business of false witness of Misters Winata is judged.</seg>
<seg>Considering all these defects of form, my judgment and my custodial sentence are hardly surprising.</seg>
<seg>But I keep good hope in the final analysis to gain when the call of Tempo is carried in front of higher authorities.</seg>
<seg>The higher courts indonésiens are more respectful ethics and the director of the supreme court is a burning defender of the democracy and freedom of expression. The business of Tempo could become well a decisive stage for our democracy, just like the famous decision of the supreme court of the United States in the business of NewYork Times against Sullivan.</seg>
<seg>While having raised the tolerance level in the charges against slandering, this decision made it possible the American press to claim accounts with the persons in charge of the public affairs.</seg>
<seg>No country knows better than Indonesia that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are the tested indicators of the democratic development and that the penalization of the journalists is one of the primary symptoms of authoritarianism.</seg>
<seg>Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the years 1950, before musellement of the press by President Sukarno, helped of the military junta, in 1956.</seg>
<seg>Very critical having been choked, the consolidation of the capacity without against being able was easy and, in July 1959, Sukarno could issue the beginning of the “enlightened Democracy”.</seg>
<seg>During the few first years which followed the fall of Sukarno in 1966, all the advantages of a true democracy, including freedom of the press, were restored (except for the Communists).</seg>
<seg>However, the mode of President Suharto also launched out in musellement of the press to the beginning of the year 1970, by suspending various newspapers and by imprisoning many journalists.</seg>
<seg>The muzzled press, other political rights were quickly ridiculed and the democracy indonésienne disappeared once more.</seg>
<seg>Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia became the third larger country democratic in the world and the first democratic Muslim community of the history.</seg>
<seg>Free elections, right and peaceful were held by twice for the election of the Parliament and the direct election of the President, including the last presidential ballot, proving the possible coexistence between Islam and the democracy.</seg>
<seg>The enemies of the democracy never rest however.</seg>
<seg>The Islamic groups extremists launched out in bomb attacks without distinction, while the groups with the marked authoritative tendencies made a projection in the circles close to President Megawati.</seg>
<seg>But Mrs Megawati has just lost the recent Presidential elections.</seg>
<seg>Will Susilo, the new elected President, continue to persecute the journalists?</seg>
<seg>My judgment, and the lawsuits and judgments of other journalists, mark will the beginning of the end of the third democracy indonésienne gained so hard?</seg>
<seg>The answer is in the support that the democratic activists indonésiens will be able to generate nationally and internationally.</seg>
<seg>To lose Indonesia, potential torch of the hope of all the democratic activists within the world Muslim community, would be a terrible defeat.</seg>
<seg>The morals of the capital punishment</seg>
<seg>One often reproaches the United States their refusal to abolish the capital punishment.</seg>
<seg>Many are those to claim today that the abolition of the capital punishment is a requirement to establish a civilized system of criminal law.</seg>
<seg>The Nobel Prize Gary Becker is not of this opinion.</seg>
<seg>The European governments are resolutely opposed to the capital punishment -- the European Union prohibits it completely, and certain Europeans consider that its use in the United States concerns cruelty.</seg>
<seg>In fact, many European intellectuals estimate that the capital punishment, and any sorrow in general, does not dissuade the criminals.</seg>
<seg>But whereas Europeans, with rates of criminality quite lower than those of the United States at the time of the last half-century, could for a long time allow a certain “softness” with regard to the majority of the crimes, he saw their rate criminality to increase in a brutal way during the twenty last years.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, the American rates fell partly thanks to the increased use of the punishments.</seg>
<seg>The capital punishment in fact part.</seg>
<seg>I am for the execution of certain marked people of murder because, and for this reason only, I believe that prevents other murders.</seg>
<seg>If I were not convinced by it, I would be opposed to the capital punishment, because revenge and other possible motivations should not be used as base with a public policy.</seg>
<seg>Serious empirical research on the capital punishment in the United States started with a study of Isaac Ehrlich, published in 1975 in American Economic Review.</seg>
<seg>Certain studies which followed sometimes discovered a capacity of dissuasion much weaker, others an effect much more extremely.</seg>
<seg>However, information available is limited enough, it is thus appropriate not to base its conclusions solely on the econometric evidence.</seg>
<seg>Obviously, the public policy as regards punishment cannot hope for perfect evidence.</seg>
<seg>But even with the limited quantitative evidence which one lays out, the good reasons to accept the dissuasive capacity of the capital punishment are sufficient.</seg>
<seg>The majority of people, and the murderers in particular, are afraid of death, especially when it follows quickly and quasi unrelentingly the perpetration of a murder.</seg>
<seg>Like says it David Hume in connection with the suicide, “no man forever rejected the life as long as it was worth the sorrow to be lived.</seg>
<seg>Such is our natural horror of died… “In the same way, Schopenhauer thought that “when the horrors of the life reach the point where they exceed the horrors of death, a man puts a term at his life.</seg>
<seg>But terrors of death oppose a considerable resistance… “</seg>
<seg>The opponents with the capital punishment often proclaim that the State does not have the right, morally, to take the life of whoever, would be this that of the most condemnable murderer.</seg>
<seg>However it is a completely erroneous conclusion for which thinks that the capital punishment is dissuasive.</seg>
<seg>To see why, suppose that for each murderer carried out, (to the place, let us say, to be condemned to the life imprisonment) the number of murders is tiny room of three, which is a figure quite lower than that of Ehrlich and than other estimates of the effect of dissuasion.</seg>
<seg>That implies that for each murderer not yet carried out, three innocent victims will perish.</seg>
<seg>In fact, the government “would take” many lives indirectly if it did not have recourse to the capital punishment.</seg>
<seg>To save three innocent lives for each person carried out seems a very gravitational market, and even two lives saved by execution appears a ratio cost/persuasive benefit in favour of the capital punishment.</seg>
<seg>It should be been appropriate however that the thesis in favour of the capital punishment becomes less distinct when the number of lives saved with each execution falls.</seg>
<seg>But even if only one life were saved with each execution, the market can still be desirable if the saved life is much better than the removed life, which is generally the case.</seg>
<seg>Many protests with the idea to compare qualities of the saved life and that which is removed.</seg>
<seg>However I do not see how to avoid such a comparison.</seg>
<seg>Take the case of a criminal of career stealing and killing a victim which carried out a correct life and leaves several children and a partner behind it.</seg>
<seg>Suppose that it is possible to save the life of an innocent victim by carrying out a criminal of this kind.</seg>
<seg>It appears obvious to me that to save the life of such a victim must weigh heavier than to take the life of the criminal.</seg>
<seg>Obviously, all the cases are not also clear, but a comparison of qualities of the individual lives must belong to any reasonable industrial relations policy.</seg>
<seg>Here also why the capital punishment should be used only for the murders and not for the less serious crimes.</seg>
<seg>When it is a question of choosing between taking lives and, for example, to reduce the flights of private property, the thesis of the more lenient punishment is much more powerful.</seg>
<seg>Although serious aggressions, in particular certain rapes terrible, approach sometimes the murders in their gravity, and could possibly call the capital punishment, I am not for his use in this kind of case.</seg>
<seg>One of the main arguments to hold the capital punishment with the murders is “marginal dissuasion.”</seg>
<seg>If the aggressions were punished by the capital punishment, that would push the attackers to kill their victims not to be discovered (what is an imperative reason so that the severity of the punishments is proportional to the gravity of the crimes).</seg>
<seg>One of the complications could be however that a murderer would fight with more pugnacity to avoid being captured, which could cause more deaths.</seg>
<seg>But, although marginal dissuasion is important, I believe that the resistance of the murderers to their capture, sometimes at the expense of their own life, constitutes really an indirect evidence that the criminals fear the capital punishment.</seg>
<seg>Naturally, the risk to carry out the innocent ones worries me.</seg>
<seg>My support for the capital punishment would weaken much if the rate of execution of innocent people were as important as much claim it.</seg>
<seg>However, I believe that the appeals in the United States offer an enormous protection, not so much against the unjust judgments than against the unjust executions, with the result that there is only very little, even at all, of case of people carried out of which it is proven that they were innocent.</seg>
<seg>And this situation was immensely consolidated by the development of the identification by the DNA.</seg>
<seg>I affirm again that the debate around the capital punishment is a debate on the capacity of dissuasion (which can be seen decreased by too long calls).</seg>
<seg>I can understand that some remain skeptics in front of the existing evidence, although I think that they are wrong in connection with that like on the question of the good sense of the problem.</seg>
<seg>It is very perturbing to take the life of somebody, even that of a murderer, but sometimes of the extremely unpleasant acts are necessary to prevent still worse behaviors causing the death of innocent victims.</seg>
<seg>People against Putin</seg>
<seg>I contributed to the choice of Vladimir Poutine to succeed the first chair democratically elected, Boris Eltsine.</seg>
<seg>Since structures such KGB and the Maffia direct Russia today and handle the legal system, it is allowed that Eltsine wanted to choose itself its successor in order to avoid the continuations.</seg>
<seg>But us, who chose Putin, were charged to find a successor ready to continue the reforms started by Eltsine, and not somebody which would protect them, him and his family.</seg>
<seg>Eltsine was not afraid of nothing and did not think of its own survival, but of the survival of the democratic idea which it had introduced in Russia.</seg>
<seg>This idea is however threatened today by the successor that we chose to him.</seg>
<seg>I do not seek to deny the responsibility for my support for Putin.</seg>
<seg>We were not close friend, but him and me worked together in critical situations, and I never doubted his sincerity.</seg>
<seg>Putin acts according to its convictions.</seg>
<seg>The problem is that its convictions, in particular the belief which Russia can thrive only if it is directed by a single source of being able, are erroneous.</seg>
<seg>And this big mistake is leading Russia to its political ruin.</seg>
<seg>Obviously, no one cannot hold a station with high responsibilities without making mistakes, even fundamental errors, and it is especially true when times are disturbed.</seg>
<seg>Eltsine did not make exception to the rule, but he recognized his errors.</seg>
<seg>When it withdrew on December 31, 1999, it asked for forgiveness of have started the war as Chetchnia.</seg>
<seg>Putin, on the other hand, seems unable to recognize and admit its errors, and persists in a policy a long time after its failure becomes obvious with the eyes of the whole world.</seg>
<seg>One of the errors of Eltsine was its failure to place the priorities morals at the head of its reform program.</seg>
<seg>Russia would have owed repentance of the Stalinism and the system of the goulags.</seg>
<seg>The whole nation, without exception, would have owed repentance, like the Germans did it since 1945.</seg>
<seg>This failure counts, because it allowed that the unconditional faith of Putin in the central authority leads to a new capture of the State by the security services.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, one of the direct consequences of the national repentance should have been the round of applause of the Communist party and the disqualification of any political station of those which worked for the KGB.</seg>
<seg>Even if such political sorting are not simple in companies post-Communists, where victims and collaborators were so numerous, and the border between two sometimes the so fuzzy one, a viable solution could have been found, as as a Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg>The choice nothing to make left the Russian structures of safety unscathed and able to make their return on the political scene, it to what they arrived today.</seg>
<seg>The political resurrection of the structures of the KGB under Putin, and their efforts to make conceal dissidences, again transformed Russia into a country of defectors.</seg>
<seg>It is impossible to make conceal the independent politicians and media without choking the independent sources financial, which explains why the Kremlin of Putin concentrated its attacks on so-called “the oligarchs.”</seg>
<seg>The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his lawsuit were orchestrated for this precise reason.</seg>
<seg>By removing the independent financial sources, the security services which dominate the Kremlin hoped to destroy the independent political life in Russia.</seg>
<seg>Without independent bases of thought, it is a climate of fear which settles.</seg>
<seg>But the fear is not only degrading, it does not make it possible to control well.</seg>
<seg>Eltsine had intuitively understood that fear and centralized and downward decision making could not constitute the good manners to direct a modern country, and he had thus insisted to reform the relations between the citizens and the State.</seg>
<seg>Putin still does not understand that a centralized political system is as unable to include/understand and correct the errors today as it was it at the Soviet era.</seg>
<seg>For lack of a solid education, Putin is, completely sincerely, carrying out Russia towards same disintegration as that which accompanied the collapse by the Soviet State.</seg>
<seg>The people start to realize it.</seg>
<seg>It notes that the desire of Putin to create a solid and effective modern State cannot be carried out, because a modern State is not controlled top, but by informed citizens who force their leaders to recognize and to correct their errors.</seg>
<seg>Putin, also, seems to him to suspect the impotence of its mode.</seg>
<seg>It is one of the reasons which made Russia so aggressive with its neighbors, the Ukraine and Georgia, and which push it to maintain a military presence in places like Transdniestrie, the area secessionist of Moldavie.</seg>
<seg>While being essential in the areas close to Russia, the Kremlin thinks that it can convince the Russians of his omnipotence.</seg>
<seg>Since the debates in Russia are châtrés and that the Kremlin is able to handle the elections, a regime change is the only solution which it remains to preserve there the idea of democracy.</seg>
<seg>It is vain to cling to illusions.</seg>
<seg>Those which are opposed to Putin must decide on what they want and to announce that if the mode fails to make respect the constitution, they have the right to force it there by all the means.</seg>
<seg>Today, the question of the capacity in Russia cannot decide any more with the ballot boxes.</seg>
<seg>As in Ukraine, in Lebanon and Kirghizstan, it will decide in the street.</seg>
<seg>Impose and spend (PLEASE)</seg>
<seg>An excessive taxation can blunt the encouragements and block the growth.</seg>
<seg>But an insufficient taxation can also produce the same effects.</seg>
<seg>The governments having a thin revenue from taxes cannot provide the essential public goods.</seg>
<seg>Worse still, a weak revenue from taxes in the poor countries often results from defects inherent in the systems of tax collection (rather than of low tax rates) which also encourage to it not productivity.</seg>
<seg>India illustrates the importance of a tax system designed good.</seg>
<seg>In Bangalore, the companies of high technology built campuses of international class abounding with impeccable lawns and high-speed communication networks of data.</seg>
<seg>Out of these campuses, however, extend from the opened sewers, the not taken refuse and the roads in a state of advanced decay.</seg>
<seg>While the technological companies transmit instantaneously terabytes of data to remote continents, local transport advances with an almost medieval pace.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, the companies with Bangalore exploit their own services of bus, sub-contract with suppliers deprived to have drinking water, and install generators to be protected from the power cuts.</seg>
<seg>The State cannot mitigate this disaster because it is in bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg>The debt of the government of India exceeds 70% of the GNP so that more half of its revenues from taxes are devoted to refunding of the interests.</seg>
<seg>But the debt is not the fact of excessive expenditure in the past.</seg>
<seg>The expenditure of the government of India accounts for approximately 15% of the GNP, against an average from approximately 40% of the GNP of OECD.</seg>
<seg>The financial problems of India rather have due a tax system conceived evil and badly managed.</seg>
<seg>The rates and the rules for the income taxes of the private individuals and the companies seem reasonable within sight of the international standards.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, the government of India perceives income taxes accounting for only approximately 3,7% of the GNP, that is to say approximately half of those of Asian South Korea and other tigers.</seg>
<seg>Agriculture in India represents approximately a quarter of the GNP, but even the rich person farmers do not pay taxes.</seg>
<seg>The export businesses in the software industry and other industries are given a temporary tax exemption on their benefit, although their employees pour income taxes their personal.</seg>
<seg>In spite of reasonable rates, the tax evasion is currency.</seg>
<seg>The fraud is explained by the fact why the government did not invest in the personnel or the systems to discover the refractory taxpayers, who seldom go in prison and who can often leave themselves business by pouring bribes when they are made take.</seg>
<seg>More subtly still, the loophole of the “direct” taxes on the incomes and the benefit reflect the disorder inherent in the system of the “indirect” taxes taken on the production and consumption.</seg>
<seg>The excise duties represent more than 60% of the indirect taxes of India, which represent in their turn the same proportion of its total revenues from taxes.</seg>
<seg>The excise duty basic was fixed at 16% of the value of the production of a company.</seg>
<seg>Then various reductions, exemptions and surtaxes follow.</seg>
<seg>For example, a “rate of right to preferential conditions” of 8% is taken on categories like the food products, the matches, wire of cotton and the computers.</seg>
<seg>A “excise duty special” additional of 8% is taken on products which include/understand polyester filaments, cars, air-conditioners and tires.</seg>
<seg>A “excise duty additional” (not to be confused with the “special excise duty”) is taken on “products of special importance”.</seg>
<seg>The exemptions of the excise duties are many and complex, including the companies with total annual incomes lower than 10 million rupees and companies located in certain agitated or postponed zones.</seg>
<seg>In general, the exemptions are divided into 70 main categories, themselves subdivided in 259 entries, 52 conditions and 7 lists, each one containing of many elements.</seg>
<seg>The exemptions encourage with the abuses.</seg>
<seg>For a certain sum, civils servant located at the bottom of the hierarchy, which makes watch of an exemplary discretion in the application of the conditions, can be incited to give favorable interpretations.</seg>
<seg>The products imposed on high rates (for example, polished granite) are sold like products imposed onless rates (for example, like nonpolished granite).</seg>
<seg>The fraud concerning the excise duties is more contagious than the tax evasion on the benefit and the incomes.</seg>
<seg>If a company defrauds the excise duties and that the tax rate is high compared to the profit margins before taxes in industry, its competitors must also defraud simply to be able to survive.</seg>
<seg>While the fraud increases, the governments take additional” or “special” rights “which encourage with a greater fraud.</seg>
<seg>Perceptions of the direct taxes also suffer.</seg>
<seg>The bribe poured with the tax collector of the excise duties for a favorable classification, the difference between the value of the polished and nonpolished granite, and the omission of recording of the true incomes create “black” funds which cannot be declared on forms of income declaration.</seg>
<seg>In addition to weakening the capacity of the State required essential goods public, the systems making it possible to escape the indirect taxes also discourage from the companies adopting more productive technologies, which requires technologies implying a deployment with large scales.</seg>
<seg>But as the indirect taxes can be more easily circumvented by deploying several small units instead of only one great unit, it is impossible to carry out economies of scale.</seg>
<seg>It is important to note that in the software industry, where all the units are exonerated from indirect taxes, the Indian companies operate on an effective scale.</seg>
<seg>Could India imitate the example of China, country in which the rationalization of the indirect taxes in 1994 prepared the ground for a great boom?</seg>
<seg>Or are the governments of the coalition in a vigorous democracy unable of such a reform?</seg>
<seg>The last year, the government carried out by the BJP of India promulgated a legislation authorizing of the considerable reductions of the budget deficit.</seg>
<seg>It then named an work group charged to formulate the changes necessary to bring to the policies public expenditure and to the fiscal policies.</seg>
<seg>Last July, the work group proposed to increase the taxes (rather than to reduce the expenditure) by removing the majority of the exemptions of the indirect taxes, inter alia things.</seg>
<seg>The new government carried out by the Congress of India also seems to support these proposals.</seg>
<seg>If the Congress and the parties of the opposition follow, they will help much to support the economic growth of the country and to dissipate the idea that the democracies cannot take the necessary measures to encourage the development.</seg>
<seg>Which is the problem with Turkey?</seg>
<seg>On December 16, Orhan Pamuk, one of the most famous Turkish authors, will have to face a court of Istanbul. It must answer the charge of “insult with the national identity” to be marked in favour of a discussion open on the genocide by the Turks of 1,5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916.</seg>
<seg>Pamuk incurs three years of prison.</seg>
<seg>The efforts of Turkey to impose fines and custodial sentences on those which overflow of the official framework convince me that I was right to oppose to me to the opening negotiations on the adhesion of this country to the European Union.</seg>
<seg>In December 1999, the European Council granted to Turkey the statute applicant country of the EU, which implied that Turkey would use the Union on a not yet fixed future date.</seg>
<seg>The Council then asked the European commission to decide before October 2004 if Turkey satisfied the political criteria necessary to adhesion, which include/understand the democracy, the rule of law and the respect of the right of the ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg>This decision was one of the last catches by the Commission of Romano Prodi, of which I was member.</seg>
<seg>Among its 30 members, 29 declared that Turkey satisfied adequately with the criteria to be able to continue.</seg>
<seg>I was the only dissident.</seg>
<seg>It is the report/ratio even of the Commission on Turkey, prepared by Günter Verheugen, then in charge of the widening of the EU, who justified my decision.</seg>
<seg>This report/ratio mentioned that in 2003, some 21.870 Turks requested asylum from the EU, among which 2.127 were accepted.</seg>
<seg>In other words, the governments of the EU themselves recognized into 2003 that the Turkish government had persecuted more than 2.000 of its own citizens.</seg>
<seg>In the interval, the Commission published a report of progress on Turkey estimating that the reforms continued, although at slower intervals, under the government with moderately Islamic orientation of the Recep Tayyip Erdogan Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg>This report/ratio gave nevertheless a report on serious doubts: the violations of the human rights, including/understanding the practice of torture, continued; the military influence preserved too much width; freedom of expression was not universally observed; the religious minorities not-Moslem women and cultural were victims of discriminations and violence against the women did not meet a sufficiently strong opposition.</seg>
<seg>The situation did not change much since the discussions on adhesion started in October.</seg>
<seg>Beyond the persecution whose Pamuk is currently the victim, the unacceptable behaviors abound.</seg>
<seg>In March 2005, the police force violently intervened in a demonstration celebrating the international Day of the woman.</seg>
<seg>In May, the greatest teaching trade union was interdict to have supported the education of the 14 million Kurds of Turkey in their own language.</seg>
<seg>It is undeniable that intolerance reached until the tops of the Turkish government.</seg>
<seg>The Abdullah Gul Foreign Minister recently cancelled in a brutal way a press conference in Copenhagen when it located a Kurdish journalist in the public which the Danes refused to make leave.</seg>
<seg>Such acts and such attitudes largely justify my dissension of October 2004.</seg>
<seg>But even if these defects were corrected, Turkey should not nevertheless be allowed in the EU, because it is not an European country.</seg>
<seg>Christianity, feudality, the Rebirth, the Lights, the democracy and industrialization made us to them Européens that we are, but they did not make Turks what they are.</seg>
<seg>I am thus not persuaded that reforms in Turkey, implemented because of the insistence of the European commission, would be continued after adhesion.</seg>
<seg>I even suspect as there would be repetitions.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, the accession of Turkey would undoubtedly lead to that of the Ukraine, Bielorussia and Moldavie, and perhaps of Georgia, Arménie and Azerbaïdjan.</seg>
<seg>These the first three countries are surely more European than Turkey.</seg>
<seg>By leaving side the three republics of the Caucasus but by including the States which succeeded Yugoslavia, that would give an EU of some 35 members.</seg>
<seg>Which kind of Union would this be?</seg>
<seg>The EU is not simply a club of friends.</seg>
<seg>It is founded on the freedom of circulation of the goods, the services, the capital and the people.</seg>
<seg>The Commission, as a guardian of the treaties of the Union, must protect these four fundamental freedoms, which means that it must sometimes persuade, and if necessary to oblige, of the Member States to change their laws.</seg>
<seg>The policies concerning alcohol in Sweden, law-Volkswagen in Germany and discriminations against the funds of overseas investments in France are examples of cases which made the Commission unpopular.</seg>
<seg>But they were necessary.</seg>
<seg>At the time where I left the Commission, I had by-towards me a pile of 1.500 observations of irregularities of this style.</seg>
<seg>In short, adhesion at the EU implies the acceptance of incisors measurements which deeply affect the internal businesses of a State.</seg>
<seg>That proves to be impossible with such disparate members.</seg>
<seg>The EU would fall victim from what the historian Paul Kennedy calls the “imperial surextension.”</seg>
<seg>It would be diluted in an unacceptable way.</seg>
<seg>For this reason former French president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing feared that the entry of Turkey does not lead to the end of the EU, and therefore the former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: “the accession of Turkey would be more than what the EU could not about it support.”</seg>
<seg>But the strongest reason to be opposed to the accession of Turkey is a question of democracy: the majority of the population of the EU does not want any quite simply.</seg>
<seg>The Bolivian Crisis, failure of the Latin America</seg>
<seg>Bolivia is not a typical country of the Latin America, far from there.</seg>
<seg>And if they were not the Haitian disorders, it would be the poorest country of the Western hemisphere: it is even less stable than Haiti as shows it its history and its two hundred coups d'etat since its independence.</seg>
<seg>In an area with the indigenous past extremely, but at the dispersed and isolated present, Bolivia is perhaps, with Guatemala, the only country of Latin America where native-born people represent the majority of the population.</seg>
<seg>Its topography and its ethnic distribution generate forces separatists and even secessionists who threaten the national unit of manner much more provocante that everywhere else.</seg>
<seg>And it is, of course, with Paraguay, the only country of all the private sub-continent of access to the sea.</seg>
<seg>Thus, it would be well not very advisable to extrapolate the crisis which currently Bolivia passes through to the remainder of the Latin America.</seg>
<seg>Generalization would be well too simplistic: elsewhere, the institutions are much stronger, poverty, and particularly misery, was reduced and the fights of appropriation of the natural resources were generally regulated.</seg>
<seg>Even in countries such as Venezuela, which has enormous crude oil reserves and which are equipped with a nationalist government to the traditional spirit, the status quo maintained allowed the safeguarding of the overseas investments during almost the eight years of government of president Hugo Chavez.</seg>
<seg>Even if the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries, since Chiapas until the “Araucania”, of Amazonia until Ayacucho, they never posed any real threat with the national integrity in any country of Latin America.</seg>
<seg>Thus, Bolivia did not see a premonitory crisis, not more than eternal “the theory of the dominos”, in which Lyndon Jonhson and Che Guevarra believed both in the case of Bolivia, does not seem valid nor even partially reasonable.</seg>
<seg>However, the current crisis in Bolivia shows finger the “democratic deficit” which afflicts the Latin America.</seg>
<seg>The elected leaders are put in failure for a reason or another in Bolivia, Ecuador and Haiti.</seg>
<seg>The democracy is failing or absent in Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua and sees itself threatened pure a reason or another in Venezuela and in Colombia.</seg>
<seg>None of these cases resembles the other and they comprise all various degrees of danger, destruction and reconciliation.</seg>
<seg>Remain to be seen what can be made against this irrefutable fact, who contrasts hard with the encouraging prospects who prevailed until these last years.</seg>
<seg>During the last meeting of the Organization of the American States which was held at Fort Lauderdale, in Florida, the United-States delegation borrowed an good idea provided by others and quite simply ran it because of its support.</seg>
<seg>The history began two years earlier when Dante Caputo, former Argentinian Foreign Minister, and the development program of the United Nations (UNDP) were charged to prepare a report/ratio on the democracy in Latin America.</seg>
<seg>Their conclusions indicated that a system of anticipated warning of the democratic crises in the area would help to generate certain actions before any loss of control, as it is the case of Bolivia today.</seg>
<seg>Misters Caputo and the team of the UNDP had then convinced the Chilean president, Ricardo Lagos, to undertake the initiative and to promote it with several of his/her colleagues.</seg>
<seg>What it did without the initiative not going very far.</seg>
<seg>In fact, the report/ratio of the UNDP on the democracy in Latin America, published in 2004, hardly mentioned it.</seg>
<seg>The United States and the new general secretary of the OAS, Jose Miguel Insulza, started again it at the time of the meeting of the OAS in Florida, but it was killed by reasonable fears of Latin-American persuaded which it is an action against Venezuela, associated with anachronistic fears of Latin-American on the violation of the sacro-saint principle of nonintervention.</seg>
<seg>In spite of impossibility for the continent of agreeing on the principle, the idea of a system of anticipated warning deserves to be studied.</seg>
<seg>Today, the Latin-American community probably has little possibility of intervention on the Bolivian situation, and yet it is dangerous for everyone.</seg>
<seg>Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and the growers of sheets of Coke, is perhaps an honest democratic leader, somewhat malavized, but its supporters are all released from any authoritative will?</seg>
<seg>Perhaps Hugo Chavez does not finance Misters Morales and the other Bolivian dissidents, but Venezuela and Cuba aren't tempted to mix with the businesses of this country where Che Guevarra died in the head of the guerrilla nearly 40 years earlier?</seg>
<seg>Will the community of businesses of Santa Cruz in Bolivia will perhaps not give following its threats of secession, but prefer to share the natural gas and crude oil reserves of their area with native-born people of the highlands rather than with the Brazilian industrialists of São Paulo?</seg>
<seg>Before the events do not reach extremes, it would be perhaps good that the OAS (and not the United States) interfere themselves.</seg>
<seg>The area continues to need this participation, in term of time, message and suitable democratic platform, distinct from the traditional American intervention and the usual indifference of the Latin America.</seg>
<seg>Decline of France?</seg>
<seg>The French are manifestly sensitive, not to say on the defensive, as for the scale of France abroad.</seg>
<seg>The French state devotes an important sum to the diffusion of the language and culture Frenchwomen, but the French are painfully conscious that the world position of their country is not any more what it was.</seg>
<seg>In this context, it is thus not surprising only at the time of the last presidential elections, the publication of a report/ratio of the European commission declaring that the economic row of France among the European countries had passed from the 3</seg>
<seg>OECD and Eurostat, the European organization charged to join together these data, thought of having put an end to this aspect of the debate by showing that France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain presented all of about identical standards of living per capita.</seg>
<seg>But the controversy on a vaster scale did not disappear for as much.</seg>
<seg>Rumours worry on the “French decline” made their reappearance with the steps of protest which proceeded this year against the reform of the retirements, the disagreements growing on the fiscal policy with the European commission and the squabbles with America on the war in Iraq.</seg>
<seg>The nonfictionalized work which gains a great success in France at present is a polemic written by Nicolas Baverez, France who fall.</seg>
<seg>The book of Will dribble is filled of quotations of de Gaulle and Napoleon.</seg>
<seg>According to the author, the last achievements of France go back to the years 1970, with the express train, the TGV, and the Airbus.</seg>
<seg>He criticizes Mitterrand and Chirac severely joined together by a “common talent to gain the elections and to make France losing”.</seg>
<seg>The success of the book constitutes in itself a sign of “faintness”.</seg>
<seg>But of which type?</seg>
<seg>The evidence of degeneration brought by Baverez is not as convincing as he wants to believe it well.</seg>
<seg>For example, it quotes the exhaustion of the industrial employment like the most obvious proof of the decline of France.</seg>
<seg>But disindustrialization is a reality common to all the advanced countries.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, France obtains in fact better results that the majority of its close competitor rich person and, contrary to Germany, of RU or the United States, it preserved the same world market share in the industrial sector as that which it held with the beginning of the year 1970.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, according to a more precise measurement of competitiveness and overseas investments, France obtains excellent results in these fields.</seg>
<seg>According to a recent report published by the economic Council of analysis, the direct investments in France passed to 60 billion euros in 2001, that is to say almost twice as much as Germany.</seg>
<seg>The French competitiveness of the costs also improved (of 20%) in the three last decades, the higher productivity counterbalancing the rapid growth of the wages.</seg>
<seg>But the heart of the economic problems on the long run of France resides precisely in the fear of losing the industrial employment.</seg>
<seg>France remains a strong industrial power in traditional sectors such as the car and the aerospace one, but it took delay in innovating markets on which smaller companies diffuse new technologies.</seg>
<seg>France, for example, devotes only 30 billion dollars per annum in the search and the development for state-of-the-art technologies, against 51 billion dollars for Germany, 98 billion dollars for Japan and 265 billion dollars for the United States.</seg>
<seg>In short, the analysis of Will dribble share in the bad direction.</seg>
<seg>France undertook several extremely important reforms over the two last decades: the financial economic liberalization and, the elimination of the exchange and price controls, end of the restrictions of credit, European liberalization, the reduction of the inflationary and commercial deficits, the advent of the euro and the forced universalization of the companies of the country.</seg>
<seg>French faintness was certainly not induced by these reforms.</seg>
<seg>The problem of France comes from what it did not succeed in recognizing the new world of which it forms already part.</seg>
<seg>French capitalism died and France does not manage to accept its disappearance.</seg>
<seg>France must be the only country in which a Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, felt obliged to on television present excuses after having said that “the State is not the Almighty”.</seg>
<seg>There exist several reasons to explain this French schizophrenia, but most important of them the political game of these 20 last years concerns.</seg>
<seg>Until 1981, France was clearly divided between right-hand side and left.</seg>
<seg>For this period, the Mitterand administrations and Chirac have blunted their ideological side in order to implement the difficult process of adaptation to Europe and universalization.</seg>
<seg>A “treatment by electric shock” in Mrs. Thatcher two decades before could have forged a new political conscience.</seg>
<seg>But the slow and consensual passage of the reforms made it possible to the French to live in a world and to think in another.</seg>
<seg>This irrefutable fact mainly explains the political cataclysm which exploded at the time of the last presidential campaign, when the leader of the extreme Jean-Marie Le Pen right-hand side reached the second turn of the presidential elections in front of the first outgoing minister, Lionel Jospin.</seg>
<seg>The rise of the extreme left, which gathered 10% of the voices at the time of this presidential campaign, also attests this political failure.</seg>
<seg>France requires for a political revolution good more than of an economic revolution if she wants to manage to accept reality, in particular the fact that the “French decline” is a fear created by French people.</seg>
<seg>The value of the European values</seg>
<seg>The European leaders continued the constitutional discussions which had ended last December following a disagreement on the rights to vote.</seg>
<seg>These debates must obviously lead to compromises, which could not delay.</seg>
<seg>Still remain to include/understand clearly which are the supposed objectives of the constitution.</seg>
<seg>Two basic principles governed European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg>These two principles are held with cross of philosophy, politics, economics, sociology and the right.</seg>
<seg>During years, they formed integral part of the legal structure and institutional of the European Union, in the treaties, the Charter of the Basic rights (which quotes them in its Preamble) and in the recent preliminary draft of Constitution.</seg>
<seg>To summarize, they are registered in the history and the ideals of the EU.</seg>
<seg>But which is the real significance of these two principles?</seg>
<seg>Let us take the solidarity, which lends itself to two interpretations at least: the static solidarity, which relate to only the distribution of income and richnesses, and the vaster concept of dynamic solidarity, which relates to the production of incomes and richnesses.</seg>
<seg>In the history post-war period of European integration, dynamic solidarity strongly appeared during the first period, that of the European Coal and Steel Community, so much in its economic development strategy (rebuilding) that in the treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome.</seg>
<seg>That does not mean however that dynamic solidarity was removed thereafter: the European monetary Union, for example, expresses this principle perfectly.</seg>
<seg>Thus, although certain countries immediately did not profit from the euro, they nevertheless accepted it because they were convinced that it would have positive effects on the long run.</seg>
<seg>In other words, dynamic solidarity means to encourage policies which support the investment, the innovation, the economic growth and employment.</seg>
<seg>However, as the growth of the GNP in the EU indicates it, dynamic solidarity was shaken during the last decade.</seg>
<seg>The shift between the research and the development constitutes a particularly alarming subject.</seg>
<seg>The application of the so-called strategy of Lisbon of the EU, adopted in 2000 with the promise to create the most competitive economy of the world, is threatened by the growing importance attached to the static solidarity, which is reflected in the high costs of the social security and the high taxes necessary to its financing.</seg>
<seg>The primacy of static solidarity is due to a growing old population which, jointly with a slowed down growth, involved structural fiscal imbalances.</seg>
<seg>One of the more big challenges posed with becoming of the EU consists in treating the current prevalence of the static solidarity, which is directed towards the elderly, with the detriment of the dynamic solidarity, which supports the young people.</seg>
<seg>After all, the Union cannot allow only continuous current consumption to carry it on the required investment with future prosperity.</seg>
<seg>Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in what its interpretation is also double: vertical subsidiarity and horizontal subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg>Vertical subsidiarity relates to the distribution of the capacities between the various levels of government and sovereignty: the EU, states national, areas and municipalities.</seg>
<seg>The most known application of this principle is the federalism.</seg>
<seg>The European treaties express this vertical subsidiarity clearly.</seg>
<seg>But is this sufficient to include the institutional and constitutional groundworks emergent of the Union?</seg>
<seg>Horizontal subsidiarity relates to the responsibility and the freedom of the human beings like on the social and economic powers.</seg>
<seg>It includes the relations between the state, the company and the market.</seg>
<seg>But the company and the market have their own rights and their own sovereignties which are not granted by the state.</seg>
<seg>Emerges then the following problem: how to guarantee the autonomy of each kingdom?</seg>
<seg>Let us quote like example of horizontal subsidiarity the internal European market, which created a new type of economic freedom and increased competition between the companies by eliminating protection that the national governments offered to them.</seg>
<seg>Horizontal subsidiarity means that in the company and the economic sphere, the state cannot violate the freedom and the several liability, which must be respected with the more possible high level.</seg>
<seg>It also implies that a “higher power” must give its support each time freedom and the several liability are not enough to achieve the goals necessary to human dignity.</seg>
<seg>This support must however be exempted according to methods which support the natural potential of the individuals, the company and the market.</seg>
<seg>But this is not possible that if the role of horizontal subsidiarity is clearly stated, which was not the case in the European treaties, the Charter of the Basic rights or the work of European Convention.</seg>
<seg>To summarize, solidarity implies a redistribution today rather than a growth (thus the present generation expresses solidarity with the future generations) while subsidiarity relates to the distribution of the political power rather than a careful definition of the borders separating the state, the civil society and the market.</seg>
<seg>At present, these two values are defined so as to support the State.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the stress laid on the growth directed towards the market was often identified with the semi-foreign values of America.</seg>
<seg>But these values are deeply enracinées in Europe and they must be uprooted again.</seg>
<seg>The EU must restore her economic vitality by continuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity more balanced in favour of the market and the company, which would decrease the socio-economic influence of the State.</seg>
<seg>The public institutions must produce public goods (such as defense, justice and the fiscal policy and monetarist), the company must offer social goods (like the culture, education and the assistance with needy) and the market must produce economic goods (related on the profits, the growth and employment).</seg>
<seg>With the 21e century, Europe must re-examine the value of these two principles (solidarity and subsidiarity) if she wants to carry out the historical objective of integration: freedom and wellbeing necessary to overcome the political differences and divisions which involved tragedies during the 20th century.</seg>
<seg>Such is the spirit in which must be elaborate the European Constitution.</seg>
<seg>The Policy of the values</seg>
<seg>The debate on the American elections still did not weaken.</seg>
<seg>How president George W. Bush could obtain three million votes moreover than the senator John Kerry, and, moreover, to be offered a Republican majority to the two rooms of the Congress?</seg>
<seg>One agrees little on the answers, but two topics are recurring in many explanations.</seg>
<seg>One of these topics is due to its personality.</seg>
<seg>At our time full with uncertainties and threat, the citizens placed their confidence in a president whom they rather knew than in a candidate not having proven reliable yet.</seg>
<seg>The second is that of the values.</seg>
<seg>The citizens voted for a whole of values rather than for specific policies.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, some (one says) are in line with the policies of Misters Kerry but however brought their voice to Misters Bush because they felt “at ease” with the whole of her attitude.</seg>
<seg>It is clear that the United States is now deeply divided into electoral terms.</seg>
<seg>An arch of blue States (democratic) in the East, North and the West extends around an enormous red zone (republican) in the center and the South.</seg>
<seg>Beyond geographical division, divisions reproduce at the local level.</seg>
<seg>The gerrymandering, this practice of retraçage of the electoral borders to support a political party with the detriment of an other, is not necessary any more.</seg>
<seg>The voters tend to move in areas where the majority of the inhabitants share their values, which they are republican or democratic.</seg>
<seg>Which are these values exactly?</seg>
<seg>In fact the values treat, so that one says to us, “of god, of the weapons and the gays”.</seg>
<seg>The religion plays a part there, in particular with the truths specific to the bible in the field of the history of creation.</seg>
<seg>The possession of a weapon is the ultimate test of individualism and the use of weapons in period of war does not have anything odious.</seg>
<seg>The gays and others practical “modern” are rejected, because nombrilists.</seg>
<seg>As the political economist Andrew Hacker said it recently, “the candidature of Misters Bush was built to form a majority by giving to 60 million voters the chance to feel well with respect to themselves”.</seg>
<seg>All that or are exist an American phenomenon other tendencies elsewhere?</seg>
<seg>One of the answers wants that in the capacity as American phenomenon, the policy of the values can order a majority well today but is not to in no case general.</seg>
<seg>Europe and other areas of the world are divided same manner.</seg>
<seg>The personality counts without any doubt, and under the obvious political differences also questions of values are which were not clarified yet.</seg>
<seg>However, the traditional political differences founded on the dissension in connection with fundamental values play a part always less important in the elections.</seg>
<seg>The Tony Blair Prime Minister, for example, another leader having to face an election in his country, play the chart of the personality and speak about policies, but represent before a whole whole of values of middle-class.</seg>
<seg>When he speaks about “modernization” or “to enter twenty-and-unième century”, he manages to suggest a strange mixture but attracting change and of stability.</seg>
<seg>That leaves the conservative opposition without any effective answer.</seg>
<seg>Even the questions of tax cuts and of right of asylum more strict do not manage to make fly on the cords of the melody of the values than the Republican party succeeded in making hear in the United States.</seg>
<seg>The situation is the same one in Germany, where the manifest influence of the policy of the values is even less.</seg>
<seg>The debate, in Germany, still remains in its major part a political debate.</seg>
<seg>When the opposition offers to the government to negotiate the reform of social protection or, more recently, to combat unemployment, the subjacent challenge is not posed in terms of values but of competence rather.</seg>
<seg>However, under the traditional battle fields of the English or German political debate, or besides in Europe, the clashes of the values threaten.</seg>
<seg>The parts fight for those which can “feel at ease at their own place”, perhaps but they do not include/understand very although that is only partly a question of policy.</seg>
<seg>The religion will be never a big factor in European policy: the opinion polls show that the religious practice remains one of the rare principal differences between the Americans and Europeans.</seg>
<seg>The weapons also occupy a different place in the European spirits: it is their absence which Europeans regard as important.</seg>
<seg>Europe also saw without any possible doubt a current of pacifist values.</seg>
<seg>And the question of politically correct (“gays”) also plays a less part until now in Europe.</seg>
<seg>Especially, Europe itself divides Europeans, because the “national question” is present in all the European States.</seg>
<seg>It is a question of values inspired by the fear.</seg>
<seg>The citizens want to know where they are located and, in the tread, are turned over against the United States and towards Europe or against Europe and towards their own country.</seg>
<seg>In all manners, we then leave the kingdom of the policies and even of the policy and enter the marshy field of the symbols and the myths.</seg>
<seg>What, in any case, represents the principal danger to which the democracies must face, because the policy of the values is a dangerous development.</seg>
<seg>It reintroduces fundamental divisions of a company whose more democratic great success was precisely to banish the fundamentalism of the political life.</seg>
<seg>An enlightened public debate must be a discussion on the policies contained by a community of values.</seg>
<seg>It is thus essential to insist on this vital objective of the policy of freedom.</seg>
<seg>The advent of the interest</seg>
<seg>One swallow doesn't make spring and only one month of normal growth of employment and price in rise in the United States does not mean however that the Federal fund does not fear any more one faintness and a deflation economic.</seg>
<seg>But the time will come where world interest rates will start to increase like the central bankers prepare to resist the vagueness of rising inflation.</seg>
<seg>When this moment arrives, that it is this autumn, in 2005 or 2006, or in 2007, America and the worldwide economy must face financial vulnerabilities which will reflect the three last years success of monetary stimulation by stopping the decline of the production and by moderating unemployment.</seg>
<seg>Short-term interest rates are surprisingly low: only 2% in the euro area, just 1% in the United States and zero in Japan.</seg>
<seg>The expansionist monetary policy proved to be a success, but only after having brought interest rates to bottom historical grades and to have convinced the investors who the costs of loan would remain on their current levels for a long time.</seg>
<seg>The monetary stimulant mainly caused to increase the prices of the credits: all that produces a benefit, a dividend or a rent becomes much more attracting, and thus much more invaluable in financial terms, when interest rates are very low and should remain it.</seg>
<seg>This explains the considerable differences between the current prices of the real estate in the United States, the ordinary actions in New York, London and Frankfurt, and the obligations on the long run everywhere in the world and what should be, in a conventional way, their fundamental values.</seg>
<seg>What will occur when the central banks start to increase their interest rates?</seg>
<seg>In 1994, the increase in interest rates on the short term involved an increase in the rates on the long run (and a reduction in the prices of the obligations on the long run) of at least the double of that envisaged by the standard models this year.</seg>
<seg>Interest rates of the peripheral economies in the process of development moreover increased much more than the rates of the principal advanced industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg>The first danger for 2005 and the years to come, when world interest rates increase, as that is extremely probable, is another wave of financial crises of the emerging markets.</seg>
<seg>For countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the record of the years 1990 shows that the variations of interest rates can grow and flows of capital to be reversed remarkably quickly, whatever the degree of benevolence with which the representatives of the IMF and the analyses carried out by the large banks consider the policies of a country.</seg>
<seg>The variations of interest rates of the emerging markets are currently abnormally weak.</seg>
<seg>Flows international currencies, surge of capital in the excluded United States, are not yet at the levels associated with a “irrational exubérance”, but there are strong chances so that occurs before interest rates do not start to climb.</seg>
<seg>This prospect is alarming because if there is a lesson to be learnt from the years 1990, it is that nobody should over-estimate the stability of international financial flows.</seg>
<seg>The second danger comes from the high values of the credit in the principal advanced industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg>The way of thinking dominating within the Federal fund, to which I adhere fully, supports that the revolution of information technologies continues, that the potential production in the United States always grows very quickly and that the variation of production is thus relatively large.</seg>
<seg>This implies that interest rates will have doubtless to remain low during a relatively long time.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, confidence in the Federal fund is large and the last vestiges of the premium of the risk of inflation of the years 1970 do not comprise any more any interest rate.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, even after the levels of production returned on their potential level, interest rates will remain low according to the standards of the years 1980 and 1990.</seg>
<seg>All this constitutes, obviously, of good news for all those which hold credits such as obligations on the long run, of the actions and the real goods.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the raising of prices of the credit on the long run was precisely it to what the fall of interest rates aspired: to return the real bond-holders, and particularly owners, richer gives after a whole whiplash to the expenditure.</seg>
<seg>But the bad news, it is that even if interest rates are supposed to remain low during a certain time, they will not remain also low indefinitely.</seg>
<seg>Essence, it is that when interest rates go up, the values of the credit fall.</seg>
<seg>It is during these periods, and particularly when the values of the credit drop quickly and considerably, that we fully discover the degree of competence of our central bankers in their principal task: to reduce financial volatility and to support economic stability.</seg>
<seg>It is also during these periods that we discover how the individuals who hold obligations on the long run, of the real goods or the actions hold them not because they think that the current prices are interesting compared to the basic prices, but because their prices increased during the last years.</seg>
<seg>It is a crucial question for the political décisionnaires because the individuals who bought credits on the long run because the prices seemed to increase indefinitely are also those which will sell as soon as the tendency seems to be reversed.</seg>
<seg>Particularly, the trade deficit of the United States lets predict a massive instability if the prices of the credits on the long run should fall considerably.</seg>
<seg>It is certain that the challenges which will arise for the décisionnaires economic policies of the world during the years to come will differ from those with which they were confronted since the collapse of the illusion of the NASDAQ.</seg>
<seg>The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those generated by a production in fall and the threat of a deflation.</seg>
<seg>But, as we learned during the years 1990, that does not mean however that the challenges to come will be easier to solve.</seg>
<seg>Opposite Futures of America</seg>
<seg>I recently discovered an interesting fact: the American economists who deal with international finance and the American macroeconomists who deal with the economy domesticates have from the very different points of view -- in fact, opposite -- on the possible consequences of the enormous US deficit.</seg>
<seg>The economists of international finance consider that a financial crisis possible, is followed of a painful and perhaps prolonged recession to the United States.</seg>
<seg>The macroeconomists who treat interior economy on the contrary not see a forthcoming fall of the value of the dollar like a crisis but like an occasion to accelerate the growth.</seg>
<seg>The macroeconomists who examine the interior economy generally consider the situation as follows: at one time given in the future, the foreign central banks will be less inclined to continue their massive purchases of safety measures in dollar to support the green ticket</seg>
<seg>When they put an end to their programmes of purchase of dollar with large scales, the value of the dollar will fall, and it will strongly fall.</seg>
<seg>And, from this point of view, if the value of the dollar declines, American exports will become much more attractive for the overseas markets and the American labour market will begin again, the labour being redirected towards the new sectors of export in full boom.</seg>
<seg>The situation will be comparable with that of Great Britain when it gave up its indexing of foreign exchange rate and let the pound sterling be depreciated compared to the German mark, or what occurred in the United States at the end of the years 1980 when the dollar was depreciated compared to the book, with the mark and -- especially -- compared to the Japanese yen.</seg>
<seg>The economists of international finance describe a darker future.</seg>
<seg>They consider that the end of the programmes of purchase of dollar with large scales by the central banks will lead not only to the decline of the dollar but also to a rise out of arrow of American interest rates in the long run, which will immediately make fall the household consumption and will control the capital expenditures after a short amount of time.</seg>
<seg>Undoubtedly, the economists of the international finance also consider which American exports will benefit from the fall of the dollar but the shifts of the request are such as the push of exports will occur only one or two years after the decline of the consumption and the capital expenditures.</seg>
<seg>Eights to ten million people will have to pass from the service sector and construction to the sector of the import-export of goods, which implies that the structural unemployment will increase.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps moreover, one will attend a financial panic: the great financial institutions with short-term obligations and long-term credits will encounter difficulties of supporting a big rise of the long-term interest rates made out in dollar.</seg>
<seg>This factor of inequality can involve a certain financial tension and a bankruptcy as easily as those caused at the time of the Mexican crises and East Asia in the years 1990 or of the Argentinian crisis of this decade because of the credits in local currency and of the obligations in dollar which the banks held.</seg>
<seg>When the economists of international finance propose this scenario, the macroeconomists specialized in the economy domesticates answer them that resembles a case of incompetence as regards monetary policy.</seg>
<seg>Why the Federal fund should allow to the rise of interest rates in the long run when the foreign central banks will cease their programmes of purchase of dollar?</seg>
<seg>Shouldn't it then intervene and take over by the American purchase of Treasury bond in the long run, thus preserving long-term interest rates at a satisfactory level to encourage the full employment?</seg>
<seg>The economists of international finance generally answer that the Federal fund does not have the capacity to do it.</seg>
<seg>Obliged to choose between the full employment and the price stability, according to them, the Federal fund will choose the price stability, because its institutional memory of the years 1970 and the flight of inflation remains very powerful.</seg>
<seg>Thus, since the fall of the value of the dollar raises the import prices and of this fact functions as a negative shock on the side of the offer in the economic sector, the Federal fund will have to increase and not reduce its interest rates and to thus sell rather than to buy Treasury bonds.</seg>
<seg>Serious economists that I respect largely find to give an opinion in opposite camps of this debate.</seg>
<seg>I am not enough wise to give reason to one or the others, but I know without any doubt which side I hope to see being mistaken.</seg>
<seg>Poor pupils of Europe</seg>
<seg>In the United States, the states which continue not very judicious fiscal policies are penalized.</seg>
<seg>Their obligations are sold with the reduction compared with those of other better managed states.</seg>
<seg>The debt servicing higher than they must pay is useful, with a certain degree, of disciplinary measure against temptation to spend today and to pay later.</seg>
<seg>Naturally, the discipline of the market is not perfect: the bond market “does not see” not really the passive implicit futures (like the promised payments of the retirements).</seg>
<seg>However, the application of this tax discipline, associated with the internal budgetary processes of each state, prevented occurred of tax crisis of great width in the United States since the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg>Let us consider the case of Europe.</seg>
<seg>Before the advent of the euro, many States d' Europe of the south underwent tax crises, producing vague high inflationists.</seg>
<seg>But with the installation of the single currency, the way making it possible to solve a tax crisis by inflation was closed, since Central Bank Européenne (ECB) supervises the monetary policy.</seg>
<seg>However, even if the nations cannot count any more on inflation to solve the imbalance of their finances, the single currency enables them to use the credit-worthiness which belongs in fact to other members of the European Union to extend their extravagant madness and to push back their political responsibility for periods of leave good rolled times [1] [sic].</seg>
<seg>It is to avoid this possibility that the EU created the Stability pact and of growth: the budget deficit of the governments should not exceed 3% of their GDP.</seg>
<seg>Last week, the German government, formerly the European country most careful and disciplined at the tax level, has enfreint the rules of the pact for the fifth consecutive year, without really presenting (much) excuses.</seg>
<seg>The Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrueck announced that it expected that the European commission applies sanctions against Germany: the credibility of the Pact would be, says it, put in danger if no gesture were made.</seg>
<seg>Thus, Germany would not make obstacle with the sanctions this time, as that was the case there are two years and half.</seg>
<seg>But Steinbrueck also expressed clearly that it purely expected only one sanction symbolic system in answer to the budget deficit accounting for 3,4% of the GDP, and not with penalties which would have a true cost for its government or its economy.</seg>
<seg>The Stability pact and of growth is not, or not yet, in the process of function in the way envisaged at the beginning.</seg>
<seg>What is it discipline of the market?</seg>
<seg>Is the will of the German government to increase its debt and to dig its deficits limited by the fact that the market recognizes and penalizes nations which let their tax position weaken?</seg>
<seg>In a word, not.</seg>
<seg>Interest rates on the sovereign debt in euro of the twelve governments of the euro area are very similar.</seg>
<seg>The market thus does not seem to worry that countries have different potentials to generate exports financing financial flow necessary to the refunding of the debts, or various current or projected ratios déficit/PIB.</seg>
<seg>Willem Buiter, of the university of Amsterdam and Anne Sibert, of the University of London, estimate that it is the acceptance of the ECB of all the deficit of the euro area as guaranteed which sapped the will of the market to become the controller of tax moderation.</seg>
<seg>As long as the marginal part of the German debt is used like guarantee for a short-term loan or central part of an operation of pension delivered to acquire liquidities, its value is much more likely to be given by the terms according to which the ECB accepts it like guarantee than by its fundamental.</seg>
<seg>The treatment by the ECB of any debt of the kind as so important source of liquidity of reserve distorts from now on any differential analysis of sovereign risk in the long run.</seg>
<seg>They is dangerous long-term.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to have at the same time a discipline of market and a solid tax management to have a chance reasonable to profit from a price stability on the long run.</seg>
<seg>Omit today to sanction by the market a behavior which can become breakage-neck or to activate the institutional levers which give a voice to the future generations, and you expose yourselves to undergo serious consequences -- perhaps not today nor tomorrow, but one day, and for the remainder of your life.</seg>
<seg>As time passes, the arrival of the single currency and the way in which the euro was set up generate faintness more and more.</seg>
<seg>The policy of all the euro area in general is far too deflationary.</seg>
<seg>The transfers necessary to make the currency current bearable to the areas which slow down or are already in recession when the ECB applies a more strict policy are not made.</seg>
<seg>The institutional foundations of a stable fiscal policy on the long run are in full erosion.</seg>
<seg>Now, Buiter and Sibert convince us that the ECB gives to the market less possibility of rewarding most sparing and of penalizing the extravagant ones that it should not.</seg>
<seg>The ground does not move yet, and that will not arrive before a moment.</seg>
<seg>But the ground under the euro could become well slipping if the things do not change.</seg>
<seg>Milosevic and Hussein: even lawsuit, even joke</seg>
<seg>The lawsuits of the war criminals were formerly serious businesses.</seg>
<seg>Remember the photographs Hermann Goering and Rudolf Hess, disasters, on the dock in Nuremberg.</seg>
<seg>Certain leaders Nazis were even hung afterwards of the relatively short, but right lawsuits.</seg>
<seg>Nowadays, the lawsuits of the most contemptible leaders of the world became jokes.</seg>
<seg>The lawsuit of Saddam Hussein and her friends of Baath is an uninterrupted series of awkward moments.</seg>
<seg>The defendants try a singery after the other and Hussein makes watch of all the forms of possible contempt. The only thing which it did not make yet, it is to show its buttocks with the judge.</seg>
<seg>It is difficult to expect from it an exit which could appear legitimate with the eyes of the Iraqis or world.</seg>
<seg>During this time, the lawsuit of Slobodan Milosevic changed into funeral after four tedious years of testimonys and 200 million dollars spent unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg>In Kampuchea, the United Nations and the government tergiversated during almost ten years to know how to bring the surviving personalities Khmer Rouge in front of the courts.</seg>
<seg>The killers masses some who seized the power at the twentieth century were condemned to be killed in revolts popular or judged for their crimes -- at least, if they did not die during their mandate.</seg>
<seg>Who can feel to trust that the last communist chief of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, was shot with his wife without very appearances of a right lawsuit?</seg>
<seg>The formal traps of a true Court appear always preferable with an instantaneous justice, even if the end result is also death.</seg>
<seg>Today there are two plausible ways to proceed with regard to a relieved tyrant.</seg>
<seg>A nation can send its former leaders in front of the courts, like made the Argentinian ones in the years 1980 with the generals responsible for disappearance of more than 5.000 of their fellow-citizens.</seg>
<seg>With the international level, the model of Nuremberg remains valid to be used as example with other lawsuits, although under the conditions ambiguities which the victorious powers sometimes require of the accounts for certain crimes, like the “crimes against humanity,” which are not correctly defined in the moment when they are made.</seg>
<seg>It one time ago when one could see the advantages of at the same time national and international lawsuits.</seg>
<seg>The lawsuits on the national territory made it possible the local community to give free course to its sorrow while taking part of close with the procedure.</seg>
<seg>As judges and sworn, the compatriots of the defendants could also bring a greater sensitivity to the estimate of the culpability because they could appreciate the hard conditions under which a relieved dictator made his decisions.</seg>
<seg>The lawsuit of the generals in Argentina was a crowned ritual of success within the framework of the painful transition from the military junta to the democracy, but this experiment was completed in a larmoyante called in question.</seg>
<seg>Even after their judgment, the generals were enough strong to require a denunciation of their lawsuits then an amnesty of the following president.</seg>
<seg>The Argentinian policy is still tangled up in the legal consequences of these lawsuits of twenty years ago.</seg>
<seg>With the international level, the decision of the safety advice of UNO to establish the International penal court for ex-Yugoslavia (TPI) was also greeted with a great confidence.</seg>
<seg>The TPI made several decisions founders under the direction of Antonio Cassese.</seg>
<seg>But then the judges had the bad luck to carry out their dream expensive: to judge the scélérat as a chief, Slobodan Milosevic.</seg>
<seg>One cannot have a clear idea in the way in which the Serb ones would have judged Milosevic within the framework of a local lawsuit.</seg>
<seg>Much would have depended on the political party which would have controlled the Court.</seg>
<seg>To the international level, fears did not relate on an excess of policy but to an excess of right.</seg>
<seg>The lawsuit of Milosevic was to be more than right, it was to be the emblem of the justice of UNO.</seg>
<seg>Thus Milosevic was authorized to defend itself -- serious error in terms length and effectiveness of the lawsuit.</seg>
<seg>There no were limits with the number of people whom the charge invited to testify on the same terrible history to the aggression and brutality Serb.</seg>
<seg>It will take many months to determine the problem and to know why this scandal of a four years lawsuit.</seg>
<seg>My intuition that the quite disposed civils servant of the court were influenced too much by the Commission of truth and South-African reconciliation, model is sold in the schools of right like a desirable alternative to distributive justice.</seg>
<seg>During South-African lawsuits, the most important question was not the future of the defendant but the past of the victims.</seg>
<seg>Each victim was encouraged to tell its history and the defendant listened.</seg>
<seg>In the case of massacres perpetrated at the twentieth century, such narrations can last of tens of years.</seg>
<seg>To encourage the victims to speak then to give to the defendant the right to monopolize the word and to block the lawsuit by praising its merits of political leader are the ingredients of an interminable session.</seg>
<seg>One of the lessons which we drew from the lawsuits of Milosevic and Hussein is that one should not judge men or women to make them lose their charismatic attraction.</seg>
<seg>They will reverse the lawsuit, in particular if they are authorized to defend themselves, and use the courtroom to justify their courses.</seg>
<seg>The tyrants should be judged only after being clearly demolished.</seg>
<seg>Irony of the history, the fact that the court of Nuremberg was animated by representatives of the winners and the powerful ones was an advantage.</seg>
<seg>They constituted a constant recall for Goering, Hess and their henchmen who the Allies ordered, that the Nazis were irremediably overcome.</seg>
<seg>To punish the culprits, rather than to form the way in which the history would be written, was always the objective light of the lawsuit.</seg>
<seg>The tragedy of the lawsuits of Milosevic and Hussein is that the points on the “I” of the history still miss and that the history itself is on the bolster.</seg>
<seg>The consequent hesitation of the persons in charge gave rise to procedures, at the same time national and international, which facilitated the phantasms of justification and return.</seg>
<seg>In the case of Saddam Hussein, this phantasm could be still carried out.</seg>
<seg>The Dividing line of the Iraqi economy</seg>
<seg>All those which analyze Iraq see there a nation divided between the communities of the Shiites, Sunnites and the Kurds.</seg>
<seg>But there exists another division quite as fundamental, a division which contributes as much to the continuous insurrection that the sectarian conflicts and the opposition to the military occupation directed by the Americans, that of the growing ditch who separate the rich person and the poor from Iraq.</seg>
<seg>When Iraq was released, the populations, particularly the stripped populations, began to hope that a charismatic leader would save them hard realities of the daily life.</seg>
<seg>Raised in the fear, they did not have any idea on the way in which the democracy could apply to their company nor how the defense groups of the Human rights and other organizations of civic rights could help them to work their future.</seg>
<seg>Iraq quickly found itself vis-a-vis a new line of social division.</seg>
<seg>On a side those were which included/understood how to function in a democracy, to arrive at the capacity and to carry out clean ambitions.</seg>
<seg>They learned how to speak the language about the democracy, to gain at the same time money and influence, and to make sure the contest of the independent organizations to defend their rights and their preferences.</seg>
<seg>Other side, however, one finds a vast Iraqi population without being able, in particular the widowed women, divorced or given up without anybody to deal with them, they and their children.</seg>
<seg>For these, the democracy and the Human rights do not mean large thing.</seg>
<seg>They are uncultivated, poor and sick.</seg>
<seg>Victims of an education system which crumbled there is more than ten years, they are formed little to find an employment in the Iraqi economy in decrepitude.</seg>
<seg>Under the yoke of Saddam, no effort was made to record the standard of living of stripped.</seg>
<seg>I visited the large Iraqi shantytowns and discovered families living in dwellings hardly covered with a roof, infested insects everywhere, with sewers with open sky running out under their doors.</seg>
<seg>Harms and day, they live in the black.</seg>
<seg>Not needing anything less than food, decent dwellings and prospects for employment, these families await death, terrified by the cries of their famished children.</seg>
<seg>When I met the women who live in these dwellings, they bombarded me questions: was the democracy going to give them food and houses?</seg>
<seg>Would the democracy prevent the men from beating their wives?</seg>
<seg>Would the democracy grant the citizenship to their children?</seg>
<seg>Their would give the right to divorce the husbands who would have given up them?</seg>
<seg>All these questions, I answered “Yes”.</seg>
<seg>Yes, the democracy will grant the right to life in a decent house, the right to you to learn and work, and it will grant the citizenship to the children and the equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg>But it will be necessary for you to work hard and make all the possible efforts to require these rights.</seg>
<seg>It what they answered: “Saddam learned how to us to be unemployed, quiet and apprehensive during 35 years.</seg>
<seg>What can we there now? ”</seg>
<seg>In these poor zones where live the majority of the Iraqis, the populations are in prey with bitter temptations.</seg>
<seg>Many are those which are not with the range of the political leaders or governmental.</seg>
<seg>They fall easily into violence, the flight and sabotage.</seg>
<seg>Poverty leads some to accept money in exchange of terrorist acts, made accessory by the promise to a false heroism which they could not exploit during the long reign of Saddam.</seg>
<seg>Poverty exacerbated the traumatism of the violent history of the wars and the atrocities of Iraq, which destroyed the sensitivity of the people towards the assassination.</seg>
<seg>Although the conditions of existence in Iraq today lead many young men towards violence, I am convinced that it is simply enough to provide them employment and decent housings to save them.</seg>
<seg>Employment, in particular, would help the young people to forge new lives thanks to serious employment.</seg>
<seg>One should not use factitious employment to make up the army of without employment.</seg>
<seg>We must give to the populations employment which enables them to contribute positively to the rebuilding country.</seg>
<seg>By nature, each individual seeks to be useful for his own company.</seg>
<seg>But the culture that Saddam created convinced the Iraqis whom political connections represent the only means of acquiring authority, money and to know.</seg>
<seg>To exceed such feelings will take time and will require a flourishing economy, which implies that the new Iraqi government must have capacities limited in order to facilitate the growth of the private sector while encouraging the generalized comprehension of the democracy and the Human rights.</seg>
<seg>The religious groups are ready to take part in this process.</seg>
<seg>We can also rehabilitate the technocrats who were useful under Saddam, so that they are likely also to serve their country.</seg>
<seg>Last point, and not of least, we must offer loans to the families stripped to help them to build a sizeable life.</seg>
<seg>The government must over do everything all the possible efforts to convince the poor Iraqi populations of the value of the democracy and freedom and the importance of the constitution in the realization of their aspirations to a better life.</seg>
<seg>That will not be easy to realize in a country where many are those which consider that enfreindre the law is an act of heroism.</seg>
<seg>We however have, us, the Iraqis, learned that the capacity should not be concentrated in the hands of a minority, and that the installation of justice requires to fight corruption in all its forms.</seg>
<seg>If the constitution must function like a guarantee of democracy, freedom and safety, the stripped Iraqis must learn how to make them this fight.</seg>
<seg>Islamist identity</seg>
<seg>Where that you direct your glance at present, Islam is used (and misused) as a political clout.</seg>
<seg>Certain Moslems make use of it like incentive with the action; many Moslems in Occident (and in other countries) perceive it like “an other” demanding damming up and “an other” exclusion.</seg>
<seg>As a Turk, I directly feel these two sides of the debate.</seg>
<seg>The reason for which Islam resembles a religion of “the other” with the eyes of the Westerners is that the Occident attended a systematic desinstitutionalisation of the religion.</seg>
<seg>It is not the religion which disappeared from the modern Western life, obviously, but rather the claims which the religious institutions can emit on the individual behavior.</seg>
<seg>The religion in the modern world is more than ever an personal experience and spiritual.</seg>
<seg>However, a process of desinstitutionalisation of the religious experiment also occurs within Islam.</seg>
<seg>The politization of Islam supplants the authority of the religious classes of Islam, the ulema.</seg>
<seg>As in Occident, the islamist religious experiment becomes more personal.</seg>
<seg>The interpretation of the religious texts by individual Moslems, including political militants, intellectuals and women, is a consequence among so many others.</seg>
<seg>Also let us quote the popularization of religious knowledge, the lesson of Coran being abused and being taken out of their context to support political objectives.</seg>
<seg>Who decides from now on what is legitimate and of what is illicit in Islam?</seg>
<seg>Who has the sufficient authority to interpret the religious texts?</seg>
<seg>Who can emit a fatwa or declare the “jihad”?</seg>
<seg>Nowadays, activism and terrorism offer, or rather impose, a source of legitimacy.</seg>
<seg>Thus laymen decide on what means or Islam does not mean, without the authority of the religious schools and specialized training.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the Islam of today is primarily interpreted by cultural political actors and movements, and not by religious institutions.</seg>
<seg>This desinstitutionalisation made it possible Islam to pass from the statute of local and national social link to that of creator of imaginary bonds between all the Moslems of the whole world who feel oppressed or moved.</seg>
<seg>Islamism can thus link members who were deeply divided: intellectual Moslems soufis and canonized Moslems of Shariat origin; Shiite Moslems and sunnites; preserving Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran.</seg>
<seg>Islam is also dynamic, its believers leaving the rural areas for the cities, including the Western cities.</seg>
<seg>Many regards this movement as negative and stresses that these individuals are socially uprooted and that they rock thereafter in alienation and, for some, terrorism.</seg>
<seg>But the social mobility also constitutes a prerequisite to create a modern prospect.</seg>
<seg>Obviously, the migration causes a feeling of distance among Moslems, if it is not a total rupture, of with their social origins.</seg>
<seg>Their religious experiment is thus new, private of theological, Community or public institutions.</seg>
<seg>The religious experiment becomes rather a form of social imagination within which they rebuild a feeling of membership of Islam in an at the same time new and strange environment.</seg>
<seg>It is not the distance from with the modern life, but the proximity with this life which starts a return towards the religious identity.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the large majority of radicalism appears in groups which, from their experiment of mobility and displacement, are familiar with the laic Western modes of political thought and urban life.</seg>
<seg>Disorientated by an unknown environment, these individuals hang up again themselves with the Islam which becomes their single support.</seg>
<seg>But so that this support functions, Islam must be released from its traditionally obséquieuse, passive and flexible attitude vis-a-vis modernity.</seg>
<seg>While wearing a veil or a beard, by asserting the right of obtaining places of prayer to work or the school and by requiring special food, the Moslems are identified openly like Musulmans.</seg>
<seg>They inform the whole world which they are more dedicated and more meticulous person in their religious observance that the individuals who confine their religiosity with the private life.</seg>
<seg>For example, non the Moslems generally consider the port of the veil as the sign of the depreciation and the inferiority of the Moslem women.</seg>
<seg>Of shame, it however became for the Moslems a sign of their positive assertion of an islamist identity.</seg>
<seg>The Moslem young women of Europe illustrate to perfection this transformation.</seg>
<seg>The young girls who adopt the scarf in the French and German schools are closer, under many aspects (namely, culture of the young people, the awakening of the mode and the language), their classmates that their mothers without instruction who are obliged to remain at the house.</seg>
<seg>By adopting the scarf for the European public sphere, these young girls change without wanting it the symbol and the role of the Moslem women.</seg>
<seg>This tendency goes well beyond the simple scarves.</seg>
<seg>All the Western Moslems have a double feeling of membership, a double cultural capital.</seg>
<seg>They are defined by their religiosity, but they also acquired universal laic knowledge.</seg>
<seg>Owing to the fact that they have this cultural capital doubles, they can circulate relatively freely between the various activities and spaces (residence, school, houses of young people and space for the urban leisures).</seg>
<seg>To be Moslem and be Islamiste are two different things.</seg>
<seg>We attend today the change of a Moslem identity for an islamist identity.</seg>
<seg>Ego religious for the individual Moslems passes from the kingdom deprived to the public kingdom.</seg>
<seg>The question which remains for each one is to know if this search of identity can be satisfied with scarves and a broad public acceptance with the islamist religious practice or if a positive assertion of Islam requires a more fundamental renunciation of modernity.</seg>
<seg>A new era for Islamic science?</seg>
<seg>During several hundred years, whereas science and mathematics knew one period of great inventiveness, an area of the world was distinguished from the others.</seg>
<seg>The Masters of these disciplines were révérés there, medicine advanced with great steps and people wondered about the operation of nature.</seg>
<seg>Nothing of surprising so that this area was universally respected.</seg>
<seg>In other half of the known world, the scientists were punished, even killed.</seg>
<seg>Mathematics, regarded as irreligious and foreign, was outlaw, and was controlled later to the religion.</seg>
<seg>The standard of living was low.</seg>
<seg>The area thrives was the Islamic Middle East, whereas ignorant Europe remained poor.</seg>
<seg>The two areas were controlled religieusement (the historians do not agree on the role and the nature of the religions in this context), but science opened out only in one of them.</seg>
<seg>Today, obviously, the roles of the Islamic Middle East and the Occident are reversed.</seg>
<seg>Since the second world war, the United States is the unquestioned world leaders in the field of sciences.</seg>
<seg>For all this period, the most brilliant students were attracted out of their countries of origin by the prospect for better opportunities for career and research.</seg>
<seg>Up to one recent period, more half of the graduate students of the superior in mathematics, sciences and engineering in the United States had been born abroad.</seg>
<seg>Many of these young talents remained after obtaining their diploma, and so much the industrial world which the government drew profit.</seg>
<seg>During this time, the Islamic culture entered a historical phase in which science was comparable with the influence of the Occident, and even flees for this reason.</seg>
<seg>Even in countries where the incomes of oil could feed a significant proportion of research, the Arab leaders did not encourage such investments, and the consequence is that their companies did not thrive as far as they could it.</seg>
<seg>Recently, an aspiration with a larger political respect pushed the Islamic nations to invest in the technological field, which is especially visible in the Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions.</seg>
<seg>But whereas of such weapons has a political weight, the science on which they rest is banal and old.</seg>
<seg>The respect resulting from visions maturely considered, rather than that born from discoveries passed, is much more significant.</seg>
<seg>Imagine the influence which would at the head have a Pakistani institute world research on cancer.</seg>
<seg>And would political rhetoric so change researchers in Oman discovered a means of making disappear the AIDS?</seg>
<seg>This opportunity does not arise for the moment.</seg>
<seg>But there are some another, which are not limited to the Islamic companies.</seg>
<seg>The United States made the serious falseone recently.</seg>
<seg>“Questions of faith” replaced science within the government, on the basis of the presidency.</seg>
<seg>Eminent researchers saw their reports/ratios modified by members of the political staff when the facts contradicted the official version.</seg>
<seg>Encouraged by an administration influenced by the religion, the school systems are diverting their teaching of sciences towards the “values.”</seg>
<seg>Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, the visas of entry are fewer and more difficult to obtain, which slows down the flow of young talents towards the American universities.</seg>
<seg>Large scientific organizations protested without result.</seg>
<seg>In same time, tax laws were revised to make in the short run the investors richer, discouraging the long-term investment in research.</seg>
<seg>One half-billion of dollars was devoted to the war in Iraq, a sum about equal to the financing of all the thousand last years basic research.</seg>
<seg>Even if the United States avoids a dark age of fundamentalism, they are clearly likely to lose their world domination in research topics.</seg>
<seg>Japan recognized the bond between political weight and science in the years 1980.</seg>
<seg>The principal Japanese industrialist, Akio Morita, chairman from Sony, and the politician of right-hand side Shintaro Ishihara, made a series of speeches which were compiled and published in 1986 pennies the title The Japan that Can Say No [Japan which can say not].</seg>
<seg>They outlined a national strategy in which the world influence would rise from the scientific power.</seg>
<seg>The principal idea is that the military power could be made obsolete if the “food chain” of military technologies were controlled by the other nations.</seg>
<seg>The title of the book refers to the project of Japan “to not say” to the American military influence once Japan will control principal military technologies.</seg>
<seg>To build an economy based on knowledge thanks to the richnesses resulting from oil is completely possible.</seg>
<seg>Texas for example, like the majority of the States of the south of the United States, was formerly economically poor and on the decline.</seg>
<seg>Even with oil incomes, the flow of dollars in the economy, in oneself, is not enough to instigate prosperity as much as one could believe it.</seg>
<seg>Texas thus decided to devote the money of oil to an equipment for education.</seg>
<seg>Today, this equipment is about equal to that of the university of Harvard, and it extends to 15 universities.</seg>
<seg>It had a confusing effect: aerospace industry almost disappeared from California, but it explodes in Texas.</seg>
<seg>The research centres and the consortia of telecommunications precipitated in Texas, to the Canadian giant of Nortel telecommunications.</seg>
<seg>Although industry undergoes a crisis in the United States, Texas has one of the most solid industrial economies of the world.</seg>
<seg>There is no reason that the same results cannot be reached in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>But above all, the Islamic world must redécouvrir and be reconciled with its proud heritage.</seg>
<seg>The Iranian Debate on Iraq</seg>
<seg>No country of the Middle East follows the events of the post-war period of Iraq of as close as Iran.</seg>
<seg>The geographical proximity, an intense history and forces of war with Iraq of Saddam Hussein, of religious and emotional connections with the Shiites of Iraq, a certain concern as for the United States and with their policy in the area: in fact there the wire link Iran with its Western neighbor.</seg>
<seg>Considering the tensions without end with America, Iran is particularly concerned by the possibility of a continuous American presence in its neighbor, like by the role dominating of America in the construction of the future of Iraq of after-Saddam.</seg>
<seg>The foreign observers can find difficult to follow the Iranian internal debates, however they exist, they are intense, even if they are not always visible for the international public in general.</seg>
<seg>One can release three general approaches in the Iranian debate in constant evolution on Iraq of after-Saddam.</seg>
<seg>The Iranian pragmatists support that Iran will have to inevitably cooperate with the United States in Iraq of after-Saddam, even if is only to make sure that the rights of the population Shiite of Iraq are respected.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, Iran should gain the insurance that the new Iraqi leader is not hostile and will seek for him to gain bilateral friendships.</seg>
<seg>Other essential considerations for the pragmatists relate to the safeguarding of the Iraqi territorial integrity and the repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.</seg>
<seg>They are the moderate ones which thinks that the Iranian government should insist at the United States to obtain the extradition of the members of the organization of Moudjahidins Khalq (MKO) based in Iraq, as well as the total dismantling of the organization.</seg>
<seg>In exchange, the Iranian government should offer its support to ensure peace, stability and safety in Iraq.</seg>
<seg>All in all, the pragmatists would like to limit the relations américano-Iranian women, concentrating them on a program which largely reflects interior concerns of Iran.</seg>
<seg>In general, the preserving forces of Iran support this approach.</seg>
<seg>Another approach proposes a more active and co-operative role for Iran in the rebuilding of Iraq.</seg>
<seg>The defenders of this position support that Iran is well placed to facilitate the rebuilding, because of its well established infrastructure of personal and institutional bonds with Iraq.</seg>
<seg>Finally, one thinks, the United States and the international community will recognize the value of the Iranian co-operation.</seg>
<seg>The Iranian co-operation should be rewarded by dismantling for the infrastructures for the MKO in Iraq, in exchange of an Iranian promise to perhaps attack the activities of Al-Qaida, like expelling the members of Al-Qaida of Iran.</seg>
<seg>Especially, Iran should invite the Americans to answer his co-operation with the insurance of a guarantee in return which Iran in the future does not become the target of American military actions.</seg>
<seg>In short, the defenders of the co-operation call their wishes an open and explicit market: the support of Iran to ensure the stability during the phase of current transition as its engagement to maintain cooperative relations with any permanent government which will emerge in Iraq in exchange of the improvement of the regional and international position of Iran.</seg>
<seg>This position is largely shared within the reforming movements in Iran, with the centre and outside the government, like by the technocratic class and of businesses whose orientation is more international.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, for the Iranian radicals, the possibility of a co-operation with the United States remains pure fantasy.</seg>
<seg>They are convinced that America only seeks to sap Iranian safety and to put in danger its national interests.</seg>
<seg>According to the radicals, the United States will at the very least seek to impose important changes on the Iranian foreign politics.</seg>
<seg>In the worst case, they declare, America will seek to impose a regime change in Iran in an active way.</seg>
<seg>It will militate with enthusiasm against the acquisition of nuclear knowledge and energy by Iran and could even try to weaken the military capacity of Iran as a whole.</seg>
<seg>The radicals perceive the American invasion of Iraq like the reflection of the American will to encircle Iran.</seg>
<seg>In return, they think that Iran must adopt an aggressive position in the defense of its interests, by forming strategic alliances with Russia and other capacities regional and use the Iranian influence in Iraq to prevent the formation of a government pro-American and anti-Iranian in Baghdad.</seg>
<seg>The partisans of the hard line of all edges support this approach.</seg>
<seg>The inversion of Saddam and her mode was only the easiest aspect of the Iraqi crisis.</seg>
<seg>Maintaining the hardest remainder to be made: to establish peace and safety, to gain the war against terrorism and to convince the Moslem masses that America does not intend to occupy Iraq to trap all its oil resources and to redraw the Middle East with its image.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile, the opposition against the United States, under the expression of suicide bombings to the bomb or other forms of terrorism, will make probably only grow.</seg>
<seg>Iran is intended to keep its determining position in the area thanks to its political dynamism and its Moslem identity whose echo resounds everywhere in the Muslim world.</seg>
<seg>What occurs in Iraq has major implications in Iran and the United States would make well find a means of recognizing this irrefutable fact.</seg>
<seg>The American threats, or the discussions on another war, feed the fire of the resentment and frustration in Iran, reinforcing the most radical movements.</seg>
<seg>If the United States wishes to avoid such effects, they must agree to limit their influence of his own radicals, by admitting that the American interests in Iraq are defended better through a co-operation with Iran.</seg>
<seg>An exit for Iraq</seg>
<seg>The situation in Iraq arrived from there at the point where everyone wishes the same thing openly: the departure of the forces of coalition.</seg>
<seg>The recent disclosure of a confidential note of the ministry for British Defense on the withdrawal of the troops comes to underline this aspiration.</seg>
<seg>The only question is to know how to satisfy it.</seg>
<seg>As long as the forces of the Coalition will remain, violence will do nothing but increase.</seg>
<seg>However, if they leave, the climbing of violence will take place nevertheless, and more quickly still.</seg>
<seg>The true question is to know how to manage to Iraq to organize an army and a police force with which one can make confidence to make respect the law and the order.</seg>
<seg>It remains much of way to make to approach this goal.</seg>
<seg>In spite of the courage of many Iraqis who join the rows of the police force or the army, that does not surprise anybody that some have motivations than pure less.</seg>
<seg>In the north of Iraq, one regulates of old accounts and the ethnic segregation is introduced in fact into certain traditionally mixed zones, like Irbil.</seg>
<seg>In other areas, the charia is imposed.</seg>
<seg>How Iraq can create bodies likely to make apply the law with effectiveness and impartiality, without consideration of ethnos group, religion nor of kind?</seg>
<seg>The traditional answer is to recruit, form, and inculcate the “good values.”</seg>
<seg>But there is no time.</seg>
<seg>Other means should be found.</seg>
<seg>In the absence of a system of value deeply enraciné, Iraq needs associations anchored in the civil society, at which organizes it and the army will have to return accounts.</seg>
<seg>They could take various forms, but most important is that they are really extended at the local level, and that they have the support of the authorities of the district, the area and the country when they announce abuses.</seg>
<seg>If a local monitoring is installation, is supplemented and recognized at the national level, then the majority of the members of the military forces and police will undoubtedly behave in an adapted way, and in the contrary case, it will be simpler to identify them and to manage them.</seg>
<seg>Such measurements can appear inordinately optimistic, and yet, in Afghanistan, a country which resembles Iraq under many aspects, of many groups work thus.</seg>
<seg>The Co-operation for Peace and Unity (CPAU) gives a model in the way of operating.</seg>
<seg>In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, the priority of ordinary people was to reduce violence.</seg>
<seg>The CPAU worked in all the country during the three last years to set up Committees of peace at the level of the districts, supported by the satellite Councils of peace in the villages.</seg>
<seg>This initiative faces a culture in which violence is so deeply anchored that the children, at one time, learned the arithmetic one by counting the dead Soviet soldiers.</seg>
<seg>The Committees thus tried to gather all the groups of the community, in particular the teachers, the leaders tribal, the religious leaders, the women, the police force, the judges and the business men, in order to conceive manners of solving the conflicts without violence.</seg>
<seg>Even if the Committees did not play officially a part of control until now (it is envisaged in the future), the simple fact that the police force, the army, and justice form of it part the met in contact with the remainder of the community, allows an information feedback, and contributes to the establishment of relationships of trust.</seg>
<seg>Certain results are remarkable.</seg>
<seg>In one of the workshops, the local military commander came to spend a few hours by courtesy, and ended up remaining all the week.</seg>
<seg>It left while being excused for its violent past and was committed disarming its private army of 2 000 men.</seg>
<seg>It returns today regularly visit to the offices of the Committee.</seg>
<seg>In Iraq, projects as Humanitarian Liaison Center de Kirkuk start to fulfill a function of monitoring by offering to the population with the various ethnos groups opportunity of exposing its complaints and of obtaining a help to solve its problems.</seg>
<seg>But, too often, even in the case of a lawsuit, the judgement is not applied because the victims yield to the threat.</seg>
<seg>The American and British forces have already well work to reinforce the civil society.</seg>
<seg>However, we do not hear of the workshops of emancipation of the women, or the success of the organization of local elections to small scales in the country.</seg>
<seg>To mobilize the civil society represents an enormous challenge, particularly when, as in Iraq, that must be done quickly and with large scales.</seg>
<seg>The military forces remain necessary, but very as much as the encouragements with disarmament, which can take the form of prospects for economic opportunities more profitable than the crime and the vol.</seg>
<seg>Extremely fortunately, such an organization of the civil society is as not very expensive as important.</seg>
<seg>Association Humanitarian Liaison Center treats any Kirkuk at an annual cost of 75 000 $US.</seg>
<seg>With 10 million dollars, one could set up a hundred centers of the same kind, and there would remain currency.</seg>
<seg>It is now a question of engaging in this direction, to support without failing the courageous people which take up the challenge to request accounts from the capacity.</seg>
<seg>Failing this, the Iraqi people are likely not to know the safety of which it hopelessly needs after so many years suffering.</seg>
<seg>Democracy on the Nile?</seg>
<seg>The surprised decision of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to propose an constitutional amendment authorizing the behaviour of direct and competitive presidential elections could extremely well constitute a step of giant for the democracy in Egypt and in the Arab world.</seg>
<seg>The Westerners accustomed to a pluralist democracy can have difficulties in include/understand which potentially considerable change this decision will generate in an accustomed country with the military reign since more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg>Under the current system, the Egyptian citizens can only appear the day of a presidential referendum organized every six years to say yes or not to the only name which is reproduced on the presidential ballot.</seg>
<seg>This explains why an individual such as Mubarak always received more than 90% of the voices, though in the middle of an indifferent rate of participation.</seg>
<seg>The strong men Syrian and Iraqi made still better with this system, undoubtedly because they required that the names and the addresses of the voters be placed at the bottom of each poll.</seg>
<seg>Several individuals support for a long time that democratization in the Middle East will not be able to progress as long as Egypt will not imply itself fully in the process.</seg>
<seg>Egypt could not really commit itself to democratization without initially amending its constitution, this in order to reduce the Pharaonic capacities of its president and to limit the duration of its mandate.</seg>
<seg>Mubarak, after all, in is already at its 24th year as a president.</seg>
<seg>Thus, its advertisement of competitive presidential elections constitutes a first major stage.</seg>
<seg>The mode can suppose that it will be able to use the process with its advantage, but the events could prove more difficult to control than envisaged once the citizens will start to feel responsabilized.</seg>
<seg>The democratic genius left the bottle.</seg>
<seg>In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this area disturbed to launch out on the way of the democracy.</seg>
<seg>Turkey on a side of the Middle East and Morocco of the other are already well engaged in this process.</seg>
<seg>The genuine ground swell seems this time to result from the temporal proximity and the positive tests of the recent elections which were held in Iraq, Palestine and, to a least degree, in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg>The demonstrations without precedent against the occupation of Lebanon by Syria following the assassination of its former Prime Minister, Rafiq Al-Hariri, do not seem to attenuate.</seg>
<seg>The Egyptian groups of opposition also organized increasingly courageous steps and other forms of civil disobedience during the last weeks.</seg>
<seg>The catalyst of their anger was the arrest and the detention of the leader of the sick opposition, Ayman Nour, at the end of January.</seg>
<seg>The arbitrary attitude of the government reinvigorated the national movement Kifaya (which means “Enough”), which required the end of the mode of Mubarak.</seg>
<seg>Suddenly, the popular wisdom which wants that the Egyptians are passive and are afraid to act more did not appear to be checked.</seg>
<seg>An alliance of local, regional and international forces is linked against the permanent tyranny exerted on banks of the Nile.</seg>
<seg>The recent wave of popular pressure seems to have shaken the mode.</seg>
<seg>Only one month before, Muybarak refused the demands of constitutional reform by taxing them with “futile”.</seg>
<seg>But, whatever the combination of events which brought this reversal, the initiative relating to the elections must be accomodated well.</seg>
<seg>It is a first stage necessary, although insufficient, to alter the stagnating political system of Egypt.</seg>
<seg>The Egyptians are wary already of the reforms symbolic systems to Tunisian, country in which president Zine El Abidin Bin Ali, which occupies his functions for a long time, created a caricature of constitutional amendment which appeared to open the way with competitive presidential elections, but which thereafter involved a show of contest with some “opponents” sorted on the shutter.</seg>
<seg>At the time of the preceding Tunisian presidential referendums, Bin Ali collected 99% of the voices systematically; it now obtained 96% from them.</seg>
<seg>Let us hope that Mubarak is more serious as for the electoral reform.</seg>
<seg>To prove its sincerity, it must order the immediate liberation of Ayman Nour and take measures to put an end to the 24 year old state of emergency, which prevents the organization of political campaigns successfully.</seg>
<seg>Mubarak must also approve a limit of two five years successive mandates for each president.</seg>
<seg>Quite as necessary, of the intended measures to gain the confidence of the citizens, in particular an access open and equal to the media, which are currently controlled by the State.</seg>
<seg>I announced that I intended to dispute this presidential election to come in order to begin the debate on these essential reforms.</seg>
<seg>But I will turn over with pleasure to my life of private citizen when I have the insurance of an free election and open the nearest autumn.</seg>
<seg>If they are seriously implemented, these stages will transform the heritage of Mubarak.</seg>
<seg>With the events which have occurred in Lebanon, in Iraq and Palestine, they could inaugurate an Arab spring of freedom very well, awaited since strong a long time.</seg>
<seg>Historical elections for Egypt?</seg>
<seg>The Egyptians will go to the ballot boxes on September 7 to elect a president among 10 candidates, of which Hosni Mubarak, with the capacity since 24 years.</seg>
<seg>If little doubts that he will be re-elected at the conclusion of the poll, much the stages with passion follow from there.</seg>
<seg>Some 6 000 national electoral observers were formed for the occasion, and from the hundreds of international observers will arrive in the country this week.</seg>
<seg>Although all the signs external of a true electoral competition are set up, it is striking that several signs of authenticity miss with the call.</seg>
<seg>In spite of the promises of the opposite, the conditions of play are far from being equitable.</seg>
<seg>Mubarak profits from a disproportionate number of advantages: recognition of the name, a quasi-monopoly of the electronic media controlled by the State and nothing less than 85 % written media.</seg>
<seg>One week before the poll, certain candidates of the opposition did not on the occasion yet to diffuse only one countryside on television Egyptian.</seg>
<seg>All the members of the presidential electoral commission are named by Mubarak, and the electoral new rules eliminated all the independent competitors.</seg>
<seg>Since 2000, a decision of the Supreme court stipulates that the 8 000 Egyptian judges must supervise the elections and to certify the results of them.</seg>
<seg>It is about a great step towards righter elections, because the trade union of the judges remained rather independent during the last half-century of seizure on the executive power.</seg>
<seg>The mode of Mubarak thus had to use various subterfuges to neutralize the trade union of the judges.</seg>
<seg>One of them was to stretch the definition of “legal” to include there thousands of employees graduate in right, without experiment at the court but faithful to the government.  That leaves little margin to truths judges, because if they protest by boycotting their work of observation, the task will be allocated once more to the police force of the infamous ministry for the Interior.</seg>
<seg>Thus, in the past, the trade union of the judges discharged his task, with foreseeable results.</seg>
<seg>At the time of the parliamentary elections of 2000, whereas the party in power of Mubarak received only approximately 38% of the voices in the zones supervised by truths judges, the results succeeded in culminating to 86% when the almost-judges were in charge of the observation.</seg>
<seg>This year promises to be very different.</seg>
<seg>At spring, the judges held an assembly of width national and solved that unless the government does not grant a total independence to them and the exclusive monitoring of the process of the elections, they would not control the presidential ballot (or member of Parliament) to come.</seg>
<seg>On September 2, they exposed their ultimate requirement: the mode must authorize civil groups to observe the course of the elections, to stop modifying the definition of the legitimate judges with an electoral aim, and to accept that no ballot box leaves the presence of a legitimate judge without its contents being counted, are certified and deferred.</seg>
<seg>For the moment it seems that the situation is without exit, because the chief of the presidential electoral commission announced publicly on television Egyptian that he refused any observation by the citizens of the course of the elections.</seg>
<seg>Among the interesting developments, the day before the poll, is reproduced a surging public debate on the topic: is it necessary to boycott the election or to go to vote?</seg>
<seg>Many opposition parties invited their members to abstain from to protest against restrictive electoral rules which strongly support Mubarak.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the Muslim brothers, considered as formant the only group of opposition having weight in Egypt, push their partisans to be voted according to their conscience but not to support any “controlling despotic and corrupted.”</seg>
<seg>It has been an implicit but clear repudiation of Mubarak, only Head of State for 24 years.</seg>
<seg>Some 34 organizations of the civil society prepare thousands of young Egyptians to supervise the elections in spite of the reiterated governmental objections.</seg>
<seg>These groups advance that if the mode does not intend to fake the elections, then the presence of national and international observers should not pose problem.</seg>
<seg>The answer of the mode consists in saying that any external monitoring is an interference in Egyptian sovereignty, and that national observers would constitute an affront with the integrity of the judges.</seg>
<seg>This last argument quickly fell when the trade union of the judges decided in favour of the observers of the civil society.</seg>
<seg>That the mode of Mubarak is frightened voices of the interior and outside which put it at the challenge to organize free elections and right, or which it is simply unable to remove the cheating within the party so much it became inherent in its operation, the current signs do not predict anything good as for the poll of next Wednesday.</seg>
<seg>While waiting, for the first time the Egyptians make the exciting experiment of the challenge to tyranny, and benefit from a very new space of freedom.</seg>
<seg>The European desire of the dollar</seg>
<seg>The currencies can play a crucial role not only in the commercial transactions, but also in the diplomatic and political arguments.</seg>
<seg>When that occurs, the commercial transactions become more difficult and prone to a greater uncertainty.</seg>
<seg>The politization of the money at the time of the depression of the inter-war period appeared devastator economically.</seg>
<seg>But of violent wars of the currencies were held more recently.</seg>
<seg>During years 1960, the order international currency became the object of a keen political struggle.</seg>
<seg>Each protagonist had appreciably different theories and explanations on the situation.</seg>
<seg>Europeans, and particularly the French, complained about what the Charles de Gaulle general described as “exorbitant privilege” of the American dollar.</seg>
<seg>The general and his monetary guru, Jacques Rueff, supported that the United States used the statute of the dollar as currency of major reserve of the fixed mode of foreign exchange rate of Bretton Woods in order to manage the deficits and to pay their military adventurism abroad (at that time in Vietnam).</seg>
<seg>France reacted while calling to a monetary reform which would put an end to the particular role of the dollar and tried ressusciter the largely discredited gold standard.</seg>
<seg>Europeans started a long discussion on the advantages of the monetary union, whose realization would enable them to compete with the dollar.</seg>
<seg>But from the American point of view, the international role of the dollar was a trap.</seg>
<seg>Other countries could change their foreign exchange rates and could thus maintain a greater competition on the level of exports.</seg>
<seg>The US government appeared impotent vis-a-vis a underestimated yen, feeding the belief which the rest of the world used the dollar to tackle the base of manufacture of America.</seg>
<seg>The Nixon administration concluded that the only means to save the US economy consisted in beginning in a monetary unilateralism (a so spectacular monetary expansion that the other countries would be forced to adjust their foreign exchange rates).</seg>
<seg>These battles forgotten for a long time seem suddenly very present again.</seg>
<seg>The world does not lay out more than one mode of foreign exchange rate fixes, but the dollar remains the currency of major reserve, a kind of Bretton Woods floating.</seg>
<seg>For the Americans, the role of reserve of the dollar constitutes a potential threat while for non the Americans, it would act rather of another example of American néo-imperial search for hegemony.</seg>
<seg>During this decade, China took the place of Japan of the years 1960, preventing its foreign exchange rate from going up in order to push the growth of exports.</seg>
<seg>That made of it the target of the American recriminations as for an unfair competition and to efforts aiming at imposing an adjustment of foreign exchange rate likely to dissuade the Americans to buy toys, apparatuses and clothing Chinese.</seg>
<seg>The American manufacturers estimated that the bras made in China threatened the American lifestyle.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile, Europeans (and particularly French) complain about the enormous US deficits and the argument about de Gaulle affirming that the rest of the world pays for the wars of America east again to the mode.</seg>
<seg>Certain Europeans suggest that the Asian central banks should hold a larger part of their reserves in euros, an echo of the unfruitful attempt of the general to make capitulate America by selling dollars against gold.</seg>
<seg>Years 1960 ended by a collapse of the “system” and in a major financial agitation, accompanied by a vague inflationist of the prices of goods.</seg>
<seg>Each and everyone was touched and the role of America on the world scene was shaken.</seg>
<seg>A similar collapse at present should have an appreciably different effect.</seg>
<seg>The system of current rate floating is more stable and the differently distributed costs of adjustment.</seg>
<seg>The majority of the Americans do not suffer much from the marked fall of the dollar because the foreign salesmen must carry out adjustments of the prices for the US market.</seg>
<seg>The Asian economies development vigorously and their central banks to their are pressed on the United States.</seg>
<seg>They should continue this policy not to see their sectors export to undergo a sudden failure on the capital US market.</seg>
<seg>The United States will have thus more time to treat a deficit of the accounts - currents which will not appear viable on the long run.</seg>
<seg>The areas economically dynamic of the world (North America and Asia) are thus bound by a pact which will guarantee the continuity of the centrality of the American dollar.</seg>
<seg>The Americans will continue to accumulate debts because the Asian ones encourage there.</seg>
<seg>The abrogation of the pact would be contrary with the interest of the two parts.</seg>
<seg>It is not a question of an American unilateralism because the pact implies a collaboration with Asia.</seg>
<seg>But for Europeans, who are excluded from the pact, this pact resembles a monetary and economic unilateralism.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile, the supremacy of the euro on the dollar makes suffer the European industrial exporters.</seg>
<seg>Europe is not however able to relieve them.</seg>
<seg>Europe will indeed represent the largest victim of the new confrontations of currencies.</seg>
<seg>The answers forecast in the years 1960 (re-establishment of the gold standard or invention of a common European currency) do not seem any more very useful.</seg>
<seg>A single currency did not make it possible to provide a consequent protection.</seg>
<seg>The old version of the European reaction (what the psychologists call “the desire of the dollar”) will become only more penetrating.</seg>
<seg>The European Central bank will be invited to extend the monetary base, as if the imitation of the dollar constituted the answer to all the industrial problems, structural and demographic which invade Europe.</seg>
<seg>But us should remember that the problems of Europe do not come from the handling of the currencies.</seg>
<seg>The protests against the new version of the exorbitant monetary privilege of America must be considered for what they are: a means allowing to compensate for real European impotence.</seg>
<seg>The desire of the dollar is not thus ready to disappear and it will be accentuated, the international value of the dollar disappearing without causing obviously harmful effects on the people who print it and use it.</seg>
<seg>An epidemic of policy</seg>
<seg>The Americans, like the citizens of all the countries of the world, managed from there to accept the fact that the policy plays a big role in the nomination of certain kinds of public representatives.</seg>
<seg>Little among us is surprised (although some can be disappointed) when a federal judge or a diplomat senior is named because it made a success of a crucial test of fidelity to an important principle with the eyes of the party of the president or Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg>But science, in everyone's opinion, occupies a special place and on this point, the United States starts to be used as example of warning for the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg>The scientific nominations must rest on objective criteria of formation, competence and performance.</seg>
<seg>Obviously, it is legitimate to question a future secretary with Health and the human Services (HS) on its sights on the abortion.</seg>
<seg>But it is completely moved to subject the candidates selected to sit in scientific advisory committees with tests of political honesty.</seg>
<seg>In the same way, the membership at organizations examining the scientific proposals, a fundamental process for scientific progress, would have without any doubt being freed from all the barriers which are without relationship with the professional qualifications.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, the scientists in the United States more and more often run up against these barriers.</seg>
<seg>During the last fall, the Science review published several reports on the question.</seg>
<seg>One of these reports related to the massive replacement of the members of the advisory committee of the National centre for the environmental health, which belongs to the Center of prevention and control of diseases (CDC), without preliminary consultation of the director of the center.</seg>
<seg>Similar cases also were observed in Advisory Committee one Lead Poisoning and Prevention of the CDC, Advisory Committee one National Human Research Protections and Advisory Committee one Genetic Testing.</seg>
<seg>The current epidemic of ideology, in which the advisory committees dissolved then are reformed with novel members, and where the candidates are subjected to tests of honesty, seems exceeded with certain observers.</seg>
<seg>The representatives of the HS spoke about it like “practice equitably current”.</seg>
<seg>It is not a question of a current practice in America, or at least not until today.</seg>
<seg>In all the cases, the fact that the Bush Administration makes pass from the tests to the candidates to stations - keys in order to determine their compatibility with his “values” is not really worrying.</seg>
<seg>The development more alarming relates to the degree of importance of the ideological investigations, which are involved in fields up to that point immunized against this kind of handling.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the most revealing case in this growing political epidemic perhaps related to the rehandling of the membership of the section of study of the National Institute off Occupational Safety and Health, which evaluates the subsidies granted to the study of the wounds which have occurred on the work place.</seg>
<seg>The advisory committees could have been vulnerable to an occasional rehandling of this type in the past.</seg>
<seg>After all, they recommended the policies which the politicians take or not into account.</seg>
<seg>But sections of study?</seg>
<seg>In October 2002, Science published a leading article of David Michaels and several of his colleagues.</seg>
<seg>Several of them were former civils servant distinguished having taken part in some from the committees concerned and they brought an invaluable point of view to the question, based on their personal experience.</seg>
<seg>Their article constituted a business in itself, but the consequences which it had were even more interesting.</seg>
<seg>It started a flight of letters in which the scientists evoked similar experiments.</seg>
<seg>A candidate in Muscular Dystrophy Research Coordinating Committee of the National institute of health told that a survey had been carried out into it by a member of the White House.</seg>
<seg>After being invited to evoke its opinions on the various policies of the Bush Administration, of which none among it had bond with the work of the committee, it had to indicate if it supported the policy of the president on the embryonic original cells.</seg>
<seg>Another person to be itself expressed, a professor distinguished in psychiatry and psychology told to have received a call of the White House concerning her nomination with the National Council one Drug Abuse.</seg>
<seg>Its interlocutor declared to him that it was to make an investigation into him in order to “determine if its opinions could embarrass the president”.</seg>
<seg>According to the professor, series of questions followed, the representative of the White House holding a card of notation.</seg>
<seg>Example: “You obtained two out of three; the president is opposed to the exchange of the needles [for the users of intravenous drugs] for reasons morals, whatever the result. ”</seg>
<seg>Then the conversation took a turn even more alarming.</seg>
<seg>The representative asked the candidate if he had voted for Bush and, after having received a negative answer, he asked: “Why didn't you support the president? ”</seg>
<seg>This attitude is connected with a dictatorship, and not with a democracy.</seg>
<seg>The objective of the scientific advisory committees is to bring councils impartial and considered to the political process.</seg>
<seg>There is nothing to gain, and to lose much, when a desired political result is proposed.</seg>
<seg>This is why the determination of the research projects to be supported was always a question having to be examined objectively by pars, and not by politicians.</seg>
<seg>In fact, the law which applies here (the law on the federal advisory committees, Federal Advisory Committee Act) requires explicitly that the committees be impartial and “not influenced in an inappropriate way by the authority holding the capacity of nomination”.</seg>
<seg>The American secretary with Health and the human Services Tommy Thompson and the personnel office of the White House should show the example with the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg>They can reach that point very easily: by respecting the law.</seg>
<seg>Murder in Moscow</seg>
<seg>It is time to put a term at the fiction according to which the “dictatorship of the law” of Vladimir Poutine returned Russia post-Communist so much oneself little more respectful of the laws.</seg>
<seg>The murder of Anna Politkovskaïa, one of the journalists among best and most courageous of Russia, a woman who dared to put at the day the brutal murders made by the Russian soldiers as Chetchnia, is the ultimate proof that president Putin directs only one banal dictatorship being proof of the ordinary contempt with regard to the law.</seg>
<seg>It is time for the rest of the world to recognize it, particularly for Europe.</seg>
<seg>The German ministry of the Foreign affairs prepares a policy on the relations between Russia and Germany, which should ratify the indifference with the lack of respect of the law expressed by Putin like national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>But the indifference becomes conciliation when she encourages Putin to continue on this way in the international arena, as its current countryside shows it aiming at strangling Georgia economically.</seg>
<seg>The murder of Politkovskaïa has a disaster taste of already-considering: just like during the days of glory of the KBG, in Russia of Putin people disappear, quite simply.</seg>
<seg>The assassination of Politkovskaïa is the third apparently political murder in three week.</seg>
<seg>Enver Ziganshin, chief engineer of BP Russia, was killed by ball with Irkoutsk on September 30 last.</seg>
<seg>Andrei Kozlov, vice-governor of the central bank of Russia which conducted a campaign against the financial fraud, was assassinated on September 14.</seg>
<seg>The fact that the public prosecutor of Russia Iouri Tchaïka takes the investigation into the murder of Politkovskaïa in hand, as it did for that of Kozlov, is not source of hope, as it would be the case in a true democracy if a so senior official implied himself in an investigation.</seg>
<seg>In fact, an implication of the more high levels of the government in Russia is practically an insurance which the murderer will never be found.</seg>
<seg>The murder of Politkovskaïa is a particularly sinister omen when the fact is considered that it emitted virulent criticisms at the place of the Russian president.</seg>
<seg>In its articles for one of some newspapers still independent of Moscow, Novaïa Gazeta, and in its books “Russia of Putin: life in a failing democracy” and “a dirty war: a Russian journalist as Chetchnia” Politkovskaïa commented on the suppression of freedoms which signs the presidency of Putin.</seg>
<seg>As shows it the fate of the former exiled business men Boris Berezovski and Vladimir Gusinki, and that of the oil tycoon imprisoned Mikhaïl Khodorkovski, the destiny of the enemies of Putin can take three forms: the exile, the prison or fall it.</seg>
<seg>I am not showing the government of Putin to have ordered the murder of Politkovskaïa.</seg>
<seg>After all, as a journalist of investigation in shift, it has mad much other people in addition to Putin, among which current the Prime Minister tchetchene Ramzan Kadyrov is not the least, that it showed to carry out a policy of removals against ransoms.</seg>
<seg>But even if the associates of Vladimir Poutine had nothing to do with the murder by ball of Politkovskaïa in an elevator of its building of the center of Moscow, its contempt of the law created the climate in which the murder was perpetrated.</seg>
<seg>With the image of the murder of Thomas Beckett in his cathedral of Canterbury there is many centuries, the crime was made with the clear conviction that the king of it would be satisfied.</seg>
<seg>Being given what Politkovskaïa represented - the responsibility for a democratic press to call in question the Kremlin and its policies - the government should have made sure that it would arrive to him nothing.</seg>
<seg>Russia of Putin already lost 12 eminent journalists, assassinated during the six last years.</seg>
<seg>None of these crimes was elucidated, which would not be the case if the “dictatorship of the law” of Putin were other thing that a simple strategy of public relations.</seg>
<seg>The six years which were passed since the arrival of Vladimir Poutine to the Kremlin were remembered by deeply contradictory signals.</seg>
<seg>On a side, the world sees a young graduate leader committing himself to modernize Russia, and particularly aligning the application of the law and the practices legal on the international standards.</seg>
<seg>On other side, the president is satisfied to look without anything to say whereas his/her former colleagues of the Russian security services of FSB (the old KGB) do not protect absolutely those which are made assassinate, and even launch a series of businesses of espionage sadly famous against ecological journalists, scientists and activists.</seg>
<seg>Among these “néo-spies” appear the journalist Gregori Pasko, the expert in control of the weapons Igor Soutiagine, the diplomat Valentine Moiseïev, the physicist Valentine Danilov and well of others.</seg>
<seg>The influence supposément civilizing that the fact implies of being a Western partner, chairing a top of G8 Saint Pétersbourg, for example, seems to count for nothing in the cabal the Kremlin Putin.</seg>
<seg>Once more, the contact with the values of the Occident gave rise to another Potemkine village; Russia presents a frontage of laws and rules democratic, but behind this paste board decoration they are the same ones butt arbitrary which makes the law.</seg>
<seg>On a world level, the danger is that the non-observance of the laws expressed by Putin is exported.</seg>
<seg>Close to the Russian borders, a form of criminalized diplomacy is in the train of enraciner.</seg>
<seg>Think of the way in which Putin tried to fake the elections in Ukraine, and of the charges without ceases carried and withdrawn against the leader of the opposition Ioulia Timochenko.</seg>
<seg>Consider the areas secessionists playing the franc-tireurs in Moldavie and Georgia, which exist only because they have the support of the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg>Look at as the Kremlin seeks to make sing its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies.</seg>
<seg>All the police officers know that when one is unaware of the behaviors of the criminals, those only become more daring about it.</seg>
<seg>It is more than time that the world recognizes Vladimir Poutine for what it is: a man who brings back Russia to the country of the shades.</seg>
<seg>The world must today contemplate this old Latin maxim which tacet consentere videtur: silence gives consent, and to wonder whether it is really wise to quietly grant construction by Putin of a super power of energy where the law does not count.</seg>
<seg>A gas pipeline to reinforce the Empire of Russia</seg>
<seg>Gerhard Schröder who, it there has less than one month, was still German chancellor agreed to become President of the company in charge of construction D `a gas pipeline connecting Russia to Germany through the Baltic and Western Europe.</seg>
<seg>In many countries, Schröder would be easily shown offence of conflict of interest.</seg>
<seg>Its apparent moral failure is amplified by the fact that at the same time, Russia threatens to stop the gas supply of the Ukraine if this one does not yield to the tariff requirements of Gazprom, the gas giant property of State of the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg>The strategic objective of Russia is obvious. Currently, not to more distribute a gas to the Ukraine also means that good part of Europe will not be supplied any more, because the majority of the large gas pipelines cross the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg>By sailing round the Baltic Ukraine, Poland and, of course, States, the new gas pipeline will reinforce the influence of the Kremlin which again seeks to be essential in the area.</seg>
<seg>President Vladimir Poutine and his government of clones of the ex-KGB will not have any more to worry about the reactions of Western Europe when they decide with which firmness to make pressure on the neighbors post-Communists of Russia.</seg>
<seg>Should Europe really equip Putin with such a weapon imperialist?</seg>
<seg>Worse still, does Russia have to use this weapon to put the EU at her energy boot?</seg>
<seg>That a former German chancellor takes the management of the firm which will provide to Russia the means of handling the European economy testifies to the dangerous sufficiency of Europe vis-a-vis the ambitions neo-imperialists of Putin.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the Russian media are conscious of the growing dependence of Europe by reports/ratios to the energy resources of Russia.</seg>
<seg>They go until of délecter. Russian leader-writers wrote “When we integrate and amplify our energy trade with Europe, it will have to keep silence on the question of the human rights. ”</seg>
<seg>Putin expresses this position in a more oblique way while being committed continuing than it calls a “policy of independence. ”</seg>
<seg>Thus, wants he simply to say that Russia must remain “independent” of the concerns of the Western democracies concerning ethics and the human rights.</seg>
<seg>It may be that some European leaders really believe that the maintenance of the soft prosperity of the EU justifies that one keep silent oneself about the human rights and other topics which annoy the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg>Of course, we must briefly express us on the “commercial” questions, like the expropriation of Yukos. However, if the Kremlin came to monnayer our values or our critical spirit in its connection -- as about Chetchnia ensanglantée -- it would seem that Europeans would prefer to keep silent themselves to face a potential rise of the energy prices or even a blockade, as that with which the Ukraine is currently confronted.</seg>
<seg>While at the same time Putin its court reorganizes, by subjecting the Duma to its will, the hopes of the EU to see Russia becoming more and more “European” should be abandoned.</seg>
<seg>Russia that Putin is building is transformed little by little. She forsook her hopes of freedom post-Soviet to become an oil and gas rampart favorable to the new elite of the ex-KGB.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, Matthias Warnig, the director of the consortium of the gas pipeline chaired by Schröder, is an old friend of Putin.</seg>
<seg>A little earlier in the year, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Warnig, the director of the Russian arm of Dresdner Bank, is an ex-officer of Stasi, the former secret police of East Germany, and that it met Putin at the end of the years 1980 whereas the Russian President was spy of the KGB in GDR.</seg>
<seg>That the Russians accept a formed government of former men of the KGB, for which the lack of compassion and the refusal of dissidence are the rule, their exhaustion towards the twenty last years reflects tumult.</seg>
<seg>Now, the Kremlin estimates that what is good for the basic Russians is also for the citizens of the independent nations. No pity will be granted to the small weak countries once Russia will hold the means of intimidating them, to isolate them and to threaten them from energy blockade.</seg>
<seg>As a former Head of State of independent the Lithuania news, I was often confronted with such threats.</seg>
<seg>The European Union signed many agreements with Russia, including concerning a “common space” of freedom and justice.</seg>
<seg>The Kremlin is very strong to pretend such an idealism.</seg>
<seg>Its control on Eastern Europe was always imposed on the basis of treaty “of friendship” and the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were “fraternal” missions.</seg>
<seg>But, look at how Putin ridicules this “common” space: a barbarian treatment of Tchétchènes, imprisonment of the business man Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the harassing of ONG foreign and the charge of Yuliya Tymoshenko, one of the egeries of the Orange revolution, by the Russian military judges on completely invented loads.</seg>
<seg>If Europeans believe sincerely in their common space of the human rights and freedoms, they must nevertheless recognize that these values are not shared by the henchmen calculators of Putin.</seg>
<seg>It is the same as regards regarding Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg>Is it really conceivable that the fatherland of “red Terror”, innumerable unpunished crimes of the Soviet era and still dirty hands of the blood of the Lithuanians to the Caucasians can really help to fight the world threat held up by Iran and the North Korea?</seg>
<seg>It seems more probable than the cold spirits of the Kremlin will be satisfied to exploit each crisis to increase their capacity of destruction and their influence.</seg>
<seg>During decades, the area of Europe from where I come was left at mercy evil.</seg>
<seg>This is why I cannot remain quiet when Europe stumbles blindly in a new appeasing.</seg>
<seg>We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, learned from our history that behind each diplomatic act of Russia an ambition imperialist is hiding place.</seg>
<seg>Europeans of the West, who forgot this history, should take account of our warning statements.</seg>
<seg>Dependence compared to Russia -- even if it takes the face of supposedly “charismatic” Gerhard Schröder -- right in the wall can only lead us.</seg>
<seg>Iraq: balls against ballot papers</seg>
<seg>When the war in Iraq began in 2003, the Bush administration cherished ambitious projects: with the image of Germany and Japan post-1945, long and peaceful occupation was considered, during which the increase in the production of oil would ensure an at the same time growing prosperity as the democratic structures would be built item by item.</seg>
<seg>The base was to be about it a liberal constitution, even post-modern, with precedes of it the guarantee of 25 % of parliamentary seats ensured the women.</seg>
<seg>Current Iraq knows neither peace, nor prosperity.</seg>
<seg>The constitution which must be voted next on October 15 includes this rule of 25 %, but does not have anything liberal.</seg>
<seg>The provision-key (article 2) stipulating that no law can contradict “the uncontested laws of Islam” violates the basic principles of parliamentary sovereignty, and will prevent the legislation from corresponding to the international standards.</seg>
<seg>For example, the age of the assent to the sexual relations for the girls cannot be high above nine years, because Mahomet itself had a nine year old wife.</seg>
<seg>It results from this that some nine year old young girls are also adult compared to the criminal law, and passable of the capital punishment for, for example, conversion with another religion.</seg>
<seg>The Shiites can use this clause to place their ayatollahs above the elected Parliament, as in Iran, because they only are authorized to determine the “laws” of Islam.</seg>
<seg>The Iraqi foreigners and the few liberals worry especially about this about Islamic clause, but the opposition to the constitution, largely widespread at the sunnites, aims at other provisions: the exclusion of the “party saddamist Baath” of the political life and the government, and the federalistic clauses which grant autonomy to the 18 Iraqi provinces and enable them to join in regional governments.</seg>
<seg>The law of exclusion is a personal problem for the elites sunnites, which include/understand thousands of business men, liberals, even of artists, who, with some exceptions, were all members of Baath.</seg>
<seg>In theory, constitutional prohibition could not be retroactive.</seg>
<seg>But in practice, the administrative laws are today implemented to exclude the members from the Baath be-saying “of high ranking” of any form of employment to the government, which relates to thousands of people.</seg>
<seg>The sunnites would undoubtedly accept the federalistic provisions if they applied only to the Kurds.</seg>
<seg>They know that the alternative is not a return to the centralism, but the Kurdish secession of the three provinces with a majority of Dahuk, Arbil and As Sulaymaniyah to form independent Kurdistan, with its own ministry for Finances, its army (Pesh Merga), and its production of oil around Kirkuk, larger second holds of Iraq.</seg>
<seg>The sunnites reject this same federalism for the Shiites because they regard them as Arab compatriots who always accepted the law sunnite in the past and which will do it again, unless they do not have their own government.</seg>
<seg>It is what the new constitution would allow, because the provinces of the south - which have the principal Iraqi crude oil reserves - with Shiite majority could form their own regional government.</seg>
<seg>In the usual style of the Middle East, leaders sunnites disappointed and dissatisfied with the constitution threaten from now on to use of violence.</seg>
<seg>But the federalism is not the only reason for which the partisans of supremacy sunnite and the islamist ones launch attacks mortals.</seg>
<seg>Their opposition is more elementary: they do not accept the principle of the democratic government by the majority.</seg>
<seg>In the place, they seek to restore the reign of the minority sunnite.</seg>
<seg>For the islamist ones, all the Shiites deserve death in any event, as apostates.</seg>
<seg>A Shiite leader, Moqtada Sadr, are him also opposed with vehemence to the federalism.</seg>
<seg>Its partisans, mainly illiterate, are poorest and more the Shiite violent ones of the shantytowns of Baghdad and beyond, whose “militia mahdi” fought the American troops in 2004, even whereas the Americans protected the Shiites from the attacks sunnites.</seg>
<seg>As a young priest deriving his authority from his father, an ayatollah deceased  populist itself, Sadr must face the opposition of the alive Iraqi ayatollahs, who scorn his ignorance and his violence.</seg>
<seg>Sadr cannot absolutely compete with them in terms of religious authority, it thus chooses to take a party Arab-nationalist against them, often recalling that most Shiite religious dignity, the Ayatollah Sistani, is not Arab but Persian.</seg>
<seg>Same manner, it recalls to its partisans that El Hakim, which directs the Supreme council of the Islamic revolution to Iraq (SCIRI) and their militia “Badr” were exiled subsidized in Iran, from which much fought Iranian side during the long one and bitter Iran-Iraq war, until the Americans “bring back them.”</seg>
<seg>Sadr opposes the federalism because a Shiite regional government would obey its enemies, Sistani and the SCIRI, and, affirms it, would fall under the Iranian aegis.</seg>
<seg>To underline her message, Sadr sent her men to fight the Badr militia, successfully in Baghdad, where the mahdis are numerous, but not in Najaf, where Sadr is haï after the destruction which it caused last year until its men are massacred by the Americans.</seg>
<seg>It was already rather difficult to face Sadr the gangster.       Now, a simple political calculation leaves think that he will be undoubtedly the principal character to decide exit of the vote of the constitution of October.</seg>
<seg>To reject the constitution and to cause new elections of a constitutional assembly, the opponents need a majority of two thirds in at least three provinces.</seg>
<seg>The sunnites are likely to carry it only in two provinces, but if Sadr orders with her partisans shantytowns of Baghdad to vote not with the local sunnites, that will undoubtedly make fall the capital to the hands from the opponents to the constitution and will ensure his defeat.</seg>
<seg>Like any political hooligan, Sadr is naturally to sell.</seg>
<seg>Last year it was required for murder.</seg>
<seg>Today he seeks a recognition as a statesman, he wants money, and, at least implicitly, the humiliation of Sistani and SCIRI.</seg>
<seg>It can very receive proposals, and the negotiations perhaps even already started.</seg>
<seg>But some of the Shiites whom it attacks with words and balls have thousands of men armed at their disposal and for them, it deserves to receive only balls in return.</seg>
<seg>End of the secrecy</seg>
<seg>The transparency is not always an easy exercise in the new democracies of Eastern Europe. It is what Hungarian the Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany discovered, when a recording in which he acknowledged the lies of his government started riots.</seg>
<seg>Like Hungary, Romania post-Communist endeavoured to encourage the opening and honesty in a company which counted formerly among the most closed in the world.</seg>
<seg>But the persistence of a culture of the secrecy exploded the corruption and the abuses of power.</seg>
<seg>One however notices a true evolution towards more transparency, evolution recognized by the European Union which gave green light to Romania for an adhesion with the beginning of the year 2007.</seg>
<seg>In addition to the installation of what the EU holds today for a “operational market economy”, essential reforms in the political arena and legal, of which I have the load, go from the reinforcement of the transparency and the control of the financing of the political parties to the reorganization of the legal system.</seg>
<seg>The legal reforms contribute to uproot corruption.</seg>
<seg>Ministers and former ministers, members of Parliament, magistrates, lawyers, and members of the police force, customs and other bodies public, as well as chiefs of private companies, were put in examination.</seg>
<seg>In addition, of new forms were developed for the declarations of assets and of financial interests by the people occupying of the official functions at the government, at the Parliament, in the public administration and local and the legal system.</seg>
<seg>The new methods of declaration are most detailed in Europe, and especially they are made public.</seg>
<seg>Progress of Romania is confirmed by a report/ratio published this month, according to which the citizens of Eastern Europe have from now on access to governmental information very as much as those of the established democracies of long time.</seg>
<seg>The report/ratio Transparency and Silence, of Open Society Justice Initiative (available on www.justiceinitiative.org), even states that the new democracies do sometimes better than the old ones: certain Rumanian governmental bodies more answer the information requests of the citizens that their French or Spanish counterparts.</seg>
<seg>More precisely, 60% of the requests are satisfied in Romania, against 31% in France and 24% in Spain.</seg>
<seg>Among the other good pupils, one can quote Peru and Mexico, two countries which adopted a legislation relating to the freedom of the information in 2002, shortly after Romania.</seg>
<seg>However, it is not increasingly easier to reach sensitive informations in the democracies of transition.</seg>
<seg>I worked as lawyer for the defense of the human rights within the Rumanian Helsinki Committee, and we often had to seize the courts to require the communication of information, under the terms of the Rumanian law of 2001 for the freedom of the information.</seg>
<seg>For example, when we officially obtained the access to data on the phone-tappings authorized by the public prosecutor, he quite simply was unaware of this decision.</seg>
<seg>We attacked it with the civilian, and the judge fixed a fine for each day of delay in the communication of information.</seg>
<seg>It is only when the media were interested in the business, that the data - many listenings authorized during the ten previous years, people concerned and duration of the operations - were made public.</seg>
<seg>Romania then finally started to turn the back on a past marked by the omnipresence of Securitate.</seg>
<seg>I form part of the government today, and I realize that it is not always obvious to share certain information with the public.</seg>
<seg>But it happens that painful reforms are essential.</seg>
<seg>We would not have carried out to good the economic reforms and policies which will enable us to enter the EU without subjecting our policies for the examination by the public and without accepting the increased participation of the citizens in the decision-making process which inevitably accompanies such an opening.</seg>
<seg>In fact, the access to information became an indispensable condition of the democracy everywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg>When the United States adopted Freedom off Act Information in 1966, they were only, with Sweden and Finland.</seg>
<seg>Today, 65 countries obtained such a legislation.</seg>
<seg>In Romania, those which fought for the adoption of a law on the freedom of the information draw party fully from it.</seg>
<seg>According to the study of Justice Initiative, the people who apply to the Rumanian government receive without much difficulty of information which it would have been unthinkable to communicate a few years ago.</seg>
<seg>Thus, the Rumanian ministry of Defense revealed the number of dead soldiers in 2003, as well as the circumstances (in particular 13 suicides, two deaths per ball, and two died with the combat in Afghanistan).</seg>
<seg>Another example, the court of Bucharest received a request concerning the number of judges having been the subject of a disciplinary proceedings since the beginning of the year 2000, and the reasons for the possible sanctions.</seg>
<seg>The court transmitted this request to the Superior council of the magistrature, which gave a complete answer: four pages enumerating all the sanctioned magistrates, the reasons and measurements taken.</seg>
<seg>This process is at the same time the fruit and the engine of the continuation of the reforms.</seg>
<seg>Controlling were not always very at ease with the opening, and the battle continues for the most sensitive documents.</seg>
<seg>But in communist in the past countries, the benefit of the transparency are undeniable.</seg>
<seg>However, the experiment of Romania shows that the official secrecy is always a threat, that no country is with the shelter, and that only a vigilance of every moment can prevent it from sapping the bases of the democracy.</seg>
<seg>To save the trees of the life</seg>
<seg>Nobody can finish his day without having used a derivative product of the forest.</seg>
<seg>In a measurement more important than one generally believes it, the paper on which one writes, the water which runs our taps, the drugs which look after us, drink whose our houses and our pieces of furniture all are made come from the forest.</seg>
<seg>The forests give us the fresh air which we breathe and shelter of the species in the process of disappearance.</seg>
<seg>They offer also places to us of leisures, which becomes increasingly more important in the complexity of our world.</seg>
<seg>Approximately 1,5 billion individuals living in the poor rural areas depend directly on the forests for their basic requirements in food and firewood.</seg>
<seg>However, deforestation continues.</seg>
<seg>Each year, we lose 14,6 million hectares of forest, that is to say a zone almost as large as four times Switzerland.</seg>
<seg>The irresponsible management of the forests, accentuated by too weak regulations and governmental obligations, and the markets which reward illegal demolition conspire all to deprive the world of its most threatened most invaluable forests and.</seg>
<seg>When the forests start to disappear, a whole whole of environmental, social and economic problems generally follow, which affect all in one way or another to us.</seg>
<seg>The island of Sumatra in Indonesia in is an good example.</seg>
<seg>The companies of pastes and papers undertake an endemic and illegal destruction forests which shelter the greatest diversity of plants in the world.</seg>
<seg>It is extremely probable that still unknown plants will disappear in the process just like the species in the process of disappearance such as the rhinoceros and the elephant of Sumatra, as well as the orang-outang.</seg>
<seg>When the forest of Sumatra disappears, of the whole communities will also find without suitable places of life nor any decent means to earn their living.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, the distortion that the trade of illegal products and products at a cheap rate imposes on the worldwide markets east causes difficulties for the responsible citizens.</seg>
<seg>The developing countries lose 15 billion USD tax incomes each year because of illegal demolition.</seg>
<seg>To complicate the whole, the demand for wood for the rebuilding, following the tsunami of last year, an already insupportable request with respect to the forests of Sumatra intensified.</seg>
<seg>The basins of the Amazon and Congo are the object of similar threats.</seg>
<seg>A recent study of the United Nations, the Evaluation of the ecosystems for millenium (EM), watch that the forests and other areas important know a serious decline because of their bad management and will continue to disappear so from the serious protection measures are not installation.</seg>
<seg>The information published by the Brazilian government shows that the deforestation of irreplaceable forests in Amazonia, because of agricultural conversions, reached 2,6 million hectares last year, which changes the total of the zone of deforestation of Amazonia to 17%.</seg>
<seg>However, the battle against deforestation is not lost yet.</seg>
<seg>Various organizations, movements of defense and companies worry about the state of the world forests work in concert to reverse the phenomenon of deforestation and to improve management of the forests.</seg>
<seg>Thus, for example, the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) and the World Bank helped the Brazilian government to launch an initiative intended to establish new protection zones of the forest on more than 17 million hectares in the form of national parks.</seg>
<seg>The co-operation of the WWF and the World Bank also motivated other partners to establish funds of special assignment to manage these protected areas with perpetuity.</seg>
<seg>In the same way, a meeting at the top of the leaders of the countries of the Basin of Congo allowed a transborder co-operation for the conservation of the forests and their enlightened management.</seg>
<seg>All that led thereafter to the releasing of 53 USD million on behalf of the State Department of the United States to promote the conservation of the forests of Congo.</seg>
<seg>Since the first meeting of the leaders in 1999,3,5 million hectares of protected areas were lately organized in the Basin of Congo.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, considering the consequences of the Asian tsunami of last December, the weight of the arguments provided by the EM and the statistics on the deforestation of the most critical areas, we must continue our efforts.</seg>
<seg>The World Bank and the WWF recently promised to work with the reduction of 10% of the world rate of deforestation for 2010 and to work with the institutions of the public sectors and deprived to allow ambitious achievements as regards conservation of the forests.</seg>
<seg>The studies of the WWF show that if the world forests are divided between various uses, of which the protection of certain zones, commercial management responsible and restoration for the forest landscapes, we will be able to provide for the world requirements in forest products while preserving the environmental and social values essential with our near future.</seg>
<seg>The managers of undertakings, the governments, the organizations of the civil society must all play their part in the realization of this vision.</seg>
<seg>Are the Saoudis fanatics?</seg>
<seg>The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia brought much to call in question the prospects for survival of the reigning House of Saud and to consider the question of knowing if the kingdom is basically dysfonctionnel and destructive or not.</seg>
<seg>For a reason or for another, it seems that the Saoudi company generated a current of violent fanaticism which draws its inspiration in an extreme religious orthodoxy.</seg>
<seg>The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers who took share with the attacks of September 11, 2001 against the United States were Saoudis crystallized a deeply anchored perception of the kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.</seg>
<seg>In certain connections, this perception is right, but it cannot be applied to the Saoudi population as a whole.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, it would be a serious error to suppose that fanatic Islamism entirely defines the Saoudi attitudes towards the religion.</seg>
<seg>Between 2001 and 2003, I belonged to a team charged to make a study with large scales of the values in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt, in Iran and Jordan.</seg>
<seg>Our results produced a surprisingly moderated image of the Saoudi attitudes.</seg>
<seg>By comparison with questioned people inhabitant of other countries of the Middle East, the Saoudis appeared less the monks of all in general, and their attitudes towards the arranged democracy and marriages also indicate a moderate subjacent feeling.</seg>
<seg>It is certain that in the four countries, the religiosity is spread, more than 90% of the questioned people stating collectively that they believe in a God, a life after death, and in the paradise and the hell.</seg>
<seg>But the Saoudis seem less monk than their Moslem co-religionists.</seg>
<seg>Sixty two percent of the Saoudis were described like religious individuals, against 82% of the Iranians, 85% of Jordanian and 98% of the Egyptians.</seg>
<seg>The Americans also seem to be more a monk that the Saoudis, with 81%.</seg>
<seg>This variation can be partly explained by transnational differences on the significance of the term “religiosity”.</seg>
<seg>For example, the Americans can define the religiosity differently inhabitants of the countries of the Middle East, with perhaps an attachment less pronounced with the religious beliefs than in the Islamic countries.</seg>
<seg>This could also give an account partly of the differences between the Moslem countries.</seg>
<seg>But the variation, between the Saoudis on a side and the Iranians, the Jordanian ones and the Egyptians of the other as regards religiosity autodéfinie, is so large that it defies the widespread perception of extremely preserving and religious Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the actions are more speaking that words: only 28% of the Saoudis declared that they witnessed weekly religious services, against 27% from the Iranians, 44% of Jordanian, 42% of the Egyptians and 45% of the Americans.</seg>
<seg>These conclusions, although opposites with popular perceptions of the Saoudi culture, are less surprising that they do not appear to with it.</seg>
<seg>The sociologists of the religion support for a long time that in a monolithic religious environment, or when the religious institutions are closely related to the State, the total religiosity of the population declines.</seg>
<seg>It is judicious to think that when the authorities of the State apply rigid behavioral codes, the individuals tend to rebel and to move away from the officially ratified religious institutions.</seg>
<seg>It is thus hardly astonishing but the Egyptians and the Jordanian ones, who live in countries in which the State does not apply piety, are more monk than the Iranians or the Saoudis, who must compose with the police force of local the “virtue” supported by the State.</seg>
<seg>Even on the question of the marriage, of many Saoudis expressed surprisingly liberal opinions.</seg>
<seg>The questioned people were divided almost in an equal way on the question of the arranged marriages, half supporting the idea that the marriage must be based on the parental assent, against 48% which considered the love as bases marriage.</seg>
<seg>Being given the segregation of the sexes and paternal predominance firmly anchored, this result seems to reveal a keen desire of individual choice more shown in what always was, traditionally, a family decision.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, the Saoudis appear keen partisans of the democracy, contradicting once again the widespread image of Saoudi conservatism.</seg>
<seg>On all the Saoudis questioned, 58% considered the democracy as the best shape of government which is, 23% were in disagreement and 18% did not express themselves.</seg>
<seg>The massive support in favour of the democracy in a country without secular and nationalist history seems against-intuitive.</seg>
<seg>In fact, the support for the democracy corresponds to several other liberal attitudes which we noted in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg>The partisans of the democracy tend to be less monks, more secular, more tolerant towards others, more critical of the actions of the public sector, and more anxious by the Western cultural invasion.</seg>
<seg>Beyond the data of the study, the history showed that the liberal ideas become more widespread when a despotic monarch controls with the support of a religious institution.</seg>
<seg>A fort running of liberalism appeared at the end of the ninth century in Othoman Syria in answer to the religious despotism of the Abdulhamid sultan.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, a secular movement anticlerical in the name of the constitutionnalism made its appearance in Iran, reaction to alliance absolutist between the Shahs Quajar and the religious institution.</seg>
<seg>In the light of the similarities between these preceding histories and the current conditions in Saudi Arabia, do not should draw aside the possibility of reform to us.</seg>
<seg>The data of the study also suggest that the Saoudis could require very well a more transparent policy and a religion minus interventionist.</seg>
<seg>The European museum</seg>
<seg>At the end of the XIXe century, Asia represented for Europeans an artistic source of inspiration or the target of ambitions imperialists.</seg>
<seg>Contrary, Europe was a symbol of modernity - for the Japanese of the Meiji era -- or of decline -- for the Chinese.</seg>
<seg>One century later, thanks to the Japanese economic miracle, Europeans regarded at least a small portion of Asia as a center of technological advancement and industrial fast.</seg>
<seg>Today, at the dawn of XXIe century, mutual perceptions of Europe and Asia are changing radically, with flourishing Asian economies and an European Union in full identity crisis.</seg>
<seg>Certain important Asian personalities, like the former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, launch warnings to Europeans: if they continue on this impetus, their continent will not have soon any more interest but for the top-of-the-range tourism and real estate.</seg>
<seg>An influential Chinese business man, who shares his time between HongKong and London, was even more precise.</seg>
<seg>He declared a few weeks ago, at the time of a private demonstration gathering in Paris of the political directors and of large heads of undertaking: “You are becoming Third World countries. You waste your time with the Constitution, the Welfare state, the crisis of the financing of the retirements, and you systematically bring the bad answers to the questions which you put”.</seg>
<seg>The idea that Europeans are done of Asia in general, and of China in particular, is more complex. It goes from the lucid adaptation to a new sizeable competitor, with the pure and simple ideological rejection.</seg>
<seg>In mai1968, certain French students descended in the street to invent a new world dreamed of China of Mao, a country however plunged in a brutal and foolish Cultural revolution.</seg>
<seg>This absurd passion was the fruit as well of the ignorance of the crimes of the mode Maoist, as of the trouble felt in a company thrives near to the full employment.</seg>
<seg>Today, their heirs criticize the Asian capitalist model openly.</seg>
<seg>China, formerly star anti-capitalist of the revolutionary utopians, became the ultra-liberal enemy dreaded by a new generation of utopians reactionaries, who defend the status quo in Europe.</seg>
<seg>The students who expressed recently in the streets of Paris do not want to imitate the Chinese and the Indians; they refuse the logic of universalization and the abandonment of hard gained social skills.</seg>
<seg>The attitude of the European economic elites is very different.</seg>
<seg>They have well included/understood that their tinted post-colonial designs of nostalgia, according to which China and India would be vast markets of exports and immense tanks of cheap labour, are obsolete.</seg>
<seg>These countries became true competitors worthy of respect, even of admiration.</seg>
<seg>Quality, the costs and the delivery periods - in auto industry for example - are reaching the European level.</seg>
<seg>Europe preserves an advantage in the scientific disciplines, as for the drug company, but of new very powerful companies, especially in India, manage more and more to recruit graduates of MIT and Harvard, and -- thanks to always lower hired labour charges -- to remain competitive on a worldwide scale.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, if the European leaders became aware of the Asian challenge, they did not succeed in translating it into a lesson of realism, in a context of universalization irresistible, or in a call to the weapons in the social domain and economic.</seg>
<seg>In fact, the European political officials, with some rare exceptions like Tony Blair, were too much long in adapting to evolutions fulgurating in Asia.</seg>
<seg>Deprived of long-term strategy, and obsessed by short-term interests, the European politicians - contrary to the heads of undertakings - did not gain the respect of their Asian counterparts.</seg>
<seg>Remain that, on a continent which did not succeed in burying the past and finishing some with the spectrum of nationalism, the EU is also a model of reconciliation, peace and of prosperity.</seg>
<seg>But can this image survive a continuation of the decline?</seg>
<seg>For the Asian ones, the European model could become a political version of Venice: a place which one visits with the nostalgia of a size passed, like an admirable museum.</seg>
<seg>Red and blue</seg>
<seg>The nomination of Condoleezza Rice at the post of American Secretary of State to replace Colin Powell shows that the recent presidential elections still have powerful repercussions.</seg>
<seg>It is important that the Americans but also especially the rest of the world include/understand what these elections reveal us of America.</seg>
<seg>The presidential election of this year proves that the American démocracie is healthy, and that certain things would gain with being improved.</seg>
<seg>Contrary to the election of 2000, where president Bush had not received the support of the popular vote and hardly gained the vote of the electoral College, Misters Bush carried it of 3,5 million voice this time.</seg>
<seg>While certain Democrats remain bitter, the legitimacy of the victory of Misters Bush cannot be called into question.</seg>
<seg>America is strongly divided between the States red, republican, and the blue, democratic States.</seg>
<seg>If 100.000 votes had rocked in the red State of Ohio, John Kerry would have become president (in spite of a minority popular vote).</seg>
<seg>The electoral College was incorporated in the American Constitution to protect the small States in the federal system and that implies today that the electoral campaign concentrates now very largely on a dozen States at most, battle fields where the public opinion is narrowly divided.</seg>
<seg>Basically, there is something of incredible in the election of presidents without popular majority.</seg>
<seg>It is thus time to discuss amendment of the constitution to abolish the electoral College.</seg>
<seg>Certain observers complain about rhetoric and negative publicities good to sow the discord which characterized this countryside.</seg>
<seg>That must be appreciated from the historical point of view.</seg>
<seg>At the time of the Founding fathers, the newspapers easily took party and George Wahsington showed himself dismayed by the hardness of the political language.</seg>
<seg>For the major part of its premium history, without speaking about the civil war and the period of rebuilding, the country was as narrowly divided as it is it today and the bitter rhetoric of the campaigns always reflected this narrow competition.</seg>
<seg>For as much, in spite of negative publicities on the two sides, the three televised national debates raised important matters in a serious format and were largely followed.</seg>
<seg>In general, any President-in-Office profiting from the economic growth is likely all to be re-elected.</seg>
<seg>In this direction, the true surprise of the re-election of Misters Bush was the weak margin of its majority.</seg>
<seg>Mainly, that is due to the unpopularity of the war in Iraq.</seg>
<seg>Misters Kerry tried to transform the war, the low level of job creation, the insufficient medical cover and the tax credits of Misters Bush towards the favoured classes of the key questions in the countryside but certain observers felt that did not manage to send a clear message.</seg>
<seg>Misters Bush countered it with the question of safety against terrorism and a cultural populism about certain questions such as the homosexual marriage and the abortion.</seg>
<seg>Finally, the cultural populism and safety carried it against the economic populism.</seg>
<seg>The interpretation of the elections was influenced by the surveys of exit of the ballot boxes at the time which the voters were to come to a conclusion (after having voted) about the questions which ontle more counted for them.</seg>
<seg>The major part (22%) answered “the values morals”, by comparison only 20% quoted the economy and 19% terrorism.</seg>
<seg>The social conservatives interpreted that as meaning that they had gained the election of Misters Bush and that their program was to dominate its second mandate.</seg>
<seg>However, a Pew survey carried out one week after the election indicated that the category of the “values morals” embraced a large variety of questions in addition to the rights to the abortion and the homosexual marriage.</seg>
<seg>In fact, the surveys show that 25% of the public defend the homosexual marriage and 35% are in favour of the legal civil unions of the gay couples (position which defended Misters Kerry).</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, for the 37% which are opposed to the homosexual marriage in particular in the red States in the center of the country, the question made it possible to rejoin the supporters Misters Bush to make them come to the ballot boxes.</seg>
<seg>Remain to be seen, overall, if the United States is divided beyond any hope.</seg>
<seg>The electoral map of the red and blue States gave birth on Internet to jokes and cartoons on the secession of the two blue coasts of with the red center of the country.</seg>
<seg>Some call that “Côtopie”.</seg>
<seg>But divisions are not so clear.</seg>
<seg>In the two camps, many States were gained by a weak margin and if one rather colours the charts by county than by State, the major part of the country turns to the purple one.</seg>
<seg>Cities against suburbs and rural areas would be a better description of the situation instead of Côtes against heart of the country.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the public opinion polls show that the majority of the Americans are concentrated in the moderate center of the political spectrum rather than to the two extremes.</seg>
<seg>But the political elites such as the political militants and the members of the Congress tend to show extremists more that the public.</seg>
<seg>With the first access, that seems astonishing, since they should feel attracted by the center, rich in voice.</seg>
<seg>However, of many members of the Congress districts represent which are acquired with their party and the true threat towards their re-election arises to the primary educations parties, dominated by the most militant wings and most extreme of the parts.</seg>
<seg>This tendency is reinforced by the rise of the cable television, which attracts the televiewers through discussed programs of information-entertainment, and the writers of chronicles Internet called Blogs, which launch out in polemics baited without any leading filter.</seg>
<seg>A reform which would make it possible to modify the borders of the districts of the more competitive Congresses to return them permettrer to answer this problem, but few elected officials will vote such changes which could increase the risk of their defeat.</seg>
<seg>The weak margin of the results suggests that Misters Bush does not have really the mandate of the change which he thinks of having gained.</seg>
<seg>Vis-a-vis the difficult questions as regards foreign, tax politics and dociale, it would be advised to turn to the center rather than to reconcile its preserving base, but the policy which will prevail between the policy of conviction or the pragmatic policy remains dubious.</seg>
<seg>Let us take down oil!</seg>
<seg>The chancelière Angela Merkel made fight against climate warming the great priority of the German presidencies of the European Union and the G8 which begin in January.</seg>
<seg>Its specific proposal is rather general so that the leaders hold account of it and accept it, and rather clear so that the other governments and the companies includes/understands it: at the time of the next top of G8, it will quite simply be necessary to fix a date from which the vehicles running on the gasoline will not be registered any more in the large industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg>This decision will have a considerable on the levels geopolitics and economic positive impact.</seg>
<seg>Today, true concern as regards energy is not related on the reduction in oil world reserves, but rather to the decline of the internal production of the large-scale consumers -- Europe, the United States and China -- , at the moment when the increasing demand of Asia burdens the market.</seg>
<seg>The reserves available will concentrate more in the Middle East, because those of the other areas of the world will be soon dry.</seg>
<seg>Who more is, the large oil exporters are not been willing to subject their policies of investment to the market rates.</seg>
<seg>Saudi Arabia wants to only manage its production of oil and, on its side, Iran makes fear with the potential investors with its bureaucratic obstacles and its corruption.</seg>
<seg>Iraq suffers from a lack of safety, while the foreigners are put in failure at each attempt at investment in Russia.</seg>
<seg>These four States contain half of the world crude oil reserves, of which two thirds could potentially be exported.</seg>
<seg>These factors, except the production costs, are at the origin of the high prices of oil and the race for the contracts in Africa and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg>The fact of believing that the rise of the oil prices is a good thing for the environment does not take account of the data items of the international policy.</seg>
<seg>First of all, in the majority of the poor countries of Africa and Asia, the oil importation represents a greater part of the national expenditure than in the industrialized countries, which means that the economic growth and social development are compromised, and that new crises of debt threaten.</seg>
<seg>The revenues of the oil production block the reforms in the principal exporting countries.</seg>
<seg>Thanks to the reinforcement them financial capacity, the modes like those of Venezuela and Iran feel less and less constrained by the international rules.</seg>
<seg>The last newcomers among the large consumer countries energy, like China, reproduce the old practices of the industrialized Occident and their long tradition consisting in closing the eyes on the violations of human rights, in order to guarantee contracts lucrative with the authoritarian regimes and rich in oil.</seg>
<seg>Only the political and economic heavy lorries, the industrialized countries which remain by far the principal hydrocarbon consumers can start a change on a worldwide scale.</seg>
<seg>It is important to start with the transport sector, which at present represents more half of oil consumption -- proportion which will increase doubtless in the future.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, the countries of G8 will have to agree not to register new cars more rolling to the gasoline as from 2025.</seg>
<seg>This decision is not directed against individual mobility, but against the wasting of a rare resource having to be used in priority to produce synthetic materials.</seg>
<seg>The political officials should not privilege such or such technology.</seg>
<seg>They should rather encourage auto industry to develop alternative technologies which use the biocarburants, ethylene, hydrogen and even natural gas, for one transitional period.</seg>
<seg>The countries which opened the way with the political will on the matter, as a collateral benefit, set up national industries first in the technology of energy to ensure the later markets.</seg>
<seg>The important awaited reduction of the CO2 emissions could finally lead to progress necessary of the international policies on the climate.</seg>
<seg>Economic development between also concerned: if we look after our “dependence” with oil, the poor and less developed countries, as well as the new industrialized countries, could have some more, which would cause a drop in the prices and would calm the energy competition.</seg>
<seg>At the geopolitical level, the benefit would be quite as manifest, in particular the large oil exporting countries would be much less able to make sing the industrialized countries.</seg>
<seg>This reversal would increase the force of negotiation of the international community in the Middle East and would consolidate the social forces of the countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia, which seriously wish to promote the economic reforms and policies of the interior.</seg>
<seg>Large producing car and country with the leading-edge technology, Germany is well placed to launch such an initiative.</seg>
<seg>Angela Merkel, who is titular of a doctorate in physics and began her political career at the post of minister from the environment -- chairing in 1995 the first conference of Convention-tallies of the United Nations on the climate changes -- , would be more credible than any other of his/her colleagues of the European Union and G8 to face the problem.</seg>
<seg>It is high time to achieve a political act of bravery.</seg>
<seg>The Myth of the humanitarian aid and the commercial exchanges</seg>
<seg>The humanitarian aid and the commercial exchanges became buzzwords international.</seg>
<seg>An increased humanitarian aid (accompanied by a relief of the debt) and a better access to the markets of the rich countries for the products of the poor countries: that seems now to have taken the first place of about an international day.</seg>
<seg>In fact, the debate today does not relate any more to the measures to take, but to the quantity of measures to be taken and with which speed.</seg>
<seg>Lost in all that: clear lessons to draw the five last decades of economic development.</seg>
<seg>In the foreground of these lessons, one discovers that economic development is left mainly in the hands of the poor nations themselves.</seg>
<seg>The countries which managed well in a recent past succeeded thanks to their own efforts.</seg>
<seg>The humanitarian aid and the markets played only one minor part.</seg>
<seg>Let us take the example of a developing country which lays out of an free access and preferential at the market of sound larger neighbor, who is being also the most powerful economy in the world.</seg>
<seg>Let us suppose moreover than this country either able to send million its citizens to work on other side of the border, receives an enormous volume of overseas investments and or completely integrated into the international line productions.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, the banking system of the country is supported by its close rich person and his will posted to intervene like lender of last recourse.</seg>
<seg>Isn't universalization could arise under better auspices only these?</seg>
<seg>Let us consider a second country now.</seg>
<seg>This one must face a commercial embargo on the largest worldwide market, receives neither foreign aid nor no form of support on behalf of the western world, is excluded from the international organizations such as OMC and cannot borrow at the IMF and of the World Bank.</seg>
<seg>If these external handicaps were not sufficiently debilitating, one can add to it an economy which maintenance itself of the barriers against the international business (in the form of trade of State, tariff barriers to the importation and quantitative restrictions). </seg>
<seg>As the reader could guess it, these countries really exist: it is of Mexico and Vietnam.</seg>
<seg>Mexico divides a 3 200 kilometers long border with the United States, which offers not only the privileged access at a market of goods and labour, but also to a share of the financial resources of the state American (as the experiment of the crisis of the peso in 1995 in made the demonstration).</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, America maintained its embargo commercial against Vietnam until 1994, did not restore its diplomatic relations before 1995 and granted the statute of most favoured nation to the Vietnamese imports only many years later.</seg>
<seg>Vietnam still did not enter with OMC.</seg>
<seg>Let us examine their economic performances now.</seg>
<seg>Since the signature of the ALENA in December 1992, the Mexican economy knew an average annual progression of hardly more than 1 % per capita.</seg>
<seg>Not only this figure is quite lower than the rates of the champions of the Asian economy, but it is also only one fraction of the clean performances of growth in Mexico of the decades preceding the crisis by the debt of 1982 (3,6 % per annum between 1960 and 1981).</seg>
<seg>Vietnam, however, knew an annual progression of 5,6 % per capita since the stammerings of her economic reforms in 1988 and the re-establishment of the diplomatic relations with the United States in 1995, and knew a continual rapid growth at the rate of 4,5 % since.</seg>
<seg>Vietnam was pilot of a dramatic fall of poverty while Mexico knew a fall of the real wages.</seg>
<seg>These two countries made the experiment of a marked takeoff of the international business and overseas investments, but the general picture is very contrasted where that counts more: in the improvement of the standards of living, particularly among the poor populations.</seg>
<seg>What these examples show, it is that the interior efforts eclipse all the other elements in the determination of economic fortunes of a country.</seg>
<seg>All that the US market had to offer to Mexico could not counterbalance the consequences of the political errors on the interior market, particularly the incapacity to reverse the true appreciation of the foreign exchange rate of the peso or to extend the productivity gains obtained in a narrow sector of activities of export to the remainder of the economy.</seg>
<seg>What counts more remains the adoption by a country of a strategy of suitable growth.</seg>
<seg>Without any the advantages from which Mexico profited, Vietnam pursued a strategy countered on the diversification of her economy and the improvement of the production capacity of the local suppliers.</seg>
<seg>The total experiment of the post-war period supports the proof that the domestic policies are what imports more.</seg>
<seg>South Korea took off with the beginning of the year 1960, not when the foreign subsidies were with their height, but when they started to be dried up.</seg>
<seg>Taiwan did not profit from foreign subsidies nor of privileged access at certain markets.</seg>
<seg>China and India, the economic superstars of the moment, largely thrived thanks to their own efforts of economic reform.</seg>
<seg>It is trying to put at the account of the foreign request for their products of export rare African successes, Botswana and Mauritius (respectively diamonds and clothes industry), but that cannot go very far.</seg>
<seg>Obviously, these two countries would be much poorer without the access to the overseas markets.</seg>
<seg>But, as in all the cases of successful development, which distinguish them are not the external advantages from which they profit but well their capacity to exploit these advantages.</seg>
<seg>It is enough to see how other countries wasted the advantage that their natural wealths get to them.</seg>
<seg>The word “diamond” especially does not give birth to with the spirit an image from peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.</seg>
<seg>In the same way, few zones of treatment of exports proliferating throughout the world did not know the level of development which one observes in Mauritius.   </seg>
<seg>That does not release however the rich countries of their obligation to help.</seg>
<seg>They can lead the hard life to the corrupted dictators, by sharing the financial informations best and while refusing to recognize the international contracts which they sign.</seg>
<seg>In the same way, the increase in the number of workers of the poor countries authorized to work in the rich countries and a broader range of policies directed towards the growth thanks to the relaxation of the rules and conditions of OMC imposed by the United States would produce a more important impact on the long-term development.</seg>
<seg>It is not proven that the widening of the access to the markets and the subsidies represents the best use to make political capital of the northern hemisphere.</seg>
<seg>The development should concentrate on the improvement of the political environment in the poor countries, rather than on the assistance and the trade.</seg>
<seg>Interdependences</seg>
<seg>If the large Argentinian economist Raul Prebisch were living today, there is not any doubt that he would wonder whether the world started to turn to back.</seg>
<seg>Its largely influential theory of the dependence advanced that if the poor countries rested too much on raw material exports, they would never reach the industrial level necessary to support a rapid growth.</seg>
<seg>They are embourberaient in the place in a cycle of world decline of the prices of the raw materials and of reduction without end on behalf of the incomes.</seg>
<seg>The favorite answer of Prebisch, protectionism, proved to be disastrous for the many countries of Latin America and Africa which followed it.</seg>
<seg>But the fact is that during years, Prebisch seems to have had the reaction right about the price trends of the raw materials on the long run.</seg>
<seg>The permanent profits of effectiveness in the sectors of the agriculture and the extraction of the natural resources cause a drop in the prices of the raw materials, especially in the years 1980 and 1990.</seg>
<seg>With some exceptions, the countries which concentrated on raw material exports obtained only poor results, whereas Asian countries not laying out that little of resources made fast progress.</seg>
<seg>Today however, with the Asian giants, India and China, which join the worldwide economy, the prices of the gasoline, gold, corn and practically all the other raw materials explode.</seg>
<seg>Admittedly, it there will always have cycles (the oil price, for example, will undoubtedly fall again before starting again its rise) but the long-term tendency of many raw materials will remain clearly with the rise for a few times still.</seg>
<seg>_ it that some many negotiator commercial and other decision maker have not seem recognize still, whereas Prebisch it have include immediately, it be that this abrupt reversal of situation comprise some enormous implication for the balance world of capacity.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, no other aspect of economic universalization will launch moreover big challenges to the leaders of the world during the decades to come.</seg>
<seg>The questions are numerous.</seg>
<seg>Are the rich countries of today prepared to enter during one time of Co-dependence, in which they will be as hopelessly petitioning of raw materials as the countries in the process of development are to it industrialized products and technologies?</seg>
<seg>Are they prepared with the inevitable flow of capacities and influence towards the raw material producer countries as those grow rich?</seg>
<seg>How the two super powers of the world, China and the United States, will manage the fact that important raw material exporting areas of Africa and the Middle East towards the Central Asia are covered with State-nations malformed?</seg>
<seg>Certain autoproclamés prophets expose the problem like that of the limits of natural reserves and claim that the most critical raw materials decrease at an alarming speed.</seg>
<seg>Nowadays, many are the followers of the theory “of the peak of Hubbert” of the production of oil, which supports that we reached limit higher our production capacities, that the wells are drained and that the situation can only be degraded.</seg>
<seg>However, as the eminent historian of oil daN Yergin indicates it, the birds of ill omen protested that the black gold resources were about to dry up at least four times already.</seg>
<seg>Each time, of radicals technological advancements made fly away these threats.</seg>
<seg>At the end of the years 1800, the oil extraction implied to dredge with mules.</seg>
<seg>Today, to drill to 3.000 mm under the ground of the oceans seems natural with everyone.</seg>
<seg>Such progress was also made in the fields of the extraction of metals and agriculture.</seg>
<seg>Not, the world is not confronted with a nearest raw material shortage.</seg>
<seg>Actually, it occurs that the integration of 2,5 billion people (that is to say China and India) in the worldwide economy produces a displacement of the request likely to put much more pressure on the rise of the prices of the raw materials than no technological profit will undoubtedly be able to counterbalance.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, and this at least for 50 to 75 years, and perhaps even until the human ones start to drill over Mars during the centuries to come, the prices of many natural resources will go up.</seg>
<seg>The new balance of the economic powers which will result from it will it destabilize the world political situation?</seg>
<seg>The First World War was partly started by the concern of Germany in front of the monopolization by the other colonial powers of a too great part of world oil and raw materials.</seg>
<seg>In the same way, during the second world war, Japan has fears for the stability of its supplies out of oils and other natural resources come from abroad.</seg>
<seg>Will such tensions appear between China with the dubious resources (even the water scarcity there is problematic) and the Occident?</seg>
<seg>Fortunately, that does not seem probable for the moment, in particular within sight of the approach as sober as pragmatic of the problems of resources of their country expressed by the Chinese leaders.</seg>
<seg>The Chinese turn to areas like Africa in the hope to find business partners stable.</seg>
<seg>They do not share the political evangelism of the Americans, who do not want only to make trade with the raw material exporters, but want also to convert them.</seg>
<seg>And then there are these American leaders who still speak to make the United States self-sufficing in terms of energy resources.</seg>
<seg>It is a joke: sufficient, perhaps, but self-sufficing, never.</seg>
<seg>A great Arab part of the world thinks, and it is comprehensible, which the invasion of Iraq constitutes the angular stone of the American strategy aiming at getting stable energy resources.</seg>
<seg>If they are right, one can only hope that America has a solution of help.</seg>
<seg>While waiting, the prices of the raw materials will continue to increase, and the exporters oil to constitute the largest contributors with the open trade deficit of the United States.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the true American strategy consists in it trying to have to the money oil exporting countries so much that those will become dependent on the happiness which they get in America!</seg>
<seg>Here is a turning that Prebisch would never have envisaged.</seg>
<seg>The radical choice of Iran</seg>
<seg>The choice of the Iranians to carry to the capacity the radical mayor of Teheran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, risk to deteriorate the relations with the Occident and to accentuate the insulation of the country to the international level.</seg>
<seg>However, in terms of national policy, the islamist mode will undoubtedly go from there better than if a more moderate candidate had carried it.</seg>
<seg>It appears clearly that Ahmadinejad has a real base of support.</seg>
<seg>The fact that it was presented in the form of populist, that it spoke to help the poor, condemned the government and practically acted like a candidate of opposition does not count: he incarnated the choice of the mode, and ended up receiving an official help including against radical rivals.</seg>
<seg>The mode showed a great skill.</seg>
<seg>It transformed the candidate a little more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani, in dissension with certain government policies, a character in harmony with the established order, and its own candidate as a rebel.</seg>
<seg>The government thus used the resentment against the Establishment to consolidate its own capacity.</seg>
<seg>Since former president, Mohammad Khatami, supported the movement reformist, mm�me if it were not very bold and that it with final nothing achieved, that does nothing but underline � which point the leaders turned over � their advantage the political situation.</seg>
<seg>Ahmadinejad is a representative of the youngest activists of the revolution anti-Shah of 25 years ago.</seg>
<seg>It is directly implied in the taking of American hostages in Iran, though one does not know really � which point.</seg>
<seg>Most worrying is that it is close to the two independent groups which represent the elements more the extremists of Iran: the Body of the guards of the Islamic revolution and the Basij organization.</seg>
<seg>The first is an army parall�le pro-mode; the second is an organization which intimidates the opponents and whoever is � the search for a more open company.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, this concern to see Iran with the hands of leaders even more radical is mitigated by two factors.</seg>
<seg>First of all, Ahmadinejad undoubtedly will concentrate on national probl�mes, and will try - without one being able to predict his chances of succ�s - to improve the living conditions of the poorest Iranians.</seg>
<seg>Deuxi�mement, the group with the capacity since the revolution will continue to follow the policies ideological and étrang�re.</seg>
<seg>The president has less of capacities than it does not appear to with it, and it particuli�rement is particuli�rement eclipsed by the guide supr�me the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</seg>
<seg>At all events, the election of Ahmadinejad cr�ment clarifies the challenge which Iran represents for the Western policy and the stability of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>First of all, it sends the signal to the elements plus extremists of Iran and to the terrorist customers of this country -- Hezbollah Lebanese, Hamas Palestinian and Islamic Jihad, and several small groups who act against Arab Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other countries -- that they have green light to launch their attacks.</seg>
<seg>They undoubtedly will estimate that Iran will support them, though they make.</seg>
<seg>Seemingly, Iran often showed itself relatively careful, while playing � covered the role of world silent partner of terror.</seg>
<seg>Iranian civils servant who could, individually, to act to order and to coordinate specific operations, will feel from now on freer to act thus.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, Ahmadinejad openly preaches an intensive programme of obtaining nuclear weapons.</seg>
<seg>The majority of the Iranian politicians, in any case those which the government authorizes � to act at the great day, support this program, but support an approach more discr�te and careful.</seg>
<seg>Rafsanjani, for example, makes pass the establishment of better relations with the Occident before the projection on the nuclear face.</seg>
<seg>If Ahmadinejad is the president of nuclear Iran, it is more likely to use the weapons in a hazardous way of them.</seg>
<seg>That does not mean that it would use them, but rather than it would make use � of it of the ends of diplomatic blackmail, making assemble the threats � of the levels of crisis.</seg>
<seg>Since the Iranian leaders proclaim their desire daily to erase Israel of the chart and to fight the United States (Ahmadinejad went on the image of an American flag while going to vote), the risk of confrontation increased.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, Ahmadinejad is likely to be enhardir at the point to endanger the stability of Iraq, and its victory will encourage the radical Iranian civils servant and the Iraqi extremists.</seg>
<seg>Iran sends déj� many agents in Iraq and supports customers who seek � to transform this country into clone.</seg>
<seg>The Iraqis, including the Shiite Moslems, who follow the mm�me version of Islam that Iranians, generally reject of such interferences.</seg>
<seg>A more militant Iranian position will be able to increase the frictions with Iraq, and to inspire there even more anti-American violence.</seg>
<seg>In short, the result of the Iranian elections is dangerous, mm�me if its potential destabilizer will depend on the acts of Ahmadinejad and the degree of being able that Khamenei will grant to him.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, to deal � Iran also openly extremist - radical mm�me according to the crit�res of a hard mode déj� -- will constitute a challenge not only for the United States, but also for Europe.</seg>
<seg>Will the European countries continue � to claim that militant rhetoric and the provocations of Ahmadinejad do not count and that it is possible to find diplomatic solutions with the nuclear ambitions of Iran?</seg>
<seg>With Rafsanjani, a true agreement or at least appearances of a co-operation would have been easy � to maintain.</seg>
<seg>But, with Ahmadinejad, one will need an immense amount of conciliation to maintain would be this that the tiniest diplomatic procedure.</seg>
<seg>Certain reformists and exiled Iranian are delighted by the election of Ahmadinejad, because they estimate that its administration is more likely to show the true face of the mode and to undeceive any hope of compromise of the Westerners.</seg>
<seg>But it can also symbolize the succ�s mode � to turn over � its advantage the dissatisfaction caused by a quarter with si�cle of r�gne islamist radical.</seg>
<seg>Whatever are the consequences, the victory of Ahmadinejad means for the Occident that all that touches � Iran will become even more delicate.</seg>
<seg>Let us take to the poor, give the rich person</seg>
<seg>President Bush seems about to ruin the American budget for the years to come.</seg>
<seg>When president Bush took his functions, the forecasts anticipated budgetary surpluses as a long time as one could imagine it.</seg>
<seg>Today, thanks to a mixture of irresponsible tax cuts launched by the Republicans, an economic deceleration, the bursting of the bubble of the stockmarket and a massive increase in the military expenditure, the tax horizon is dominated by important deficits.</seg>
<seg>The worst remainder to come, because the Bush government and the Congress with Republican majority prepare to worsen the tax disorder.</seg>
<seg>The devastations which they will make will probably weaken the United States and will increase the instability of the international economy.</seg>
<seg>Usually, the American Republican party defended of the balanced budgets.</seg>
<seg>That changed with the Reagan government, when the preserving Republicans were favorable to the tax reductions, when well even that was done by means of important budget deficits.</seg>
<seg>President Reagan announced to the American people that it could enjoy all at the same time tax reductions, of the reinforcement of the army and the continuation of their programs of expenditure preferred.</seg>
<seg>The result, without surprise, was a series of important budget deficits and whose elimination took several years.</seg>
<seg>The president George Bush father as far as president Bill Clinton had to increase the taxes to put order in the chaos of the Reagan era.</seg>
<seg>These increases of taxation probably contributed to the defeat of the president Bush father by Bill Clinton in 1992.</seg>
<seg>However, Clinton bravely decided to finish the involved process to restore tax balance, partly to protect the long-term financing from the programmes of retirements of the social security.</seg>
<seg>When Clinton left the presidency in 2000, the budget situation was as well as possible since decades.</seg>
<seg>Then came the president George Bush wire, ready with rejouer Reagan with important tax reductions, a considerable increase in the military expenditure and the continuation and even the development of programs of popular expenditure.</seg>
<seg>The result was foreseeable.</seg>
<seg>In January 2001, the cumulative budget estimates for the years 2002 to 2011 anticipated a budgetary surplus of 5,6 billions dollars.</seg>
<seg>Semi-2002, these anticipated surpluses had disappeared.</seg>
<seg>In the light of these new economic conditions, and in the shade of the war against Iraq, one could expect that the Bush government and the republican Congress are careful in the defense of new tax reductions.</seg>
<seg>But far from there, their main priority is to set up more tax reductions from which only the easy classes will profit mainly.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, the government claims important increases in the military expenditure.</seg>
<seg>With the approach of the presidential election of November 2004, one can be certain that no significant reduction of the expenditure will intervene in the nonmilitary programs.</seg>
<seg>It thus seems that the massive budget deficits are intended for perdurer.</seg>
<seg>If the domestic expenditure remains simply constant, on the level of a fraction of the national revenue, ten next years the cumulative budget estimates anticipate a total deficit of 1,5 billions dollars.</seg>
<seg>But this figure could be very optimistic, because it probably takes counts of it the cost of a probable war against Iraq, neither another whole of tax reductions, nor the risk of the increase in interest rates for the years to come.</seg>
<seg>Why the Republicans show do if not very concerned by this disorder?</seg>
<seg>Certain Republicans are worried more of the tax reductions for the easy classes than of anything else.</seg>
<seg>Others think that the deficits will bring by force of the important reductions of the interior governmental expenditure, thus reducing the participation of the State, which is their wish expensive.</seg>
<seg>The problem of this last analysis is that the majority of the taxpayers are attached to the social programs and large reductions of expenditure will not support easily.</seg>
<seg>The question more intrigante remains to know why the Americans vote for such policies when they should know that it will probably result from it from the problems.</seg>
<seg>One of the possible answers is due to the fact that many voters do not see coming the budgetary problems.</seg>
<seg>A better answer is due to the fact that the majority of the Americans do not have in fact not voted for these policies.</seg>
<seg>The rate of participation of the election of 2002 was only of 40% of the voters, and only about half from these 40% voted for the Republicans, that is to say approximately 20% of the people in right to vote.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the prospects should not necessarily be so dark.</seg>
<seg>The war against Iraq will be perhaps avoided.</seg>
<seg>The had a presentiment of tax reductions could be moderate or abandoned.</seg>
<seg>But I predict important budget deficits for the years to come and a feeling growing from faintness inside the United States and abroad about the macroeconomic situation of America.</seg>
<seg>The foreign investors could decide to reduce their financing of the governmental budget and the current account deficit of America in favorable terms.</seg>
<seg>The dollar could weaken, and the fear of inflation could become even more marked.</seg>
<seg>All that will make lose confidence with the political decision makers of the United States which will be then less flexible in their answers to the economic shocks.</seg>
<seg>The disadvantaged classes, in the United States and abroad, could suffer more, since president Bush and the Congress state with the American people and the whole world that there are no cash in hand to treat the question of poverty, health and education, because of the important budget deficits.</seg>
<seg>If the average American does not open the eyes on these tax risks, the easy classes could profit from another gift of several billion dollars while the country and the world support of them the hard consequences for the years to come.</seg>
<seg>Lessons to retain tax unconcern of America</seg>
<seg>George W. Bush made much more to destroy the economic policy of the United States that all the other presidents of the American history, exceeding even her mentor, Ronald Reagan.</seg>
<seg>In only three years of mandate, it destroyed a fragile political consensus which had asked for ten years of efforts and which could require another decade to be rebuilt.</seg>
<seg>By doing this, Bush risked economic health and the social stability on the long run of America.</seg>
<seg>Being given that the budgetary challenges on the long run which the United States in an extremely awkward way manages are not the only existing challenges, the tax blunders of America offer important lessons to the other countries.</seg>
<seg>The main issue presented by the fiscal policy is that the politicians can easily make themselves temporarily popular while decreasing the taxes and while increasing the public expenditure while accumulating massive national debts and by leaving their refunding to the future elected officials.</seg>
<seg>This stratagem can last a few years, but the budget deficits and the growing national debt impose earlier than envisaged a painful change of policy.</seg>
<seg>A cynical politician can however buy his re-election and perhaps be party with the retirement when the crisis arrives.</seg>
<seg>One could imagine that afterwards similar decades of episodes of political irresponsibility in the countries of the whole world, the voters would be allergic to this type of stratagem.</seg>
<seg>However, Bush the bracket again by buying a popularity today by distributing massive health tax cuts while simultaneously increasing the military expenditure and the expenditure education.</seg>
<seg>The budget deficit thus obtained is equivalent to more than 5% of the GNP.</seg>
<seg>Worse still, the budgetary prospects in the long run for America were already worrying before Bush does not start to apply her imprudent policies.</seg>
<seg>The American population is growing old, so that the costs of the retirement schemes and health care financed by public funds will increase out of arrow.</seg>
<seg>Thorough calculations show that the incomes which will be released thanks to the fiscal policies preached by Bush are likely not to reach tens of trillions of dollars which represent the costs of the public retirements, the health care and other tax expenditure awaited by the population.</seg>
<seg>For a certain moment in the future, it will be necessary to strongly increase the tax collections, drastiquement to reduce the public expenditure, or both, to mitigate the actions of Bush.</seg>
<seg>Then why the population support does its policies?</seg>
<seg>Because it includes/understands little these consequences on the long run, or that it is concerned little with it, even if these consequences have finally an impact on the majority of the Americans.</seg>
<seg>The richest taxpayers are of course happy because they profited from the major part of the tax cuts.</seg>
<seg>As astonishing as that can appear, the richest 5% of the American taxpayers profited from approximately half of the tax cuts and these taxpaying rich person wait clearly until the others 95% (middle-classes and the poor) support the majority of the future reductions of the expenditure and increases in the taxes.</seg>
<seg>Meanwhile, Bush convinced a great number of poor voters and voters of the middle-classes which they should also be satisfied with their fate, without their saying that they will have to pay their small tax cuts by reductions much more consequent of the future governmental services if the policies of its administration prevail on the long run.</seg>
<seg>If the Americans had a political memory, they would understand that they already climbed this “Russian mountain” tax during the 20 last years.</seg>
<seg>Ronald Reagan also took her functions by promising massive tax cuts and important increases in the military expenditure.</seg>
<seg>That ended in an enormous budget deficit in the middle of the years 1980.</seg>
<seg>The tax cuts made Reagan extremely popular and allowed him to be re-elected in 1984.</seg>
<seg>It then took a decade (starting from the second mandate of Reagan until the mandates of George Bush, Sr. and of Bill Clinton) to return to a surplus budget.</seg>
<seg>Of course, this result required the approval of new increases of taxation, which cost its re-election George Bush, Sr. and led to the polarized policy of the years 1990.</seg>
<seg>The history has great chances to be repeated.</seg>
<seg>Certain ideologists of right-hand side in the Bush Administration estimate that the current budget deficits will in the final analysis involve a drastic reduction of the welfare expenditures of the government.</seg>
<seg>They hope to dismantle programs such as the Social security and Medicare.</seg>
<seg>But the American population supports these social programs firmly.</seg>
<seg>Thus the strategy which initially consists in reducing the taxes in order to involve obligatorily thereafter reductions in the social programs is dedicated to the failure and will inevitably involve the increase in the tax rates.</seg>
<seg>Other ideologists of the Bush Administration support that the tax cuts play a crucial role to leave the United States the recession.</seg>
<seg>This argument is also erroneous.</seg>
<seg>The economy of America could have been rectified without the tax cuts, and perhaps even more firmly.</seg>
<seg>In all the cases, it is a monumental error to base the long-term fiscal policies on the business cycle in the short run.</seg>
<seg>The other countries have two lessons essential to retain this situation.</seg>
<seg>The first, it is that the imminent budget deficits of the United States will limit early or late the international power of America.</seg>
<seg>The Americans supported the war in Iraq only because they did not have to subsidize it by higher taxes.</seg>
<seg>When the Americans are constrained to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be much less inclined to support expensive military operations abroad.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the United States will be deeply divided internally when the population is with the catches with the tax disorder left by Bush.</seg>
<seg>The second lesson, it is that the countries must plan their budgets according to the increasing tax costs caused by a growing old population.</seg>
<seg>The budgetary conditions in the long run are seldom taken into account by the taxpayers or the Parliament.</seg>
<seg>The governments must have to subject budgetary evaluations on the long run at the same time their proposals for an annual budget in order to reduce the tendency towards a political handling on the short term of the budget.</seg>
<seg>The United States can play the part of an alarm signal for the other countries.</seg>
<seg>The White House should give to the other countries the same council that the magicians on television give to their spectators: “Do not try to make similar on your premise”.</seg>
<seg>The politization of the markets of the transferable securities</seg>
<seg>Many economic and financial analysts complain that the markets of the transferable securities of the emergent countries are often heavily handled by their governments and are more political than economic.</seg>
<seg>By contrast, a primitive force of an economic nature governs the markets of the transferable securities in the advanced countries and to predict their performances returns in fact to predict the growth of the trees.</seg>
<seg>This description of the markets of the transferable securities in the emergent countries is not false, just partial, because same description applies to the markets of the transferable securities in the advanced countries.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the best analysts know than to predict the performances of the market of the transferable securities of any country amounts at the bottom predicting the degree to which the government wishes than the investors of the markets of the transferable securities imply themselves in the current political environment.</seg>
<seg>Take the market of the transferable securities of the United States, by far most important in the world.</seg>
<seg>The government leaves the quiet companies and the returns on investment in the American market of the transferable securities reflect the fundamental forces of a solid capitalist economy.</seg>
<seg>This explains partly why the United States attracts the investors of wallet of the whole world.</seg>
<seg>But the returns which return the US markets of the transferable securities if attracting reflect a fragile political balance.</seg>
<seg>In particular, the tax rates which affect the transferable securities varied with the wire of time with the change of the political pressures.</seg>
<seg>During the Second world war, for example, the political support for great fortunes decreased and the government strongly increased the income taxes the profits of capital, the dividends and in general raised.</seg>
<seg>When the Second world war made it possible to rectify considerably the economy weakened by the Great Depression of the years 1930, president Roosevelt and the Congress set up an income tax exceptional in order to guarantee that the shareholders do not release a too consequent benefit.</seg>
<seg>By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but that the market of the transferable securities was on a bottom grade, the American voters elected Ronald Reagan, a man judged by much like being a president too on the right.</seg>
<seg>He asked, and obtained, of the tax cuts on the profits of capital, the dividends and the incomes.</seg>
<seg>The political interferences in the market of the transferable securities do not relate only to the income taxes the profits of capital, the dividends and.</seg>
<seg>The taxes on land, the indirect taxes, the rights of importation and the taxation of the sales, which all are poured, directly or indirectly, by the companies, can have an impact amplified on the benefit of the companies and thus on the market of the transferable securities.</seg>
<seg>It is not a chance so everywhere where markets of the transferable securities develop, the governments take care that these taxes lower to the maximum the benefit of the companies after tax.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the policies of the markets of the transferable securities do not stop with the taxes.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, almost each activity of the government touches the benefit of the companies and, thereafter, the market of the transferable securities.</seg>
<seg>After the crash of the markets of the transferable securities of 1929, the US government suspended most of the antitrust activity which made it possible the companies to acquire a monopoly which increases their value.</seg>
<seg>This policy delayed the fall of raised unemployment rate, but was not enough to control the political clouts deployed to support the market of the transferable securities.</seg>
<seg>In the same way, one of the actions the most important companies by president Reagan was to destroy most of the capacity remaining of the trade unions of America, which competed to obtain their share of the industrial cake.</seg>
<seg>The victory gained by Reagan at the time of the strike of the air traffic controllers in 1981 represented a great turning for the American trade union movement, and also for the market of the transferable securities which launched its spectacular market to the rise in 1982.</seg>
<seg>The US government showed itself particularly keen to support the market of the transferable securities from the culminating point of the illusion of the prices of the actions in 2000, and in particular to reduce interest rates on several occasions.</seg>
<seg>Of course, this measurement was publicly justified in terms of stimulation of the economy, and not in terms of support for the market of the transferable securities.</seg>
<seg>But it is extremely revealing width of the US market of the transferable securities that one of the most important factors which weigh on the economy relates to the prices of actions in fall.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the answer of the authorities was not limited to a monetary stimulant.</seg>
<seg>The national accounts of products and incomes of the United States show that the effective rate of the income taxes of the companies (percentage of really versed benefit to the government in the form of taxes) is assembled in peak with 33,7% during the first quarter 2000 (the record of the market of the transferable securities and the economy in general) and fell to 20,2% during the fourth quarters 2003, when the market was low.</seg>
<seg>Most of this decline reflects the measurements of tax reduction voted by the Congress as well as perception, among the companies, that in economic environment and current policy, they can be shown more combative to avoid paying taxes.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, after the crash of the market of the transferable securities, the maximum tax on the paid dividends on the transferable securities passed from 35% to 15%, bringing a new substantial advantage to the investors on the long run and intensifying the effect combined of the reinvestment of the dividends after tax.</seg>
<seg>Again, this tax cut was justified to stimulate the economy what can, obviously, to endeavour to practically any intended measures to support the market of the transferable securities.</seg>
<seg>But it is the balance of the political clouts which determines the credibility of this type of justification.</seg>
<seg>One could support that the same variables, including the hostility towards high taxes and a weak trade union movement, functioned in the United States during the 200 last years and that they should continue to function in the future, producing returns raised on the markets of the transferable securities and attracting surges of considerable foreign assets.</seg>
<seg>Those which estimate that the investments on the US market of the transferable securities will follow the same growth trend raised during decades could be right very well.</seg>
<seg>But it is important to be clear on what one predicts.</seg>
<seg>The forecasts relate before all not only on economics, but also on politics, and even to the cultural values, which work the policies and the economic performances.</seg>
<seg>The real estate market with planetary scales</seg>
<seg>There is no investment more local than the real investment. The residence which one buys is enracinée at a precise place, like a tree, and flowers or decays with the liking of the local economic conditions.</seg>
<seg>The whole world ravels on our screens of TV, but the real estate market, made up almost only of local amateurs, seldom crosses the local geographical borders.</seg>
<seg>Soon, however, this could change.</seg>
<seg>Within one month, Mercantile Chicago Exchange (CME), in collaboration with my MacroMarkets company, like Fiserv and Standard & Poor' S, will in the long term launch options on contracts on the real prices in ten cities of the United States.</seg>
<seg>The contracts will be based on the real price indexes S&P/Case-Shiller, established according to speculative research that my colleague Karl Case and myself carried out, almost twenty years ago.</seg>
<seg>For a long time, we canvass in favour of a real estate market in the long term, but no Stock Exchange, until now, wanted to use these indices to create such a market.</seg>
<seg>The futures markets on the real prices will make it possible to the investors of the whole world to indirectly invest in the American real estate, via these markets.</seg>
<seg>A purchaser in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo will have the possibility of investing in residences occupied by their owners in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, inter alia.</seg>
<seg>One of the basic principles of the financial theory -- the diversification or the spread of the risk -- imply that the interest for these new agreements will be strong.</seg>
<seg>The companies and the inhabitants of New York, for example, are over-exposed with the local real risks. However, by selling their residences in the long term, they should succeed in reducing these risks.</seg>
<seg>The investors in Tokyo will assume a share of the risks by buying residences in New York in the long term, if the price is right.</seg>
<seg>The New Yorkeans will continue to live in their residences, while having spread investment risks everywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg>The experiment of a true futures market on the one-family residences was not retentée since 1991, when London Futures and Options Exchange (called from now on Euronext.liffe) missed launching by such a market.</seg>
<seg>This test forever generated great volumes of transactions.</seg>
<seg>The Stock Exchange launched a concept which did not convince anybody.</seg>
<seg>The British markets of bets diversified on the real prices, just like certain retail markets on line, never paid much either.</seg>
<seg>Will this be different this time?</seg>
<seg>Of course, the launching of a new market is always dubious. People are interested in an idea if it allures of it already many others; if nobody is allured, it will not attract more.</seg>
<seg>The same applies to the markets. If there are no interested investors, it will not occur enough transactions to generate the profits making it possible to attract others of them.</seg>
<seg>However, as it is the case for all the brilliant ideas, we never know very well why they allure. Also, we cannot predict starting of this new market, but we know that, sometimes, success is with go.</seg>
<seg>The initial indicators let think that the interest growing for the transactions for future delivery as regards real prices, especially because of the ambient speech on the “real estate bubble”, stresses the importance of the diversification of the risks.</seg>
<seg>After the advertisement of the CME, one of its competitors, Chicago Board Exchange Options, stated its project to off create options on contracts in the long term in the greatest American areas, based on the average real prices published by the National Association Realtors (National association of the real estate agents).</seg>
<seg>However, in addition to the strong public interest for the real investment and the covering of the risks, another thorny question must be regulated so that the futures markets function well: the prices must be openly revealed and the investors must include/understand the significance of it.</seg>
<seg>I believe qu `there are great chances so that these futures markets involve soon a fall of the prices in certain American cities.</seg>
<seg>It will be a question of “offset”, as say the traders. Today, the price in the long term on the market is lower than the price of a real estate.</seg>
<seg>Probably, the offset will not appear as of the first day of the real transactions, but it should occur at the end of a few months.</seg>
<seg>We could need offset so some of these markets fulfill indeed their functions.</seg>
<seg>Everyone knows that these cities knew an enormous real boom during these last years (it is a generalized world phenomenon besides).</seg>
<seg>The international investors do not seem very inclined to invest in these cities, without the prospect for a fall of the prices based on the futures markets. The inhabitants of Tokyo learned it with their costs.</seg>
<seg>However, if the offset is sufficiently important, even the investors who estimate that the American real estate market is in full decline will be able to always await a good return of the real prices in the long term, because they profit already from a less price on the futures market.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, the New Yorkeans will require to carry out some adjustments to cover their own real investments, if they want to sell contracts in the long term involving a fall of the prices naturally.</seg>
<seg>They will have to be made with the idea that the market already anticipated this decline and that they can be protected only from the negligible potential margin which exceeds this anticipation.</seg>
<seg>In fact, such adjustments in our way of thinking will occur undoubtedly if one attentively observes the future prices of the market.</seg>
<seg>Until now, the trend of the prices of the real estate primarily was the result of various opinions.</seg>
<seg>When the markets create an international consensus about the prices of the residences in all the big cities of the world, it will be easier to manage the risks than they meet while stabilizing on the one hand, their economies and on the other hand, our own standards of living.</seg>
<seg>But what makes move the markets?</seg>
<seg>Since May 10 approximately, the majority of the worldwide markets showed strong cumulative declines, in particular in the two weeks around on May 23, with on average of the courses which persist with the fall.</seg>
<seg>Is concern on the world stockmarkets synonymous with concern for the economy of the world?</seg>
<seg>Let us consider the most marked falls.</seg>
<seg>Among the principal countries, the most impressive crash landing is that of India, where the courses fell of 16,9% between on May 10 and on May 22.</seg>
<seg>The rout on other side of the sphere took as much width almost. There, the tops and bottoms had only a few days of shift with those of India: in Argentina, the courses fell of 16,1%, in Brazil of 14,7% and Mexico of 13,8%.</seg>
<seg>The European markets them also wiped large losses.</seg>
<seg>In Sweden, the courses tumbled down of 15,2% between on May 9 and on May 22; practically over the same period, they fell of 9,7% in Germany, 9,4% in France and in the United Kingdom and 9,3% in Italy.</seg>
<seg>In Asia, the courses dropped by 11,5% in Korea, 9,3% in HongKong and 8% in Japan about over the same period.</seg>
<seg>Many commentators try to associate these events with the situation in the United States.</seg>
<seg>However, the American courses did not show that a fall of 5,2% between the 9 and on May 24.</seg>
<seg>China does not seem either to be behind this world decline since the courses increased over there for this period.</seg>
<seg>The standard explanations of the economists relate to the monetary policies.</seg>
<seg>In the wake of the great fear of the deflation of 2003, the central banks of the whole world reduced interest rates, causing speculative explosions on the real estate markets and with the purse.</seg>
<seg>But today, if one believes this point of view of it, interest rates in increase start to make effect, which lets predict new declines on the markets.</seg>
<seg>There is without any doubt an important element of truth in this argumentation.</seg>
<seg>The American Federal fund indeed increased its interest rates the 10 and its president, Ben Bernanke, then indicated that other increases could take place in the future.</seg>
<seg>On May 17, an aggravation of the American data was announced, which lets suppose future monetary hardenings.</seg>
<seg>The economists like to think that the world is logical and gérable, which implies that they include/understand what occurs there.</seg>
<seg>But by doing this, they often exaggerate the role of the central banks.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the increase in the American rates nothing but did fall under a whole series of increases in rate -- 16th of at a stretch.</seg>
<seg>No other central large bank increased its rates after the beginning of the decline of the stockmarkets in May until June 7, date on which several put themselves there (the European Central bank, India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).</seg>
<seg>Another factor: the oil price, which increased by 24% between on March 22 and on May 2, beating all its records.</seg>
<seg>Here are which was going without any doubt to constitute an major event able to influence the markets of the whole world.</seg>
<seg>The increases in the oil price play the part of the culprit in practically all the economic recessions since the Second world war.</seg>
<seg>And yet, the flights of the oil price do not correspond to the moment when the stock exchange courses fell the most, in mid-May.</seg>
<seg>To advance that these increases caused the declines of the markets supposes a shift of several weeks.</seg>
<seg>But the stockmarkets are not very logical, and an answer shifted to the shock of the oil price could be possible.</seg>
<seg>As for all the courses in any financial market, an increase always draws the attention.</seg>
<seg>When the oil prices increase quickly, people look at information which speaks and discusses it between them these increases, creating by themselves a sensitivity increased to this news.</seg>
<seg>The crisis in the Middle East is related to the oil prices, and it constituted the dominant information of May.</seg>
<seg>Signs the bad one forecasts and the language extremely used by various political personalities could be amplified in the spirit of the investors by the increases in the oil prices.</seg>
<seg>On May 8, the Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres, in reaction to the hostile declarations of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, struck that “the Iranian president should remember that Iran also could be striped chart.”</seg>
<seg>In the same way, around the beginning of the stock exchange fall of May, Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia, the country cash the greatest number of Moslems in the world, and the newspapers reported on May 13 that it had received a true ovation on behalf of students of two of the best universities of the country.</seg>
<seg>This history can be interpreted as the proof that the strategy of the tightrope of Ahmadinejad in the nuclear field brings political dividends to him, feeding the perception which the situation tended to the Middle East could lead to other increases in the oil price.</seg>
<seg>These articles of newspapers can seem much further away from the stockmarkets than the monetary policy.</seg>
<seg>But the public reaction that they cause, as well as the recent increases in the oil prices, could enter for a good measure the change of the psychology of the market.</seg>
<seg>The attitudes vis-a-vis the risk change with time, and of the events like the remarks D Ahmedinejad and Fathers can precipitate these changes.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, although these events are difficult to quantify, perhaps the analysts should pay as an great attention to the words of Ahmadinejad as with those of Bernanke when they try to include/understand the direction which take the world stockmarkets.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the economists do not like to concentrate on the mentality of the public and the way in which it interacts with the fluctuations in prices, the news world and speculative dynamics.</seg>
<seg>That would imply indeed that the economic events are less foreseeable (and omniscient economists) than they do not enjoy to imagine it.</seg>
<seg>However, from an intuitive point of view it would be logical to do it.</seg>
<seg>What is there really in the head of the investors?</seg>
<seg>Ahmadinejad is a charismatic character, not Bernanke.</seg>
<seg>Ahmadinejad embarks in an adventure, not Bernanke.</seg>
<seg>And, perhaps most important, Ahmadinejad exerts a destabilizing influence, not Bernanke.</seg>
<seg>Whatever their cause with final, the world stock exchange falls of mid-May indicate a psychology of unstable market.</seg>
<seg>Difficult to believe that they were dependent only on opinions concerning of possible monetary policies, and not with vaster and major questions, in particular relating to energy and the political tension, who are the bases of the performances of the worldwide economy.</seg>
<seg>Why pay more for the equitable trade?</seg>
<seg>Marks & Spencer, the chain of supermarkets and clothing owner of 400 stores through Great Britain, has just announced that she was going to convert her complete range of coffees and teas including/understanding 38 different products with the label “Equitable trade”, the symbol marketing of the “ethical production”.</seg>
<seg>The chain sells already only and bearing coffee this label in these 200 coffee stores “Coffee Lives again”.</seg>
<seg>She also encourages the purchase of shirts and other goods worked out starting from cotton resulting from the equitable trade.</seg>
<seg>This advertisement took place during “About fifteen the Equitable trade”. During these two weeks of promotion of labeled products, meetings of presentation were organized with producers of the countries in the process of development in order to explain to the British how this form of trade helped their communities.</seg>
<seg>The movement towards a more ethical consumption also knows an signification advance in the United States. The consumers turn more and more worms of food biological or produced locally, such as hen eggs raised in freedom.</seg>
<seg>In the United Kingdom, a study showed that more than 50% of the questioned people recognized the symbol of the equitable trade and understood that the products carrying this label more observed the work conditions of the producers of the Third world.</seg>
<seg>There does not exist currently any study comparable with the United States, but the reported data and the discussions that I had with my own students let think that the figure would be low for the Americans.</seg>
<seg>The tradesmen eager to obtain certification Equitable trade must pour with the producers a price covering the costs of a durable production and sufficient wages to live.</seg>
<seg>For example, the minimal course for a coffee pound is of $1,26, it does not matter the fall of the level of the market price.</seg>
<seg>If the market price exceeds this figure, the tariff relating to the equitable trade will increase in order to remain higher of 5 hundreds/delivers.</seg>
<seg>As regards the small producers, they must be organized in co-operatives or other types of groups allowing a democratic participation.</seg>
<seg>The plantations and the factories can claim label Equitable trade if they offer decent wages to their workmen, if they conform to the medical standards, environmental and of safety, if they authorize the trade unionism or any other form of associations of workers, if they provide a worthy lodging to the workmen who work far from on their premises and if they use neither the forced labor, nor infantile work.</seg>
<seg>However, everyone does not approve the equitable trade.</seg>
<seg>Brink Lindsey, Director of the center of studies on the marketing policies of Cato Institute, organization pro-market, estimates that the countryside for the coffee labellized Equitable trade is a “paved dead end of good intentions”.</seg>
<seg>He is explained by justifying that the true cause of the fall of the courses of the coffee does not lie in the realization of excessive benefit by the multinationals, but in the considerable rise of the production of coffee in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with the novel methods allowing the culture coffee-plantation while working less and consequently, with lower costs.</seg>
<seg>From the point of view of Lindsey, if we want to help the coffee farmers, we must encourage them to give up the coffee to turn to more advantageous cultures -- he insists here, rightly, on the commercial restrictions imposed by the rich countries and on the subsidies which constitute obstacles having to be removed -- or worms of the products of high added value, such as the special coffees which can be paid expensive.</seg>
<seg>What is strange in the argumentation of Lindsey, however, it is that the countryside for the equitable coffee seems to do exactly what it recommends, i.e. to encourage the coffee farmers to produce special coffees being able to be paid more expensive.</seg>
<seg>The economists pro-market do not oppose the companies which openly use the attraction of the luxury to promote their products.</seg>
<seg>So people are ready to spend $48 for a coffee pound Jamaican Blue Mountain, because it is the preferred coffee of James Bond, the economists do not estimate, in this case, that the market is distorted.</seg>
<seg>Then, why be so critical towards the consumers who wish to pay $12 for a coffee pound of which they know that it was cultivated without pesticide, under ombrageux trees favorable to the survival of the birds, by producers who can from now on nourish and educate decently their children?</seg>
<seg>The economists could retort with that if one wants to help people to nourish and educate their children, it is possible to buy an not-equitable coffee pound to the identical taste for $10 and to pour the $2 remainders at an charity association which distributes food and provides education for the poor children.</seg>
<seg>It is indeed a possible strategy. However, the equitable trade has true advantages.</seg>
<seg>The producers know that they must manufacture an appreciated coffee of the consumers not only for his taste, but also for the way in which it is cultivated.</seg>
<seg>If their coffee is sold well, they are proud to have manufactured a product sought in the whole world.</seg>
<seg>From the point of view of the farmers, to receive a premium by selling a labeled product Equitable trade is preferable with obtaining a caritative help which they would receive in any case, that they work or not and whatever the quality of their production.</seg>
<seg>To pay more for one labeled product Equitable trade is not more “anti-market” that to spend more to buy a Gucci high-class product.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, this label reflects better ethical priorities.</seg>
<seg>It does not consist only of one subsidy granted by the governments, its success depend on the political lobbysme and market demand not.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately, in Europe, this request grows quickly.</seg>
<seg>Let us hope that it will quickly reach such levels everywhere in the developed countries, where the consumers can decide with their own way the manner of spending their money.</seg>
<seg>Calves, pigs and the American democracy</seg>
<seg>Among the beachcomber of the titles on the return of the democratic majority to the Congress after the elections of November, the result of an important poll is largely unperceived past.</seg>
<seg>Although it clarified the defects of the American political system, it also allowed me to again accept the compassion ordinary American citizens.</seg>
<seg>In Arizona, the citizens can, if they joined together a sufficient number of signatures, submit a bill to the direct popular vote.</seg>
<seg>This year, one of the questions subjected by the popular vote was a law in order to prohibit that the sows gestantes, or the calves raised for the meat, are strapped or confined in a manner which prevents them from being turned freely, of lying down or of extending their members.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps those which do not know the methods of intensive breeding will astonish by the need for such a legislation.</seg>
<seg>The traditional breeding, such as it was practised everywhere in the world fifty years ago, and in certain countries today still, makes it possible the animals to move and to be stretched.</seg>
<seg>But today, nearly 90 percent of reproductive sows -- mothers of the pigs high and shot down for the meat, bacon and ham -- pass the essence of their life in stalls which measure approximately 60 centimetres by 2,2 meters.</seg>
<seg>They can neither be turned, neither to extend their legs once lying, nor to advance or move back of more than one step.</seg>
<seg>They are also sometimes strapped to limit their movements.</seg>
<seg>Same manner, the calves are confined their life lasting in boxings individual where they cannot be turned over, to lie down or stretch themselves.</seg>
<seg>Essentially, these methods aim to save the costs of labour. They facilitate the management of the animals and make it possible to employ less workmen, and less qualified.</seg>
<seg>They also prevent the animals from wasting energy while being déplaçdant or while fighting between them.</seg>
<seg>A few years ago, following protests of the defense organizations of the animals, the Commission of the European Union asked a report/ratio the Permanent veterinary committee of the EU on the methods of intensive breeding.</seg>
<seg>The conclusions of the report indicate that the animals suffer to be able to move and of the trouble not to have anything to make whole days.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the simple good sense makes it possible to arrive at the same conclusions.</seg>
<seg>Giving following the report/ratio, the EU fixed the dates from which the containment of the livestock will be prohibited.</seg>
<seg>For calves, on January 1, 2007.</seg>
<seg>The individual stalls for sows, already prohibited in the United Kingdom and in Sweden, will be banished as from 2013 in all the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Measurements to improve the wellbeing of layers, high out of battery in cages out of lattice without enough of place to extend their wings, are also applied gradually.</seg>
<seg>In the United States, nothing the kind is envisaged.</seg>
<seg>Previously, when my European friends asked me why the United States showed such a delay in the wellbeing of the livestock compared to Europe, I could only answer.</seg>
<seg>If they insisted, I was to acknowledge well that a possible explanation was that the Americans worried less about the animals than Europeans.</seg>
<seg>Then, in 2002, defense associations of the animals managed to make submit to the popular vote a proposal for a prohibition of the individual stalls for sows in Florida.</seg>
<seg>With the general surprise, the proposal was accepted by 55 percent of the voters.</seg>
<seg>Last month in Arizona, in spite of an opposition liberally financed by agribusiness industry, the prohibition of boxings of containment for calves and the pigs was also approved, by 62 percent of the voters.</seg>
<seg>Neither Florida, nor Arizona are States particularly progressists -- both voted for George W. Bush against John Kerry in 2004.</seg>
<seg>The results of these two popular votes thus suggest strongly which if all the Americans were to come to a conclusion about the maintenance of the sows gestantes and calves in containment, a vast majority would oppose it.</seg>
<seg>In the final analysis, it seems that the Americans are worried very as much as Europeans of the living conditions of the livestock.</seg>
<seg>To explain the difference between the wellbeing of the animals in breeding in Europe and in the United States, the political systems undoubtedly should be compared.</seg>
<seg>In Europe, the concerns of the voters concerning the living conditions of the animals found an echo among members of the National parliaments and the European Parliament, with for consequence the adoption of national legislations and directives of the EU to improve their fate.</seg>
<seg>In the United States on the other hand, these same concerns did not have any visible effect on the members of the Congress.</seg>
<seg>There exists any federal legislation on the wellbeing of the livestock and so to speak no legislation on the level of the States.</seg>
<seg>Àb my opinion, tens of million dollars of agribusiness industry empochés by the representatives seeking to be re-elected there is for something.</seg>
<seg>The movement of defense of the animals, in spite of a strong popular support, does not make the weight in the arena of the political lobbying and the electoral donations.</seg>
<seg>In the American electoral races, the money counts more than the opinion of the voters.</seg>
<seg>The discipline of party is weak and the congressmen must join together themselves the main part of the required funds to their re-election -- in fact, every two years for the members of the Room of the representatives.</seg>
<seg>In Europe, where the discipline of the parties is respected and where parties, and not the candidates, finance the electoral campaigns, the money plays a less important part.</seg>
<seg>In the United States, a proud country of its democratic tradition, the calves and the pigs is not the only losers by far.</seg>
<seg>What is nine on the new army entirely made up of Afghans?</seg>
<seg>The assassination of the Afghan Minister for Aviation by a crowd (perhaps incited by the members of the proper temporary administration of Afghanistan) watch which the Afghan company remains deeply fissured.</seg>
<seg>The first reforms on the Afghan army will do nothing but accentuate these divisions.</seg>
<seg>The Minister for the Defense of the temporary administration of Hamid Karzai to Kabul already appointed the senior officers of this new army.</seg>
<seg>The minister, the general Mohammed Fahim, is an Inhabitant of Tajik of the district of Panjshir in the North, which became three months earlier the chief of the forces of the Alliance of north which captured Kabul after the American bombers cleared the way to them.</seg>
<seg>As a group, its assignment constitutes a direct challenge with the objective of reunification of the country of Mr. Karzai.</seg>
<seg>Afghanistan is an pluri-ethnic nation, the most important group being Pashtounes, which represents the two fifths of the total population.</seg>
<seg>Hazaras and Tajiks constitute a fifth of the population respectively.</seg>
<seg>On the thirty-eight officers raised with the row of general by Mr. Fahim, thirty-seven are of Tajiks, the thirty-eighth being Uzbek.</seg>
<seg>If, on the fifteen to seventeen million Pashtounes of the country, some are recruited like soldiers, they will be useful under a structure of command almost entirely made up of Tajiks.</seg>
<seg>The language of Pashtounes differs however tajik like Spanish and English, and of the million Pashtounes reaching the age of the military service only some concepts of tajik have as well as possible.</seg>
<seg>The geographical profile of the new military authority is as restricted as its ethnic composition.</seg>
<seg>Thirty-five on the thirty-eight senior officers are originating in a small zone in the north of Kabul including/understanding the province of Parwan (where the airport of Bagram is located) and it near valley to Panjshir, along the bastion of the Alliance of north.</seg>
<seg>In other words, the potential chiefs originating in twenty-seven in the twenty-nine provinces in Afghanistan were excluded from the new military elite from their country.</seg>
<seg>A so restricted group could perhaps overcome the impression which its members are one clicks closed if they represented a broad sample of the dozen political parties of the country.</seg>
<seg>But it is not the case.</seg>
<seg>Eighteen of the thirty-eight senior officers come from only one party, Jamiat-e-Islami, the Islamic faction which was directed a long time by mollah and former professor of theology Burhanuddin Rabbani.</seg>
<seg>It was this party which controlled Kabul a short moment in the middle of the years 1990, creating carnage and the chaos which led the majority of Afghan to accomodate the arrival of the Talibans.</seg>
<seg>The Communists equalize practically the number of the members of Jamiat in the military hierarchy.</seg>
<seg>Sixteen of the thirty-eight officers were aligned a long time on this party whose tricks at the end of years 1970 led to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89 which cost two million and half of Afghan lives.</seg>
<seg>The majority of the Afghans consider today the Communists with the same degree of sympathy that the Czechs or the Poles reserve to the national Socialists of Hitler.</seg>
<seg>It is true that Afghans, like everywhere else, joined the Communist party for various reasons and that they were not to in no case all of the hardened ideologists.</seg>
<seg>But in the case of the generals of the general Fahim, six were professional workers of the Communist party and continued to serve the Party after the invasion of the Red Army.</seg>
<seg>These six men, plus three Communists who were useful as officers in the Afghan army, collaborated actively during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which lasted one decade.</seg>
<seg>Imagine how the French would have reacted if a quarter of the body of the French officers of the after-second world war had lined up side of Wehrmacht while this one occupied their country.</seg>
<seg>In Afghanistan, the news travels quickly by the word of mount.</seg>
<seg>The Afghan nationalists (i.e. almost all Afghans) will discover soon the political reasons of the members of the intimate circle of the Fahim general, if it is not already done.</seg>
<seg>Even this crushing proof of partiality and prejudice in the formation of the high command of the new army could be neutralized if the generals integrated a professionalism and an engagement towards the patriotic values of really national armed forces in their task.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, only ten of the thirty-eight officers promoted by Fahim received a training of professional military officers.</seg>
<seg>One eleventh was useful as a pilot.</seg>
<seg>By contrast, twenty-four on the thirty-eight generals (the trainings of the four remaining generals remain unknown) are civilians, who had a profession, which comes from the offices of the Communist party or, in a case, which were mollah.</seg>
<seg>What means all these statistics in terms of daily reality?</seg>
<seg>They mean that when the chiefs of the international forces of maintenance of peace in Afghanistan, as well as the official soldiers and diplomatic American, meet the Afghan deputy minister of Defense, they meet Abdul Rashid Dostum, a lord of the war and a manifestly brutal and corrupted Communist who remains in liaison with former friends of the Red Army who are always used for Moscow.</seg>
<seg>That means that the chief of the Afghan armed forces as well as the chief of the operations and the chief of the intelligence service of the army are also communist, of the men whose honesty remain dubious and of which many Afghans are wary.</seg>
<seg>Is this team likely to unify Afghanistan torn by the war?</seg>
<seg>Is the presence in Kabul of a so doubtful team likely to insufflate confidence at the three-quarters of the Afghan population which are excluded from the military high command?</seg>
<seg>Or does this list rather constitute the harvest of an approach “very for the winner” of the government which is obliged (at a certain point in the future) to make unchain another national bloody reaction by those whose legitimate interests were cynically trampled?</seg>
<seg>UNO and the political officials European and American must meditate on these questions before granting a catch to be able relentless by a small unpopular minority.</seg>
<seg>Celebration of the irrational one</seg>
<seg>Hurrah for the new prizes winner of the Nobel Prize of economy: Daniel Kahneman of the university of Princeton and Vernon Smith of the university George Mason of Virginia.</seg>
<seg>Like many Nobel Prize, these rewards recognize not only the work determining undertaken by Misters Kahneman and Smith, but also the schools of thought which they helped to develop.</seg>
<seg>Misters Kahneman, psychologist, showed that the individuals behave systematically in a way less traditional than the traditional economists think it.</seg>
<seg>Its work shows not only that the individuals act sometimes differently of the standard economic theoretical predictions, but also that they do it regularly, systematically, and in a manner which can be included/understood and interpreted through different assumptions which enter in competition with those used by the traditional economists.</seg>
<seg>For the majority of the actors of the market, and in fact of the ordinary observers, that does not seem to make great difference.</seg>
<seg>The brokers of Wall Street which make traffic with actions which they can be bad exploit the irrational one that Misters Kahneman and Smith showed.</seg>
<seg>Most of the passion which led to the swelling of the markets was based on the exploitation of psychology of the investors.</seg>
<seg>In fact, this irrationality is not new either for the economists.</seg>
<seg>John Maynard Keynes formerly described the purse like not being founded on the fight of rational individuals to discover the bases of the markets, but rather as in a beauty contest in which gaining is that which guesses best those that the judges will say.</seg>
<seg>The Nobel Prize of this year celebrates the criticism of the simplistic market economy, just like that of last year (which I received with two other colleagues).</seg>
<seg>The prizes winner of last year stressed the fact that the various actors of the market have different information (and imperfect), and that this asymmetry of information has an impact marked on the operation of the economy.</seg>
<seg>More particularly, the prizes winner of last year implied that the markets are in general not effective; that it remains with the governments a great role to play.</seg>
<seg>The invisible hand of Adam Smith, the idea that the free trade leads to the effectiveness as guided by an invisible hand, is invisible partly only because it does not exist.</seg>
<seg>That, also, is not a new fact for those which work daily with the markets (and make fortune while benefitting from this asymmetry of information and by exceeding it).</seg>
<seg>For more than twenty years, the economists have impassioned themselves for these so-called models “of rational forecasts” which left the principle that all the actors have same information (even imperfect) and act in a perfectly rational way, that the markets are perfectly effective, that it there forever no unemployment (except when it is caused by avid trade unions or the minimal wages imposed by the governments), and that it there forever no rationing of the financings.</seg>
<seg>Such models are prevalent, particularly in the courses of third cycle in the United States, in spite of the evidence of the opposite which shows the triumph of the ideology on science.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, the students of these programs of higher education are today the decision makers of many countries and they try to set up programs based on these ideas, which one calls today the fundamentalism of market.</seg>
<seg>Allow me to be well clearly here: the rational forecasting models contributed in an important way to the economic theory; the rigour that their defenders imposed on the economic thinking made it possible to clarify the weakness of many subjacent assumptions.</seg>
<seg>Very good scientific thought can recognize its limits, but the prophets of the rational forecasts generally showed little modesty.</seg>
<seg>Vernon Smith is one of the leaders of the development of the experimental economy, the idea that one can test many economic proposals in a laboratory.</seg>
<seg>One of the reasons which make that the economy is a so complex subject, which explains also the many dissensions between the economists, comes owing to the fact that the economists cannot undertake controlled experiments.</seg>
<seg>Nature unbalances the experiments life size, but in the majority of the circumstances, as well of things can change so quickly as it is often difficult to disentangle the causes of the consequences.</seg>
<seg>In theory, in a laboratory, one can undertake controlled experiments, and of this fact of releasing from the more reliable inférences.</seg>
<seg>Criticisms of the experimental economy worry owing to the fact that the subjects bring to the experimental contexts ways of thinking determined outside the experiment, and that thus the experiments and the inférences are not also detached and clear only in physical sciences.</seg>
<seg>Nevertheless, the economic experiments bring a certain knowledge of a big number of questions, such as the design improved of the biddings.</seg>
<seg>Over all, the irrationality of the actors of the market, the principal question of work of Misters Kahneman, was checked in a way repeated in the context of the laboratories.</seg>
<seg>One of the results more amusing released by the experimental economy concerns the altruism and selfishness.</seg>
<seg>It would seem (at least in the experimental situations) that the experimental subjects are not as egoistic as the economists think it, except a group: that of the economists himself.</seg>
<seg>Would this be because the economy is a discipline which attracts individuals who are, by nature, egoists or because the economy makes it possible to mould the individuals of kind to make them more egoistic?</seg>
<seg>The answer, certainly, holds surely a little of both.</seg>
<seg>There is not any doubt that experimental research and future work will make it possible to solve this question of the relative importance of these two assumptions.</seg>
<seg>The Nobel Prize shows how much it is important to study the individuals and the economies such as they are and not as we want to see them.</seg>
<seg>It is only by including/understanding best the real human behaviors that we can hope to design policies which will also make it possible to better do to function our economies.</seg>
<seg>Bush and her energy policy insincerely</seg>
<seg>An episode of most surrealist occurred, this year, during the World economic forum in Davos. Experts of oil industry explained there that the cast iron of the polar icecap -- much faster than all the announced forecasts  -- do not constitute only one problem, but also a chance in what enormous news quantities of oil will be from now on accessible.</seg>
<seg>In the same way, these specialists recognized that the refusal of the United States to sign the Law of the Sea, the international convention which determines the accesses to the sources of offshore oil rig oil like to the other maritime mineral resources, represents a risk of international conflict.</seg>
<seg>However, they also insisted on the advantages: oil industry, in its ceaseless search of new reserves, does not need to beg the Congress to obtain the right to plunder Alaska.</seg>
<seg>President George W. Bush has a strange capacity not to include/understand the important messages.</seg>
<seg>Since years, it is increasingly obvious that its energy policy does not turn out badly.</seg>
<seg>Certain members of its party refer even to an old energy bill, written by oil industry, as being very advantageous for all the lobbyists.</seg>
<seg>While carrying to naked the virtues of the market economy, the only objective of Bush consists in granting enormous subsidies to oil industry, in spite of the increasing deficits to which the country must face.</seg>
<seg>However, the market does not function correctly when it is question of energy. The intervention of the government should take a completely opposite direction with that which the Bush administration proposed.</seg>
<seg>The fact that the Americans do not pay the price of pollution -- and especially of their enormous production of gas with greenhouse effect -- resulting from their energy wastings involves a devaluation of the price of energy and blow, an excessive consumption.</seg>
<seg>The government must encourage energy saving. Its intervention on the fixing of the prices, primarily by the means of the energy taxes, is an effective method to do it.</seg>
<seg>But, instead of supporting Bush, energy saving heading in a policy which consists with “initially draining America” of its own resources, making it even more dependent in the future on the external oil resources.</seg>
<seg>It does not matter that a strong demand makes climb the oil prices and thus creates a basket for many countries of the Middle East, which are not the best friends of America.</seg>
<seg>From now on, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it seems that Bush finally took the measurement of the increasing energy dependence of America. It had become difficult for him not to realize consequences of the which gallops rise of the oil prices.</seg>
<seg>But, once again, the hesitant gestures of its government will not fail to worsen the problems in an immediate future.</seg>
<seg>Bush still refuses to act in favour of energy saving and expenditure finally very little money to support her continual prayer of technological hello.</seg>
<seg>What to make, then, of the recent declaration of Bush on her engagement to reduce, in the 25 years, the oil dependence of America on the Middle East of 75%?</seg>
<seg>For the investors, the message is clear: do not invest any more in the new reserves of the Middle East, which are by far the least expensive oil resources of the world.</seg>
<seg>However, if there is not a new investment in the reserves of the Middle East, the unrestrained growth of energy consumption in the United States, in China and elsewhere implies that demand exceeds.</seg>
<seg>And to crown the whole, the threats of sanction of Bush against Iran could cause the interruption of the provisioning of the one of the largest producers of the world.</seg>
<seg>With a world level of production of oil quasi to its maximum and prices having almost doubled since the war in Iraq, this lets predict prices even higher and still more profits for the oil industry, the only true winner of the policy of Bush to the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>At all events, nobody should reproach Bush for having recognized that there was a problem.</seg>
<seg>But, like always, its proposals anything else constitute only one small round of sleight of hand of its administration.</seg>
<seg>In addition to its refusal to admit the warming of planet, to encourage energy saving or to allocate sufficient funds to advance research, the great promise of Bush to reduce the American dependence vis-a-vis the oil of the Middle East does not mean large thing.</seg>
<seg>With only 20% of American oil extracted in the Middle East, the objective of Bush could simply be reached by modestly increasing the provisioning coming from the other areas of the world.</seg>
<seg>The Bush administration must absolutely carry out that oil benefits from the worldwide market.</seg>
<seg>Even if America were completely independent of the oil of the Middle East, the reduction of the energy production of this area would have devastators effects on the world prices and a fortiori on the US economy.</seg>
<seg>As that is too often the case with the Bush government, there is no clear explanation of the official policy.</seg>
<seg>Is Bush playing with the policy by agitating the feeling anti-Arabic and anti-Iranian of the Americans?</seg>
<seg>Or is this still another example of incompetence and confusion?</seg>
<seg>According to what us considering these five last years, the answer right contains certainly more than a little insincerely and of pure silly thing.</seg>
<seg>The roadmap of China</seg>
<seg>China is about to adopt its 11th five-year plan, drawing up the decoration to prolong what is undoubtedly the most remarkable transformation economic of the history, while improving the wellbeing of almost a quarter of the world population.</seg>
<seg>Never before the world had known such a durable growth; never before it had had such a reduction of poverty there.</seg>
<seg>The explanation of the long-term success of China holds partially in its single association of pragmatism and vision of the future.</seg>
<seg>Whereas most of the rest of the world under development, according to the Consensus of Washington, is launched in a search of increase in GDP worthy of Don Quichotte, China once more established clearly that she sought durable and more equitable increases real standards of living.</seg>
<seg>China realizes that it entered a phase of economic growth imposing of enormous requirements on the environment which will not be able to last.</seg>
<seg>Unless changing trajectory, the standards of living will end up being compromised.</seg>
<seg>For this reason the new five-year plan stresses really the environment.</seg>
<seg>Many areas of China among latest knew a growth so fast that one would shout with the wonder so of other parts of the country still did not know a faster growth.</seg>
<seg>Whereas this phenomenon reduced poverty, the inequalities increased, with disparities growing between rural areas and urban, and areas of the coasts and the interior.</seg>
<seg>The report/ratio of this year of the World Bank World Development Report explains why the inequality, and not only poverty, should raise concerns; however the 11th five-year plan of China attacks the problem frontally.</seg>
<seg>The government has evoked for several years a more harmonious company, and the plan describes ambitious programs to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg>China also recognizes that what separates the least developed countries the most developed countries is not only one disparity of resources but also of knowledge.</seg>
<seg>It thus drew up daring projects to reduce these disparities and to create a base allowing an independent innovation.</seg>
<seg>The role of China in the world and the worldwide economy changed, and the plan reflects also this situation.</seg>
<seg>Its future growth will have to be based more on the domestic request that on exports, which implies an increase in consumption.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, China suffers from a rare problem: an excessive saving.</seg>
<seg>People save partly because of weaknesses in the programmes of Social Security of the government: to reinforce the social security (retirements), the public health and education will reduce simultaneously the social inequalities, will increase the feeling of wellbeing of the citizens and will support everyday consumption.</seg>
<seg>If that functioned (and until now China almost always exceeded even its clean high hopes) these adjustments could impose enormous pressures on a world economic system already destabilized by enormous fiscal imbalances and commercial of the United States.</seg>
<seg>If China puts itself at less saving -- and if, like announced it its representatives, it continues more diversified policy of investment of its reserves, which will finance the trade deficit of more than 2 billion dollars per day the United States?</seg>
<seg>It is a subject to approach another day, but this day is perhaps not so remote.</seg>
<seg>With such a clear vision of the future, the challenge will lie in the application.</seg>
<seg>China is a large country, which could not have succeeded as well without a vast decentralization.</seg>
<seg>But decentralization poses its own problems.</seg>
<seg>The gases with greenhouse effect, for example, are world problems.</seg>
<seg>Whereas America proclaims that it does not have the means of doing anything on this subject, the Chinese senior officials acted in a more responsible way.</seg>
<seg>In the one month space after the adoption of the plan, of new ecological taxation of the cars, the kind and the products of the wood were imposed: China uses the mechanisms of the market to solve its environmental problems and those of the world.</seg>
<seg>But the pressures on the persons in charge of the local governments so that they create economic growth and employment will be enormous.</seg>
<seg>They will be very tempted to say that if America is not able to produce in order to protect our planet, how they could it?</seg>
<seg>To translate this vision into acts, the Chinese government will need strong policies, in particular of consequent increases in the taxes on the environment.</seg>
<seg>While China transformed itself into an market economy, she saw developing certain problems which are the plague of the developed countries: specific interests dissimulating of the personal interests under a mask of ideology of market.</seg>
<seg>Some will evoke the trickle-down effect: of made you not for the poor, with final everyone will end up profiting from the growth.</seg>
<seg>And others will oppose the policies of competition and the strict laws of governorship of company: let the Darwinism operate its wonders.</seg>
<seg>Arguments of growth will be advanced to counter strong industrial relations policies and environmental: for example, to increase the taxation of the gasoline our incipient auto industry will kill.</seg>
<seg>Such so-called policies pro-growth would not only fail to provide growth, they would threaten totality of the vision of the future of China.</seg>
<seg>There is only one way of avoiding that: the open discussion of the economic policies in order to reveal sophisms and to give the means of implementing creative solutions for the many challenges which China must take up today.</seg>
<seg>George W. Bush showed as it is dangerous to misuse the secrecy and to restrict decision making with a narrow circle of sycophantes.</seg>
<seg>The majority of people out of China do not realize at which point its leaders, contrary, engaged in wide deliberations and vast consultations (even with foreigners) whereas they fought to solve the enormous problem with which they are confronted.</seg>
<seg>The market economies are not self-regulating.</seg>
<seg>They cannot simply be left as an autopilot, especially if one wants to make sure that their benefit are largely shared.</seg>
<seg>But to manage an market economy is not thing easy.</seg>
<seg>It is an act of balance which must constantly react to the economic changes.</seg>
<seg>The 11th five-year plan of China provides a roadmap in this direction.</seg>
<seg>The world opens the eyes, full with hope and fear, while the lives of 1,3 billion people continue to be transformed.</seg>
<seg>Lessons on the democracy of Tocqueville</seg>
<seg>Because of war in Iraq, 200 years after the birth of Tocqueville, the world discusses the nature of the democracy.</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville is famous rightly to have rejected nostalgia reactionary by considering that the democracy was our destiny, alerting us however on the dangers which it conceals for freedom.</seg>
<seg>Do we have to share his concern?</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville initially did not consider the democracy a political system, but before just like a intellectual system which works the customs and habits of the company, thus allotting a sociological and psychological dimension to him.</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville estimated that the democratic regimes guide the course of our thoughts, our desires and our passions.</seg>
<seg>Just as there was the man of the Rebirth and with the XX° century the homo sovieticus, “the democratic man” is the shape of the human being.</seg>
<seg>For Tocqueville, the systemic effects of the democracy can lead the citizens to give up their faculty of reasoning.</seg>
<seg>They can only pretend to judge events and values by themselves, whereas in fact they are satisfied to repeat the reducing opinions of the majority.</seg>
<seg>What Tocqueville called the seizure of the “social capacity” on the opinion is undoubtedly stronger in the democratic regimes - a point of view which let predict the level of demagogy and handling by the media in the modern world.</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville thought that on the long run, nothing can be really opposed to this tendency.</seg>
<seg>Neither the local democracy, neither of small groups inside the company, neither the countervailing powers, nor the civil laws can prevent the decline of the critical thought only the democracy appears to generate.</seg>
<seg>The school as well as possible constitutes an enclave safe from the irresistible influence that the company exerts on the spirit.</seg>
<seg>Same manner, Tocqueville thought that the research of the virtue to the manner of Old or a religious faith could sometimes raise the heart, but one and the other is incompatible with the democratic ideal as from the moment when they are imposed by the authorities within the framework of the public life.</seg>
<seg>In this direction, the theorists néo-Marxists of the school of Frankfurt and Hannah Arendt which feared over all the disappearance of the reason in the modern societies are the heirs to the thought of Tocqueville.</seg>
<seg>One can also note that the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet entitled one of these recent books the democracy against itself.</seg>
<seg>For these authors, the democratic lifestyle tends to eliminate very thought original and to prevent the emergence of a culture of good level, yielding the place to a mediocrity which leaves the citizens vulnerable vis-a-vis the enemies of the democracy.</seg>
<seg>If the History abounds in criminal modes constant by intimidated and handled masses, the greatest risk of the democratic countries is to see their citizens sinking in the indifference and limiting themselves to a short-term thought, in the search for their immediate interest.</seg>
<seg>The past - in spite of the ritual ones which aims at the commemoration of the historical events - is masked by the dependence with regard to the moment present and of the last innovation.</seg>
<seg>Even the leading class, supposed educated well, is victim of this influence.</seg>
<seg>The main issue of democratic mentality lies in its lack of historical conscience.</seg>
<seg>As proclaimed it Tocqueville, do the defects of the democracy make pessimism resigned the only way - realistic but unacceptable - which opens with us?</seg>
<seg>I do not think it.</seg>
<seg>There exist means to fight what one could call “democratic stupidity” that one sees spreading today.</seg>
<seg>The first of these means is to develop an education system which forms true critical spirits, in particular through the largely neglected matter teaching (nowadays) which are the literature, the history and philosophy.</seg>
<seg>If one wants to train citizens informed and able to think by themselves, which is essential to the operation of the democracy, our schools must stop running after the latest fashions in progress and starting to develop the capacities of analysis of the pupils.</seg>
<seg>Because of their tendency to cultivate the surface one and the distraction, the mass media constitute the main obstacle with such an education.</seg>
<seg>Today, much from people more times during their life in front of such as in a classroom pass.</seg>
<seg>The passivity that the mass media induce with exact is opposed of the active engagement of the citizens, necessary to the democracy.</seg>
<seg>But it is difficult to imagine that the mass media (with share newspapers of quality) accept of their own liking to become the tools for an education which would develop the critical spirit of the citizens.</seg>
<seg>This focusing on the mass media does not translate a élitiste contempt for the popular culture.</seg>
<seg>It is not a question only of one question of popularity - Mozart was popular at his time and the parts of Shakespeare attracted the poor as much as the rich person - but of the refusal of the mass culture to call in question and to cause.</seg>
<seg>It results from it an indifference and a passivity generalized from the public.</seg>
<seg>For a long time, a mondialized media culture is spread more and more, incompetent to cause the least critical spirit or to raise the feelings.</seg>
<seg>Because of its disinterest for these questions, it is a culture which threatens the democratic liberties because it does not create in any way a direction of the duty with regard to the company, the history or the community.</seg>
<seg>Is it too late to defend oneself against a culture which blunts at this point the spirits?</seg>
<seg>Tocqueville scorned the elites of its time because of their kindness with regard to the dangers of the democracy of mass.</seg>
<seg>Will the myopia of our leaders support the realization of its worrying prophecy?</seg>
<seg>Europe for all</seg>
<seg>The members of long time of the European Union seem to doubt the future of the European Union, but the Ukrainians look at the European Union with a certain hope and a certain admiration.</seg>
<seg>The fundamental goal of our foreign politics is to integrate us into European progress, because the Ukraine discovered that national autonomy is not an end in itself but a simple beginning.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the European unit is indivisible: when a nation is victim of ostracism, no nation is free.</seg>
<seg>We are, Européens, all bound by a bond from which we cannot escape, dependent in a single destiny.</seg>
<seg>All the aspects of the culture which we share, without speaking about the century of sufferings which we have just shared, us confirm it.</seg>
<seg>All that assigns to an European affects us directly all indirectly.</seg>
<seg>We will be able to never again allow us to live with the narrow concepts of two Europes, Europe of secured and Europe by stripped, elected officials and outlaws.</seg>
<seg>Whoever lives on the continent of Europe today cannot, in fact does not have, being considered as a foreigner with his Union.</seg>
<seg>Large Pax Europa of today, just like current prosperity paneuropéenne, depends on it.</seg>
<seg>Some will say of course that the Ukraine does not form part of Europe.</seg>
<seg>That they come to Kiev and meet its inhabitants, young people and old man, the workmen, the wives of farmers, the lawyers and the doctors and the teachers who rose and remained upright in the cold and the snow of the weeks lasting to defend their freedoms last winter.</seg>
<seg>Aren't they plain with those which gathered around the de Gaulle general within French Resistance?</seg>
<seg>Don't they form a unit with those which died in the combat for the defense of the Spanish Republic in the years 1930, those which released Budapest in 1956 and reflect fine with Fascism in Spain and Portugal in the years 1970?</seg>
<seg>Aren't they animated a same spirit as that of the Polish trade union Solidarnösc and peaceful masses which started the velvet Revolution in Prague in 1989?</seg>
<seg>It is there the true heart of Europe and no doubt will be able to destroy it.</seg>
<seg>All those which consider that the Ukraine is too with the drag to become member of the Union, I will say this: that they also come them to visit my country and to see the mothers who remain until late at the office to teach with their children the use of the computer of their office.</seg>
<seg>That they come to attend the language classes of each village and city where our youth prepares for Europe by learning French, German and English.</seg>
<seg>Those which doubt the European vocation of the Ukraine should understand that Europe is not a simple matter of material and motorways: it is the insatiable desire of freedom, prosperity and solidarity.</seg>
<seg>I believe that our future is as promising as the past of Europe is proud, and than our intended is not that of a ground border forgotten in a disturbed area but that of an influential participant of peace and unit of Europe.</seg>
<seg>Self-determination is not synonymous any more with insulation because to arrive at national independence nowadays simply the return means on the world scene equipped with a new statute.</seg>
<seg>The new nations can build with their former occupants the same kind of profitable relation that France established with Germany: a relation based on the equality and the mutual interests.</seg>
<seg>It is the type of relation which my government wants to establish with Russia, thus we can help to extend the peace zone in Europe.</seg>
<seg>It is premature, of course, of going beyond the indication of the high consideration which we grant to the possibility of entering the European Union.</seg>
<seg>We know that our role in this large building will not be established in a night.</seg>
<seg>We know that great work of the European unification is not limited to the documents and the declarations but takes root in the innovative action conceived to improve the standards of living and to bring safety to all Europeans.</seg>
<seg>To build a worthy Ukraine to adhere to the European Union will be easy, neither fast, nor without effort.</seg>
<seg>But just like the European Union itself, that will be built and that will be done.</seg>
<seg>We know that the challenge is large but the game is worth the candle and Europe must understand that it is our objective there.</seg>
<seg>The restoration of the Ukraine passes partly by an innovative battle to put an end to one century nightmarish during which Fascism and Communism, of the ideologies born in the middle of Europe, clashed to seize the power.</seg>
<seg>Through the cities Ukrainian there are a few months still, parents and children faced armed troops, thundering dogs and even death.</seg>
<seg>It there has a few years only still, a young journalist, Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public on corruption of our old mode, was maltreated and decapitated by the henchmen of the mode.</seg>
<seg>Our Orange revolution, last winter, proved that the Ukraine and its people could carry it.</seg>
<seg>Thus, in spite of the doubts and the difficulties, I preserve a indéfectible confidence in Europe.</seg>
<seg>I refuse to accept despair like final answer to ambiguities and horrors of the history of the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg>I refuse to accept the idea that the Ukraine either so tragically condemned to live in the middle of the night without stars of the communist heritage at the point never to be able to see the point of the day of peace and a true European unit.</seg>
<seg>When the citizens of the European Union think of the place of the Ukraine in Europe, it will be necessary for them to consider closely and to know to look beyond the face that we will show them.</seg>
<seg>See beyond the devastated zones that Communism inflicted to us, beyond poverty and of social divisions through which our former leaders now repudiated sought to prolong their put hand.</seg>
<seg>It will rather be necessary for them to consider closely the face of our president, Victor Ioutchenko, devastated by the poison that one managed to him at the time of the electoral campaign of last year, and to remember the words of this large French that was André Malraux, for whom “the most beautiful faces is those that one wounded”.</seg>
<seg>The Moslem civil war</seg>
<seg>Is the gap between sunnites and Shiites in the Middle East now deeper than antagonism between Israel and the Arabs?</seg>
<seg>One could believe it by seeing the reaction of certain Arab governments in the decisions of Hezbollah to attack Israel.</seg>
<seg>Whereas the Israeli bombs fall on Beirut and Tyr, Saudi Arabia, perhaps the Moslem Arab state most preserving of all, openly condemned the acts of the Hezbollah Shiite which initiated the conflict against Israel.</seg>
<seg>Never before, in the history of the Israeli-Arab conflict, a State which regards as the leader of the people Arab Moslems had supported Israel so openly.</seg>
<seg>Moreover, the rupture of Saudi Arabia with Hezbollah is not a single case.</seg>
<seg>Egypt and Jordan also categorically condemned Hezbollah and its leader, the sheik Hassan Nasrallah, for their adventurism.</seg>
<seg>What is there behind this astonishing situation?</seg>
<seg>Do we Somme in the moment of living a fundamental turning in the relations between Arab nationalism and Islamic sectarianism?</seg>
<seg>Does the government sunnite of Saudi Arabia feel more fear and of concern in front of the Shiite Islam which it does not imply in the Arab unit and the Palestinian cause?</seg>
<seg>The denunciations of Hezbollah by Arabs suggest that the Moslem sectarian ditch, already obvious in daily violences in Iraq, grows hollow and intensifies through the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>The will of president George W. Bush to destroy the cold companies of the Arab world was condemned to draw up the forces of modernization against the traditional elements of the Islamic and Arab companies.</seg>
<seg>It seems in the place to have released the most atavistic forces of the area.</seg>
<seg>The opening of this Pandora's box could give rise to one era even more horrible of generalized violence, with what can be undoubtedly qualified only of “Moslem civil war.”</seg>
<seg>The ditch Shiite-sunnite exists since the paddle of the history of Islam, but the geographical and ethnic insulation of Shiite Iran not-Arabic, as well as the domination of their minorities Shiite by the Arab countries sunnites, generally left this competition in background.</seg>
<seg>These tensions moved back more at the time of the vagueness “of Islamization” created by the Iranian revolution, because in its wake the sectarian identity sunnite of the Arabs was more pushed back with the background as appeared a generalized “Islamic” assertion.</seg>
<seg>All that changed when Al Qaeda, a terrorist group sunnite which is inspired largely by the ideology and the personnel Saoudi wahabbites, launched its attacks against America in September 2001.</seg>
<seg>A branch specifically sunnite of Islam militant was moving.</seg>
<seg>When the United States launched wars at the same time against the Talibans sunnites to Afghanistan and the Iraqi mode sunnite, this new radical tendency sunnite acquired more audacity still.</seg>
<seg>The Arabs sunnites of the area, who from now on gained in insurance, see Israel and the Occident like only one threat, the other including/understanding the alleged one “growing Shiite” -- the ground arc which extends from Lebanon in Iran while passing by Syria and Iraq, inhabited by supposed the Shiite heretics.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps the leaders of Saudi Arabia, as guards of the crowned sites of the Moslem faith of Mecque and of Médine, feel this threat with more acuity.</seg>
<seg>For the sunnites, the Shiites are not satisfied to dominate the areas rich in oil of Iran, Iraq and the areas of the east of Saudi Arabia, they also test, by the acts of Hezbollah, to usurp the role of “guard” of the central dream of all the Arabs, the Palestinian cause.</seg>
<seg>It is because the Saoudi royal family derives her legitimacy from a strict form of Islam sunnite and questions the honesty of her population Shiite that the kingdom deviates from Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg>The irony of the thing, it is that America, protective of long time of Saudi Arabia, returned the catch of responsibility possible Shiite by reversing Saddam Hussein and by putting the Shiite parties at the capacity in Iraq.</seg>
<seg>The Bush administration seems to recognize what it did; as the Shiite arc rises in the east of the Arab Muslim world, the United States tries to consolidate their protection of the arc sunnite -- Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia -- in the west of the area.</seg>
<seg>Israel, formerly enemy relentless of the Arab cause, seems embedded today in this defensive structure.</seg>
<seg>But such a defensive position is inevitably unstable, by the only fact of the feelings panarabes.</seg>
<seg>Today, the ordinary Saoudi citizens do not take off of Al Jazeera and other Arab networks of TV per satellite to follow the events to Gaza and the south of Lebanon.</seg>
<seg>They see running Arab blood (not Shiite), and only Hezbollah to answer.</seg>
<seg>For them, Hezbollah became a heroic model of resistance.</seg>
<seg>This situation pushes the Saoudi State to increase the schism sunnite-Shiite.</seg>
<seg>After the official denunciation of Hezbollah by the kingdom, the Saoudi State asked its official clergy wahhabite to emit fatwas condemning Hezbollah as an heretic and a deviating Shiite.</seg>
<seg>Such judgments can only exacerbate sectarian divisions inside Saudi Arabia and in the area.</seg>
<seg>In front of will the aggravation of these antagonisms, the modes sunnites finish by believing that they need their own Hezbollah to fight in their corner?</seg>
<seg>If they arrive to this conclusion, they will not need to seek well far, because the combatants of this type already followed a drive - exempted by Al Qaeda.</seg>
<seg>Why Europe cannot be unaware of Georgia any more</seg>
<seg>The time when Europe could be pressed on America to make the war, to restore peace and the democracy in its own court is completed.</seg>
<seg>With the widening of the European Union, and like showed it the recent crisis of Russian gas, this court includes/understands now either only the Ukraine but also Georgia.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, in Georgia, as in Ukraine, the democracy is put to the test and Europe cannot allow itself to be unaware of it.</seg>
<seg>Georgia was the first country of space post-Soviet to make his “revolution of color” and to thus make the proof, with dignity and maturity, of the choice of its people in favour of the democracy and the European values.</seg>
<seg>The flags of the European Union which float on all the public buildings géorgiens since then show well the natural attachment, as old as the history of this country which, for the old Greeks, formed integral part of the world of the time.</seg>
<seg>Prométhée, Médée, the amazones and in Arménie neighbor Noah's Ark, are as many signs as Europe of our myths starts there.</seg>
<seg>By its history, its civilization, its traditions, old but also more recent, when Georgia was distinguished from the other republics of the ex the USSR, by its critical spirit, independent even critical, Georgia is undoubtedly today still the place of this space where the democratic Clerc's Office can take as well as possible.</seg>
<seg>It is thus all the more worrying to see the threatened democratization of the country.</seg>
<seg>All seemed sufficiently well to have started.</seg>
<seg>Thanks to launching without blow to férir of a policy of reforms, of privatization, of fight against corruption, the search for frameworks new and thus unscathed of compromisings with the preceding mode, the implementation of a foreign politics marked by a return of Europe in the play géorgien.</seg>
<seg>The totalitarian frame of mind since remade surface in these leaders who, proclaiming the representatives of the majority, adapted always more capacities.</seg>
<seg>It is a caste who the such hydre with thousand heads does not finish any dying and to reappear of her ashes.</seg>
<seg>These and their methods of being able that the “pink Revolution” of November 2003 wanted expurger once and for all are reintroduced in the middle being able it, using their networks, with ramifications including outside the borders, their considerable financial weight, their skill in the intrigues and the handling of the political apparatuses and electoral.</seg>
<seg>It is a capacity which does not respect sufficiently the gasoline of the democracy which is not in the ballot boxes but in the separation and the balance of power.</seg>
<seg>Each day, the government mixes with the legislature, the very large majority of the laws is written with the presidential chancellery; the Parliament wants to control the daily exercise of the government policy, including, in my case, the nomination of the ambassadors and their daily operation!</seg>
<seg>Lastly, and it is most serious, the judicial power is not still able to be freed from the supervision of the executive and does not represent any more or not yet for the citizen or the investor the guarantor and the guard, without whom it is not Rule of law, nor of economic freedom</seg>
<seg>It is a company which to be democratic in its head, is not it yet in its legs. She still hesitates to engage in policy thus leaving the scene to those which occupy it since too a long time.</seg>
<seg>Because this democracy is in danger to rock, but because it is still there, strongly established in the population, in the organizations of the civil society, a press which is sought but which does not lose its faculty criticizes…</seg>
<seg>It is the moment for Europe to save the democracy in order not to destroy all these hopes.</seg>
<seg>The United States already did what they could, since independence, and they are at the sides of stability géorgienne.</seg>
<seg>The stability was undoubtedly not identified with the democracy under the reign of Edouard Chevardnadzé, former Foreign Minister Soviet that the pink Revolution dislocated of its position of president géorgien.</seg>
<seg>But the Americans invested very liberally in the survival of the elites géorgiennes and their training of the democracy.</seg>
<seg>The criticism of the Soros initiatives, today with the mode, appears to me more unjustified: the Revolution of November was not created of all parts by the Americans, with due respect to the propaganda of the Russian nationalists too accustomed to the direct interventions to be able to think differently, but the democratic substrate which allowed it certainly was nourished, encouraged and supported by the assistances of the Soros Foundation.</seg>
<seg>The course which must be crossed today so that Georgia evacuates of its organization -- this time definitively the totalitarian evil, is a complex stage which asks for a support of another nature, that Europeans are more capable to provide.</seg>
<seg>The models which must be proposed for the balance of power, the institutions of Rule of law, the operation of legal or the local democracy must take as a starting point the European forms closer to reality géorgienne than the Anglo-Saxon model, American alternative.</seg>
<seg>If Europe today rejected this task, it would betray its duty fundamental towards this country, small, Mediterranean, flexible, of historical long tradition, where the democracy is likely much better to succeed than in Ukraine, which is all at the same time very large and always very Soviet in its spirit, without speaking about the Central Asia.</seg>
<seg>Not to help Georgia, it is to accept that the Democracy and thus stability are long to come not only to Tbilissi, but more still with Kiev, Minsk, nothing to say of Moscow.</seg>
<seg>It is especially to take a very serious risk.</seg>
<seg>Moscow which, with tops and bottoms, infinite tergiversations, an interior tearing, started to be resigned to the idea of democratic ineluctability, at least to its circumference, not without having to give up its imperial dreams and their instruments of domination, could suddenly re-examine its perception.</seg>
<seg>This hesitant resignation, this acceptance of a normality in its relations with its neighbors, which was only at its beginnings, can be carried by a sudden eruption of irrational of the Russian power of this too famous “Derjava” which cannot resist the attraction of the weakness, with the feeling of vacuum, temptation to be again not the equal one, but most extremely.</seg>
<seg>It is what explains the recent crisis of Russian gas.</seg>
<seg>Any sign of retreat of the democracy, of deceleration of democratic vagueness, will be taken by Moscow as a foolish hope of reversibility where gradually Russia accustomed itself to believe in it more.</seg>
<seg>It is the responsibility for Europe to convince Russia which it places at twists its hope in a return to the past.</seg>
<seg>Europe is this responsible compared to itself, with its future energy independence. It is as this responsible to show as there exist also strong European values -- of freedom, of democracy, justice enters the people.</seg>
<seg>For that Europe must obtain the instruments of its policy: a large foundation public deprived for Europe and the democracy, a university to form there the executives of tomorrow of the democracies which are still sought, a police force, an army of judges and magistrates who make live models close to the companies that we let us please convert.</seg>
<seg>Europe needs especially conviction.</seg>
<seg>If Europe were not appropriate itself itself that it is interested in the fate of its neighbors, their democracy and in the future of its values and their propagation, which thus will believe in it tomorrow?</seg>
