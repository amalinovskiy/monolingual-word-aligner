<seg>Our statement of rights is first of this millennium.</seg>
<seg>We have to know how to organise ourselves as fifteen in order to be able to receive in good conditions for those countries which are knocking on our door.</seg>
<seg>In Article 87 of the scope of the existential assistance with cultural and social charitable purposes must be included, so that these important institutions can enjoy lasting protection.</seg>
<seg>Some people maintain that it is possible to create an internal market in Europe without being adequate to basic principles and values.</seg>
<seg>I would like to pay tribute to the important and substantial intervention of President Prodi.</seg>
<seg>You know that in this case a deliberate decision it took place in Amsterdam, to distinguish between the two roles, the High Representative perfectly, unlike the Commission, is not made with full independence, but that this mission is to coordinate the foreign policy and common security, which are the responsibility of the Member States, and in that case perhaps we should leave a broad scope for the intergovernmental aspect.</seg>
<seg>He has asked that the Presidency is drawing up in Nice the way for the future.</seg>
<seg>In fact, we can want more and better, but I think in all honesty that that is a good principle.</seg>
<seg>I therefore hope that the European Council in Nice is associated with this project and decided to initiate it as a project in particular, not as a fait accompli, after having adopted, of course, the reforms that we now need.</seg>
<seg>However, I have also pointed out, in particular, that on the basis of the present, we can obtain extremely important objectives with the Community method that we currently have, for example, for better action in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg>If we were only able to involve Russia to the West, and the European Union, we can influence its policy and maintain contact and dialogue with this country.</seg>
<seg>Motion for a resolution (B5-0767 / 9) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</seg>
<seg>It is carrying out this genocide and in addition it seeks to completely remove the freedom of the press and the rule of law, whose existence is already precarious.</seg>
<seg>Precisely in order to respond to the expectations of the citizens who are called Giuseppe Italy and live in Cremona, and to which I would like to navigate on the river Po, I have voted in favour of the Piecyk report on the promotion and development of seaports, inland ports and intermodal terminals.</seg>
<seg>- () of the result of the vote in this House will make it impossible to reach the goal of the directive, a recognised aim and by all the speakers and the Commission have been made.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I voted in favour of the Skinner report, as I said during the debate prior to the vote, because I believe that the risk capital is important.</seg>
<seg>My colleague of wild Armonie Bordes group said yesterday, incisive way in which only a minority has an interest in the transfer of Community funds and the contributions of occupational pensions to the risks of entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the Charter will serve mainly to confirm the current practice, even retrograde, of the national States, instead of being a step forward.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, at last we have a Charter of the rights of the European citizen who contains an article, Article 25, entirely devoted to the elderly.</seg>
<seg>In principle, this text may seem trivial, because it contains basically right existing. but it was incorporated into the Treaty with binding force, as the European Parliament demands, with time would tend to automatically the harmonisation of national rights in Europe does it would give a disproportionate powers for the Court of Justice does it would favour greater centralisation around the European institutions does it would limit the scope for independent decision of each nation.</seg>
<seg>(must be prevented an overload of the burden with detailed regulation, which must be reserved to the provisions of lower status.</seg>
<seg>I will vote for another letter, taking part in the demonstrations in Biarritz, on 13 and 14 October and Nice, on 7 December 2000.</seg>
<seg>progress towards membership of the 12 candidate countries</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, a number of Member States have not included / understood until today, the existence of this link and the hesitant progress of the Intergovernmental Conference can lead to major difficulties in carrying out the enlargement in the timescale.</seg>
<seg>We will only be able to take on a long-term basis, in practice, to all the questions that I have gone so far as to whether the policy and leader of the candidate countries for membership and the European Union - and, in this respect, I agree with you, Mr Commissioner, let it be known to the public that the enlargement of the European Union is good in itself.</seg>
<seg>This is the enshrined formula.</seg>
<seg>I should like now to mention the second direction, according to which the Presidency wishes to make progress during this six-month period, the enlargement process.</seg>
<seg>What I propose, therefore, is to work in this direction with the idea that we need to consider, in view of the year 2003, which are candidates who could join in this date.</seg>
<seg>I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for your extensive and clear report, as well as the other rapporteurs.</seg>
<seg>In these negotiations, the case "if it does not take into account in any? ', but' how 'and' when '.</seg>
<seg>But they have also made it because the prospect of membership of the European Union gives hope to them in the solidarity of the European peoples and because it requires strong to the political and economic basis.</seg>
<seg>A number of countries have made, with regard to the second economic criterion of competitiveness in the internal market, and considerable progress that they deal with compliance with the requirements of the accession very quickly.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, we should try to ensure that coordination with the programmes of the national governments, the European Parliament and the other institutions is as close as possible.</seg>
<seg>In every country of the accession of the opinion is expected with great concern that every year gave the Commission on its progress, it is going to give itself again soon, on 8 November.</seg>
<seg>We have chosen, with success, the principle of differentiation, according to which each candidate country should be judged on its own merits.</seg>
<seg>This debate is an opportunity to my political group to emphasise that the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus and Malta, is the best guarantee for the future of all of us in Europe, both in the East and in the West.</seg>
<seg>It is a matter of the utmost importance and, in spite of this, the curious thing, as soon as it has attracted public attention.</seg>
<seg>people spend jokes said that, after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, enlargement remains in five years.</seg>
<seg>The following natural opportunity will be in connection with the next elections to the European Parliament in the year 2009, but we want to make an effort to ensure that the largest possible number of countries can join in 2004.</seg>
<seg>For the rest, there are six points of substance which worry about the method.</seg>
<seg>In fact, we are living in the model of European construction, that is to say: the simultaneous integration of all sectors of activity, beyond the traditions or the specific features of and others, is once again in a trap.</seg>
<seg>Their words count on the support of the President of the Hungarian Central Bank: "The European Union must sign must, on the other hand ', Eastern Europe will suspect that Europe does not work seriously in enlargement, something which could end up in a dangerous disillusionment with the promises made in Brussels - and I quote the Hungarian spokesman -.</seg>
<seg>But it must be clear: we cannot have an income from reductions.</seg>
<seg>force is an idea that is also a big idea: we do not make the enlargements, contrary to the opinion, and the best way to make the enlargement with the opinion is its participation in the elections, because the elections are the expression of democracy and the method of accession of the citizens to the political system.</seg>
<seg>. Mr President, of () Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say very briefly say something about the conditions of the scenario wish here by several parties.</seg>
<seg>I would be very surprised if they do not exert this pressure.</seg>
<seg>But I have already pointed out that all countries approach relatively quickly to the readiness for accession.</seg>
<seg>This means that the liberalisation of trade in the area of agricultural products is already agreed without the Poles have concerns that for that reason its agriculture is sinking.</seg>
<seg>Efforts have been needed, but, in general, peace and the trade have established stronger links between the citizens, now more solid with monetary union.</seg>
<seg>What has to be the result of the negotiations.</seg>
<seg>The only amendment that has been tabled is already covered in my report, but I am glad that the Green Group wishes to stress the importance of equal treatment for the citizens.</seg>
<seg>There is only one law is not included on the public service but also that there are opportunities for the use of young people in the administration and adequate payment.</seg>
<seg>This applies both to Latvia as to the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The linking of the lita to the euro in the second half of the year 2001 has been planned.</seg>
<seg>. (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am rapporteur, is the largest and most important one, but, as we know, it is also the most problematic of those countries that are ready to join the European Union, so problematic that voices are heard about their possible exclusion of the first group, one of the countries which will be included in the first place.</seg>
<seg>Poland, to the countries of the East, the countries which were Communist we have done too many number of unfulfilled promises.</seg>
<seg>It is a point that always arises when it is the Czech republic. is the problem of the Roma.</seg>
<seg>Slovakia is not condemned to the second group, and it is only logical that it wishes to enter when does the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, I would like, finally, to make a comment on the internal policy.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, and as for agriculture, whose level of productivity is even lower than that of the European Union, it is important to ensure the opening up of the agricultural market to the necessary capital for the privatisation of land, the modernisation of the operations and the structures of marketing, as well as for the improvement of incomes.</seg>
<seg>Bulgaria is waiting with bated breath for the moment for joining the European Union and NATO.</seg>
<seg>The acute poverty has been a fundamental problem of Romania since 1990, and with the present government of the economy, finally, is a real signs of improvement.</seg>
<seg>I hope that these issues will be the priorities of the new Parliament office within fifteen days will take, and of the new government.</seg>
<seg>But we also pointed out that final, the right solution and permanent it must fully respect both the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations, which is neither more nor less than the current international law, and the principles on which the European Union is governed.</seg>
<seg>Malta has in addition to stable democratic institutions that work.</seg>
<seg>- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we want to make our contribution to this debate.</seg>
<seg>They must also be implemented the European Community law is not only law in the books, but must also be in the candidate countries law in action.</seg>
<seg>This change is tough demands to the people in the candidate countries, but at the same time it ensures its future, and the future of their children.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to devote particular attention - on which I agree with the previous speaker - to the border regions.</seg>
<seg>In this context, it is not only due to leave the Commission.</seg>
<seg>The candidate countries want to achieve a rapid economic growth, even if this takes place at the expense of a policy for the protection of nature previously established.</seg>
<seg>We are faced with a traffic in return of bad habits, many of them relating to health.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and united European continent.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, which is competent in the domain of transport and the trans-European networks, are aware that it is necessary to coordinate the various sectoral Community policies in favour of a global policy of regional planning.</seg>
<seg>First of all, however, I would like to make the point that the transport infrastructure is going to be of central importance to the success of enlargement.</seg>
<seg>. (DA) Mr President, I join the chorus of those who say that the forthcoming enlargement is now the largest task that faces the EU.</seg>
<seg>A great deal of pressure has been exerted on the traditional social values in Central and Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg>The Group of the European People's Party does not want to usurp the responsibilities of the candidate countries as far as the rate of accession, because we cannot give a date for this.</seg>
<seg>The second point is the mention of dates.</seg>
<seg>There is also another reason.</seg>
<seg>Third: the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the various countries and the EU in their entirety depend - and this has been social and democratic Denmark to it, to a large extent, they are reduced the shortcomings of the European policy.</seg>
<seg>populism is the infamous epíteto that the technocrats attach to the will of the people, when this is expressed in a way that does not agree to them.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and gentlemen, you have a break to eat and rest. we will continue at 3 p.m.</seg>
<seg>In a more long-term perspective, there will be a single currency for the whole continent.</seg>
<seg>In these issues internal battles in each of the countries are concentrated.</seg>
<seg>We invite them to fight for a different Europe, of all the peoples of Europe, which has got rid of all of these inhumane characteristics, in which the people are masters of their fate, develop freedom, peace, brotherliness and relations of mutual good cooperation.</seg>
<seg>I have publicly praised the work of these organisations and, in particular, the Romanian challenge appeal that has been in Birmingham and other Irish organisations supported by many people, including Daniel according to 'donnell, Irish artist of varieties, that a million pounds promised and collected that amount in Ireland and other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg>The Nice Summit must above all contribute clarity on whether and how it is going to act, the EU, on the other hand, to be in a position she herself to be extended in depth and in time.</seg>
<seg>The Poles are asking themselves: will be paid to us when we agree or will we be countries in the second category?</seg>
<seg>I am sure that, with good will and the support of the European Union, a solution can be found which would allow the two communities to live in harmony and to prosper as they have done for centuries.</seg>
<seg>But we have also addressed the question of minorities, because the issue of the integration of these minorities, including linguistic integration, which is also of importance in these countries.</seg>
<seg>The requirement to become a Member is, basically, the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria.</seg>
<seg>There has been talk of the benefits of enlargement, and this is one of the areas in which Lithuania shows us the way forward.</seg>
<seg>Imagine if we were all like them!</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank and congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs, but, first of all, I want to confine myself Slovakia, more specifically, to the political position of minorities.</seg>
<seg>I urge you to ensure that, in Nice, they set a date for when provide for concluding the negotiations with the countries most advanced candidates - without mentioning names.</seg>
<seg>The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its progress for the entry into the European Union and, of course, ensure that the planning of that aid is even more decentralised.</seg>
<seg>The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups of the civil society, the government and Parliament plays in this important and, as we have seen, is also a positive role.</seg>
<seg>We are putting an end to the division of Europe into two, and not by creating a new division.</seg>
<seg>All this is contained in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne and I would like to sincerely congratulate you on behalf of our political group, for this report.</seg>
<seg>From this point of view, I believe that the issue of Cyprus is the one that is going to determine the capability of Europe to see its political nature.</seg>
<seg>I live near the Baltic Sea, which concerns us all.</seg>
<seg>The political vision remains the same.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, it has proved very nice to hear Mr Klaus he, who spoke on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, when it is hoped that the Commission should make a real assessment of the consequences of enlargement, and also on the economic impact, which would take place in case of not being carried out enlargement.</seg>
<seg>However, I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, that without transitional periods, it cannot work in the interests of both parts, as an MEP of a border region, such as Mrs Schierhuber, has an agricultural farm near the Czech border, it is very important to me that common economic area without any major problems arise closer and more than they lead to positive results on both sides.</seg>
<seg>I would like to highlight three aspects as a Social Democrat.</seg>
<seg>The EEA in including the questions of the first pillar, will enable us to the access of the economies of the candidate countries to the internal market and will give young people and science, the right to take part in the exchange programmes, but, nevertheless, it will not force the EU to extend even its system of agricultural aid to those countries, in this way, the agreement on the EEA, would help to give a positive impetus, above all, to the economies of the candidate countries - very need growth to put their societies in conditions of adherirse-, but also the national economies of the EU, since it is estimated that, through economic growth, could be covered two thirds of the total costs of enlargement, and perhaps even more if we went to the model of the EEA.</seg>
<seg>Secondly: we say no to the idea of the whole big-bang while agreeing to a large group of applicant countries, since this would be contrary to the principle of the countries are accepted by their own efforts.</seg>
<seg>Third: we must do everything in our power to draw up until the end of 2003 to the European Union for the enlargement process in the direction of the excellent speech by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.</seg>
<seg>In this context, I would like to refer to the relationship between Parliament and the Council, and to point out that in recent times, the Council will respond with a significant delay to the written questions from Members of Parliament.</seg>
<seg>It is worrying that this is happening in a country which is going to join the European Union.</seg>
<seg>I request referral back to committee for its preparation.</seg>
<seg>. (SV) Mr President, today, we will discuss and perhaps we will vote on three reports which deal with this subject, both of which are of mine.</seg>
<seg>All those involved in the food chain would benefit.</seg>
<seg>The safe food have a cost throughout the chain.</seg>
<seg>We must, therefore, support to Mrs Paulsen and the Commission, and adopt the not-dissolution principle, to give security to the nutrition and really to protect European consumers.</seg>
<seg>The 1999 directive is a well-considered report and it can show some success, as they have been able to reduce demonstrable damage the burden.</seg>
<seg>But to simply accept the possibility of "diluting 'products is not the solution.</seg>
<seg>Very quickly, that we must insist on Amendment No 37, relating to the dioxin.</seg>
<seg>On this point, we agree.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, the result is that, as the European consumers, we will have to continue to buy meat and milk and its derivatives, produced in the world markets with feedingstuffs, which do not have any kind of relationship with the thresholds and the limit values that we have established as a European Union, and with a system of production of animal feed raw materials, which is in the international, free markets to mix up any principle and wording to sell their products in the territory of the Union.</seg>
<seg>Before the second reading, we need to know the opinion of the Commission on how the risk assessment will be carried out.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, it would be regrettable if this were adopted, for example, Amendments Nos 39 and 40, because it would mean that the possibility of the Member States would disappear to intervene quickly the new dangers faced with that are found.</seg>
<seg>Consumer protection begins with the animal feed, on the content of the feed, your statement and, finally, the administrative control.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our colleague, Mrs Paulsen on undesirable substances in animal nutrition deals with an important issue that, like all the important issues, it raises many discrepancies.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the discussion on this excellent report by Mrs Paulsen had very emotional nuances in a few points, and I believe that, after the end of that debate, we must proceed on the basis that the requirements for the feed industry for the cattle are certainly strict but we can then make the quality should be amended by adding component.</seg>
<seg>These three proposals approach, individually and collectively, the serious shortcomings that the dioxin crisis has brought to light.</seg>
<seg>Amendment No 33 removes the possibility of re-exporting to the country of origin, the nonprescribed games.</seg>
<seg>Amendments Nos 41 and 42, 43 and 44, which propose to introduce the possibility of dilution under certain conditions of raw materials for contaminated feed, are also unacceptable.</seg>
<seg>That would have to be sufficient, given our commitment to set up a rapid alert system that includes all the food chain and animal feed in the new proposal on the food safety authority.</seg>
<seg>Commissioner Byrne, after this directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs is an old problem at heart, namely, that of the open declaration.</seg>
<seg>This is already a profit that has brought me this morning's sitting.</seg>
<seg>If we do this, if we implement it quickly, and if we also finalised quickly the codecision procedure, without a doubt, we will have gained a great deal, and I am sure that we will be able to maintain a strong and unanimous position before the Council.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the future too can happen again, or is it not possible to at least be ruled out that in the contaminated feed raw materials are introduced.</seg>
<seg>The BSE scandal was known and most serious example and more.</seg>
<seg>Common sense - our rapporteur said - it would obviously be to have an open label, which made / displayed the list of ingredients.</seg>
<seg>I believe that the technical skills and competence of the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to judge on the issues related to agriculture, and also to the nutrition are indisputable from the point of view of the search for a solution with a practical and practicable approach, that the farmers and consumers can apply and include / understand.</seg>
<seg>Up to now the positive side.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, it is a legitimate right to information which must be satisfied.</seg>
<seg>I would like to ask you, Madam President, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, and on my own behalf, that both sends the condolences of the House to the families of the victims and the local authorities in Britain as Marin, Galicia, where they are from most of the victims.</seg>
<seg>(Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg>Is there a Member who is against the tabling of this oral amendment?</seg>
<seg>This is, in fact, as the rapporteur has explained to us the things.</seg>
<seg>Most of the technical proposals they deserve to be supported enthusiastically, for example those relating to food safety, the dismantling of nuclear power stations in the first generation, the protection of the environment, the fight against social dumping, to the essential code of conduct of the business of the West when they work in the East, and so on, the task is enormous, and also an absolute priority.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, the barriers to overcome are considerable, especially at budgetary level.</seg>
<seg>The enlargement to thirteen countries not only change the geopolitical context of the European Union, but also changes the structure, because the total population is going to increase (+ 28%), but at the same time, it will make the number of 'less-favoured regions'.</seg>
<seg>In this context, it is necessary to take account of that, due to its strong economic and social, competitive an agricultural sector and food weight is going to be crucial to the success of the process of transformation and restructuring of the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg>In this respect, I would like to see the outermost regions, including 6 of each 7 remain in the group of 10 more poor women in the EU, have benefited from the Structural Funds, not only on the basis of a single criterion of GDP, but also on the basis of geographical and demographic and, above all, social indicators.</seg>
<seg>As we reject it, for the good of the French, we cannot, in all conscience, to adopt its enlargement to the countries and peoples of the East as soon as liberated from the Communist dictatorship, which is not yet in a position to know technocratic and totalitarian the trap into which they want to fall.</seg>
<seg>We had to be content with the national information and, at most, a brief resolution but filled with content.</seg>
<seg>The present system, with subsidies, subsidies and quotas must be replaced by the free trade and the adjustment of the markets.</seg>
<seg>The importance and the extent of the problems that enlargement is not we sympathise with the double language on it is used within the European Union.</seg>
<seg>for me to talk about enlargement does not mean to recognise the property or nonproperty from some countries of Europe.</seg>
<seg>our neighbouring country has made an effort, with determination, over the last ten years to fulfil the criteria for membership.</seg>
<seg>Latvia has its place in this Chamber, not only because overall, their progress be right that 'appropriation of essential confidence' successfully to complete negotiations of this kind, but, above all, and above all, because in Europe, it is in its own House.</seg>
<seg>Gawronski with this report and I think that Poland is the state, among all those countries which have applied for accession, which deserves our support more than others, because, without the most important initiatives of Poland, communism would not have fallen, and today, we would be talking about this problem.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps this is not so evident to the public, that it is still particularly Euro-sceptic.</seg>
<seg>I urge the Prague that it welcomes this message, this request, this request that a dialogue should be established, and that it is you and you will, together with this House, so that it is possible to overcome this legacy of a nationalist era.</seg>
<seg>. (in) I welcome the Wiersma report on the request for the accession of Slovakia to the European Union and I share most of the conclusions which the rapporteur has arrived.</seg>
<seg>I am very happy to take advantage of this opportunity to address a very special welcome to pensioners and elderly people of the Bulgarian republic. as mentioned in the report.</seg>
<seg>If Romania is making good progress and the European Union to adapt its structure and its institutional policies to be able to cope with enlargement, I do not see any reason for Romania does not have to be accepted in the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Whatever the solution that is taken with regard to the settlers, and is one of the difficult issues, together with the land back on both sides, that is too hard if some reservations do not become.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, some of the comments that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy dumping in the draft report on the request for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union do not make things any easier.</seg>
<seg>This task will not be easy, if we consider the lack of good will in the Turkish part of Cyprus and Turkey.</seg>
<seg>Stenzel report (A5-0243 / 2000)</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, I had a slight food poisoning in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>For all these reasons, I voted in favour of the prohibition of the proposed dissolution of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg>We must urge the ASEM countries in the present resolution to put pressure on the military regime in Burma to restore democracy.</seg>
<seg>We are biased in our approach and implementation.</seg>
<seg>We cannot afford to be cautious.</seg>
<seg>Some important aspects of the regulation are: firstly, the regulation of the burden of proof.</seg>
<seg>equality of treatment and discrimination are not fundamental principles of the EU.</seg>
<seg>For that reason we need legislation against discrimination.</seg>
<seg>Partly as a result of this, we have in front of us a great deal of legal and technical amendments which seek to ensure a level equal treatment against discrimination on the grounds of race, on the one hand, and on the grounds of religion, disability, age and sexual orientation, on the other hand.</seg>
<seg>It was necessary to make an effort to balance, moderation and good legal technique and his report reflects, in my opinion, these qualities.</seg>
<seg>Also, we believe that the cases of discrimination are not as many as to warrant legislation.</seg>
<seg>In the action programme, there is no money enough to replace the work that is being carried out in the fifth framework programme and, hopefully, have monitored in all other framework programmes, although we will have to make sure that they are compatible.</seg>
<seg>Everyone is in agreement with what there is to fight against discrimination, but the opinions differ on how to do it, to what extent and in what way.</seg>
<seg>I had the opportunity, in the Commission, anger me against the fact that expert could also be outside the NGOs and yet have things to say.</seg>
<seg>Also, we are very satisfied with the provision of the directive, which shows that the equality of treatment for also disabled also means that it is expected of the companies that make adjustments in the workplace.</seg>
<seg>Only in this way will we be able to fight effectively against discrimination in all areas of human coexistence in Europe.</seg>
<seg>After all, as they show a great Anglo-Saxon democracies, racism and discrimination fight with the liberal democracy and not with the restrictions or the gradual erosion of economic freedom of opinion and expression and association.</seg>
<seg>We have a proposal that will enhance the homosexuality in the same category as the Holy marriage.</seg>
<seg>Therefore we strengthened the position of the European Union for specific situations experienced by their people with regard to discrimination and equal treatment.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to comment on the question of religious exclusion.</seg>
<seg>There is one which has expressed its concern to me by the possible interpretation of the recitals relating to Article 1, which, once again, they may seem clear enough, but to make a distinction between the sexual orientation and behaviour.</seg>
<seg>So there is a hierarchy of discrimination.</seg>
<seg>In New Caledonia preference is given on the basis of the skin colours.</seg>
<seg>The first positive element of the directive is the universal approach for the treatment of discrimination is designed, a point which is of particular importance if a proper application of the directive is like.</seg>
<seg>So those who come here to say that Europe does not have to include in a directive, the values which we all want to defend, are confusing.</seg>
<seg>We should not interfere in these achievements that we reached with so many efforts.</seg>
<seg>Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the media should also play an important role in this task.</seg>
<seg>Experience has shown that the promotion of legislative measures in the fight against discrimination is essential, but it is not enough.</seg>
<seg>We must avoid pointless bureaucratic formalities, that the only thing that will do is to reduce Europe to a purely mercenary organisation, politically correct, but devoid of meaning.</seg>
<seg>I believe that this Parliament has accompanied as if it were a Christmas tree, the little advanced legislation that the Commission would have liked to have put on the table.</seg>
<seg>I would like to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, this excellent report.</seg>
<seg>I will accept the amendments that aim to highlight the importance of preventing and combating discrimination.</seg>
<seg>The second category is intended to clarify the text of the Commission proposal and the third includes a large number of amendments which seek to adapt the current proposal for a directive on the race, adopted last June.</seg>
<seg>In particular, Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 propose the deletion of the reference to discrimination on the grounds of racial and ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg>I cannot accept the references to the Parliament in Amendments Nos 21 and 45 to the natural and legal persons is, as well as the unofficial groupings, because this proposal on employment is only applicable to individuals.</seg>
<seg>The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.</seg>
<seg>We cannot wait for a public support for the actions of the establishment of peace, if our troops expose themselves to die as a result of bullets from weapons which we ourselves have provided.</seg>
<seg>In my own country, to have a heart it would need a licence, but it does not stop to set up to me as a seller of weapons in junk of my garden.</seg>
<seg>Another important point is the ban on the export promotion and marketing of equipment and it used to inflict torture.</seg>
<seg>Having said this, I would naturally like to congratulate Mr Titley on his excellent report.</seg>
<seg>We have to extend our examination, on the one hand, in addition to the issues of binding force, also to other aspects alien to the equipment for strict military use, such as the disarmament and the increase in the efficiency of the body of the police and customs authorities, and then, on the other hand, to the candidate countries, as has been mentioned by Mr Wiersma.</seg>
<seg>The control of the scope of the money is certainly more difficult to avoid the provisions on the arms trade.</seg>
<seg>The purpose of the annual report is to find possible improvements.</seg>
<seg>The European Union is currently examining the possibility of continuing the project after the expiry in November of this year.</seg>
<seg>They have set out a methodology and indicators and will be available at the next Council 'research'.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the problems of the SMEs, of course, we have seen that in the framework programme, the SMEs have their part, as envisaged in the budgetary decision.</seg>
<seg>This is, at least, which seems to colegir itself of the debate on the budget in Greece are, and the fact that many invoke the points of view of the European Union, is that the case?</seg>
<seg>As regards the pluridisciplinaridad, I share your view.</seg>
<seg>The first is that the EU's participation in national programmes has specifically mentioned in his report.</seg>
<seg>Would it not then be possible to speak of a European research area if we only represent 5% of this research.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much, Mr Busquin.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, and after the effort made to completely committed funds at the end of 1999, for instance, at the beginning of this year for the financing of new projects, are very small.</seg>
<seg>But I repeat that Portugal made things in the previous period well. what I should just like to point out - and I have been given the figures you on 26 September, is that the money actually commitment on the part of Portugal and for the new period (I am only Commissioner for a year) they reach a 2.6%.</seg>
<seg>Question Nº 2 by (H-0730 / 9):</seg>
<seg>Finally, the establishment of a high level of the contributions of use and consumption on mineral oils should not lead to a not-fulfillment of Community provisions on competition.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, as Mr MacCormick knows, in those cases in which the Member States favour by means of public prosecutors certain sectors of industry, they contravene the rules on state aid, in this case the fiscal state aid, which is equivalent to a subsidy.</seg>
<seg>For example, nuclear energy is a very clear and appropriate.</seg>
<seg>Subject: the budget line for minority languages the budgetary resources that the European Union spends since 1983, in favour of the minority languages registered a constant increase in 1995, when they reached its ceiling, EUR 4 million.</seg>
<seg>. () Mr President, of the members of the Parliament, without a doubt, know that the Structural Funds - and this is a new also put a lot of resources for cultural activities, because I have insisted, Michel Barnier, where they are not only invested in roads and airports, but for the people.</seg>
<seg>So that the next year, the Commission is not going to make new financial commitments on the issue.</seg>
<seg>In relation to the specific proposal for financing, it is not possible for me to take a position, as we must respect the normal procedures.</seg>
<seg>. (SV) I have thought about many alternatives.</seg>
<seg>And it is a reality which we will have to face, because we are talking about millions of small and medium-sized enterprises throughout Europe.</seg>
<seg>The rules on the treatment of products of hunting, for example of the KLA, should also be applied to the meat used for their own use?</seg>
<seg>If these rules were applied to the meat which consume the hunters, it would mean a bureaucratic disaster for the killing of the KLA.</seg>
<seg>When this report has been completed, I intend to present / show proposals to improve the transport of animals and the problem of inadequate compliance with time limits to the number of days in the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg>In the meeting I had with the Group of the Greens, we discussed this matter now.</seg>
<seg>Our question was clear: what Mr takes the Commission.</seg>
<seg>General product safety also requires the producers to provide consumers with information about the risks.</seg>
<seg>The case of Maryam ayubi is extremely worrying.</seg>
<seg>Question No 14 by (H-0745 / Nº 9):</seg>
<seg>The attitude of the EU with regard to this ministerial meeting in Vientiane and if, in fact, it must be held or at what level must be represented in the EU it will depend on the change in the situation in Burma in December.</seg>
<seg>One last comment.</seg>
<seg>The elections are an important step towards ensuring that the population of Kosovo is involved in the administration of the Communities.</seg>
<seg>I can tell you that the development of these elections has been more democratic, better than the one of the elections in our own countries, in which, on many occasions I have participated or I was an observer.</seg>
<seg>But we saw it as a principle and not, in any way, such as the end of the process.</seg>
<seg>This report calls for a more closed better control and on the arms trade and for greater transparency.</seg>
<seg>Now I find that, every year, they increase contracts for weapons and components of weapons.</seg>
<seg>We cannot make real decisions based on information and apparent realities.</seg>
<seg>The provision for which they have remained together in the same DG would have to be revised.</seg>
<seg>Although these institutions should have the option to appoint an internal auditor is enough to impose certain minimum requirements for auditing the financial controller.</seg>
<seg>This proposal does not have the unanimous approval of this Parliament, as the Commissioner is well aware.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, we do not have any objection to the creation of an independent internal audit service, to which we give the green light to the report of Mr van Hulten.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur.</seg>
<seg>The modernisation of administration is urgently necessary in our opinion.</seg>
<seg>An independent audit is essential to avoid errors.</seg>
<seg>The money is to be spent in the future even more suited to the objectives and more efficient, and, of course, it is also necessary to guarantee better than the funds are used for the purposes for which it has allocated by the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the proposed amendments, I should like to point out the following very briefly: the Commission accepts the introduction of additional recital.</seg>
<seg>I would therefore like to thank you for your proposals and their advice to them.</seg>
<seg>I would like to sum up the proposals in this report which seem to me to be the most important, and in particular viable. first, the creation of a group of experts set up by personalities of acknowledged experts appointed by the Member States, to contribute to the establishment of minimum standards of media protection of minors are second, the creation of a system of self-regulation between all operators in the sector are third, the possibility of promoting and of making available the systems of filter for the television and the Internet as well.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, I cannot subscribe to requests from the Liberals.</seg>
<seg>This basically remains the responsibility of the legislation of the Member States, which does not exclude, however, the possibility of an agreement reached at European level on certain indicative values, through dialogue with all the parties involved.</seg>
<seg>However, and equality in other circumstances, I think that it is the task of the parents of dissuading their children that they see this type of programme at home.</seg>
<seg>Parents need special support in this area, which should include the following: the common parameters for the media protection of minors in the whole of the territory of the European Union are the installation and the possibility of having systems of filter at reasonable prices are legal provisions relating to the protection of minors and the responsibility of the media, the companies and the suppliers of the public and private sector.</seg>
<seg>For me, it is strange, and that is a euphemism, to hear some people say, during discussions in committee, that there is no proof that can have a harmful effect on children, the television violence in all its forms.</seg>
<seg>As regards the introduction of a system of self-regulation code, it should be noted, particularly from the technical point of view, that in certain Member States by broadcasters have already introduced codes of adjustment for television sets, which should enable the parents off the norm.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>In particular, my report replaces the valuable international generalisations for a return, in fact, of the decisions of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>This would be at the very least, to provide that area of freedom, which is a fundamental right of every citizen of Europe.</seg>
<seg>There are still, Mr President, that things have not been paid since 1996.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Evans and Mantovani, for the work they have done.</seg>
<seg>I would commend this report to the House and would urge support for the amendments made / displayed by Mr Evans.</seg>
<seg>Our human resources are our only future in a world where knowledge is what better.</seg>
<seg>The problems with Mrs Green and White and black or red books are not resolved, but with a specific action.</seg>
<seg>But the European Parliament, and it is the role of Parliament, the pressure that researchers are, in spite of everything, including in the same text.</seg>
<seg>Today it is visiting us at a crucial time for the future of European integration.</seg>
<seg>However, we know that the process has not yet been completed and that its inconclusión threatens their vitality.</seg>
<seg>If we do not say this now, in this sensitive and tumultuosa stage of European and world history, when we will do it?</seg>
<seg>None of us can now try to know exactly when and how well we will achieve these objectives, but we all know that we believe in them and forward them very much, we will have made half of the way.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to ensure that women can benefit from the European works, and for that reason they prevent the same inequalities reproduce than in the more traditional areas: skilled jobs less, sometimes unelected a part-time, precarious contracts and difficulty of access to the control points.</seg>
<seg>A proposal for a scoreboard will be submitted to the Council, which allows us to measure the progress achieved on the matter.</seg>
<seg>Finally, in a nutshell, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities, reaffirms the integrated approach of equality with gender mainstreaming and specific guidelines.</seg>
<seg>I think more about in particular the violence suffered by them, one of the priority issues of my government action, and that is in particular - you are it to you.</seg>
<seg>We know that the measures of the reconciliation of family and professional life, particularly for women, even though there is still studies on the current situation of the family and the role that women play in the same, that it is no longer the traditional, because society has changed a great deal and, at the same time, the family structure.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes, colleagues in this Parliament, too, believe that there are, but this is not the case.</seg>
<seg>I would like to finish, Mr President, by saying that the equal opportunities starts in the home.</seg>
<seg>This position seems to me to be embarrassing and ambiguous and deserves, I believe, consideration for the projects that have been proposed to us, because it is not certain that we end up with in practice.</seg>
<seg>In this area there is no equality.</seg>
<seg>The image of the European women, which is found in the pages of our report, in our directives, not square with the Danish women who are against the majority of the euro.</seg>
<seg>In this connection, it seems important to me that the report insists that there is to be a numerical balance in all sectors of society, for example on the labour market.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, it seems to me that an opportunity at this report has been lost because marriage and the family are left out altogether.</seg>
<seg>It is something which should also be taken into account in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.</seg>
<seg>We have heard that the previous presidency of the Council, first to restructure the Ministry of equal opportunities in their country and to remove it.</seg>
<seg>The average salaries of women are still below, on average, in almost a 28% of men's, which helps to ensure that women are most of the poor and impedes their participation in the social and political life.</seg>
<seg>This is excellent.</seg>
<seg>Today we see in Europe a impoverishment of the workers, women and in France too, where 15% of them live, after all, with less than 3,650 French francs per month.</seg>
<seg>All the countries have not been able to follow this example and I hope that the example of France ends up fructifying in other countries.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the history of women is very long.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to help the candidate countries to put itself at the level of the Community acquis.</seg>
<seg>But it would need your support.</seg>
<seg>This is not the case, but it is a good text and, after long thinking and after a broad debate, the Committee on Legal Affairs decided not to present / demonstrate amendments.</seg>
<seg>The Committee on Legal Affairs, after a long debate, understood that was not sensible to keep legal insecurity for six years, that three years, which is the time to set a deadline, it is more than fair so that, with the appropriate means and a diligence medium-sized, it is possible to be able to establish whether there has been nonirregularity or in a declaration.</seg>
<seg>Nº is Amendment No 15, relating to fraud.</seg>
<seg>The aim is to arrive at a simplified communication but, above all, of high quality with a sufficiently flexible legislation, an improvement of the tax collecting procedure and with greater adaptation of the provisions in the field of customs procedures, responds to one of the requirements of the single market, and this has been achieved, to such an extent that many countries have even been based on it in order to be able to participate as quickly as possible in the international trade.</seg>
<seg>Mrs Palacio, your efforts and the interest that have worked in the drafting of this report.</seg>
<seg>Welcome</seg>
<seg>I would like that do not change the outcome of the vote which will be expressed, but the truth is that we need to check the translation of the French version.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report.</seg>
<seg>It is recognised that the knowledge of foreign languages is a necessary precondition for mobility.</seg>
<seg>We also believe that the Member States themselves, will have to decide the taxes that wish to implement.</seg>
<seg>I regret too that the necessary proposal to introduce a period of recipe which makes it possible to retain the documentation for a limited period has not achieved a majority of votes.</seg>
<seg>During the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam, we welcome the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination based on sex, race or ethnic origin, religion or philosophical non-sectarian belief, disability, age and sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg>My final point relates to the budget for this programme, that is to say, 98.4 billion, a sum which, of course, is not enough for the actions planned.</seg>
<seg>The arguments used in this amendment explicitly comes from that its aim is to also take part in the actual requirements of age in the Member States, which, however, are perfectly justified on the grounds of psychological development and they do not have any effect in working life.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, anyone who is also stipulated in the new Article 12 (a).</seg>
<seg>With regard to the belief or religion, the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection in this area.</seg>
<seg>(SV) The Christian Democrats. welcome the proposal for a directive on equality in the workplace.</seg>
<seg>But this only says something of the Group of the internal audit service and nothing in the financial importance and usefulness of this service.</seg>
<seg>The EU has decided to set up a common military capacity to carry out the so-called Petersberg objective, however - the fight against the crises and the resolution of conflicts outside the territory of the EU), and does not have a common defence policy.</seg>
<seg>The world would be safer without weapons.</seg>
<seg>With this resolution, it is not wanted to reduce the arms sales radically to favour a disarmament policy, but only to regulate them to ensure more of the benefits of the industrial groups.</seg>
<seg>The communication from the Commission to acknowledge the problem, but it does not propose concrete measures, because it is ofuscada in the logic of the liberalisation of the market and competition, and that no proposal concerns the harsh reality, especially for children, of the unaccountability of big multinational companies, which, in their search for profit, they ignore the impact of its programmes and products and transferring all the responsibility to the parents, inviting them to use new products to protect their children.</seg>
<seg>Like the rapporteur, I believe that the measures to protect young people from the violent and damaging programmes should not be limited to the traditional television, but to be applied to all the media.</seg>
<seg>with an average of three hours a day, it is the most important human activity after the dream, and for adults, after the work.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, women often take 'flexible' positions are temporary contracts or the low wages are typical of the sectors that are mainly used women.</seg>
<seg>They continue to be the first victims of cuts in public expenditure, of privatisation in the area of health, the right to medical and pharmaceutical care - at the most to the law on prevention programmes and information.</seg>
<seg>B5-0792 / 2000 by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, on the crisis situation in Peru.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in fact I would like that instead of holding a debate on Latin America on the occasion of a number of urgent question we dealt with this issue in a well-considered discussion in the committees.</seg>
<seg>We must ensure that Peru to reach the goal of candidates who are equal to the challenge and that they can respond to the demands of the Peruvian people of a political renewal and a substantial democracy.</seg>
<seg>The joint debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>However, we know that the Afghanistan is not far away, Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opiate and, therefore, we know, and we can imagine role played by those political mafias, which are not just political, in the expansion of the drug trade.</seg>
<seg>It calls on the Commission to take up programmes of humanitarian aid to the Afghan people, not to forget to anyone in the region.</seg>
<seg>The suffering that causes of this conflict is tremendous.</seg>
<seg>For years, a budget line has been financing programmes of mine clearance and prevention.</seg>
<seg>paciotti., I can assure you that, today, I will ask the Commission what has happened and what it takes is going to happen to the media for the removal of mines.</seg>
<seg>B5-0794 / 2000 by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnapping of a Spanish Jesuit in Colombia participating in the negotiations with the guerrilla movement does</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, we would not have to return to Colombia.</seg>
<seg>The Commission has already shown its willingness to coordinate the action of this package. in the next few days, intends to allocate substantial resources for this purpose.</seg>
<seg>So, once again, to two different and two measures are put in place, and I believe that we must deplore this.</seg>
<seg>The attitude adopted by the Albanian opposition is to me particularly incomprehensible, because it deliberately refuses to accept a solution that is essential in order to remedy an Albanian problem in Macedonia.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me that it is quite extraordinary that the Macedonians within their own country to conclude agreements with each other.</seg>
<seg>However, the government, who has shown enormous courage in the search for a solution to the problem of university and many other issues, needs clear positive indications as well as a strong support., on the contrary, the consequences for peace in the region can be devastating.</seg>
<seg>PHARE funding earmarked for the year 2000 in the context of the national programme can be used to help the university during the next academic year, that is to say, of course 2001-2002.</seg>
<seg>I would like to point out that even today, all the Greek Members of the European Parliament, we have reacted to this situation.</seg>
<seg>And all this is Greece, which has the greatest maritime sector throughout the European Union, which are basically concerns the safety of shipping in the entire Union.</seg>
<seg>In the last few years, in our own waters, many lives have been given to the sea, not only in major accidents of ferries, but also, all too frequently, between our fishing community.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, it is being exploited for the innocent victims in order to promote the wider objectives of the shipping companies.</seg>
<seg>We have to bear in mind that it is also a question of the credibility of the European Union here.</seg>
<seg>In conclusion I would like to stress that the Commission is fully convinced that the problem of the European legal provisions on the safety of passenger vessels must be one of the main concerns of the European Union, and that is to ensure a strict and uniform application of the same throughout the Community.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely apologise for having arrived a little late for reasons which you know well, both to make a brief statement on issues that are on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade, and the ex--republic of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>Commissioner Verheugen is going to express itself, as it has done, Mr Solana, on the two issues under discussion this evening, that is to say, the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg>We must show willing to us to keep this promise, as soon as the will of the people is respected.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I take part in this debate with reservations, because it did not want at a time that Parliament was only as an authoritative judge to send an anathema against a particular country, in which, after the hopes so strongly encouraged, right here, a month ago, we are faced with the tragic consequences of this new outburst of violence in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, my speech today is not based on a series of remote analysis, but on my own experience of the last week, because by chance, I found myself in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip when these disturbances happened there.</seg>
<seg>Although I am against all violence, it is not possible to be dealt with in the same yardstick the Israeli violence and the Palestinian violence.</seg>
<seg>I would like to ask the European Parliament, at this critical moment, that a courageous statement of support to that today, you have stood up for freedom in the streets of Belgrade, and the response of the issues that we support, the European, so many years ago, did not give those people who, in other capital also fought for their freedom.</seg>
<seg>European, Madam President, without a doubt, would be very inspired if they are included in the flight the ball that the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council sent to us here.</seg>
<seg>The position of Jerusalem is the complicated issue in the negotiations.</seg>
<seg>For years we have been able to hoodwink the inhabitants of his country, with its propaganda machine and the brutal repression of the media and, unfortunately, has also been able to engatusar to many people in the Western world by creating a false picture of reality.</seg>
<seg>When the crisis is over, it is the duty of this Parliament, as a symbol of a united Europe and free, to support the people on the Yugoslav parliament and to help Mr Kostunica to achieve and to carry out their mandate.</seg>
<seg>Exactly a very strong position makes us fear the worst, at the same time - and the current events confirm these sentences were drafted hours ago.</seg>
<seg>I wonder whether the Commissioner is already looking at the steps required to make it clear that we really were Kostunica, such as the legitimate elected representative of the Serbian people, and as a real partner with whom the European Union wants to speak as of today.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament wishes to express its full at this historic moment solidarity in which the tyranny staggers and has democracy.</seg>
<seg>In accordance with the agenda, the next item is the debate on the report (A5-0237 / 2000) by Mr anyone, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision on amending Decision 2000 / 24 / CE, with the aim of extending the guarantee granted by the Community to the European Investment Bank to loans for projects in Croatia (COM (2000) 289 - C5-0336 / 2000 - 2000 / 0122 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg>It is to be welcomed the new political direction that was opened in this country after the legislative and presidential elections.</seg>
<seg>between the European Union and Croatia it carries out its duties, amongst others, a group of consultants whose mission is within the framework to offer to Croatia its experience and technical assistance to the negotiations for the agreements of normalization of relations.</seg>
<seg>We must not forget that, until recently, Croatia was a textbook example of a completely failed programme of privatisation, which only benefited few. this process will have to be supported in their entirety.</seg>
<seg>The sum of EUR 250 million in the form of a loan from the European Investment Bank for 2000-2007 period we are debating will not be a milestone, but it will help and support.</seg>
<seg>That is why it is absolutely right that is mentioned in the report on 'democratización'.</seg>
<seg>When Croatia and Slovakia gained an apparent independence for the first time, acted as servants of the Hitler regime.</seg>
<seg>We could also, of course, have raised the question of the guarantee request and the Croatian question in the context of the debate yesterday afternoon, and the situation in Belgrade.</seg>
<seg>When it seems that Milosevic had fled and that the will of the people has prevailed, we hope that the measures to establish an association and a normal relationship between Serbia and this Union of democracies are only delayed days.</seg>
<seg>I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 6 October 2000.</seg>
<seg>(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)</seg>
<seg>My question is this: who is allowed to speak on behalf of the European Parliament in this Statute?</seg>
<seg>I would ask you, Madam President, that you will make every possible effort to speed up the procedure under way in the Committee on Petitions a letter of complaint that they have made / displayed more than thirty social groups and non-governmental organisations in this situation, in which flagrantly has failed to comply with the Community legislation on the subject of radiation protection.</seg>
<seg>The autopsy practised in Georgia has clearly demonstrated that it was a murder with possible torture.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the opportunity to take a major step towards our dream - which, by the way, I do not share.</seg>
<seg>This is the basic legislation and the basis for any other rules relating to herbal amended by means of genetic engineering.</seg>
<seg>Of course, it is a metedura from leg to another.</seg>
<seg>(The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. p.m. and resumed at 5.50 p.m.)</seg>
<seg>In accordance with the agenda the next item is the debate on the report (A5-0291 / 2000) by Mrs van lacker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council (COM (2000) 379 - 0508 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 (COS), to the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the partner-political agenda.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, I have just one question: to stress the importance of this open method of coordination, it does not mean that this method is going to replace the social legislation, because there are also set to Europe, social rights, we must have the courage to draw up the minimum social standards, and it is essential that a social legislation with a view to the single European market is.</seg>
<seg>Also, in our opinion, we support the social dialogue and cooperation with civil society and especially with women's organisations in the countries that are in the process of preparing the annexation of the European family, since we must achieve a uniform development that it follows the steps and the logic of the rest of Europe.</seg>
<seg>The list of areas of action in the communication of the Commission have also been the subject of a general agreement.</seg>
<seg>I would remind you, at this stage of my speech, which will be held in Biarritz European seminar, which I shall chair, on that subject on 4 and 5 December.</seg>
<seg>In the fight against exclusion are concerned, we have made much progress when defining, 17 October last, in the Council over the 'employment and social policy', appropriate objectives of fighting poverty and social exclusion, which will serve as the basis for national action plans.</seg>
<seg>I have heard in some quarters that, having read the report, are in agreement with the diagnosis, but not with the formula.</seg>
<seg>Technological development and the new methods of organisation also speak in favour of a flexible cooperation where we place more reliance on objectives and less to achieve results and by a rigid rules.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to seek from that side, in our opinion, the archaism that is supposed to them to hope that a market without obstacles is the best of all possible worlds.</seg>
<seg>Of course, it has contributed to reducing the discontent among the workers in our country and to increase investment in the country from the outside.</seg>
<seg>However, the method used is more debatable.</seg>
<seg>If we are talking about a charter of rights and if we are in favour of a European Constitution, we cannot be estrábicos, but we have to say that they are prepared to take all the necessary steps, but this requires a more attentive legislation. I do not believe that Mrs Fontaine.</seg>
<seg>I would like to take a critical note the absence of initiatives on the new challenges in the social protection, the involvement of the workers and the working relations.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I too would like to congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commissioner and the Minister, Mrs Pery, by this presentation of the social policy agenda.</seg>
<seg>As we know, the Conservatives are opposed to these points - our group attaches particular importance to them.</seg>
<seg>The third issue is enlargement.</seg>
<seg>The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg>The action of the Commission must be supplemented with studies on the particular access to health systems and social insurance and pensions systems, lack of labour organisation and, perhaps, also a general reduction in working hours.</seg>
<seg>In this way, women will feel Europe close, and Europe will also gain with interesting and the innovative ideas which are expressed by means of its relationship with this programme.</seg>
<seg>We are waiting for an annual report of the President of the Commission within the framework of a debate which is being held every year in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>I am pleased, in addition to which a better distribution of the care of children to facilitate the balance between professional life and family life is envisaged.</seg>
<seg>My group will be taken into account in the final vote.</seg>
<seg>(The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg>The new approach by the Commission seems to me to be very positive, and consider the proposal for a decision on 2001-2005 programme very well.</seg>
<seg>I believe that the large number of amendments adopted makes common sense of the European Commission and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, over the past year, I have received several requests of companies that have felt a certain powerlessness as a result of certain decisions on mergers, above all in relation to cases where they have needed to appeal to the decision of the Commission to the Court of First Instance.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to take this opportunity to ask Commissioner Monti on when we can expect a public and effective database be set up of state aid, and also on when it will be done long the promised table of results.</seg>
<seg>I should also like to make the point to Commissioner Monti that it is important that in the next report we find a section rather more extensive devoted to the financial services sector.</seg>
<seg>What I have already said, it is not only applies to the area of energy policy, but also for the whole of the other areas.</seg>
<seg>Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work it has done in relation to the two reports which give a positive opinion on their personal work as one of the Directorate-General for Competition.</seg>
<seg>I stress this because the market cannot regulate everything and, in this respect, it does not exist, nor can it be unrestricted competition.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, today, nobody disputes, and, of course, I am not going to do so, that the public aid to change the conditions of competition and constitute a dangerous element that he is inciting the inefficiency of the companies.</seg>
<seg>to hear you deny the fact that public aid have decreased during the period 1994-1998, when the Commission itself acknowledges that reduction, has been at least rather bizarre.</seg>
<seg>And, of course, Mr President, although my opinion xxix relates to the report by the Commission on competition policy, we cannot, at the moment, we look to the past, but nothing more than to learn lessons for the future.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, during the time that I have, I would like to mention three points: the modernisation of Community law in the field of competition, the developed activity in 1999, in relation to the rules of competition and the question of state aid.</seg>
<seg>The Commission has continued to act very firm and against the cartels and the abuse of a dominant position.</seg>
<seg>Mr Rapkay, for the Commission has been very important to be able to count on the support of the European Parliament in the pursuit of the policy of competition, and I do not believe that this support is going to disappear.</seg>
<seg>This mechanism can be activated or at the request of a Member State or in accordance with Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, a monetary provision which remains in force during the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union and to the Member States that, at the present time, they are the subject of an exception, that is to say, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.</seg>
<seg>For the future, the appeal to the capital market should continue to be the only possible option.</seg>
<seg>I therefore ask that the report in its present form will get the agreement of the House and that it can also be used in the field of propagation material of HIV in the internal market.</seg>
<seg>Today, its review is carried out, given the development of phytosanitary rules and made the scientific and technical progress, in particular with regard to the increase in vitro fertilization is concerned</seg>
<seg>Also, with the precautionary principle, I think that, to refer to the possibility of genetic modifications it means, for example, to reduce the intensive use of plant protection treatments., on the other hand, in the sense of the precautionary go the amendments by Mrs Pack.</seg>
<seg>In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, to observe the precautionary principle, in both the spirit and the letter, if unfortunately the articles and amendments that I have just mentioned are not withdrawn officers, we should stick to the opinion of Marianne Isler funds and, therefore, of the Committee on the environment, and vote in favour of their abolition.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, if you will allow me: Commissioner, you could give your opinion on the amendment of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is Amendment No 1.</seg>
<seg>The only point on which it would be possible to be discussed is whether it should, I have taken note or as soon as the French Government did not pass a resolution to me of decline of the mandate of Mr Le Pen.</seg>
<seg>I have to point out to the honourable Member that the vote will be held later, 12.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg>In the field of justice and home affairs, I am optimistic about a solution to the problem of civil judicial cooperation.</seg>
<seg>The preparatory group is going to play their full role until 19 November, the date of the next meeting at ministerial level.</seg>
<seg>We need this exciting climate, as Mr Moscovici has said and I also feel, at the level of the Heads of State and Government, a very serious impression at an historic moment collective and historic responsibility of the construction of Europe.</seg>
<seg>Quite simply, there will be, ladies and gentlemen, to ensure that, from now on, as far as the issues of the qualified majority, so that we are not here to the spirit or the climate in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg>The small countries are not on the orders of the largest Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>I would be grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify this point.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica was an historic event.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, while there has been progress on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting, remain deep disagreement on the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council, as you have pointed out.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me that we are going in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg>Those who remain outside the enhanced cooperation really enjoy the same freedom that passengers of the seats at the back of a car.</seg>
<seg>I am not here, as the honourable Member, either taking in the internal affairs of German to me, but I believe that this position is deeply coherent and is, moreover, the direction that the Commission wanted, if I am not mistaken.</seg>
<seg>We have started to exchange views on this matter, it is clear that all the Member States want the maintenance of that maximum limit after enlargement.</seg>
<seg>I believe that it will not be the case.</seg>
<seg>First: we have sometimes had the impression that in Biarritz, there was an obsession with the debate between the Member States of the small and the large ones.</seg>
<seg>From that point of view, I believe that it is not enough to say that the Community method is to be safeguarded.</seg>
<seg>Also, when the candidate countries join, each Member State must be able to maintain assistant or main a Commissioner.</seg>
<seg>The wording of the text of Article 93 is all the more serious in that, once we have the first wave of enlargement, it will be even more impossible to move towards qualified majority.</seg>
<seg>We need to convince the citizens of those countries of the clear merits of any new European Treaty.</seg>
<seg>To imagine that the fears EDF for generations could yield without new scares to a definitive peace, followed by the reconciliation, would have been to ignore the means of such a crisis.</seg>
<seg>It also concerns the smaller correspondence to me on the issue which calls for the Parliament on the democratisation process.</seg>
<seg>The guilty of this are rather which call for major reforms become before enlargement.</seg>
<seg>In part, the decision of the heads of the government of Israel to freeze the peace negotiations on the violence in the region and to concentrate its efforts on the creation of a government of concentration with the leader of the opposition.</seg>
<seg>We have found out with great satisfaction the victory of the Yugoslav people and the choice of Kostunica as President.</seg>
<seg>I would advise Mr Baron Crespo who asks the Italian colleagues to explain to you why they are in government in Italy with an openly Communist Party and so that they are being prepared to take part in political elections with another openly Communist party, the Communist Party of overhaul.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, in this area would be necessary to make progress on the application of the codecision procedure.</seg>
<seg>The Commission, which has the possibility of taking its decisions by a simple majority, is in a more favourable position to give this momentum in the future.</seg>
<seg>The Union does not need a visionary, now that they have the telescope put in 2030, but which has need of leaders who are able to catch the problems that will bring with it the completion of enlargement in a period of 3 to 8 years, as well as to provide answers to them.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, it is an open work that has not fallen from above and it has not been imposed.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>In the absence of this fundamental point of reference, in the best case scenario, we fail to understand, and, in the worst, we killing ourselves between us.</seg>
<seg>Democracy has improved in Europe, but, on the other hand, European democracy is ill.</seg>
<seg>Today, on 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, the European Parliament is very simple, and I say this very high: the European Constitution, yes, you can do that, yes, we want it to be.</seg>
<seg>That is to say, it expresses the view that the island of in case there is a sufficient criterion.</seg>
<seg>I will go to the essential, concentrating on the points of the report by Mr Gil-Robles, available to me, I will say that would be excellent simply to it.</seg>
<seg>In the first place, the simplification and clarification of the Treaties.</seg>
<seg>I am not going to go further, because we are not here - in any case, I am not here -, to debate the report by the Institute of Florence.</seg>
<seg>According to the information - I am going to be technical, forgive me - that has been communicated to the Presidency, I think that a clear majority of the language versions, contrary to the Italian version, only makes reference to the implementation of the cohesion policy, to the least favoured islands, and not to the islands in general.</seg>
<seg>Mr Duhamel, surely you agree with me in saying that, if there is no success in Nice, there will be no room, there will be no credibility at least, for a debate on the future of European integration will be, at least in the current context.</seg>
<seg>This European Constitution will also have to set a clear division of tasks between the Member States and the European Union and of incorporating the dynamics of European integration in those areas, such as the common foreign and security policy, in which a common action is essential.</seg>
<seg>They could also be necessary to overcome persistent blockades.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to clarify the distribution of powers and the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg>As you know, in the various Member States, and between the various social forces very different opinions on the subject.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, the final objective of a European Constitution would be exactly the opposite, and it is clear that we cannot approve it.</seg>
<seg>In fact, in the strengthened European home, there will be people invited, possibly tax military, monetary the table, and then the other peoples, which will be next door.</seg>
<seg>It is clear that the second version is wrong because, first, in one way or another, the structural funds economically cover the disadvantaged regions and, secondly, because if this interpretation was the right one, we should not speak about the adoption of the statement nº30.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I am going to focus my small sixty seconds in the report by Olivier Duhamel, who is a good report, because it dares to say the things quite clear, and not fine words of our rapporteur has convinced us definitively from a while ago.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, the unity of Europe can only be political.</seg>
<seg>It seems to us that the new Constitution would have to be on the point of taking effect for the next European elections.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, the adjective 'least developed' applies both to the island regions and to the rest of the regions and, according to the proposal by Mr Barnier, who is here is a modification of the Italian text of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention of Vienna.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>As my colleague said that it was going to vote against that amendment lapses.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, what is being called for here is a formula for the chaos.</seg>
<seg>I welcome the adoption by Parliament of the Trakatellis report, because it states that very high standards of quality and safety of blood and blood derivatives of blood to be set.</seg>
<seg>If the European parliamentary immunity is independent, the French authorities should have required for the waiver of Mr Le Pen.</seg>
<seg>I am very disappointed at the vote of the European Parliament on the report on the proliferation of vineyards.</seg>
<seg>For some, alcohol is like the tobacco and drugs, a product which damages much to what they eat and the people who are relating to it are others, on the other hand, mainly see as a source of employment and something with which a lot of money can be won.</seg>
<seg>The rapporteur welcomes generally welcome the proposals of the Commission's White Paper on this subject, but the possible consequences of the reform, which are concerned, in particular, to decentralise the application of the competition rules.</seg>
<seg>. (FR) Although, in the debate yesterday evening, I congratulate Mr Jonathan Evans on his work, had to say at the outset my profound disagreement with the liberal approach, excessively even ultra-liberal, of his report.</seg>
<seg>The Agency for industrial development of Ireland has been reorganising its direction to achieve half of the resulting new jobs of projects in new areas in Objective 1 region in the next three years.</seg>
<seg>State intervention, economic or tax funding and other incentives, sometimes, come to balance something this situation before the howl that cause the consequences of this policy.</seg>
<seg>(The sitting was suspended at 14,06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)</seg>
<seg>The situation in October 2000, when we are close to take a decision on the figures for the 2001 budget, is the following.</seg>
<seg>The Council, however, did not hesitate to overall reducing agricultural expenditure in 555 million euros.</seg>
<seg>For the rest, we also feel, as is logical, 400 additional posts are not due to believe, quite simply, in addition to the existing ones.</seg>
<seg>I can only recommend to the Council to follow our example.</seg>
<seg>The administration of this House should therefore be at the service of the people, and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg>The Court of Auditors is that fewer concerns it causes us at the moment.</seg>
<seg>Finally, it is also up to us to look at the budget of the Ombudsman.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, we particularly believe that research should be strengthened, with a view to the accession of the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg>We also propose that it is continuing to report regularly to Parliament.</seg>
<seg>And when a legislative agreement is held on social affairs, culture and the environment - the Commissioner is going to admit that I am right, we met the Commissioner for budgets, the Finance Ministers and the members of the Committee on Budgets to say together, so that a financial mistake is not made.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your welcome.</seg>
<seg>For the rest, when giving margins for manoeuvre, especially with regard to the ceilings of heading 3 and heading 4, the Council wants to give Parliament the last competent body in relation to these non-compulsory expenditure, the opportunity to express its priorities without returning to put those of the Council at issue., therefore, I shall simply insist on the salient points of the draft budget of the Council.</seg>
<seg>These are two often recurring themes in the discussions between Parliament and the Council and which could set standard, if care is taken to tension between the two branches of the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg>The situation is similar in relation to the structural policy.</seg>
<seg>The outcome of the agreement of this summer was also satisfactory, as has already been pointed out by Mr Colom I Naval, specifically in the sense that, in the future, the provision of information to the European Parliament in relation to the legal basis with repercussions will be extended, also on the expenditure side.</seg>
<seg>Let me remind you that in the financial perspective, which were only adopted last year they provided 1,850 million for the Balkans for the period until 2006.</seg>
<seg>I ask you again to examine this proposal - the Commission leaves it on the table without any preconceived trials and which also see it as a possibility.</seg>
<seg>This material was, of course, useful for the preparation of the budget for 2001 and the granting of discharge in 1999.</seg>
<seg>But, as a Member of the same, I very much appreciate the work of this committee and, in spite of the great respect, that is to say the work of the rapporteurs, in my capacity as rapporteur of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I do not wish to dwell on two amendments which the Commission will present / have now before the House, and that they are still important, even if they have reduced the figures.</seg>
<seg>With these measures, we intend to ensure that the judicial control back to work fully, to restore confidence in the legal security within the European Union and to consolidate its nature of Community law.</seg>
<seg>The removal of this initiative on the part of the Commission, without replacing it with any other, is clearly contrary to the political will of the Lisbon Summit and the priorities of this House.</seg>
<seg>It was an appalling decision, and many of us had the feeling that the most important programme was passed to be simply a ball of football in a game between the Committee on Budgets and the Commission.</seg>
<seg>The third question is the European agricultural policy, as is now in the draft budget.</seg>
<seg>If employment is the political priority of the Union, the fisheries sector, as well as an economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.</seg>
<seg>I am particularly pleased that the financing of the programmes has been able to be guaranteed, juventd Socrates and Culture 2000, which ended at the end of last year.</seg>
<seg>For example, our aid to the Mediterranean countries account with a delay affecting the budgets for many years.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in the debates of recent years I spoke on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which this has represented Mrs Iivari late.</seg>
<seg>But I would like to say to Parliament this afternoon that we do not lose sight of the fact that the EU spends only 1% of GDP and the administration of a large proportion is the responsibility of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>Let me turn to the overall strategy.</seg>
<seg>This brings me to the strategy of our group, because the essence of our view is the desire that the funds have a value which are appropriate for the European citizens.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, we must work for a Parliament which campaigns in favour of transparency, efficiency and effective democratic control of the European institutions.</seg>
<seg>When this happens, we must consider how we can resolve this problem.</seg>
<seg>We want to promote democratisation processes and want to maintain a balanced relationship between the traditional areas of foreign policy that we now have to deal with.</seg>
<seg>The biggest problems in the preliminary draft budget are linked to the external actions.</seg>
<seg>Of course, a rigorous management is needed are we supported it, and we should not be trying to avoid it.</seg>
<seg>It is an extremely exceptional initiative, especially at first reading, and is an invidious initiative, because it cannot, in the current context, to achieve a majority of votes in favour.</seg>
<seg>Having said this, the importance of the appropriations for Kosovo is not without its problems.</seg>
<seg>The budgetary policy should ensure that the public expects the European policy.</seg>
<seg>All measures designed to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, therefore, also deserve our support.</seg>
<seg>The level of budgetary implementation does</seg>
<seg>preserving this strategic line in the approach to the budget for this year and next, the European Parliament fully take its place in the budgetary process.</seg>
<seg>With the transfer of 175 million euros, we have estimated approximately EUR 25 million more than we expected.</seg>
<seg>As far as MEDA is concerned, the Council stated that a compromise was not a problem, in view of the eight years of delays in payments.</seg>
<seg>I think that Mr Duff was here this morning, when we mention the European Council in Biarritz.</seg>
<seg>My reply will be very simple.</seg>
<seg>Ramiro Zapata was the last of the 25 defenders of the murdered human rights and, recently, the Colombian press has reported 'plan 100' of the paramilitary groups to murder one hundred defenders of human rights.</seg>
<seg>Today, I am a little more satisfied that in July with the attitude of the Council, because, as often in crisis situations, the European Union always seems to be the final authority in arriving at international level and to make its voice heard.</seg>
<seg>The question, Mr President, and I have to say, is whether there is not a form of pressure is greater than the one proposed by the President in their reports, and if the aid that we are going to give is completely will be different from that of the United States, that is to say, addressed not to the fumigation of cultures, but to the replacement of cultures, and also to the social aspects and not to the military.</seg>
<seg>The questions which I and other Members of Parliament have tabled refer specifically to the situation in Colombia.</seg>
<seg>As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 will be taken together.</seg>
<seg>Subject: a tax on financial transactions, the demand for a tax on speculative capital has been gaining ground in the last few months, with the proliferation of committees (Attac association pour links southern taxation them transactions financières et pour l 'aide aux citoyens) in France and in Europe, and the amendments made / displayed in the French National Assembly and the Senate of the same country.</seg>
<seg>We would also like to me that she was answered the question of its influence on the volatility of the currency markets and, especially, of the effect of a tax of 0.1 by thousands of speculators who expect devaluation of the order from 20 to 50%.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, it calls for in paragraph 6, the establishment of an international organisation of arbitration to reduce the debt of the countries of the South.</seg>
<seg>For the rest, it is what happened in the case of the euro on the basis of a year, or regret it or to want it.</seg>
<seg>I will add to what Danielle Auroi said a moment ago, in relation to the countries of the South, which some estimates, by specialists, they give some interesting figures: for example, that there is a whole range of 50 to 250 000 million dollars, which could be recovered from a Tobin tax type. the UNDP, on the other hand, this figure in an amount of 40 000 million dollars a year, an amount which would be enough to give a minimum conditions of life of hundreds of millions of people who are all in third world countries.</seg>
<seg>The disease has been identified during the last few months, for example, in different parts of France.</seg>
<seg>Taking advantage of a representative of the French Presidency is, I ask: will be paid to these massacres of beef from the funds from the EU budget and will give you the national budgets, and you feel you should be pointed out that they are paid out of the EU budget?</seg>
<seg>I request indulgence like you to hear the answer.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the action of the two governments concerned is limited by the international law.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me to be a mystery which the Commission can already say in February, and the Council, in July, how much it is needed.</seg>
<seg>By acting in this way, in the name of subsidiarity, in fact, the Union abdicate of one of its tasks, as has happened in recent weeks, both in the north of Italy as in Spain.</seg>
<seg>As a Member of the European Parliament in the interest of that majority, how can I approve the cost of 11, 500 million of the taxpayers in the United Kingdom, that is to say, our current annual contribution when it does not have a broad public approval?</seg>
<seg>With a flexible attitude on the part of the Council, it would be possible to reach an agreement at second reading to close the budget.</seg>
<seg>If anyone is still not convinced that it will examine the evidence, quite simply.</seg>
<seg>Joan Colom I Naval, the Vice-President responsible for the buildings, has already introduced that strategy.</seg>
<seg>The political messages in this year's budget are - as the restructuring of the common agricultural policy, the new structural programmes have said to the Commissioner schreyer- many, to ensure better implementation of the structural policy, the monitoring of the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit on the creation of a strong EU more and more competitive and to the fight against social exclusion.</seg>
<seg>NATO's war has made too many damage and has caused much misery.</seg>
<seg>In spite of what was agreed, I sometimes wonder whether it is possible to achieve that aim with the current budgetary constraints, without undermining the necessary agricultural budget for a sustainable rural sector in the current Member States.</seg>
<seg>And I say to them in a clear and unambiguous way: to Kostunica, we must provide an opportunity to you, and I hope that in the next few weeks or months it is implemented in an amnesty, but in the meantime, what I want at political and budgetary level political conditions to the implementation of these two new budget lines are set, that is to say, democracy and reconstruction.</seg>
<seg>The Yugoslav elections have demonstrated two things: finally, people have hastiado of the dictator Milosevic and at the same time it is Professor Kostunica.</seg>
<seg>In addition, I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners will soon be in freedom.</seg>
<seg>not inevitably make it in 'financial engineering', the redistributions and reductions in either the general costs or in the environmental and social costs or in cooperation caímos, but the fact is that, in spite of this, the appropriations for the Balkans will remain inadequate.</seg>
<seg>In this context, efforts are required to resolve the major social problems such as unemployment, for example.</seg>
<seg>There is an issue which, of course, is of great importance: we have been focusing category four, but it has not yet been absolutely clear if we have been able to find a solution, because the Council refuses to full of contributing ideas.</seg>
<seg>In all budgetary work the priorities are important.</seg>
<seg>This is not very serious on the horizon next to the expiry of the Treaty, but it would be worrying if the legal framework postmint had the possibility of extending such practices.</seg>
<seg>And this leads me to my third point, to the challenge before us now.</seg>
<seg>The new financial agreement does not say anything on this point and I have been able to see that the European citizens mistrust more and more of the politicians.</seg>
<seg>I pay tribute to them for that.</seg>
<seg>The availability of the dialogue between all the institutions concerned have given rise to an exemplary cooperation that will enable us, I hope very much for that, to reach a consensus at first reading.</seg>
<seg>That we represent the European values in a sceptical country in the EU we have now found a new argument in favour of the Union, that is, a better protection of personal integrity, something that is important for the citizens of Europe in the modern society.</seg>
<seg>In my own country, the law of personal data will reform, robbing the power of Parliament on the decisions of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>Many other points are also create problems and deserve the trial of the practice to be assured.</seg>
<seg>The Commission, I would first of all like to remind you of the commitment which we have all taken with the citizens to guarantee the protection of personal data, dealt with by the institutions.</seg>
<seg>With this statement, the Commission accepts that the area of application of the regulation is limited to the activities of the first pillar alone.</seg>
<seg>With a view to honour the political agreement has been reached with the Council and the rapporteur to allow the adoption at first reading, the Commission rejects any other amendment, which does not form part of the Paciotti report adopted by the parliamentary Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, except for Amendment No 69, which corrects Amendment No 41.</seg>
<seg>It is, therefore, imperative that the staff of the inter-service group is strengthened as quickly as possible in the heart of the Secretary-General of the Commission, so that all the proposed measures of a general scope can be accompanied, during its examination on the part of the Commission, in accordance with paragraph 2º of Article 299, by a detailed statement of impact.</seg>
<seg>From the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market, what interests me to stress that, in fact, it is only possible to be treated equally, what is the same.</seg>
<seg>Given the importance of the fisheries sector for the outermost regions, I cannot help but feel ashamed about that.</seg>
<seg>So today, since, under the chairmanship of Mr Delors the interservicios for the outermost regions was created, we have travelled a long and fruitful way and that this European Group has presided over, I must express the deep appreciation of the ultra-peripheral ones.</seg>
<seg>In fact it is already before the Treaty of Rome reference to the French overseas departments was made, it was necessary to wait until 1989 and the programmes of specific actions linked to remoteness and insularity, the famous POSEI programmes, so that the European Union admitted, finally, that the residence and the combination of the structural problems of the outermost regions, justified a specific treatment with regard to the other regions of the Community.</seg>
<seg>I do not doubt that the proposals which the Commission has asked the Council will bear the stamp of these qualities.</seg>
<seg>This question is becoming more and more important as the enlargement of the EU will be close to the East.</seg>
<seg>And it nótese that right to difference is no more than a product of the principle of equality, which also requires a different way what is different.</seg>
<seg>It is a document which my services and I considered rich in ideas and that it does not shirk any of the issues which are of concern to the EU's outermost region.</seg>
<seg>Your report, Mrs Mrs Sudre, have been making emphasis quite rightly on the need to act in time for a moment.</seg>
<seg>As far as the relaunch of the diversification of the economy, we have made progress in a number of essential areas.</seg>
<seg>It is now important that a large number of projects is within the framework of the DOCUPs, but, at the same time to this action on the ground, we have to give some thought to the specific needs, the access of each of these outermost regions, to the information society.</seg>
<seg>Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg>Of course I will inform the President of your speech.</seg>
<seg>The possibility that worries me a general failure of numerous provisions of the vote takes place, which would call into question the decisions that the House does.</seg>
<seg>Both the food safety authority as the legislative proposals which have been proposed to us, which seeks to guarantee food safety, is going to be able to count on the support of this Parliament, Mr Commissioner.</seg>
<seg>Its main task is to provide scientific advice, as the debate on food safety has also to be worthy of credit.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, to conclude, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and their willingness to take account of the opinions of the other committees.</seg>
<seg>When we are faced with a possible risk is important to apply the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg>On the question still controversial of where we would have to go as far as to allow him to examine the nutrition, and even that present / displays recommendations and must be consulted by those whose main task is the management of risk, we have also said that in the field of safety, the issues should be subject to at least the opinion and the advice of the food safety authority.</seg>
<seg>A central idea is to ensure the continued existence of the rich heritage of traditions.</seg>
<seg>They are not the laws or the rules which form the basis for this respectable, but integrity, the high academic quality, independence, the sense of responsibility, transparency and comprehensibility.</seg>
<seg>Of course, it is essential to proceed on the basis of sound scientific knowledge, to evaluate the risks associated with the food chain, from farm to table.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, it is clear that a considerable enthusiasm for the creation of a European agency for food safety, as our rapporteur prefer to call it.</seg>
<seg>Given that the programme of which continues to rely on the necessary funds and support, we would say that any need for another agency does not exist, especially with a limited scope, such as the 15 Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The safety of food is the essential prerequisite for consumers, because consumers want to feed themselves healthily and it should be of concern to us.</seg>
<seg>If we do not only have a new framework directive many aspects relating to food safety will be meaningless.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, we must, in the same way change the EU Treaty in such a way that power is granted to the Commission to apply sanctions in the food field, which today is carried out in the field of competition.</seg>
<seg>I support all those who support the strategy 'food for all', and that work in the political field, administrative or any other.</seg>
<seg>I do not share these words, because we know that the man is not only body.</seg>
<seg>This should represent the real heart of coordination of the network of national agencies, which in turn, will need to be set up and to coordinate a network of centres of excellence for food safety at regional level.</seg>
<seg>I believe, therefore, that their Amendment No 11 and my Amendment No 17 are perfectly compatible.</seg>
<seg>The reform of food legislation in the European Union will be carried out at the level of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The report does not include many proposals for amendment, but that is limited to highlight certain issues.</seg>
<seg>It is stated quite clearly in the report, and I am delighted about that.</seg>
<seg>However, the creation of a European Food Safety Authority is very positive.</seg>
<seg>It is to be hoped that these criteria for the good of the citizens of the Union as a whole are met.</seg>
<seg>I believe that we need to establish certain time limits within which the European Commission in the cases will have to be informed of justified concerns.</seg>
<seg>The EU must have the highest possible level of food security for its citizens.</seg>
<seg>The Commission now proposes the creation of a European food authority.</seg>
<seg>I fear that Europe is in danger, once again, to allow an inflation apparatchiks that is unable to act.</seg>
<seg>As we create new levels of bureaucracy and we used more money, it is increasingly less what we get in return.</seg>
<seg>to prevent similar or parallel work in a number of institutions.</seg>
<seg>However, it is necessary to ensure that, within the context of the debate on the White Paper, increases in public opinion, the fear of a bureaucratic Europe, which has an influence on the quality of products, without penalizing other effectively the fraud which threaten the health of consumers.</seg>
<seg>As you know, the Commission attaches the utmost priority to its strategy on food safety.</seg>
<seg>The Commission intends to adopt a proposal for a Council regulation on the principles and global objectives of food law, establishing, which will provide the framework for the future health protection measures in food.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.</seg>
<seg>Turning now to the report, I think the Commission's proposal is positive and have to say that the Committee on Foreign Affairs and development have worked hard to further improve it, if possible, particularly on some points.</seg>
<seg>As Mrs Bonino has said in a very specific and clear way, with the proposal for a regulation from the Commission a new step forward has been taken.</seg>
<seg>The Commission's proposal for a regulation seems to us to be too vague.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary that the allocation for the elimination of anti-personnel mines is organized in a reasonable way and that we finance research work to do work of detection and disposal, for instruments that can be used in a simple way on the ground so that they in fact help in the developing countries.</seg>
<seg>Over the last eight years, we have contributed more than EUR 200 million, out of the Community budget, the fight against landmines.</seg>
<seg>But we cannot penalise those who have a bad governance.</seg>
<seg>In the first place, as I have already mentioned, I believe that it would be a mistake, well-intentioned, but counterproductive, to impose the accession to the Ottawa Convention as an essential requirement for Community assistance to the anti-mine defence.</seg>
<seg>I cannot accept Amendment No 19.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, the international community must improve the coordination of their efforts at a global level, as well as, in particular, in the countries concerned.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the Socialist Group shares the pride that you have just said, Mr Van Orden, with regard to the role played by the European Union.</seg>
<seg>piensen about the Soviet bombs toy in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg>Thank you for a sound report.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the Cambodians appeal to the mines sentries substance to us.</seg>
<seg>In the face of uniforms of the people who have a justified suspicion that built up over many years of war.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I am delighted that is ultimately a European legislation, in the form of a regulation, on anti-personnel landmines, and that we now have a good report by Mrs Bonino on it.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are dealing with a very sad state of affairs.</seg>
<seg>It is not by chance that the mines are, especially in areas in crisis, that is to say, in areas in which they could have taken another type of initiatives in order to overcome these crises.</seg>
<seg>two kilometres of a village in Bosnia, in 1999, in a field as a signal reminder of the existence of mines, which does not prevent the presence of a child in this place.</seg>
<seg>It is tragic that the civilian population is suffering because of the stupidity of their leaders.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to welcome you on behalf of our institution, with their country maintains privileged relations within the framework of our common project of building an area of prosperity, peace and security in winch of the Mediterranean basin.</seg>
<seg>All the mines are stored.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, as I agree with much of what my colleagues have said, I am not going to repeat. I will forego my speaking time.</seg>
<seg>The idea that you have of open cooperation is to fall into the institutional system dominated by the officials of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, that is to say, that decisions should be taken as close as possible to the people who will be affected.</seg>
<seg>But as an essential amendments from the Group of the European People's Party have just making a substantial majority, I have voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I abstained in the vote on the resolution on the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz, for two types of reasons: firstly, because I have had the opportunity to vote, should be taken by roll call, separately, paragraphs 2 and 5, which has allowed me to express my complete opposition to both.</seg>
<seg>In other words, around the table of the common European home, some would like to the letter and others the minimum menu.</seg>
<seg>and the lack of democratic control should not, however, do not feel that the list of these rights and its inclusion in the Treaties, was the main problem in the European Union.</seg>
<seg>There has been talk of referendums and published / displayed amendments to this report relating to referendums sayings.</seg>
<seg>In the elections to the European Parliament in 1999, 40% of the electorate involved only, without taking account of the countries in which the mandatory vote or to those in which national elections are carried out at the same time.</seg>
<seg>In order to achieve the desired objective of a European Constitution, it is unwise to impose rigid models and methodologies, which would inevitably brings us from achieving the desired objective.</seg>
<seg>A real social constitution upwards level should make the best of the achievements of the world of work, women and immigrants and the citizens.</seg>
<seg>Even without denying a laudable intention of strengthening, clarification and deepening of the European Union, as well as a simplification of the texts, necessary for the proximity of its operations in relation to the citizens, I did not vote in favour of it.</seg>
<seg>The distribution of powers and responsibilities</seg>
<seg>I believe that it is essential that the charter of human rights in the EU is the company / signature of the human rights convention of the Council of Europe.</seg>
<seg>Mr Gil-Robles help me, since it proposes that, for certain matters, sectors and areas some Member States of the European Union to adopt a joint action.</seg>
<seg>to make decisions on a growing number of important issues are taken by a qualified majority is contrary to fundamental democratic rules.</seg>
<seg>Today, it is trying to prevent the relaxation of strengthened cooperation, and will end up losing the game, in this case too.</seg>
<seg>This report aims to clarify the position in this sense of our Parliament (resolution of 13 April 2000).</seg>
<seg>. (SV) In general, our attitude towards the so-called flexible integration is favourable.</seg>
<seg>. () in the British Labour Members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we welcome the adoption of its contribution to the ongoing work of the IGC on enhanced cooperation, although I do not support all the details.</seg>
<seg>These islands must feel active part of the European Union, which I hope it makes them a paradise for tourists and a paradise for its people.</seg>
<seg>In the average age of these regions and their inhabitants do not belong to Europe, or even now are regarded as a truly European.</seg>
<seg>In fact, the special features of these regions, in general, due to the insularity and remoteness of the European continent, but also to his chronic dependence on a single production or a few, demand appropriate specific measures to overcome those limitations.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I would like to apologise to entertain the Presidency and the interpreters being heard my last explanation of vote, and, in particular, I should like to express my solidarity with the translators of our explanations of vote, as far as I am concerned, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg>We can make it clear that the objective of the Agency is to channel the national powers of defence, or to stop them, to put it to the service of the objectives of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>That does not mean that the Commission and Parliament call this agency 'authority', a completely opposite name to the philosophy on which it is based.</seg>
<seg>This is not what it proposes the Bowis report, which gives the impression that food safety is regarded mainly as a new pretext to feed the well-known process on strengthening the powers of the Commission, to the detriment of national institutions and bodies to protect the safety of the citizens.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, I believe that this declaration will allow me to condemn these unspeakable acts on behalf of the European Parliament, which is always called for respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all the communities.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, I include / understand the objections raised by the rapporteur, but on the basis of the amendments made / displayed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, not only will be voted on money questions, but which will be put to the vote on a certain direction of the question.</seg>
<seg>I would like to ask for your support, so that we can make the necessary adjustments to the a-206 line, relating to the acquisition of buildings, depending on what amendments are adopted, with the aim that we do not pass on our own limit of 20% of the total cost of administration.</seg>
<seg>Before the vote on the proposal to amend 929</seg>
<seg>Section VI - Economic and Social Committee</seg>
<seg>Report (A5-0276 / 2000) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation which restores additional technical measures to rebuild the stocks of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES Division VII a) (COM (2000) 0190 - C5-0219 / 2000 - 2000 / 0071 (CNS))</seg>
<seg>(Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg>The aid to exports lead the world market with the excesses of food in the Union is bogged down, which entails serious disadvantages for the food industry in many developing countries.</seg>
<seg>In order to achieve resources that make it possible to increase the aid to the Balkans, the Member States must make changes in the current budget.</seg>
<seg>However, Parliament has succeeded in introducing important priorities, such as greater concern for the fight against unemployment and poverty, many environmental issues and of equal opportunities, and so cetera. we have voted against the right-wing attacks against the LIFE programme, and the group of pressure European women.</seg>
<seg>- (SV) in relation to the reimbursement of costs of transfer of members of the European Parliament, we maintain our view that compensation should only cover the real costs that have been incurred on the other side, journeys in the performance of the position.</seg>
<seg>I am assuming that - and I hope that the Commission will solutions in a constructive spirit, we will cover the years 2002 to 2005, with a transitional provision.</seg>
<seg>- (of) in order, above all, putting a gridlock in all cases to the European Parliament, the European Commission, in its regulation and liberalisation anger, has made / displayed a directly applicable proposal for a regulation rather than a directive, which is to be a difficult one to íter procedural through Parliament and the Council of Ministers to take effect on 31 December 2000.</seg>
<seg>We support in this way, the reform efforts of the Commission and we are opposed to continue to promote this sector.</seg>
<seg>This has made them depend a great deal on the loans.</seg>
<seg>Nicholson report (a-0276 / 2000)</seg>
<seg>It is important to ensure that the aid is not used for military purposes.</seg>
<seg>Our view is always that the reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will have to be made, especially with the cost borne by the real pollutants (that is to say, the large industries), to the detriment of its benefits.</seg>
<seg>Moreira da Silva report (A5-0271 / 2000)</seg>
<seg>This money would be spent in accordance, and coordinating the expenditure on research policy in all fifteen Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>It is good that we manage to know, as a precaution, the truth, as far as these substances.</seg>
<seg>Voting time is up.</seg>
<seg>This will replace the national format, which is now being used everywhere.</seg>
<seg>The loss of data for the statistics relating to the balance of payments is minimal.</seg>
<seg>As you can imagine, the main ones affected are small and medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg>For years we have been demanding a harmonization of the efforts, therefore, after all, be possible to set up a rapid, cheap and reliable system.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, this report is of the utmost importance to integrate the citizens, and the small and medium-sized enterprises in the euro zone and to increase the acceptance of the Economic and Monetary Union.</seg>
<seg>obstacles or large differences should not exist when there is free movement of capital with a common currency.</seg>
<seg>However, the European Parliament and the Commission attach great importance to it.</seg>
<seg>I support the policy of two gangs which the rapporteur wishes to induce the sluggish banks to act.</seg>
<seg>Radwan and Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, in which action is called for by the end of next year, and preferably, the establishment of these standards before the euro notes and coins come into circulation of the euro.</seg>
<seg>The proposal which I made / displayed the Peijs colleague and is a step in the direction of the banks to sit at a table not to make any concessions, because we can no longer increase political pressure.</seg>
<seg>After all, if the system for the implementation of cross-border payments are still as expensive as it is today, the credibility of the new system of coins and notes will be called into question.</seg>
<seg>We believe that this form of statistical data collection on the system of internal payments of the Union is a remnant of the past are that in an integrated and single area, will cease to be justified, and that they are an obstacle to the smooth operation of the market.</seg>
<seg>Having heard all the speeches made by some of my colleagues in the committees, some of which have been here longer than I am, I had the impression that the exercise of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, which this Parliament is under the fourth time, falls into this category.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the support in advance which will contribute to my report.</seg>
<seg>If it is up to the political action at European level, must provide more opportunities for the regions.</seg>
<seg>SMEs are the main source of job creation, both in quality and in amount. they play an essential role in social cohesion and regional planning.</seg>
<seg>The care which made the examination of the proposals and the agreement that has been pursued with many interested parties has been a victory to better define and to optimise the establishment of this programme.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, we must look for European added value.</seg>
<seg>It follows that the small and medium-sized enterprises can only go well if the rate of unemployment is reduced, and the public authorities at all levels are not in debt and have sufficient resources to be used for investment budgets.</seg>
<seg>Businesses need clarity.</seg>
<seg>In particular, if an individual entrepreneur or a company with 250 employees with a project, it cannot be the only way to obtain funding the constitution of the guarantees of 120%, but it must also be possible to obtain funding for which it is only a good idea.</seg>
<seg>The national States and the regional or local authorities have even behave like real financial bombs, which undermine the taxpayers' money, that is to say, extremely who retain themselves to the majority of the population, including the most disadvantaged, and they bomb it to large companies and therefore to their owners and shareholders.</seg>
<seg>the breeding ground of small and medium-sized enterprises, including thousands of fragile attempts to feed human potential and ideas to large companies.</seg>
<seg>of the measures we have proposed here, which I would like more that it dealt with the Commissioner is to facilitate and speed up the access to the assistance and information, so that the people who put these companies can use them effectively.</seg>
<seg>All of them will occupy a special place in the multiannual programme.</seg>
<seg>Finally, I am also keen to have an annual meeting to us to make an assessment of the implementation of the programme.</seg>
<seg>The recent incidents at the expense of the Greek minority in himarë do need more urgent measures to promote democratisation, strengthening the institutions and respect for human rights in Albania.</seg>
<seg>A considerable number of Albanians leaves its land by the uncertainty that prevails in your country, by the social problems, their premodern social and family structures.</seg>
<seg>We need to be able to count on preventive measures specifically designed for Albania that contribute to the construction or reconstruction of the country, with the intention of making a decent standard of living in the region.</seg>
<seg>It is as well as the documents go from one end to the other, and the European Commission, for example, is refusing to publish the report on, amongst others, customs assistance mission (cam), drawn up by the Albanians.</seg>
<seg>Let us see it as it is.</seg>
<seg>Mrs Karamanou, congratulations on the broad and comprehensive view that shows its report.</seg>
<seg>It is a matter of the greatest importance, created under the influence of historical, social, political and economic factors.</seg>
<seg>We will never know the actual number of deaths.</seg>
<seg>The common commercial activities involving the people in a peaceful manner.</seg>
<seg>What, on the other hand, I think it is unacceptable in this report, and I tell you this frankly, that the effect of the cause is confused, that is to say, that is confused the procedure of balanced visa issue and, consequently, the possibility of emigrants, with the cause of illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg>The great institutional reforms arising from the Treaty of Amsterdam have influenced the management of the issues of asylum and immigration.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly and lastly, the action plan and its methods of implementation must be assessed by areas.</seg>
<seg>But, of course, this requirement also requires us not to go to us in the volume adoption of Community rules.</seg>
<seg>Just now, the strength of the Community action has to stress itself.</seg>
<seg>I urge you, too, to ensure that the changes to the proposals on codification of European legislation in force take place by means of the inclusion of the amendments in the directive or regulations in force.</seg>
<seg>understand very well, the principle of subsidiarity purposes in two directions: the decision making at the lowest possible level, and the recognition that the lowest possible level can be more, in fact, a very high level, when there are general goods at stake, which will be lost to less than they are protected in the same way everywhere.</seg>
<seg>The report is a clear and concise draft model and I hope colleagues will take it with the seriousness it deserves.</seg>
<seg>The report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal market do not count on the enthusiasm of its Members.</seg>
<seg>To that even referred to in the report on the SLIM project, because the Community legislation, and Mr Medina Ortega us just this test with the reading of one of the articles of the Treaty, is scarcely comprehensible, for the experts.</seg>
<seg>I am therefore of some aspects of the report produce little enthusiasm to me, because I would have liked "a more comunitarizante 'report with regard to the internal market and, above all, on this point, of course, they are not the wind of change in the report.</seg>
<seg>The important thing for the institutions of the EU, is that we have a strong commitment to raise the quality of legislation, particularly in relation to the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>The maintenance of this situation could impact negatively on the acceptance and the opinion of the citizens, the euro.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Internal Affairs and we are preparing for a thorough manner, the Karamanou report.</seg>
<seg>However, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to take advantage of our oral question and this debate to express to the two sides - then to both our motion for a resolution is, and I would like to make it with great composure, a number of comments.</seg>
<seg>The people of the Union that we represent here are demanding this.</seg>
<seg>But, as much water under the bridge has run, the agreement has elapsed, and it has not been replaced.</seg>
<seg>I can understand the reasons for the Commissioner, but I cannot understand the Director-General.</seg>
<seg>We could say that, eleven months after mooring services, we are still paying the previous agreement and the previous one of the previous one.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, a year ago we held a debate with the same and the fact that it has had to spend a year so that they give to start the negotiations highlights the difficulty of finding fishing grounds for the large fleets in the EU.</seg>
<seg>The second agreement, everything was very clear.</seg>
<seg>It is also necessary, however, not even cover / understand that nothing is eternal fisheries resources.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, it is particularly interests me to make it clear that, if something has been stressed, the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats is not only to support, defend and to reach the fisheries agreements, but to promote its enlargement a reality.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, because the fisheries agreement was suspended, it has continued to the operation of the waters of the Sahara by Community and non-Community fleets that are subject to the control, neither the Commission nor the Member States: it is mainly concerned with an important fleet in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg>I include / understand it, because these activities of fisheries represented a source of income and work for a poor region in relation to the rest of Europe.</seg>
<seg>Another aspect that I would like to highlight is that, at the end of the month, we conclude the temporary aid paid to the fishermen and shipowners to compensate for this year of shutdown. is an intolerable situation, since all prefer the work of aid.</seg>
<seg>This Andalucista parliamentarian has been a year to negotiate and proposing initiatives in the corridors, the offices, in the Committee on Fisheries and the hearing with Mr Commissioner, so that the most special idiosyncrasy of the fishing fleet is Andalusian who work in Morocco.</seg>
<seg>Spain has developed an excellent way, the most difficult relationship of cooperation that has been recurrently in history between Europe and North Africa, between Spain and Morocco.</seg>
<seg>As a Spanish Member of Parliament and Andalusia, I claim the right of thousands of families Andalusians and Spanish people to maintain and defend, and that we also support from this Parliament, their jobs, which have been in danger for almost a year.</seg>
<seg>We will now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg>A full history of almost twelve years of consolations from the Chancellery, delaying tactics, hopes, personal need also placebos for those affected, stubborn defence of old rights in front of the citizens who do not look for another thing that their rights.</seg>
<seg>As you know, it is a very complex issue, and affects seven hundred people who work in more than twenty-five Italian universities.</seg>
<seg>If the reform and change the Italian legal system, as has been the case for the university staff, we do not believe that the Commission can take part, from the moment that all European citizens enjoy equal access to all the professional categories.</seg>
<seg>The injustice lies in the fact that two people who do the same work, work side by side, to do so, however, with different salaries and under different conditions.</seg>
<seg>The worst thing of all is, in my opinion, to have to inform you that a favourable judgment can that does not constitute more than some reassuring words and it is not going to be no real change in their lives.</seg>
<seg>I would point out to the Commission that I hope that it responds to the judgment of the Court of Justice, in the allué case, expressed in the following way: "I receive this dictates that it is contrary to Article 48 (2) of the Treaty establishing the EC legislation of a Member State boundaries, in any case, the duration of the contracts of work of the assistants of foreign languages a year, with the possibility of renewal, if, in principle this limit does not apply to other teachers'.</seg>
<seg>Well, I believe that these issues will lead to the heart of associated with the fundamental principles of freedom to European law, in particular the freedom of movement, and exceptions to these principles can be done.</seg>
<seg>We still have positions, and today it has been seen in this discussion, too many restrictions, too many obstacles to the internal market, and not only in this case.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>(The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg>And I propose a minute of withdrawal.</seg>
<seg>Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg>I support the proposal made / displayed by Mr Ceyhun, and I would be very grateful that the Council could tell us if it has real intentions to present / demonstrate a new proposal on this issue.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group considers it very important that event that we believe that it would not be properly dealt with in the form of an urgent question.</seg>
<seg>The galeotes have exposing. I have the impression that you adhere to these reasons, Mr Baron Crespo, although I understand.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, some time ago, we discussed in this House the issue from the sanctions on Iraq.</seg>
<seg>It is urgent that we hold a debate before the change proposed by the British authorities to be introduced, and that the Commission says quite clearly that is the rule that must be observed in this respect.</seg>
<seg>(A5-0314 / 2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Internal Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the adoption of an agreement on the improvement of judicial assistance in criminal matters, particularly in the area of the fight against organised crime, the laundering of products of infringements and crime in financial terms - 10213 / 2000 - C5-0394 / 2000 - 2000 / 0815 (CNS)).</seg>
<seg>The statements should be followed by specific measures to proceed to the follow-up, arrests, seizure and confiscation of the benefits of the crime.</seg>
<seg>The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot remain in the hands of a specialised agency, subject to the only control of the national governments.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, Article 8 of the draft agreement which restricts only vital interests, the reasons for refusing assistance which could invoke the requested state.</seg>
<seg>At the outset I want to congratulate Mr Marinho, on the work she has done and I would like to say that, in the end, the efforts to combat organised crime must be given support and attention.</seg>
<seg>To put it, to pursue, to condemn the laundering of dirty money from the terrorists and the trafficking of arms and drugs, of course it does!</seg>
<seg>Our task is to proceed to the follow-up, arrests, seizure and confiscation of the benefits of organised crime.</seg>
<seg>All these points are set out in the amendments and, judging by the debate in the committee, I am fully confident that the European Parliament will adopt these amendments.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, the establishment of these initiatives is progressing in a way which can ignore the protection provided for in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</seg>
<seg>In reality, however, all this is not so simple.</seg>
<seg>Finally, Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party supports the compromise amendment that we have arrived at with Mrs Roure on the activities of the lawyers.</seg>
<seg>The second measure, the second instrument is the harmonisation.</seg>
<seg>This is a Portuguese initiative that has already recommended several previous speakers.</seg>
<seg>And that was the subject of a joint meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the Ecofin Council in the past on 17 October.</seg>
<seg>The best way to strengthen parliamentary control and judicial control of Europol is the full integration of the Europol Convention within the legal framework of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>a step in the right direction, which the European Parliament has been trying to provide for a long time, is the establishment of a Provisional Judicial Cooperation Unit.</seg>
<seg>This is the meaning of the guarantees, that is to say, to make progress that aspect of the freedoms.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament is the Community supranational body competent to establish this relationship, and with this speech, I propose, therefore, that supports this right to support our rapporteur</seg>
<seg>When the institutional model and the rules that will govern the European area of justice just clarify, it will be possible for the citizens and the European Parliament to express its opinion on each of the measures which the Council is proposing.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, Europol is a logical step in the process, to provide the citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice, by means of strengthening the fight against organised crime.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Gebhardt deserves to be congratulated on the excellent report that present / displays, in line with the decisions taken at the Tampere Council.</seg>
<seg>However, as with Eurojust, the coordination of national public prosecutors and judges is to fight against all forms of serious crime - and here I agree with the approach of the rapporteur - broad concept: it is no longer only about cooperation for purely transnational crime, is also talk of cooperation for the suppression of the criminal activities.</seg>
<seg>We will have the opportunity, as of 1 January 2001, to join us in that interim unit, but the Commission wants to hold a debate on what should be the final unity of Eurojust.</seg>
<seg>Each side to keep its position in all honesty, I therefore believe that, without lapsing into rigid confrontations.</seg>
<seg>The problems encountered with the expenditure do not concern of the Committee on Fisheries too, although they paid more attention to other matters.</seg>
<seg>Something is completely unacceptable that we do not have clear objectives and we will be able to measure the results, that should not happen in any other institution.</seg>
<seg>Second point: in the area of the hierarchy in the power of finance section has been arrived at unacceptable intersections, Commissioner.</seg>
<seg>I would like to stress that a positive role for a certain number of problems played.</seg>
<seg>It is obvious that this work in partnership does not create any duality in the joint financial responsibility.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, we really have acted to recover these 3,4 million, and it can be said that we have achieved this in more of a 90%.</seg>
<seg>Are there any comments?</seg>
<seg>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after nine months of work and lengthy discussion in the search for a consensus, now we have on the table a draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg>I hope that, even if today it is limited to giving its approval to this letter, this House is going to leave indubitablemente clear in the next few weeks, the compulsory nature of the Charter asks the Council and that it also includes the possibility of recourse to the European Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg>This position is united, as you know, the one adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Biarritz, in which they themselves adopted unanimously and without reservations, the Charter and, therefore, I can only invite you, on behalf of the Council, to follow this position, but doing some arguments to them.</seg>
<seg>But, above all, it is on the strength of its content, and that is why the Charter, I am sure, will make history.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, the European Trade Union Confederation has been able to condemn what it considers to be gaps, such as the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum wage, for example.</seg>
<seg>However, a number of people and, in particular, the members of the European Parliament, have proposed that includes an explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 6 of the Treaty of the Union, which refers to the Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg>Our Group unanimously supports the Charter with the single exception of the British delegation.</seg>
<seg>The European People's Party calls in its entirety and unanimously, so that the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated as soon as possible to the Treaties, in order that it also has the force of direct laws for the people of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>They have shown that it is possible to deal with the European Affairs, a new, exemplary way far better than the Intergovernmental Conference, given its democratic and open work, with a great deal of transparency and which makes possible the participation of the citizens.</seg>
<seg>The right to health, social security, housing, the minimum wage is non-existent or only in the order of solidarity.</seg>
<seg>Fourthly, the letter - and this seems to me to be particularly important part of the principle of the indivisibility of human rights of citizenship and political nature and the fundamental rights of social order.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this Charter is simply the umpteenth proof of the capacity of the Union and the Member States to increase empty texts, the declarations of intent.</seg>
<seg>The representative of the Commission in the Convention of Torino gives legal significance to the document.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps at the time of the market, the time of the Europe of rights has come finally. the concept of citizenship in the European Union is a relatively new concept.</seg>
<seg>The Charter should be drafted, in effect, a text which can have a binding.</seg>
<seg>I also note with great pride that a representative of my parliamentary group in my country, jansson Gunnar, played an important role in the formulation of this Charter.</seg>
<seg>As I said last night, and I will say this once more today, in all of this Union, there are many shortcomings in this respect and sometimes, with our impatience to develop the judicial and police cooperation, we overlook the importance of ensuring that the innocent people are not passive victims, collateral damage of a war against crime.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, the draft resolution of the European Parliament on the Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the same terms that the work of the House.</seg>
<seg>The Italian Constitution stipulates, for example, the limit of good conduct does the Convention provides for the limit of the rights of others, of public order.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in today's vote on the 12 we will conclude a process that began in 1984, when this Parliament approved the draft Treaty of the European Union, which made the request already a bill of rights, a process that we are still in 1989 with the resolution of de Gucht.</seg>
<seg>The Charter is going to have effects. is going to have them is or is not in the Treaty.</seg>
<seg>It is to be welcomed and not with fear, as it seems to think Mr bondi.</seg>
<seg>It seems that the century that has, with all their fight for the emancipation of disadvantaged social groups, has been in vain and it has not shown nothing to us.</seg>
<seg>The Charter fills a gap in Community law and will strengthen the protection of the individual in the face of the atrocities of the European police force, the authorities to combat fraud and the authorities that are responsible for competition.</seg>
<seg>I do not understand the dissension of behind it, because the Charter does not cover what we would like to see included.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I will continue where Mr Gahrton left off.</seg>
<seg>The third point I want to make concerns the rights of citizens of third countries.</seg>
<seg>The Council of Europe has, as well as with the European Court of Human Rights, a great deal of experience in similar forms of control, we can take advantage of.</seg>
<seg>In view of the text of the letter that today we are going to adopt - and I hope that, by a large majority, it is clear that in our Charter we are going to achieve greater protection and also more up-to-date of fundamental rights that would have been the accession to the European Convention for the protection of human rights.</seg>
<seg>That is why it is necessary to go further.</seg>
<seg>I think it is important to have this property in mind if we are to achieve the necessary support from the citizens of Europe to the letter.</seg>
<seg>after its adoption by this Parliament, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be my leadership of analysis, for this report, and where the average personal and intellectuals and the means as far as staff who facilitate will allow me, I will make a fair analysis of the law, country by country for the respect of the Charter in the fifteen countries of the Union.</seg>
<seg>. (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like, in the first place, to accede to the intentions of Mr Moscovici, and to show the most important contribution that the members of the European Parliament have contributed to the debate, to the Convention, in particular, the role that Mr Mendez de Vigo has carried out in the Praesidium of the Convention for the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg>I shall not refer more than some of the most important points of this debate in the first place.</seg>
<seg>The Convention has chosen to include fundamental rights inspired by the various instruments from the Council of Europe, of the Treaties, the constitutions of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>In accordance with the agenda, the next item is the joint debate on the following reports:</seg>
<seg>In the current state of affairs, it is up to Parliament to tell the Turkish people that, at the moment, there are three conditions for membership.</seg>
<seg>As a result, the European Investment Bank is one of the last ports of refuge for banking activities in the world do not pouring the waves of social debate there.</seg>
<seg>That is why I have taken good note of the suggestions made by Mr Morillon in relation to the conditions for the accession of Turkey and deserve the greatest interest.</seg>
<seg>I am pleased to be able to announce that the Turkish Government has accepted in the meantime this partnership and cooperation basis for our future, so that we can hold out a justified hopes that we will achieve exactly the intended objective, which is to support with our policy to the reformadoras forces in Turkey, to give a new impetus to the reform process and to make progress with a view to the desired accession to the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The most important thing for me is that from Helsinki has started in Turkey, between the Turkish public opinion, a debate on the conditions for Turkey's accession to the EU, a debate which supports the reformadoras forces of the country and to promote their development.</seg>
<seg>This text is the delay in its opinion.</seg>
<seg>What is now trying to give the necessary impetus to the scene of a future accession.</seg>
<seg>I would, however, like to urge Turkey - I do not know what will be the outcome of the vote that it is serious about this issue.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament will play its role in the promotion of relations with the political parties, the NGOs and the press, as well as sometimes develop its sensitive and tense relationship with the Grand National Assembly.</seg>
<seg>Mr Morillon, your report is, in my view, perfectly realistic and responsible.</seg>
<seg>On the occasion of the visit to Turkey last March at least mentioned by name, the problem of the Kurdish population, as it has done today.</seg>
<seg>To think that the Europeans are going to take to the Turks, and I quote, "to a radical change of the customs and their mentality 'at the same time reveals a great ingenuity and a great adequacy.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report which we are debating today fills me with concern.</seg>
<seg>Recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the approval of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487 / 1 / 9 - C5-0570 / 2000 - 2000 / 2233 (handbook))</seg>
<seg>In any case, in the coming times in which we are going to debate the computer power, we will have to realise that a broader control is needed and, therefore, garantizador of the person.</seg>
<seg>Duff / Voggenhuber recommendation (A5-0325 / 2000)</seg>
<seg>We pointed out indicatively:</seg>
<seg>The rights contained in the Charter are already a part of the national constitutions and are supported by the national parliaments, next to the peoples and cultures.</seg>
<seg>For example, Article 19-1, which states that: 'the collective expulsions are prohibited', it does not specify that this ban can be suspended in the event of war or serious disruption of public order.</seg>
<seg>We are going to give a brief explanation of these three points of order.</seg>
<seg>The right of a government to abandon arbitrarily their constitution is the distinctive feature of a tyranny.</seg>
<seg>But, I repeat today, we have every reason to be proud of the conditions in which we have completed this important stage for Europe.</seg>
<seg>A society that only knows rights, and nonduties, becomes an egotistical society.</seg>
<seg>It is our priority action so that the affirmation of fundamental rights is also implemented in political elections.</seg>
<seg>Although the method of the Convention is interesting and fruitful to establish a basic text, looking for a broad compromise, nothing justifies it is depriving the European Parliament, which embodies the representation of the European peoples, of the possibility of amending, to enrich the text.</seg>
<seg>This Charter must be improved, and our Parliament should propose a strategy that enables us to update and its enrichment.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the Charter should not be allowed to decide and to state at the Nice Council, but that at this summit would be to promote a European debate on it.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately, the predominant trend of national governments seems to indicate the way of common sense, that is to say, the acceptance of the Charter with a purely political scope and non-binding.</seg>
<seg>created as' house 'by the Cologne Summit,' convention 'was self-proclaimed, a name that unfortunately reminds us of 1793, and to the terrorist implications of the French Revolution, followed by another Convention.</seg>
<seg>In return, the method used, the proclaimed exclusions and the ambiguity which surrounds the very nature of this text have quite a harsh light on the new totalitarian efervescencias which act in the very heart of the process of European integration.</seg>
<seg>Fortunately, the European Parliament does not yet have in this field more than an advisory role, pending a full implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but that is the way to put it in the wrong direction, slowing down the right decisions.</seg>
<seg>However, differences of opinion as regards the procedure there.</seg>
<seg>A hundred years ago, it was the case and, after making a backwards, it is now in force.</seg>
<seg>The last thing we want is that the single market will allow the criminals to join the single market by the back door and without being seen.</seg>
<seg>And we also support the future creation of a Convention which will facilitate the fight against organised crime and money laundering, as well as the various measures proposed in order to achieve these aims.</seg>
<seg>In fact, a provisional unit consisting of a representative of the courts or the police are being created which exercise a judge activity in our fifteen Member States.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in my capacity as a Member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I pay close attention to the draft accession of Turkey.</seg>
<seg>The role of Turkey in Cyprus is not acceptable either.</seg>
<seg>However, we support the criticism of the rapporteur as far as an evaluation on the granting loans from the EIB and that is needed are shortcomings in matters of transparency and democratic control of the Bank's activities.</seg>
<seg>Turkey, with all its diversity, has always been, and continues to be an integral part of the European reality.</seg>
<seg>The accession of Turkey to the European Union has become more than ever a subject at the order of the day.</seg>
<seg>Mr Morillon says that Turkey must try not to see the European Union as a 'exclusive Christian club', which wants to exclude it.</seg>
<seg>Turkey will be a fully democratic country when he will learn to live with its past, just as democratic Germany to learn to live with their and we also ask it to it.</seg>
<seg>As soon as the authorities in Ankara have included / understood that the status quo is unacceptable for Europe and the rest of the world, will be able to be made important progress: the island could be reunited and tomorrow a fair, sustainable global regulation will be made and in accordance with international law.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, so that all of this in the report by the European Commission is not included?</seg>
<seg>This is a balanced framework in which we will have to continue vigorously with our action to promote the rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey.</seg>
<seg>If we look at the question of Armenia, in the context of the accession to the EU - and please listen to what I am saying: if we are approaching the Armenia issue in the context of the accession to the - the project that we are debating today, we will not manage to set are as simple as that.</seg>
<seg>For the rest, it is also the reason for our insistence on that appraisal of the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, so that, in Marseilles, indeed, we can to establish the necessary guidelines.</seg>
<seg>However, we have been able to continue the dialogue, and sometimes on sensitive issues: stability, terrorism, migration, human rights, for example.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the Council has made an effort, in particular since 1995, to give the Mediterranean by means of more important, in keeping with the challenges of the partnership.</seg>
<seg>This is, in fact, a matter of extraordinary importance, and I say this also in my capacity of central European.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, as you know, in English, believes that, when the star does not appear in a role, it is like a representation from Hamlet without first enterrador.</seg>
<seg>We want there to be a mancomunación of policies on issues relating to the single market and agreement to introduce the cumulation of origin, together with the regional free trade agreements, so that all the partners have relations of free trade with each other and adopt the harmonised protocol on rules of origin.</seg>
<seg>We have found out with satisfaction that the Commission is prepared to give a new impetus to the Barcelona process.</seg>
<seg>I say these things because they need to find the key to relaunch the peace process, and to this we must add the extension of the political agenda of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, it has to be our priority to guarantee peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we have to make every possible effort for the sake of this cooperation and to ensure that the funds involved are used effectively, based on we say selfish generosity to it in the European Union.</seg>
<seg>These are important and specific questions that I would like to raise, and I would like to thank Mr Brok is permitted for this debate before the Presidency and the Commission to be able to debate these issues.</seg>
<seg>The world is towards an unstoppable globalisation and, in this context, it is necessary to organize itself in large blocks that act as players in the major stage in global competition.</seg>
<seg>It is disappointing that the Mediterranean countries have asked just as soon as one quarter of the 4.7 million euros earmarked for the MEDA programme, which expires in 1999.</seg>
<seg>For this, the proposal for a new impetus is a good thing that the Commission has done and we agree entirely with the two priorities which Mr Patten in his speeches marked and reiterated this afternoon.</seg>
<seg>It is a reminder that the European Union is far more plays an active role in the Mediterranean area that historic and cultural enriched and engrandeció our European continent.</seg>
<seg>However, there is still much more serious, at the same time, in this Chamber we exchange sometimes differing points of view calmly, are still killing more Palestinian.</seg>
<seg>Aid for reconstruction</seg>
<seg>If, however, we did not contribute in December the means to implement this regulation, today, we will have had a debate devoid of content.</seg>
<seg>It is complicated procedures, but neither should we, or do we want to close our eyes, and I hope that the Member States do not do it before the role it has played in it.</seg>
<seg>The media in that region often have been responsible for the tragedy that has experienced and they have completely free media and to act according to the rules that apply in our democracies.</seg>
<seg>I am also happy because I believe that Parliament has been successful in getting to give the return to a situation which was originally not as good as it has had a continuous pressure.</seg>
<seg>I repeat: it is absolutely essential to avoid unnecessary expenditure in unnecessary meetings.</seg>
<seg>However, we do not only have to pay attention to Kosovo.</seg>
<seg>It is also unfortunate that a series of programmes has put in the so-called 'performance reserve' opførselsreserven '.</seg>
<seg>In Feira, recognised the quality of potential candidates for accession to the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process.</seg>
<seg>I would like to reiterate the main priorities allocated to the CARDS programme: the institutional consolidation in the sense of democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction are regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg>The European Union was right to react positively to the access of President kostuniça to power.</seg>
<seg>On 6 November a first study was carried out.</seg>
<seg>What initiatives are going to adopt the Presidency of the Council, as requested by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, to play a more active role in order to guarantee the full and complete implementation of the UN peace plan?</seg>
<seg>How can we manage to give a new impetus in the resolution of this conflict the close links are known that exist between the European Union and Morocco, and more particularly between France and Morocco.</seg>
<seg>Quite simply, I can say that France and Germany to him - and here I am no longer speaking as President-in-Office of the Council mentioned these issues in the course of a bilateral Summit in vittel, last week, and it was decided to set up a working group in order to counter the problem.</seg>
<seg>At the same time, the Union is making an important material support to these two countries, through the intermediary of its various programmes, especially TACIS.</seg>
<seg>The honourable Member's question is, then, to the Presidency the opportunity to clear up certain misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg>And I would like to add a further point: it is particularly in these two texts, to strengthen the criminal framework to fight against organised networks of facilitators.</seg>
<seg>In the report that the Turkish Council of Ministers last adopted on 21 September as the reform programme, they appear on the part of the legislative amendments several projects: to include in the Civil Code measures that strengthen the effective equality of men and women in the socioeducativos areas are to better combat family violence are better to condemn these acts of violence by means of the creation of judges specialising in the field of the family and, finally, to ban the possibility of a reduction of pain in honour of crime.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, the Presidency does not have to give an answer on this point.</seg>
<seg>Next week, there will be a meeting of the European Conference, at the invitation of mine, in France, that is to say, with the countries candidates. they tell me that Mrs will come.</seg>
<seg>Do you think that the model that has been followed in the case of Austria, that is, the adoption of majority bilateral decisions, could be used in the future as an instrument for making decisions in the margins of the European institutions and to create a new institution or a new group, in order to be able to get out of the rule of unanimity in the Council?</seg>
<seg>cem. the terms of this response was communicated to the whole of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>President-in-Office of the Council, Mr moscovici- who says that to make progress on the accession of Turkey to the European Union, it is not possible to take into account the question of Cyprus?</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to take account of the fact that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than just a fisheries agreement and which, as you know, if it did not reach this agreement, bearing in mind what it means, this fact could conceal a deterioration in relations between the European Union and Morocco.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, I have to express my scepticism about the outcome.</seg>
<seg>In the application of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, it should be noted that this principle should make it possible to strengthen the cooperation of the Member States, but also of the protection of the rights of the people.</seg>
<seg>The supplementary questions must be of other Members.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, the Commission, in the communication adopted the d 4 October 2000 on the oil supply in the European Union says that it intends to present / show, at the Gothenburg European Council a plan for energy saving and diversification of energy sources, which should help to strengthen the energy efficiency, especially in the buildings and transport.</seg>
<seg>With this in mind, we do within the framework, at the time of the vote on the resolution on the embargo, of the Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations, on 9 November, a call to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with the international bodies to defend human rights.</seg>
<seg>It is, then, to the NATO to take the measures it considers necessary, so that they can return to take place.</seg>
<seg>(The sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)</seg>
<seg>When it is money has the privilege unquestionably to establish clearly the political objectives, and that is what it has been doing the Commissioner.</seg>
<seg>It is this presence can give a perspective to the overall policy that we are pursuing.</seg>
<seg>If we see the region as a region of virtual political powers, we will be making a mistake.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament must be consulted and informed on a regular basis, and that is the second request that the rapporteurs have, and that we will all have to support.</seg>
<seg>The Heads of State and Government have also confirmed the determination of the Union to support that process with technical and economic.</seg>
<seg>It was Parliament that supported the Commission's proposal to create the European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg>As the House knows, we do not consider it necessary to make an explicit reference to this in the regulation, in spite of the eloquence.</seg>
<seg>The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg>The leaders agreed an enlarged and up-to-date Framework 2000 cooperation between Asia and Europe, that the work programme for the coming decade is.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, these questions, remind you of the important role that Europe is in Asia, not only in economic and commercial terms, although I must say that one of the reasons for the recovery of Asia is that we have kept our word to maintain our markets to the export of Asia open during the last two years.</seg>
<seg>I believe that we have made an excellent political declaration, but there are still a few problems to resolve.</seg>
<seg>We know that the Commission is taken very seriously the ASEM and fully support this institution in this respect.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to improve the existing mechanisms in the transposition of Community law, to increase the legal certainty and to overcome the current slowly.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, I would have to promote the creation of new regional organisations, particularly where there is already a Community presence, as is the case of the Western Pacific and the South Pacific.</seg>
<seg>This will really help to ensure that fisheries is sustainable.</seg>
<seg>I believe that the future of fishing in international waters, it depends on these organisations, and all the efforts of the Commission, Commissioner, are few. to defend the position of the United Nations, both in the Convention in 1982, as in the case of New York, which has been referred to here, we must have a very active presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing.</seg>
<seg>This is why I believe that the Commission has a role very, very important to encourage fishermen to be put to the House, to cooperate with it and to propose a solution with which we are all in agreement.</seg>
<seg>In addition to this, the Commission must take responsibility for all kinds of tasks relating to the negotiations that are to be carried out in the context of the regional fisheries organisations.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I have the same problem that Baroness Nicholson, but in my case is even more serious.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are the solutions to recommend to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</seg>
<seg>We have sometimes been wonder to what extent the cyclical crisis of the market is not caused by speculation of the aforementioned business structures, which are therefore made sure control of the sector based on their interests.</seg>
<seg>The proposed Community extra aid to Mr Garot's report is, in my view, contrary to all sanity in recent years, when, with Agenda 2000 and the forthcoming enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe we must reform of our agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg>We are trying to introduce an insurance system, and it is clear that it is based on social criteria. in my opinion, the rapporteur has done an excellent piece of work, which shows that the administration is much stake when a defined aims pursued clear, as this is the case.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, the most important producers, or those who are part of the production companies, would not participate in this mechanism, to favour the systems that have already: individual savings bank loans, compensation fund.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say to you in advance that, in principle, I welcome the Commission proposal to create a fund regulation, also within the framework of Austrian agriculture.</seg>
<seg>I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.</seg>
<seg>I understand that an organization of the market for intensive livestock operation and the collapse of the agricultural policy is like when it is linked to the land, when it is an extensive production.</seg>
<seg>An organisation of the market already exists and we should not make the mistake to call into question the current organisation of the market, since, in general terms, you have the desired effect.</seg>
<seg>In the Commission's view, it is entirely justified that only requires greater rigour to the farmers who are basically in the Rules of Procedure, because after all these are stable incomes in return, while those which do not join do not receive any compensation.</seg>
<seg>(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)</seg>
<seg>The appeal from the value added tax represented 36% and the traditional own resources amounted to 15% of the total.</seg>
<seg>Another element of the reform that is closely with one of the fundamental priorities identified by the Court is the target should be attaching greater importance to the extent of the results and the action within a framework of allocation of resources which is consistent with the priorities and objectives that are clearly defined and can be measured.</seg>
<seg>It is a good thing, and I would like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, the same applies to the members of the Court of Auditors and also their services, the support given to the reform of the Commission's report.</seg>
<seg>In this context, and given the proximity, I would also like to point out that, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we have proposed an amendment of the Treaty, which will allow us to create a European Public Prosecutor's office responsible prosecuting fraud against the financial interests of the area, I sincerely hope that the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice is not limited to take note of the proposal or reject it immediately, but that this is discussed seriously.</seg>
<seg>The reality, as described in the annual report, it is rather disappointing.</seg>
<seg>The number of errors identified is too high, to be able to provide this guarantee.</seg>
<seg>The amount for planning activities has failed to provide the EUR 240 million.</seg>
<seg>I also assume that the report of the Court of Auditors would be a lot easier to use, and that a number of clear recommendations should be given, for example, one or two clear recommendations by chapter.</seg>
<seg>In 1995, an agreement on the protection of the financial interests of the European Union was adopted.</seg>
<seg>The Commission and the Member States would have to look at it from the point of view and to make use of the results of the report as a tool to improve their performance in the management of the finances of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>I know that this report and the role that it is prepared to accept the European Parliament in the context of the discharge will help to increase the vigilance with regard to the Community expenditure.</seg>
<seg>And at this moment in time, Madam President, I would like to speak up to me and hope that someone in the Council came here.</seg>
<seg>The Court, like other years, he has not said exactly where mistakes have been made.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union approaches and the Court of Auditors' report makes it clear that still needs to make a hard work in the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we recently reached an agreement with the Court of Auditors, for which we could in advance information from the Court of Auditors with absolutely confidential and we also agree that we should actually stick to it in silence.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to address the Council and to ask you to ensure that it does not progress with regard to Article 24 of the financial regulation.</seg>
<seg>It may be that a common sense of the European Union is contributing to the resolution of the problem and place George Bush in the place of history that deserves - the dustbin!</seg>
<seg>We must look for scapegoats, either in our institutions and in our Member States.</seg>
<seg>Firstly, with regard to the procedure for the presentation of the annual report to the Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am pleased to hear the reassuring words of you, ladies and gentlemen, in the sense that the situation this year is more successful than in previous years.</seg>
<seg>But we will have the opportunity to discuss this in particular.</seg>
<seg>When it is important, from the point of view of control, we said everything there is to say.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and gentlemen, as you will have noticed, the final part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors has suffered the consequences of the interference of the awful virus in his speech and in this House.</seg>
<seg>Some amendments, such as Nos 1 and 18, has to do with questions that relate primarily to the United Kingdom, and I have to say that all the groups in the United Kingdom, are socialist, popular or green, they have defended them with great passion, and they have been approved by the Committee on the environment.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in March of this year, we adopted the directive on funiculares intended for the transport of persons.</seg>
<seg>We believe that they are not due to pass on the planned trade obligations of the manufacturer to the legislation relating to the safety of products.</seg>
<seg>We have heard the arguments in favour of the same, and to favour also repeat the arguments of the sector that we have already heard in committee.</seg>
<seg>The selling report ought to be enough for the customer about the nature of the products and the lack of information which it has on them.</seg>
<seg>Lastly, a question addressed to the European Commission in relation to Article 4, with regard to European standards, and the question of if these rules are to be made public.</seg>
<seg>I am pleased with the exceptions which cover for the settlements of institutions and charitable non-profit organisations, and for the articles which are sold as second-hand goods in car boot sales or on the part of individuals.</seg>
<seg>The reliability of the safety of products and the assistance after-sales service is more of an added value for the particularly difficult and at a crucial moment European label.</seg>
<seg>When, in another context, we call on the Commission to present / displays a proposal relating to the safety of services, it is incomprehensible that is now trying to jointly to regulate the aspects relating to the services, instead of waiting for the Commission to present its proposal / will have, in fact, can already be envisaged that problems from the demarcation of the scope of the different rules will arise and the legal uncertainty will be increased in good time.</seg>
<seg>I would like to say a few words to present / demonstrate the main aspects of this proposal.</seg>
<seg>Also, we have now provided for the possibility of opening up the system to third countries, in particular, to the candidate countries: the simplification of procedures to introduce emergency measures at Community level, so that we can intervene quickly as a result of the opinion of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure.</seg>
<seg>This new requirement does not involve any extra substantial responsibility in the event of this type of measure.</seg>
<seg>to replace "the producers' word for 'provider', as proposed in Amendment No 11, would create more confusion than clarity, because any definition of provider in the directive does not exist.</seg>
<seg>Although the Commission is in favour of the creation of a network as soon as possible, to this end, it will have to be agreed between the Member States.</seg>
<seg>This certificate can always be used to provide evidence, but it cannot be considered in itself as a crucial test.</seg>
<seg>Having explained in detail the reasons why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28, 30, 32, 33, 36 to 34, and part of Amendment No 7, the second part of Amendment No 21, and the first part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31 to them and 35 and part of Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21, and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, because they are an improvement and clarification of the Commission's proposal.</seg>
<seg>Of course, for Mr Crespo if it is Socialist Italian not it can become a member of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.</seg>
<seg>I believe that the conflict between the Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 37, does not exist.</seg>
<seg>As far as the order of voting, I leave it to the discretion of the President, and point out that, in any case, I am against the three amendments.</seg>
<seg>The non-Community Mediterranean countries face, it is no doubt, particularly serious problems relating to the economic development of the regional inequalities are increased unimpeded.</seg>
<seg>As for respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, for the sake of a harmonised European policy in the field of immigration, in addition to the legal instruments to ensure the fair treatment, it would be necessary to create instruments for financial support for all those young people who, having just higher or university a cycle of studies in the countries of Europe, want to return to their countries of origin, to start to have a professional activity.</seg>
<seg>I would like to highlight a factor which I consider to be crucial frankly on this issue are the lack of equality in the employment field.</seg>
<seg>Although late, the Commission published / displayed the programme for the Community framework strategy for equality between men and women (2001-2005), which differs markedly from the previous ones and, in particular, of the fourth action programme, which expires at the end of this year.</seg>
<seg>On the one hand, because they have seen improvement various proposals are made / displayed by my group on the other, because it has insisted on the need to examine the situation of women in the national labour markets and the lack of access to social security systems on the basis of statistics produced from representative and statistics broken down by gender.</seg>
<seg>. (in) My party has serious reservations with regard to use products on sale to apply Community legislation, and with regard to the refusal to implement the concept of mutual recognition of standards.</seg>
<seg>Now it understands this, and the amendments labour offer the guarantee that these shops will remain unchanged and be exempt from the directive.</seg>
<seg>Finally, Amendment No 15 is a free hand to the Commission with regard to the language regime of the Agency, which we consider to be very worrying.</seg>
<seg>The simplification of the procedures for decision making, the creation of decentralised operational basis - not only in Pristina, where it has acquired the significance of the separation of Yugoslavia), the treatment of the dual structure between the Council of administration and the Commission, positive movements in the direction may turn out to be faced with the enormous bureaucratic inadequacy of the European Agency for Reconstruction.</seg>
<seg>For this reason we voted against both the Commission proposal and Parliament's report.</seg>
<seg>Because of all this, I think it is right that the existing Community legislation in the area is adapted.</seg>
<seg>Also, the fund offers the possibility that the administrations more or less concealed in the form of cofinancing grant aid on the part of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>. () despite its serious shortcomings, the Morillon report is, without a doubt, more advanced than the Commission's proposal with regard to the membership of the European Union - ôurquía.</seg>
<seg>We have voted against it.</seg>
<seg>Like the rapporteur, we must admit that Turkey has made progress in certain areas and that there are positive signs.</seg>
<seg>Since 1987 our House had opened the way for the recognition and the adoption of this amendment is the coherence of the Parliament in this debate.</seg>
<seg>The European Union must do more proposals and to take account of enlargement to Turkey as an essential geopolitical strategy.</seg>
<seg>These intentions are worthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey.</seg>
<seg>For several years, as a Member of the delegation for relations with Canada, I have been able to observe operation of one of these regional organisations, the opano (organisation of fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic), in which the States in the region involved, including Canada, as well as all those who use in this place traditional fishing areas, including European France, Spain and other countries.</seg>
<seg>It will not be satisfied until its fleet of canteens, by flying the flag of the 'Star' ring, monitors compliance with its fisheries policies.</seg>
<seg>The important thing is not, therefore, to satisfy the desire for hegemony of the Commission and to weaken the position of Europe, which would be in contradiction with the correct application of the principle of subsidiarity.</seg>
<seg>Finally, after laborious negotiations, we achieved a result which is worthy of support.</seg>
<seg>So, the objective of this proposal to replace three directives on the incineration of waste is to improve the quality of the air, water, soil, the health of the people, reducing the emission of pollutants, associated with the activities of incineration and co-incineration and, above all, of dioxins and furanes and heavy metals.</seg>
<seg>However, I also think it is important to stress as new, now that it is no longer just about the emissions into the atmosphere, but also the emissions to water and the soil.</seg>
<seg>The proposal has been improved during its preparation.</seg>
<seg>The introduction of more stringent limits of NOx emissions for new plants of co-incineration, such as the cement kilns, is another step forward that it will serve as an incentive for the reduction of emissions, although the proposed rules do not reflect the best available techniques.</seg>
<seg>. Mr President, in () Ladies and gentlemen, I apologise - especially to Mr Blokland - to have arrived minutes late.</seg>
<seg>In conclusion, this directive is an important contribution to the reduction of the harmful effects on the environment and the risks that they represent to human health.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament will be met, in the name of discrimination and the fight against exclusion and in respect of the responsibilities of each one, in giving a boost to the creation of a mechanism which will enable the essential principle of solidarity exists in particular.</seg>
<seg>Major differences between the various countries of the Union have been recorded, however, and lack comparable statistics detailed to be able to state of reliable way what is in force in each country, what is - and where what etc. work better, what are the weak points - as, in fact, in my opinion, drawn up by order of the Committee on Economic and monetary policy, highlights the need to legislate Community rules on the supplementary insurance of disease, that the Commission is preparing a Green Paper, which takes up and systematizes all these now dispersed data and all the reports on the subject.</seg>
<seg>Until now, this issue has been taboo subject to a certain extent.</seg>
<seg>We are in danger of due to the increased number of serious risks to the citizens with health problems and people can only a limited contract of private insurance, which is incompatible with the social developments.</seg>
<seg>The second point of view illustrated by the original intention of the rapporteur and shared by many colleagues, is to promote the regulations and codes of conduct to be restored, between insurance, forms of mutualización costs - and ensure that all the provision of medical care of good quality, and to avoid the risks to which they are developed to discriminatory practices, as well as a selection of the risks and customers.</seg>
<seg>I think it is quite wrong that the money is the decisive factor to be first in line.</seg>
<seg>The new proposal of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, seems to us to be correct: firstly an inventory of a Green Paper is drawn up, and we shall then decide whether we need a directive or a recommendation.</seg>
<seg>At the present time, in the Netherlands, a debate is taking place about the introduction of structural changes to the system.</seg>
<seg>This is the basis of what there is to divide the Commission to draw up an initiative and to provide specific tests which could become guidelines for the health systems of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, it is unlikely that the answer is a unique and comprehensive solution for all medical insurance.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, I believe that we need to focus on the content of the report by Mr Rocard, on which we congratulate, which asks the Commission, the provision of a service, of the Green Paper, which will enable us to know the current state insurance in the Member States and also to define the future.</seg>
<seg>Both are developed on a model of three pillars: the State, business and the private sector.</seg>
<seg>With regard to the supplementary pensions, the European Union has already drawn up a number of standards has done this through the drafting of a Green Paper, which comes from a draft directive.</seg>
<seg>. () in Mr President, I would like to express my thanks and congratulations to Mr Rocard for his report and to congratulate him.</seg>
<seg>This study will be able to form the basis for a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament to propose initiatives and measures.</seg>
<seg>In relation to the amendments of the Committee on Budgets, I can say with satisfaction that they have all been incorporated.</seg>
<seg>We have supported the features typical of the programme, as they are the multidimensional treatment of the phenomenon, the measures on health, education, housing, consistency and complementarity with other similar policies, as well as the participation of non-governmental organisations, and the people affected by the social exclusion.</seg>
<seg>This means that we must take advantage of the upward phases of the cycle to restore the situation to a balance or surplus.</seg>
<seg>In this respect, I would simply remind you that the last Ecofin Council has requested of the Commission that, as from next year, there are already in the evaluation of the stability programmes precisely this aspect of long term of public finances, relating to the ageing of the population.</seg>
<seg>One of the positive features of the programme in the Netherlands is the special attention being paid - as I have said before on the impact of the ageing of the population in the public sector during the next few years.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, the budget for the year 2000, which results in the German case, will give a surplus of one and a half of the gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg>If we add to this the evolution of the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, we have had a clear negative impact on inflation terms.</seg>
<seg>They are also in order to make a public system of distribution is compatible with private capitalisation systems and, of course, they are compatible with support for the creation of specific investment funds, which can in the long term, achieve fiscal advantages and that can help to deal with the problem of the ageing population.</seg>
<seg>The third principle that guides us, then, is the precautionary principle.</seg>
<seg>It is important to remember that at the moment a number of legislative proposals are under discussion, which will help to strengthen the effectiveness and the relevance of the Community mechanism, and therefore - so I hope - the confidence of consumers.</seg>
<seg>However, this relatively low incidence is not a reason to feel satisfied.</seg>
<seg>Frankly, I was disappointed that in the statement made yesterday Prime Minister Jospin was no recognition of the positive role played by the Community over the last few years.</seg>
<seg>There is a clear need to find explanations to the increase in the BSE incidence not only in France but also in other Member States.</seg>
<seg>The Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission already gives absolute priority to the control of the Member States relating to the measures of protection against BSE.</seg>
<seg>With regard to its security, let me repeat that already a large number of controls in place to ensure that the animal meal do not represent a threat of BSE.</seg>
<seg>Yes, although it may be difficult to believe, necessary, four years to adopt a measure that I consider to be of fundamental importance for the protection of public health.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to make it quite clear that the Council has made public, finally, your opinion on the regulation on BSE.</seg>
<seg>In this situation, the only way to break the circle of transmission of BSE is the total ban on the use of animal meal in animal feed.</seg>
<seg>In this regard, I would like to say that the Liberal Group has made / displayed an amendment which I hope it will be approved.</seg>
<seg>The policies have to change this state of affairs so that the real decision-makers of this crisis are penalised, and so that the necessary decisions to enable us to take a first step in order to put an end to this dramatic crisis.</seg>
<seg>It would therefore have to be reviewed.</seg>
<seg>The labelling of beef and veal, which has been adopted, which is the minimum labelling and that came into force only two and a half months ago, does not allow adequately to trace the origin of the animals, and we have banned very delayed the specified risk material.</seg>
<seg>The public must be fully informed of the characteristics of the proof of what I mean.</seg>
<seg>At that time, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, almost did not do anything at all or nothing, as their counterparts do not do anything with regard to the consequences of the Chernobyl, anything with regard to the AIDS epidemic, anything with regard to the contaminated blood, always for the same reason, it is not to cause the panic in public opinion.</seg>
<seg>The French ban will lead to an enormous increase in demand, but the existence of such products is limited.</seg>
<seg>Consumers have lost confidence, and to contain this phenomenon, it is necessary to see evidence of BSE in cattle and sheep.</seg>
<seg>In the context of the Commission's proposal, it is much more important to work to ensure that the animal meal meet the highest safety standards.</seg>
<seg>For the rest, I fully agree - for once, and without it serve as a precedent with what Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mr said to the House.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, ladies and gentlemen of the Council and the Commission have a financial basis enough to carry out a sound policy.</seg>
<seg>We must stop this, Mr Prodi.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I am glad to hear, here in this Chamber, that, whatever the cost, it is necessary to change the CAP.</seg>
<seg>We denounced it at the time, right here, with Jimmy Goldsmith.</seg>
<seg>Food must be a safe food human being.</seg>
<seg>I think it is very good that France has been quick to take this step.</seg>
<seg>But, to those not help!</seg>
<seg>For this reason, I am surprised that, in these circumstances, they are still being able to use or process bodies.</seg>
<seg>Recently, the report has been published in the United Kingdom Phillips on BSE.</seg>
<seg>I would like to suggest that the European Commission also applies the principle of caution with regard to beef in France.</seg>
<seg>Today, we have to know, because we are still in the uncertainty, what are the scientific data, which are the measures to be taken.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, I have heard all of these proposals are, I am not insensitive to them.</seg>
<seg>If representatives from the Member States to come and tell me that the legislation has not been implemented in their entirety, perhaps we need to reconsider the issue, but we will not do it because the scientists tell us that it is necessary, but because of the gaps in the implementation of the law in the European Union there.</seg>
<seg>The best way of nonoírnos is not to invite us in any case.</seg>
<seg>The Commission believes that, for the explanation and the coordination of these policies, readmission agreements play an important role, and at the moment are being discussed the first Community readmission agreements with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco.</seg>
<seg>What proposals does the Commission have in this area, on the basis of Article 31 of the Union?</seg>
<seg>(The President cut the speaker off)</seg>
<seg>The objective during this period has been to reduce the public deficit to achieve a monetary policy more acomodante, low interest rates and a greater growth.</seg>
<seg>I say that the euro will not be introduced on 1 January 2002, the euro or in our pockets are we have with different fractional currencies, but we already have in the pocket.</seg>
<seg>The maximum values laid down by Directive 92 / 72 were not exceeded in the city of Athens, even if it is to be noted that measurements in the middle of the summer did not take place.</seg>
<seg>Subject: public aid to the audiovisual sector in a seminar on the French presidency's industries related to culture, a representative of the Directorate-General for Competition in the European Commission stated that imposed on the legal obligations of investment to the television networks provide aid to be in favour of the fact that these investments are imposed on a compulsory basis by the legislator.</seg>
<seg>It must be respected and protected ".</seg>
<seg>However, this is not clear, as the new growth is very desigualitario and can be accompanied, as we have seen in the United States for about ten years by persistent phenomena of insecurity, exclusion, poverty, urban ghettización.</seg>
<seg>The governments of the Member States do not accept this definition, which is also truth is something simple and too commonplace.</seg>
<seg>In the hostile atmosphere that is created, there are many who are on the way, and that they are rejected.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, this House is heard very frequently, as one cantinela, the glorification of the European social model, of the social market economy that we must oppose with pride - many believe it - to the wild model of the United States.</seg>
<seg>(technical failure)</seg>
<seg>This is an enormous amount.</seg>
<seg>In addition, they must get all the political levels.</seg>
<seg>I agree on the need to know the industrial causes of poverty, support the preventive action against exclusion as a result of mergers, change, the relocation of companies, rural desertification, urban hyperconcentration better, innovative and practical measures which involve local and national involvement of the social partners, governments and the joint action of the citizens.</seg>
<seg>A very interesting debate has taken place on the role of the use in the fight against social exclusion and the role of social and structural reforms.</seg>
<seg>This is a problem of legal basis, as, with adjustment in accordance with the Treaty, there can only be the reference to social exclusion and poverty.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, these proposals are a pragmatic response to his question.</seg>
<seg>But to agree with the strategy does not necessarily mean to agree on the details.</seg>
<seg>If we have defined a clear and binding framework for the Member States, the various systems that they have to meet these requirements should have a longer period of evidence.</seg>
<seg>Renewable energy sources are not going to be a panacea for solving this problem, but there is no doubt that, in large part, they can help to alleviate it and also to diversify the sources of energy and reduce our dependence on oil, on the other hand, would not do any harm.</seg>
<seg>I am going to repeat three of our demands.</seg>
<seg>The establishment of a realistic objectives will serve, without a doubt, to increase the confidence of the citizens in the energy policy that is implemented.</seg>
<seg>I believe that a vigorous policy in the field of renewable energy sources is a symbol for the Europe of tomorrow.</seg>
<seg>Finally, these agreements should allow the European countries fulfil their contribution to achieving the objectives set in Kyoto.</seg>
<seg>It is regrettable that excludes any category which can contribute to the achievement of the general objective of restoring energy from waste as much - if it is small-scale projects as if it is a part of the total calculation.</seg>
<seg>The composition of the biomass of peat in its dioxide and production of vegetable waste is similar to that of the other plant biomass.</seg>
<seg>I would like to inform Mr Chichester that off the coast of my people is being rapidly windmills in the sea, a project which, without a doubt, is going to come into operation in a very short time, so I would like to give the floor to see it to him when he has already begun.</seg>
<seg>The controversy surrounding the resignation of nuclear energy, for example in Sweden and Germany, has revealed that if they do not exist in the horizon alternative energy ecological that is feasible to a competitive price, the debate is doomed to failure.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, the Member States must be able to count on binding objectives.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, I am optimistic about the future potential of renewable energy sources, provided the necessary incentives should be provided.</seg>
<seg>I believe that we need a great deal of courage to place constantly to renewable energy sources in the place they deserve.</seg>
<seg>A huge rise in the price of oil, of course, confronts us with greater cruelty before the associated problems to our energy dependence on fossil energy sources.</seg>
<seg>We cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 28.</seg>
<seg>However, in doing this, the Commission is very aware of the terms used do not prejudge its right of initiative and should not have to be incompatible with the single electricity market.</seg>
<seg>In the Commission for the reconstruction of Tajikistan, where there are 25 000 widows, only one of the 26 delegates was a woman.</seg>
<seg>Although the proportion of women has been limited, studies have shown that the participation of women in the peacekeeping forces of the UN to improve relations with the local population and the general standards.</seg>
<seg>The Theorin report goes into this area in very specific details and makes repetition which we in the Group of the European People's Party and the European Democrats, we ask you to learn in the direction of an official document.</seg>
<seg>From a political point of view, I think that Amendment No 19 can be interpreted as a specific defeat or a concrete step backwards instead of a real commitment, which is not worthy of the cause of women.</seg>
<seg>Prisoners are maintained.</seg>
<seg>In Portugal, where the women do not have access to the diplomacy until the "revolution in April 1974 ', has recently shown, in the case of East Timor and of our ambassador in Indonesia, Anna Gomes, that the role of women and their sensitivity to the problems and the suffering of a people that it faced alone, a fight of 25 years for the freedom can be felt everywhere and, in particular, here in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>To date, the very few Member States that have done so.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, it is necessary to take account of this dimension when drawing up the policies of the European Union in the future.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, it is not appropriate to define concepts and become distinctions.</seg>
<seg>Please pass on to the Council our protest.</seg>
<seg>They are people with different experiences are necessary experience in the way in which the policy is exercised, especially in the management of the conflict.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>This brings me to the point, secondly, if we wish to regulate the sector, a number of aspects will be examined.</seg>
<seg>The last few weeks I have known that a great deal of interest on the part of the International Union circles, and a number of national union organisations are as much.</seg>
<seg>allegation against two. then is in agreement with a salary for housewives?</seg>
<seg>It is the easiest life for many families and promotes equal opportunities.</seg>
<seg>Often, in this draft two or three families have joined together a person.</seg>
<seg>We are meeting in the plenary session of this first part-session in October, while the debate was held immediately on the situation in Yugoslavia, when we were aware of the courageous reaction of the Serbian people, and, as you will remember, ladies and gentlemen, we are calling for the lifting of international sanctions.</seg>
<seg>In this way, Europe has shown the vitality of its civilisation, within the framework of world history and its capacity for creative political imagination for its future development.</seg>
<seg>It is clear that the issue of the situation in Kosovo is a democratic problem.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, we would like to have the opportunity to demonstrate to Europe that we are able to develop the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro in Yugoslavia by our own resources, through the recognition of genuine principles of democracy.</seg>
<seg>I must say that, listening to you, at the same time, I was impressed by the way in which you controlled such a difficult situation, and on his determination.</seg>
<seg>It will be determined in the next minutes, Mr Watson.</seg>
<seg>Access to documents and information on the activities of the institutions enables citizens to control the control systems in the EU and encourages greater effectiveness.</seg>
<seg>I believe that a fifth amendment is the annual report should especially consider the documents to be kept secrets or at least observe secrets.</seg>
<seg>This question is ambiguous, and it is possible that they will also take, and they are still in force more restrictive rules, and that is why we have made / displayed amendments to this point, among others.</seg>
<seg>The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy rejects the idea of except transparency, automatically, and as a group to documents relating to foreign affairs and security.</seg>
<seg>If we want the rights of citizens are truly effective, we need for the siting of new personal creation specifically prepared to know to guide the people who are seeking information through complicated labyrinth of the institutions.</seg>
<seg>These are important to be able to achieve an internal advertising.</seg>
<seg>I welcome the fact that Parliament has managed to create a broad majority in favour of greater openness.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs for this excellent work.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the access and transparency in the European Union do not enjoy a good reputation.</seg>
<seg>This being the case, a mistake is made, as it is the credibility and trust that the European Union for the citizen.</seg>
<seg>The documents are many things today, and we would like to ensure that there is the widest possible access to the different types of documents from the various forms is possible.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the position of the Commission with regard to the public access to the documents may be in manual internal who was sent on 11 October to the officials of the Commission to inform them of how to manage the demands of public access to documents published / displayed by the members of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>This provision must be eliminated or, at least, be extended so that it includes the consideration to assess the interests of the applicant.</seg>
<seg>The normal way in which it is the development of cooperation in the international sphere, with the rules of the game and use of diplomacy, that is to say, that it is carried out with the fallen curtains, does not help in the modern cooperation to which the EU has developed.</seg>
<seg>It must not be confused with the role of the European Parliament, or with the future interinstitutional agreements.</seg>
<seg>I believe that a step forward has been taken to the exercise of the right of the citizen to the information and knowledge.</seg>
<seg>However, the only one who is not that I would like to thank you, thank you very much deserves also Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen of the PPE-DE Group, which has been the editor of the proposal under the strict application of the Hughes procedure.</seg>
<seg>Transparency must be achieved as the bedrock principle for all the activities of the Union, but the right of access to documents is not yet sufuciente in itself for the realisation of transparency.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament asks that the European security and defence policy is introduced in the future in the structures of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg>When it came to Parliament, on 3 October, President Prodi referred to the institutional triangle and mentioned that in a European system based on checks and balances, the flow of the operation of each institution contributes to the common interest.</seg>
<seg>I must admit that the great challenge in this regulation is the precise definition of what are the documents.</seg>
<seg>I would like to point out that, at the moment, almost, the Commission could accept all of the amendments, such as the 9, 18, 21, 23, 25, in part, the 26,1, 28 (f), 35, 38, 40,1, the 40,6, the 41,1, 42, the 43,1, 47, 49 and 52.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes, I wanted to vote in favour of the proposals put forward by the Commission, and for that it is necessary, precisely that Members have the list of amendments which the Commission can support, and the list of what you do not want to support.</seg>
<seg>own resources of credit institutions</seg>
<seg>Finally, the most controversial, the Commission made a strong call for the use of a fast-track procedure to apply this legislation.</seg>
<seg>These amendments replace several other proposals in the report which will probably be rejected in the vote, and that they will then be replaced by these new resulting amendments of that consensus.</seg>
<seg>. () in Mr President, in view of the important vote of support to this report, and given the response of the Commission this morning, is, of course, if all the parties are observed on which we have voted - that, under Rule 69 (2) of the Rules of Procedure, we would have to postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution to be able to engage in fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I am sorry if I said that the PPE-DE Group had also asked for postponing the vote, but the coordinator addressed to me and said that they would also like me to postpone the issue until the November II part-session, instead of a vote now.</seg>
<seg>The reason why I would suggest that we postpone the vote is that - as was pointed out by Mr Goebbels - this is a very important issue.</seg>
<seg>I do not know how much the roll-call vote costs, but it is, without a doubt, hundreds of billions of francs, or Belgian francs, our budget.</seg>
<seg>I know that in France, the entire herds have been slaughtered, and I do not think that this is the best way forward.</seg>
<seg>To remove animal meal in feedingstuffs for all animals, not only of the cattle and sheep, but also of the pig and poultry and fish.</seg>
<seg>This is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg>It will be with provisions such as the consumers will reassure and farmers will hear the message of solidarity that we want to convey to them.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary and urgent to go further: to bring about a change in the common agricultural policy.</seg>
<seg>The ban on the use of animal meal in the feeding of livestock is only the first step in this direction.</seg>
<seg>We were very much regret it, on the contrary, that the amendments made / displayed by our group have not been adopted.</seg>
<seg>I believe that it would be sensible to reduce the working hours of those who work in companies that pollute.</seg>
<seg>I will end by once again to insist on the fact that the extension of the operation of the hazardous waste does not have to lead to accommodate us to the production of such waste.</seg>
<seg>In fact, if, for example, there were more pensions enough to live, there would be less poor.</seg>
<seg>The report proposes a budget of EUR 100 million over five years to reduce poverty.</seg>
<seg>I give my unreserved support to the proposal to set up a Luxembourg process (a) in the field of social exclusion, which includes guidelines and national action plans.</seg>
<seg>In fact, the report calls for a qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion pay attention.</seg>
<seg>When raise awareness / displaying its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission is to meet the request of the Council, to present / demonstrate "for June 2000 'A' initiative for cooperation in this field '.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I have abstained for a very specific reason: this report, in my opinion, has not done, from the environmental point of view, these advances which I hope and heralded.</seg>
<seg>I hope that this system will be extended to all the cities of Europe.</seg>
<seg>Some of the proposals of the European Parliament are unrealistic, and they cannot count on my support.</seg>
<seg>We must also be able to achieve in the future, a better, more than the good practices are known existing publicly.</seg>
<seg>The people who have high incomes and are aware of the environment have the freedom to choose a cleaner energy within a free market, while the rest is still not being able to choose.</seg>
<seg>In accordance with the agenda, in the first place the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg>These three reasons are as follows: first, because it makes in the process of consolidating democracy and in the deepening of the demand for the respect of human rights, particularly in relation to the indigenous populations.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in this debate, we would like to express, like the other Members who have spoken before me in the use of the word, solidarity and the support of our institution have expressed this very well to the Central American Parliament at a time when we are fighting to ensure that the priority in the field of external relations of the European Union with the countries of Latin America is maintained.</seg>
<seg>I do not have the reservations that have been able to express our colleague and friend, the chairman of the delegation for relations with Central America and Mexico, Mr Seguro, as far as the question of human rights.</seg>
<seg>Finally, in the dialogue with the Central American authorities, the Commission is also reiterated the importance that should be given to the process of regional integration as an instrument to consolidate the process of democratisation and development in the area.</seg>
<seg>In order to hold on to power, he has not hesitated to taken a grip on the obsessive debate on the 'marfilidad', causing a xenophobia wave: hatred of the other, abroad, the original version of Burkina Faso or the Malian and, however, there are many who have been working and living in the territory of the Ivory Coast for many years.</seg>
<seg>The establishment of a genuine democracy in the Ivory Coast, will not be able to be made without the creation of an independent committee of inquiry of the crimes committed, and without the formal commitment to the cause of human rights and civil peace are respected.</seg>
<seg>Some people think that importance of democracy is concerned, when it comes to Africa, which they are complex procedures, which are necessary to give time for the time I believe, however, that there is no commitment to democracy and the question today for the Ivory Coast, it is the same as the one that takes account of, for example, for Guinea, when we know today that there are people in prison and that there is no democratic system.</seg>
<seg>I will end with a question: following dictatorships, Mr President, just because there are people who are suffering from poverty, which they do not have access to knowledge, which do not have access to information.</seg>
<seg>It would be illogical for the European Union today called for the holding of new presidential elections in which they can participate, this time, all the candidates.</seg>
<seg>This happens in many parts of Africa with the most different religious and ethnic mixtures.</seg>
<seg>These elections must allow the national level representation of the political parties that are excluded in the presidential election, and to compensate for this, if only in part, the imperfections of this first choice.</seg>
<seg>on the situation in Burma</seg>
<seg>They are making a great offensive against the Shan people and against the Karen people and, as I said, the rapporteur of the UN, some of the dialogue between the SPDC and the National League for Democracy does not exist signal.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, we reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.</seg>
<seg>I hope that by giving priority to this urgent matter like this Parliament will send a clear message to the people of Burma what your urgent situation is not forgotten, and that we have to recognise that the situation in Burma is getting worse rather than better and are determined to try to do something about this.</seg>
<seg>It has taken a long time to be achieved.</seg>
<seg>In Asia, in fact, there is a danger that the economic reforms and the policies decoupled, which may have economic progress and economic liberalisation, without liberalisation in the political field, and strengthening the rule of law, even though I am of the opinion that without a constitutional state that functions, trade, aid and investment will be lost in the long term.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I am in agreement with my predecessors on the floor with many important points of what we are saying today, because of what is happening in Vietnam is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg>However, now Human Rights Watch says, to which Mr Swoboda referred, who Vietnam has taken some steps in the last time, to improve the situation with regard to human rights.</seg>
<seg>These very secret documents, provide an unknown to us look behind the scenes of the policy of the Vietnamese administration.</seg>
<seg>The Commission is still convinced, however, that a lasting solution can only be achieved by the current situation by means of a dialogue between the military regime, the opposition and the democratically elected representatives of the ethnic minorities.</seg>
<seg>clear pressures of the Vietnamese authorities also exist so that its own press has a self-censorship regime.</seg>
<seg>The next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions:</seg>
<seg>We also need for the EU to provide aid and assistance, not only in the South-West, but in all the areas that have been affected.</seg>
<seg>I ask you all to support our resolution.</seg>
<seg>It is urgent that the European Union is not limited to deploy actions of extraordinary nature when disasters have already happened.</seg>
<seg>The Commission has taken two initiatives in this respect.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, there has been a purely linguistic mistake by introducing one of the amendments in the common resolution.</seg>
<seg>The vote on its delay means to delay the order to the Commission.</seg>
<seg>(Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg>The report is based on the establishment of an increasing proportion of the insurance of disease in Europe is covered by means of supplementary insurance of disease.</seg>
<seg>It seems strange to me that it is now, I would like to maniatar to the Commission for a proposal for a directive, but that at the same time, it calls for a Green Paper on the current state of the voluntary associations and the additional medical insurance.</seg>
<seg>At a time when the population age of spectacular way, it is crucial that we seek to improve the health system, for the people of Europe as a whole.</seg>
<seg>We would not be able to contribute to this.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, there are very strong arguments in favour of the fast track when it comes to implementing the outcome of the review of the Basle on adaptation of the banking capital.</seg>
<seg>In these circumstances, such an initiative would have quite the opposite effect to the hope that by imposing our banking sectors additional obligations without guarantees of compensation. despite the demands of this House, the Commission does not have any means to ensure that the banks of the European Union will cease to be the subject of a discriminatory treatment by the American authorities.</seg>
<seg>We must be careful that Basle, moreover, does not lead to the banks that leads to a second them ballast higher demand of own resources.</seg>
<seg>This first comment, I would like to point out that I believe that the economic operators also take into account the satisfactory approach that has been given to these regulations on the capital that they strengthen the issues relating to the risk.</seg>
<seg>These are the first thoughts on how we could achieve a verifiable and outside efficient swift legislative process within the current rules of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg>And, in fact, the time has come to admit that the institution of the "European Ombudsman 'is sufficiently developed and has already given sufficient evidence of maturity to have its own budget.</seg>
<seg>The EPP / ultimately particularly supports the position of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the powers of the Ombudsman should be extended, and the sooner the better, with regard to the powers of investigation of the established by the Ombudsman in Article 3 of the 1994 decision.</seg>
<seg>The Ombudsman is obviously limited by the rules that govern the documentary secret, but is, or that the citizens know that he or she, as a supporter of the people, to have access to documents which they do not have.</seg>
<seg>The starting point of this report is the recommendation of the Ombudsman to the Commission, in relation to the previous point, which make it possible for the candidate countries access to their examinations already corrected regarding the procedure for selecting organised by the same.</seg>
<seg>We believe that the institutions of the Community would have to carry out their recruitment procedures, and, indeed, all its procedures, with the maximum openness and transparency in order to prevent the suspicions of partiality, injustice and administrative incompetence.</seg>
<seg>I am referring here to an amendment concerning the requirement of the indisputable evidence of the development of an oral tests, for example.</seg>
<seg>Our colleague, Mr Bösch, has already set out briefly here the amendments that have been made to this report.</seg>
<seg>Having made particular questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal opposition, I received specific and detailed answers.</seg>
<seg>This is beginning to open the process of the government and to make it transparent.</seg>
<seg>First of all, in the tests which have been made on the part of the Commission, the corrections are always done anonymously.</seg>
<seg>Of course it was speaking in July 2000.</seg>
<seg>Votes</seg>
<seg>(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)</seg>
<seg>In order to assess the directive on own resources of the institutes of credit to the various interests must be carefully weighed up that conflict there.</seg>
<seg>So the idea arose from a European police academy for the Member States of the European Union and for the applicant countries.</seg>
<seg>This is also the position defended by the rapporteur, and that the European People's Party shares.</seg>
<seg>The social situation in most of the Member States of the European Union is such that, in fact, there is a great need for cooperation between the different bodies of police beyond the borders of their own country.</seg>
<seg>It seems that the majority of those who have spoken so far, I think that it is essential that the Commission has a permanent seat.</seg>
<seg>The umpteenth interim but nonprecarious decision, a small gift that the Council is to make this Parliament.</seg>
<seg>The rapporteur wishes to make the prevention of crime, the provision of services, innovation and the border surveillance and also hopes that the internal security is changed so that it includes the maintenance of law and order.</seg>
<seg>These are the values which proposed to us, and that was the type of state in which they work.</seg>
<seg>I welcome the possibility of making level standards of some Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Since the first thoughts on this dossier that they were at European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission is committed to the Member States to bring an action intended to develop what we could consider a European police force, a culture rooted in the highest standards of ethics, respect for the rights and freedoms of the citizens and effectiveness in the fight against crime.</seg>
<seg>This means that the Police College is developed mainly from an intergovernmental approach.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.</seg>
<seg>- (SV) I have voted against the report on temporary creation of the European police college.</seg>
<seg>Certainly many of our courts are very slow and strong, and it is very difficult to make them act quickly on these issues.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the proposed regulation is not perfect, since it is linked with the Rules of Procedure "Brussels II ', which does not include children whose parents are separate, as well as the marriage children.</seg>
<seg>My own mother had such a kind of division and kidnapping 85 years ago, and yet it talks about it.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, I would like to say to the House that in the programme of action on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions in civil matters - whose approval we hope for at the end of this year, the Commission proposes that priority to the extension of the scope of the regulation of Brussels II is granted to the first and most and, therefore, of this regulation on visiting rights, including without discrimination to the children of unmarried couples and the trade unions, in fact.</seg>
<seg>We shall now proceed to the vote.</seg>
<seg>Today, the sport - and it is appropriate to say is closely linked to other economic sectors, such as, for example, the industries of the audiovisual sector or to the promotion and sport sale of products.</seg>
<seg>What we need is an intelligent and flexible way to interpret the current rules.</seg>
<seg>It is, strictly speaking, of an attack on democracy, no matter how much we do not see things in that light.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, the Commission is waiting to shortly receive an answer to your request for detailed information on the measures planned by the Government of the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg>This proposal was made / displayed by the Minister for the economy in a pre-budgetary statement made six months before the presentation of the complete draft budget in the spring of 2001.</seg>
<seg>Once again, I think that what has been said by Mr Simpson has been of great assistance to reassure us on the likely intentions of the government of the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg>Traffic jams are not only loss of time, not only to generate costs, but for the environment is all problem, and it is for that reason that I believe, if the British Government really gives money to resolve these problems, then all will receive some of it, above all the citizens of Europe.</seg>
<seg>We are practically the only oil producer in the European Union and in spite of this, we have the highest price of petrol, the highest price of diesel compared with any other country in Europe - we in Britain paid 1.20 GBP per litre of diesel.</seg>
<seg>This item is closed.</seg>
<seg>The European Parliament should let them know that it will be at your side, and I propose that, once again, that we speak with a minute's silence our solidarity and our emotions.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, is to support it fully, as I am one of those who have called for the inclusion of this point.</seg>
<seg>We achieved some important progress.</seg>
<seg>The EU will deepen its relations with all the important groups, and it will also be in contact with the new government of the United States as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg>Prescott on the agreement which it had produced, how is it that not only Mrs Voynet, but also, I believe, the majority of the other European environment ministers - and this is my last question to the Commissioner rejected it?</seg>
<seg>It is to be feared that the impetus has been lost, and the American negotiators change and in may need to start again.</seg>
<seg>The forests have been this time the major obstacle.</seg>
<seg>A part of the territory of the Member States of the European Union will become a sea or desert, as a result of the continuing global warming, which they are subjected.</seg>
<seg>The wealth level is high, and the price of oil products low.</seg>
<seg>I would like to congratulate the Wallström on his efforts in is and I wish him more success.</seg>
<seg>Surely it is better not to reach an agreement that to have a bad agreement, and in this case, the American position was a position of cuts, totally unacceptable for Europe.</seg>
<seg>The climate changes have major consequences for the developing countries.</seg>
<seg>I would like to repeat it in English: forest is from being carbon sinks to coal sources.</seg>
<seg>Only that credibility will allow the European Union heads the position and the action in the COP VI 'B' in Bonn.</seg>
<seg>We are going to have to make our own assessment of what happened and to prepare for documents to be in contact with the various parties and, of course, with "the group of broad representation '.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the monitoring of the next COP6 or the continuation of COP6 will be ratified in an agreement within the Union.</seg>
<seg>before the European Council, Pierre Moscovici and I myself will maintain the next Sunday a conclave, to which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, as well as a sitting of the IGC ministerial, on Monday, on the occasion of the 'General Affairs' Council.</seg>
<seg>The minimum number of Member States which are going to participate was going to limit eight, and the provision of an appeal to the European Council, which is at present a genuine right of veto will be replaced by a knowledge of the law.</seg>
<seg>It would be possible to regret it, but I am obliged to make this comment.</seg>
<seg>The European Council will also discuss the progress of the negotiations on accession, and therefore of enlargement.</seg>
<seg>The Lisbon European Council had adopted guidelines to promote an innovative and competitive European economy.</seg>
<seg>The protection of the consumer, is a growing concern on the part of the European, for obvious reasons, that they do not need greater clarification.</seg>
<seg>We must prepare for this unprecedented enlargement.</seg>
<seg>Unfortunately, the present text of the Conference is very complicated, very ambiguous and very long, with two protocols: however, in spite of this scale and this complicated, it is also very weak, does not facilitate the simple answer to us which is used for the simple problem that we have a long time ago.</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>One was that the candidate Member States themselves had to adopt and implement the "acquis communautaire 'does that is the task that shares with us.</seg>
<seg>We appreciate the charter of fundamental rights seriously and we do not want to confine ourselves to declaim it.</seg>
<seg>It is true that the text could have been better, and it could well be upgraded and be made after Nice.</seg>
<seg>It seems to me unacceptable that several governments have utterly refuse to consider the possibility of including a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty.</seg>
<seg>You do not even want to introduce it in the Treaty and in evidence that this document, this exercise has had to leave aside.</seg>
<seg>We will speak with a single thankless and vote in the WTO.</seg>
<seg>Given the uncertain prospects of success, it does not seem right to me to burden the Intergovernmental Conference with a very complex and controversial issue.</seg>
<seg>I would make an urgent appeal to the French Presidency in order to make an effort to eliminate this rejection, because it is extremely damaging.</seg>
<seg>In the field of trade policy, the Commission has drawn up a proposal which must be examined in detail.</seg>
<seg>But in the previous Treaty some progress in the implementation of this formula were achieved, also contributed to the absurd form of codecision more unanimity for issues relating to the citizenship, social security, the rights of self-employed workers and also the cultural policy.</seg>
<seg>The simple approach to this issue is, in itself, clearly demonstrative of the failure of a policy of strengthening the links of mutual trust between the countries which join the Union.</seg>
<seg>This is the situation in which we have been engaged for months in the Intergovernmental Conference, and the result is that nobody resigned to their children.</seg>
<seg>This year's experience of forces to tell us that the momentum that there is, to give the process of constitutionalisation of the Union after Nice and looking to the future of Europe must not be left to the method, which has already been exhausted, of the reserved negotiation between the representatives of the governments.</seg>
<seg>As he has quite rightly pointed out, Mr Prodi, if a rule is not adopted on the basis of majority decision-making is hampered irremediably.</seg>
<seg>In our debate today is nothing has been said on that aspect of the principle of subsidiarity, but it is very important.</seg>
<seg>We did so, we passed the extension of 1995, when the group of reflection that Carlos wensterdorp chaired with great success, came from Amsterdam, and now we are going to have a nice and we virtually continue in the same way, Mr President: giving back to the institutional issues, without finding solutions that enable us to give way to a more ambitious task, which is that enlargement to 27.</seg>
<seg>We do not add to the disappointment that will lead to the Nice Summit, if it is that Nice is, of course, unsuccessful, the disappointment caused to the peoples of our Parliament.</seg>
<seg>In the past we have shown that this objective was achieved, and, as a representative of a Member State which has benefited from a transition planned for accession, I look forward with a positive attitude towards an enlarged and peaceful Europe.</seg>
<seg>But it is necessary to understand that, if you have the right of veto, they also have the others.</seg>
<seg>But it will also be necessary to make a first move for Parliament, which will be elected in 2004, because some Member States at least will join before the new Parliament in 2004 is elected or during their term of office until 2009.</seg>
<seg>The President of the Council has addressed the issue of closer cooperation and has said that it is moving towards a consensus on this matter.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, at first sight, Nice deals with the necessary adjustments and the questions not resolved in preparation for enlargement.</seg>
<seg>If we have something of this mentality, if we made less emphasis on what is wrong in this part of the world, and we put more emphasis on what it is doing well, we should be a little more fortunate that we are at the moment.</seg>
<seg>The majority decisions that are taken in the Council should not only be applied to the goods, but also to other similar areas such as services, investment, intellectual property and the competition. paragraph 1 of Article 133 has to be amended in this respect.</seg>
<seg>The right of initiative of the European Parliament would pave the way so that the abuse of the political parties also end up to invade this highly sensitive area.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, as I said to you, by referring to the American optimism and the way in which the Americans speak for themselves, but it would also be necessary to emphasise what works and what progress.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to say that I do not believe that a problem between large and small countries.</seg>
<seg>We have worked hard, but we are facing this old problem, and I do not believe that a development by the action of one country can begin, because we are facing, once again, in twelve of the fifteen Member States to realities - national, political, democratic - very important.</seg>
<seg>Finally, Mr President, Mr Védrine, you have shown a very tense situation and has also spoken of pessimism.</seg>
<seg>It will take you, furthermore, measures in general to enhance the safety of appropriate ways to ensure that it does not happen again something similar?</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, we have to take the necessary precautions - something which we have not yet done so that the guests of this Parliament can be pleased, without having to be afraid threats. as quickly as possible, to this end, we must create the necessary technical conditions, both from the point of view of the organisation and from the point of view of safety.</seg>
<seg>Here, hospitality are there, hospitality and respect.</seg>
<seg>I would like to thank you for your contribution to you, Mr Tajani.</seg>
<seg>The best tribute to Ernest lluch and his memory would be to respect their message - diàleg in Catalan: we can offer all this opportunity to the Basque people?</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, each one can, of course, express its opinion.</seg>
<seg>(B5-0550 / 2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Commission, on the political situation in Afghanistan and humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg>When I speak of organisation, I would also like to say that, given the enormous efforts undertaken by the European Union, it is logical that it is also the responsibility of that is up to him.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, you will see in the resolution is very clear from Parliament to the security and defence policy is based on two pillars balances: civil crisis management and, in the event of failure, the military management, since the two pillars are complementary.</seg>
<seg>- (FR) Mr President, in view of the delay, which we also take and my responsibilities, I shall try to be brief in the speech I had prepared.</seg>
<seg>These relations will specifically enshrined in meetings of the Council of the North Atlantic and the copsi and in meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European candidate countries or allies.</seg>
<seg>Look, for example, what has happened in the Balkans, where we can say that each of us has played its role fully.</seg>
<seg>Also in this period we have kept fully informed of the United States in the progress of course by way of the European security and defence policy, which is a condition sine qua non for the same is developed in harmony, as is happening at the moment.</seg>
<seg>In the European Parliament, the second edition of the annual report of the European Union were on human rights, on 13 December will be organised in Paris a forum dedicated to human rights.</seg>
<seg>This policy, as you say, do not in the ambition to compete with the Atlantic Alliance, which today continues to be the basis of the collective defence of its members, or create a permanent European army.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, although I have mentioned the figure of 100 000 military, that does not mean that we are hoping to overcome the objectives laid down in Helsinki, but that we have a reserve in qualifications and different specialities, which will enable us to ensure that the 60 000 men who correspond to the objective of the Council, beyond the operational conditions of their use should be achieved.</seg>
<seg>Members of Parliament, allow me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to refer briefly to the deep political sense, adopted by a very large part of the public, of this new task, by means of which Europe is a tool of political influence that we need.</seg>
<seg>Now we are faced with the problem of making sure that, when we talk of consolidation of the liberal democracy in Europe, we refer to the whole of the European continent, because that is the enlargement and the process of enlargement.</seg>
<seg>We must be consistent in all three areas: political parties of the Community, the CFSP, including the ESDP and national measures of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>Even with our laborious procedures of the Commission, we do not need a force of 60 000 soldiers to make our objectives.</seg>
<seg>It is therefore necessary to establish urgently a solution for humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg>Although it is true that I am not in agreement with the cynics who says that Europe gets with it a new impracticable game, it is true that the rapid reaction force will not be versatile in many situations.</seg>
<seg>The EU must not be allowed to develop a system of self-defence with regular troops.</seg>
<seg>Finally, a worse situation in Afghanistan, I would like to express my group's concern for every time and to urge the Commission and the Council to do everything it can to achieve a peaceful solution and to help the population, especially now the entry of the winter.</seg>
<seg>To put it simply: where, when and how the European force must act of intervention.</seg>
<seg>They make it possible to include / understand the terrible balance of these two months' intifada ': 270 dead, the majority of the Palestinians, and around 10 000 injured, often had for life.</seg>
<seg>That is why it is also your continuing efforts is to create an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction is extremely depressing.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, contrary to what has been said by the previous speaker, I do not know whether it would be possible and desirable for the European Union to do more than the conflict and the escalation of violence do before that has taken place in the Middle East, especially now, in the period of transition in the United States.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I am going to focus this speech in dealing with the Commissioner's report, which, in my opinion, is well drafted and it is clearly expressed.</seg>
<seg>a political concept does not exist, and certainly not with a common foreign and security policy.</seg>
<seg>The EU has only a problem, that is to say, that is not well known now to arouse the interest of the public by such measures, even though they are much more sustainable and effective.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, next is, of course, the budget are how this is to be distributed.</seg>
<seg>And I say this, in spite of the enormous number of apparent guarantees that on this subject have arisen in the last few days miracles.</seg>
<seg>We would have to work together and coordinadamente. we should move towards a better European policy on the acquisition of supplies to have a defence industry more efficient than it offers greater value in exchange for the money.</seg>
<seg>Even those who question the usefulness of the decision, for example, to create the euroejército appeal must repair in the important political dimension of this decision and its influence in the cohesion of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The first presence of a Minister of Defence in our House has been a historic that we have set aside the sitting at night, so that the impression is not too strong for our Members.</seg>
<seg>For all of them, a civil management of preventive crisis is the best means than the military solutions.</seg>
<seg>Do you wish to Russia, in the long term, to participate in a political Union with an undemocratic regime?</seg>
<seg>Therefore, Europe is not going to be a new alliance, as it seems to me to have heard mention in an argument informed incomplete.</seg>
<seg>I have received a motion for a resolution, pursuant to Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure, to wind up this debate.</seg>
<seg>Given the scale of the task, it was entrusted to the four committees and a new procedure laid down, with four parallel reports.</seg>
<seg>The whole of the measures proposed in the White Paper must agree on modernising and making all the effective operation of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>It would therefore be advisable that the reform was an opportunity to limit its intervention solely in the areas which do not involve expenditure.</seg>
<seg>The assessment differences which emerged were not only of a political nature, but which reflected even further the cultural differences between the fifteen Member States.</seg>
<seg>The new internal audit service, under the direct responsibility of you, Mr Kinnock, the Vice-President responsible for reform, will have the main task of the analysis of the functions and the internal control systems which exist in the Commission.</seg>
<seg>It has been a pleasure to work together, and I believe that the process to address a major reform of the Commission, which is essential for the future of the European Union, is grappling with a comprehensive and a value added, thanks to the participation of us four.</seg>
<seg>They can have expectations of transfer to the other European institutions, implementation of temporary detachments for obligations on the national authorities or to work in the private sector.</seg>
<seg>In this way, our constitutional committee recalls the commitment to an executive, independent, more effective Commission, transparent and politically responsible.</seg>
<seg>As the Committee on Budgets, we consider that the establishment of an activity-based budget leads to problems due to the lack of visibility of the cost and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament, as the budgetary authority.</seg>
<seg>That will mark, of course, the good will of this Parliament to proceed with this reform of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work.</seg>
<seg>This is shameful, if we take into account that the EU itself is the first Ombudsman of the modernisation of economic life.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in spite of the efforts of the rapporteurs, to support the work of the Commission, is that the recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts, a global and coherent response, with a view to a government policy still does not exist, and not only to better management of the institution.</seg>
<seg>This change of attitude would have to be reflected in the transparency of its administration.</seg>
<seg>From my point of view, in the world, a structure does not have this magazine a larger and fundamental importance: fifteen Member States and, in the future, 20 or more, an entire continent are a part of the world at the moment more industrialised barks in the Union and, through it, in the Commission, by means of its structures.</seg>
<seg>The change is never easy.</seg>
<seg>In so doing, however, from the Socialist Group, we feel that the present functioning of the European public administration is quite effective.</seg>
<seg>The result is well known, that he has pointed out, the commitment and the competence of the many Members of the Commission and its administration.</seg>
<seg>Many thousands of requests for projects already take more than a year, waiting for an evaluation.</seg>
<seg>The debate, as we have seen, is not so much of the principles, objectives or opportunity of reform, regardless of procedures, pace, timetable, possible malfunctions or unintended consequences of its implementation.</seg>
<seg>I would like to begin by informing the House that at its meeting this morning, as has been pointed out by Mr van Hulten before, the Commission has adopted a proposal in the institutional agreement for the establishment of a consultative group on basic standards in public life, as planned in action 1 of the action programme of the White Paper.</seg>
<seg>In addition, these changes, it is obvious that it would only be possible with a modification of the Treaties.</seg>
<seg>The main objective of which is to achieve a simplification, to increase the transparency and to strengthen the budgetary principles, that is to say, in particular, less incomprehensible derogations, less special regulations and to increase the efficiency and effectiveness in the budgetary procedure.</seg>
<seg>It is simply very uneconomical to the Commission that, according to the contracts for cost X must reimburse a 20% for costs and a 30% and often together and see the evidence of very small sums of money.</seg>
<seg>In accordance with the agenda, Perez del Arco is the debate on the report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of the European Union's relations with the developing countries and the impact of the reform of the Commission in these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI)).</seg>
<seg>These aspects are very particular NGOs.</seg>
<seg>Of course, that is not enough, but it must all be safe from the caricatures the shortage of our development aid.</seg>
<seg>We will return to this now, because it is a good framework in itself.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I have again today from Mozambique, where the European Union has been responsible for a brilliant humanitarian aid after the flood disaster, but, once again, the reconstruction projects, which we have already allocated funds are delayed the delay of companies in Brussels.</seg>
<seg>In view of these facts, the need for greater involvement and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment are inevitable.</seg>
<seg>We have a harmonised system now to draft country strategy papers and indicative programmes of cooperation in all developing countries.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the creation of the SEM did not provide a solution to the continuing disparity between 8 extensive administrative resources.</seg>
<seg>. (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, that you had a very special interest to be with you today in this debate on the first maritime package in the European Parliament, is that you are going to look at three important texts, that they represent an essential first step in a matter that recent events have placed, unfortunately, at the fault of the present time.</seg>
<seg>From the point of view of the Presidency of the Council, that would enable us, on the other hand, to discuss with the Member States, an agreement on the basis of the proposals announced / displayed by you, and to adopt the text at first reading, with a qualified majority, if necessary.</seg>
<seg>The rapid treatment and specialist that has had a result in the two Erika packages and six proposals have generated an enormous impetus.</seg>
<seg>The lesson that this Parliament should retain this morning is that, without a doubt, the maritime legislation is throughout the world in vagueness state and we have to start the process to put in order.</seg>
<seg>We must send out a clear signal that the European waters and ports, we are not going to tolerate vessels that do not meet the standards.</seg>
<seg>For small vessels, we adopted a position of compromise between the limit of 5 000 tonnes, raised by the IMO, and one of the 600, raised by the Commission.</seg>
<seg>These data should be made available to European, State and port authorities, as well as the interested public.</seg>
<seg>cross-border nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can impact on a greater region, leads to the need for a Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution.</seg>
<seg>In cooperation with the local organisations for the protection of the environment are included.</seg>
<seg>to amend the directive in the direction of greater rigour in its application, a harmonisation of the legislation, particularly with regard to the selection of the vessels under the inspection and the scope of the different types of inspections, is clearly positive.</seg>
<seg>I would like to emphasise once again that there is no urgency, in which you insist.</seg>
<seg>I believe that in the case of the limit of the liability of classification societies, regardless of what is decided today, it is important that the Council and Parliament return to reflect together on this.</seg>
<seg>The black box, a black list and all other I seem to us an excellent ideas and we are completely in agreement with them, but I should like to highlight a number of points.</seg>
<seg>In the face of this disaster and chaotic situation of maritime transport, Europe has accepted the challenge and eleven months after the Erika disaster, the European Union will be in a position to announce that procedure has never worked with great speed.</seg>
<seg>It is clear to what extent the liberal logic is against, in fact, to a high degree of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg>In conclusion, regardless of the technical measures are taken, one of the largest sources of uncertainty will continue to exist as long as not reequilibre, the area of the Channel and the North Atlantic, the exponential growth in traffic arising from hipertrofia ports in the North Sea.</seg>
<seg>I would highlight the current President of the Council who commissioned the situation in their own country.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, since the sinking of the oil tanker, Erika, a series of measures with a view to increasing safety has been tabled under political pressure vessels in the sea.</seg>
<seg>Some Greek ships sink immediately, Mr Gayssot, without there being a hurricane.</seg>
<seg>Thirdly, when we talk of this kind of information, it seems to me that it is becoming clear that the relationship does not link between, on the one hand, the oil supply and, on the other hand, the fact that it is still use of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg>We therefore have to end political courage of our environmental ambitions.</seg>
<seg>This means that, in this area, more than in any other, our responsibility is great, and that we must, in my view, to silence any indication of institutional pride.</seg>
<seg>For example, in Finland, it is of the utmost importance that Russia will endorse these agreements.</seg>
<seg>This is the strengthening of the requirements for the construction of ships, the improvement of the rules for the port controls and the greater the severity of the rules for the organisation of inspections and expert work of vessels, which is a consequence of the previous one.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, today we are debating the maritime safety on the basis of three reports whose rapporteurs I congratulate sincerely.</seg>
<seg>With regard to these three new proposals relating to the maritime safety, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs, who have shown in extremely short deadlines that Parliament is very determined to adopt new measures to increase safety at sea, the controls, the rules of construction and that is intolerable that such accidents happen again.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, in the recent past, several maritime accidents involving considerable consequences, in particular those in which they were involved oil, has shaken our continent.</seg>
<seg>But 80% of accidents are linked to human error, but there are reasons for human error, which are social order.</seg>
<seg>a parliamentarian or parliamentarian has used the term 'traceability'.</seg>
<seg>The directive of state control of the port is designed to monitor compliance with international requirements and she does not want to introduce new rules.</seg>
<seg>Amendment No 18 proposes the state control of the port in relation to rest periods of seafarers, even if the implementation of the provisions relating to the working hours of seafarers is already fully covered by Directive 99 / 95.</seg>
<seg>I am pleased to see that the rapporteur has included in Amendment No 21, a reference to the system of evaluation of the conditions, and we agree with the proposed perspective, it is necessary that the wording is to make it clearer.</seg>
<seg>18 and part of Amendment No 4, relating to paragraph "K 'are not acceptable.</seg>
<seg>I can assure you that if a shipowner intends to register a ship in the register, after our proposal will have to think twice.</seg>
<seg>The Commissioner has spoken for 18 minutes, and during that time, she has mentioned dozens and dozens of articles, and has rejected the Commission's position.</seg>
<seg>Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council in relation to a number of actions relating to the trans-European network of collection, job creation and the dissemination of the statistics on the expiry date of extra-communitarian goods intra-European and (EDICOM) (COM (9) 0458 - C5-0401 / 9 - 2000 / 0201 (COD)) (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)</seg>
<seg>However, by withdrawing the resolution, I am convinced that, with a view to the Nice Council, our Parliament would have made its voice heard better dedicating a resolution specific and different from the very important and difficult issues from the Intergovernmental Conference, instead of dealing with them in the context of a single resolution, which includes all the other items on the agenda of the Council.</seg>
<seg>(since there have been more than twelve Members, the oral amendment was rejected) (Parliament adopted the resolution)</seg>
<seg>report (A5-0337 / 2000) by Mrs Sauquillo Perez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of the relations between the European Union and the developing countries, and the impact of the reform of the Commission on these relations (2000 / 2051 (INI))</seg>
<seg>I have voted against to protest against the fact that the European Union still does not manage to take part, and would also have in this area.</seg>
<seg>But neither the proposal for the amendment of the existing directive on the control of ships or the Watts report respond to the real needs, they give to certain passages in positive; the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have therefore voted in favour of the report.</seg>
<seg>Thus, it is regrettable that the Commission's proposal has not taken up the idea of the creation of a genuine European corps of vigilance, following the model of "coast guards' in the United States.</seg>
<seg>. () necessary condition for the safety of ships, the protection of life at sea and the protection of the environment is the fight against the immunity which shipowners benefit from, the adoption of strict measures for the control of the situation of the ships and the imposition of strict sanctions to the shipping companies which violate the safety rules are also, to improve the working conditions of the Merchant Navy, and to provide adequate training to them, as well as to guarantee organic constituent forms that they respond to the growing needs of vessels.</seg>
<seg>The rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, unfortunately, has done the opposite.</seg>
<seg>The sinking of the Erika, in December 1999, is at the origin of the emergence of the issue of maritime safety in the Community's political agenda and was under pressure from the European Parliament, as the Commission proposed the texts which we have voted today, almost a year after the sinister shipwreck.</seg>
<seg>The current compensation funds have not been adequately equipped and this has become more than obvious in the case of the Braer disaster, in which the fishing industry in the Shetland Islands has not been adequately compensated for their losses.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, I have already said that a few years ago I had the opportunity to travel.</seg>
<seg>The rapporteur's proposals relating to the harmonisation at European level is entirely positive.</seg>
<seg>This is an important point, because it concerns the societies of ship classification.</seg>
<seg>It would be rather a great success, since Europe that we need, on the eve of enlargement, it is not a Europe rigid, hierarchical, remote, but a Europe that is flexible and closer to the people, therefore, based on respect for the national democracies.</seg>
<seg>More and more open the struggle for power between many Member States may blur the possibilities to reach a compromise.</seg>
<seg>The most important task of Nice is to ensure that the EU has effective institutions.</seg>
<seg>In a week of the summit, I personally have hopes.</seg>
<seg>I am not in favour of replacing the vote by qualified majority automatically, and the codecision procedure, and I also believe that any initiative to extend the co-decision powers must be taken on a case by case basis.</seg>
<seg>When amending Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extend qualified majority voting, currently in force in the Council for the trade in goods, to other areas such as public services, intellectual property, health or education.</seg>
<seg>In this way, the European Parliament has no influence right, silence, as a tribute to the partisanship, the national fidelities and the governments and forget its obligations towards the citizens.</seg>
<seg>I have also voted against a text which calls for the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty that it is adopted in Nice.</seg>
<seg>It is a mistake to divide the Union into two groups, and that is why I cannot support the idea that at the top, one third of the Member States is.</seg>
<seg>its new role has led the neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.</seg>
<seg>In this report there are many things that the Group of the consevadores British can support, in particular, the emphasis is placed on the enlargement of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament voted in favour of the report on the creation of a common European policy in the field of security and defence.</seg>
<seg>but also against the peoples of the European Union, which will have to be financed, in any case, the new expenditure on armaments, which the report proposes and which will not even have the guarantee that the military forces are not used a day against themselves, in the name of the 'policing'.</seg>
<seg>It also serious is the claim that a State that does not want to participate in a mission will be forced to pay a financial contribution will distribute States participating in that war.</seg>
<seg>However, with military means of outside any solution is not achieved, then the cause of the conflict, does not take off or changes of public opinion.</seg>
<seg>(the military operations should be financed from the Community budget line, and that the Member States must also contribute with funds if they do not wish to participate in the operations (paragraphs 49 and 50).</seg>
<seg>However, in the EU, it would come to you that the priorities of the Petersberg tasks were reversed and attention was to humanitarian and civil options.</seg>
<seg>I support this report by my colleague, Maj-Britt Theorin.</seg>
<seg>But the needs of this category are not mentioned more than to give way to the demand for a tax deductibility of domestic services and of a 'adaptation of prices and costs to the financial resources of the individuals'.</seg>
<seg>In fact, it is extraordinary that, in the twenty-first century, we have to recommend that the Member States should guarantee for domestic servants the right to social security and a proper pension.</seg>
<seg>For many young people, its first contact with the labour market can be a black economy.</seg>
<seg>It is the most serious when it is women from distant countries, which have made this type of work by necessity and that they do not have any chance of winning the life in a sustainable way.</seg>
<seg>The reform of the Commission will be judged by the facts, hence the need for regular reports on monitoring which will over current / will show the period of duration of the programme and the importance of the expected complete balance in December 2002.</seg>
<seg>In the recent past, various scandals and failures of operation concluded in March 1999, with the resignation of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>In conclusion, I feel that it is essential to remember that through this reform, which is essential for the future, we at the same time, we expect more rigorous and more transparency on the part of the Commission in its day-to-day management, but also a greater sense of responsibility on the other hand, within the framework of strict of its powers.</seg>
<seg>The Conservatives, we also support the statement contained in paragraph 7 of the report, according to which the democratic control should be guaranteed and that it is allowed to exploit the system of the three pillars.</seg>
<seg>(The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)</seg>
<seg>We have received the information - and I would like to say straight away that I cannot think it absolutely - of which the Council President and Head of the French State is going to be presented tomorrow only 30 minutes here to speak.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, it seems to me that we should exclude that we will be able to have a fair and argued position.</seg>
<seg>Let us do what we do, we will vote, and I am in favour of a resolution, as suggested by Mr Poettering, Mr Prodi.</seg>
<seg>During the night work has been done in both these texts as in the figures relating to the distribution of votes in the Council and to the distribution of seats in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, I would like to request with insistence that does not take away from the agenda the report by Mr de Roo, because, in addition to be drawn up very well in the past the Environment Council of the French Presidency, which will take place on Monday and Tuesday of the next week, is expected to adopt a common position on this matter.</seg>
<seg>Thank you, Mr Parish.</seg>
<seg>In the meetings of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, as its President, are there and smoke.</seg>
<seg>The political basis is clear: to harmonise the market both with a high level of public health and consumer protection on the basis of existing legislation and in the development of scientific knowledge.</seg>
<seg>What is at stake is the quality and concept of life, in which the protection of health is a very significant part.</seg>
<seg>This rule can also be applied to all dangerous drugs for fun, but if no one more than the consumer can be affected.</seg>
<seg>recently in the United States trials against the tobacco multinationals have gained to poison and lying on the absence of toxicity of products.</seg>
<seg>We believe that the only possible, and the logical thing is that we have with the cigarette exports banned in the Union for health reasons.</seg>
<seg>Instead of the past to learn the lessons of this failure registered in Luxembourg on 9 October, we insist on a legally indefensible attitude.</seg>
<seg>I have looked at carefully to what the Commissioner said to my colleague, Mr Hume: "cannot have a massive loss of jobs in this sector.</seg>
<seg>It is the Parliament and the Council that they have to approve this proposal for a directive and to discuss, amongst other things, the appropriate legal basis for this.</seg>
<seg>Mr Maaten and others, there is a danger that, if this Parliament and the Council to accept the restrictive interpretation that the leader of the European People's Party and propose. by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and the Community institutions as a whole would be making our hands for legislative development of the Community institutions, which is so important for the development of Community law.</seg>
<seg>The weak point of this proposal is that it is a particular emphasis on the promotion of free competition.</seg>
<seg>In conclusion, since the signing of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has powers of coordination in environmental matters and protection to the consumer, and will work closely together, of course, with the Council and the Commission in this area.</seg>
<seg>In fact, this has nothing to do with tobacco, but that the judgment of the European Court of Justice could also be given to ban alcohol advertising or the advertising of chocolate, then, of course, the sugar sector can also be harmful to health.</seg>
<seg>I simply do not understand that a majority of this Parliament is to propose to relax the rules relating to the export more than what the governments are proposing the governments of the Member States - which also represent the many industries referred to.</seg>
<seg>It is a proven fact that 80% of smokers want to stop it, but in the tabaquero sector it promotes very few policies to help people to stop smoking.</seg>
<seg>If we want to say to the other countries what levels of public health must set by extending to the export our reasonable proposals for the internal market, we will be in danger of all the good work done by Mr Maaten.</seg>
<seg>We are in favour of what is arrived at a method of testing recognised in all the countries of the EU, to make in a country determined in a research laboratory recognised.</seg>
<seg>Today, the effects of which are openly admitted on the health of tobacco consumption, and both the legislators and public opinion shares the feeling that the time has come to impose strict rules and regulations in this area.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, the Community rules would fit in perfectly with the future international agreements, thus preventing the danger of the obstacles to trade and stepping up at the same time, the protection of consumers and to guarantee a high level of health protection.</seg>
<seg>It would be better to wait until the issue of additives has dealt with as a whole in the first report of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>As far as the laboratory tests, the amendment relating to the approval of the evidence is superfluous, because another Article already provides for the free movement of goods which comply with the provisions of the directive.</seg>
<seg>. () Madam President, in this report does not have complications: at the present time, the directives on summer time are only five years in force, and they then have to go back to the House for its renewal.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive relating to the provisions on summer-time, that there is before us, is a good proposal.</seg>
<seg>I therefore believe that we in this House should not to take up too much time on this subject, because the Member States, as well as the population, has already agreed to a large extent, the regulation of summertime, and this has been recognised as part of our annual rate.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, it is important that the issues relating to the slots and the application of the regulations on summer-time are, as laid down in the proposal, in the field of decision-making of the Member States.</seg>
<seg>It would be more justified than summer-time completed at the end of September, some six months of its implementation.</seg>
<seg>It can accept the presentation of appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the year 2007 to report that Article 5 is concerned.</seg>
<seg>It is made it clear that the interventions in the human germ line, cannot be accepted.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, I believe that in the Committee on Ethics, in which people work that they do not do this work as the main profession, can be granted to a term something more closely, but on the authorities of a certain amount of pressure of time should exercise so that they will be rapidly to work.</seg>
<seg>These groups should be maintained in the field of application of the directive.</seg>
<seg>But I am also glad that we have managed to find cerrojazo to gene therapy.</seg>
<seg>I would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his report and to thank him for his efforts to reconcile the opposing positions.</seg>
<seg>These programmes are linked to the fight against cancer, with the prevention of AIDS, the prevention of drug addiction and the promotion in the field of health are the adjournment would mean the end of the relative projects and the work of the networks, which were set up for this purpose.</seg>
<seg>It is very good to be able to ease the a priori ground, so that, even in the event that it is necessary to make a second reading to be close to the point at which the decisions are taken.</seg>
<seg>In addition, we must take into account both the prevention and promotion and monitoring are going to be increasingly important, and, for that reason, it would be necessary to provide them with more working on the assumption and to give more importance to them.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, on the occasion of the Trakatellis report on the extension of the existing European programmes in the field of public health, I would like to express my concern about how and in what way is the European policy in the field of public health.</seg>
<seg>I understand that the Council has also given its consent in principle.</seg>
<seg>In the European Union the paradox is taking place at the moment that the abolition of the internal borders for the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must coexist with the maintenance of 15 borders in the fields of police and judicial criminal prosecution authorities, that the Member States have difficulties in getting.</seg>
<seg>In conclusion, the initiative is an important step forward in the creation of a European judicial area of justice, albeit partial and limited, but it responds to the real needs of a huge number of European citizens who, until now, been almost have abandoned when they have been the victims of a crime outside the territory of their normal residence.</seg>
<seg>What we have asked for this group of people?</seg>
<seg>At the same time, a special training for professionals is due to ensure that will have to its position, the direct contact with the victims.</seg>
<seg>The victims must not become people doubly penalised, first because of a crime, and then, because of the system.</seg>
<seg>Furthermore, in this context, it is important that the report of a simple and professional way to the relatives, that is, to the relatives of the victims, the facts if they so wish, and that they can count on the support needed so that they do not have to find out all through the press.</seg>
<seg>This applies irrespective of the crime has been committed.</seg>
<seg>Never, at the level of the Member States or in the Community, it is necessary to make the basic principle of the people must always take responsibility for their actions.</seg>
<seg>In other cases, the information could be achieved that is needed in a language of the Union, which is not one's own.</seg>
<seg>I welcome the positive response to me of Parliament before the first text on such an important issue, so that the area of freedom, security and justice that we are building, gradually, can give our fellow citizens support in situations which are often difficult to support.</seg>
<seg>Vote on request for urgent procedure</seg>
<seg>(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)</seg>
<seg>In this way, on the evening of 23 to 24 November we have come to an agreement with the Council on the central points of a budget which is not brilliant is reasonable.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, the Commission has proposed a review by EUR 300 million to which I was against tooth and nail in the Council.</seg>
<seg>But I also know from the talks held that it is even more difficult to formulate a common position of the Council, to achieve a negotiation mandate and to ensure that the purely national egoisms end at a more or less reasonable and acceptable pan-European decision.</seg>
<seg>I hope that the work for recruitment office common, as it says in the modern German, that is to say, a European authority of recruitment, real progress, so that we can work together to overcome the problems which will arise in the next few years to all the institutions - the Council and the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions, that is to say, the need for staff in the next few years.</seg>
<seg>The Council is refusing to carry out this review - it seems that now we must have the data and I want to warn: to use the flexibility instrument two years at a stretch, two consecutive years - in fact, in less than 15 months and the first of them to less than six months of the approval of the financial perspective, it is emptying the flexibility instrument because it prevents its replacement and its possible accumulation, which it is planned to a height of 600 million.</seg>
<seg>This very significant amount, which responds to the existence of needs very high in 2001, will be able to finance, mainly thanks to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument for the value of EUR 200 million.</seg>
<seg>In view of this new element, the Council has voted, at second reading, a budget increase in a 2.5%.</seg>
<seg>Finally, before you come to the final adoption of this budget, I would like to highlight the work of the Council in respecting certain basic budgetary rules, in the field of implementation of appropriations in reserve, the legal basis and the classification of expenditure.</seg>
<seg>and on the other hand that in Nice, I believe that the three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission in general are very satisfied with the result.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and gentlemen, the emergence of new sick cows of BSE are also necessary that it was taken immediately in the financial sector, in particular for the protection of health, consumer protection and also for the aid to the farmers affected by this situation.</seg>
<seg>In addition, the Council has set for the framework programme of assistance to the reconstruction of the Western Balkans a multiannual indicative amount, of course, that it is compatible with the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg>With a great deal of effort, we achieved a couple of million euros.</seg>
<seg>I warmly thank Mrs Haug.</seg>
<seg>It will think that that 1% of the budget of the European Union are very well used.</seg>
<seg>You have said, if I have understood correctly, that we do not have to use the reserve, because it was an infringement of the rules.</seg>
<seg>I believe that we have seen very positive things, together with many others, I am not going to mention now due to pressure of time involved.</seg>
<seg>Although the expenditure on agriculture, which represent almost half of the total budget, are increased, having taken into account the letter of amendment in more of a 5%, the total increase of the budget is only 3.5%.</seg>
<seg>We see a great risk that in the next few years, it increases the confrontation between the MEDA programme, projects of countries bordering on the Mediterranean and the Balkans, although we all know that money is needed as a matter of urgency.</seg>
<seg>happy to have overcome the difficulties that made to close the path towards the aim to comply with the commitments made in Helsinki with the candidate countries without destroy the Union, to allow the Europe of tomorrow which continues to work effectively.</seg>
<seg>They are real, but they do not go as far as the presidency - which has shown, and I emphasise, for one reason or purpose national of a great openness would have wished.</seg>
<seg>A new legal basis for the statute for European political parties has been planned, and to the House the status of planned institutional plaintiff in Article 230 of the Treaty is granted to him.</seg>
<seg>These last few weeks three important results have been achieved.</seg>
<seg>This is the meaning of the declaration adopted in Nice and started thinking to coordinate at European level in the fight against doping.</seg>
<seg>Between the threats, it is, as you all know, climatic warming.</seg>
<seg>In addition, in Nice, the European Union has established the permanent bodies need to define and to direct a common foreign and security policy, it is a political and security committee, a military committee, a general European teachers.</seg>
<seg>For this cooperation, for his support and also for his fellow refugee, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency thanks to them.</seg>
<seg>In these areas, in fact, the Conference has hit the intransigence of certain Member States with regard to this, I feel a deep disappointment, not only by the short-term consequences, but by the spirit of closed sky, closure, lack of understanding that emerges from this position.</seg>
<seg>So we must pay tribute to the Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, who has fought to the fund for the sake of a fairer presence of the accession states and to make less unreasonable, although it is still too high, the threshold of qualified majority. in this way, has confirmed the great historic role in Belgium in the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Now we must carefully examine the text in Parliament.</seg>
<seg>I would point out, by the way, Mr President of the European Council, who pay the costs the taxpayer to them.</seg>
<seg>And I see in it a failure in relation to the declared ambition of the European Union not only change the institutions to be able to welcome correctly in the new States and improved the efficiency of the European Union, but also a failure in relation to another important objective, which has perhaps been mentioned very little, the approach of the European Union and the citizens.</seg>
<seg>The good issues are for us that the impressive human tide has asked that, from the whole of Europe, have converged in Nice on the eve of the summit.</seg>
<seg>In the first place, the Member States have signed up and running and rend gases quickly with the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</seg>
<seg>(Applause)</seg>
<seg>My group is disappointed by the Treaty and concerned about the future which will cause us, and that is why we will be voting against it with all our strength.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, you have the floor.</seg>
<seg>Finally, I would say to Mr Hager that the instrument of closer cooperation is, in my view, be a useful tool to ensure that Europe has a dynamic and that alum the way, as I said a little while ago, I believe.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I would like to know whether the competence of the European Parliament on summertime is a new conquest of Nice.</seg>
<seg>Perhaps demoralized until now by the complexity of clinical trials, laboratories to find, in the will expressed by both the Member States and by our Assembly, the value of developing the market of pediátricos medicinal products, although it does not have sufficient size for the recovery of investment.</seg>
<seg>And we need to redirect the change of summer time, which was fixed for the oil crises, with the aim of saving energy, and which had been extended until 2001?</seg>
<seg>not always the protection of the status of victims in criminal proceedings is the right one.</seg>
<seg>As a result, many passengers and tourists will benefit from this European initiative.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I will only speak to welcome Mr President of the Commission, which is here, and to the Presidency of the Council who are dealt with, and to stress that, probably never a unanimity as this has been expressed in this Parliament on the results of a summit.</seg>
<seg>That work is the one which, in six months, under the direction of the French Presidency, has ended, I believe, in spite of everything, its work on six key chapters.</seg>
<seg>However, my greatest fear is that Great Britain, France and Germany is now able to subvert the delicate balance created between Member States of different sizes and institutions over several decades.</seg>
<seg>It is difficult to understand how the decisions of Nice could facilitate the enlargement of the EU.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, I can be very brief.</seg>
<seg>For all that, I can only draw the consequence of that when we vote on the Treaty of Nice, I am going to vote against.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the most important result of Nice was, in spite of everything, which signed a treaty, so that it is now possible to give scope for the candidate countries.</seg>
<seg>The real winners in this conference are Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, the Members' no 'of Europe.</seg>
<seg>Then we can forget Nice, let us look at which come later, and I would like you to feed my hope with the project on broad agreement made by Belgium for your Presidency, as is shown, it is necessary to make a clean break and it is new, it is necessary to change of method, it is necessary to speed up history: 2004 is much too late, are too far and are too dangerous.</seg>
<seg>Instead, the spirit of Nice has been to ask how it is possible to be blocked, how it is possible to be intergubernamentalizar, how they can commend him for it in defending home, as the national interests rather than working so that the European Union real progress.</seg>
<seg>After Amsterdam and Nice, we were a Europe of principalities, a Europe of national governments, and not the Europe of the political unification.</seg>
<seg>We cannot continue to be confronted with the lack of qualified majority decisions in the essential issues.</seg>
<seg>It is true - and I will quote Mr Bayrou, which I take this seat of this morning does at the beginning, accompanying the President of the Republic, and then, in a personal capacity, and criticisms, which, in view, are measured, friendly rain, but that does not, however, stop being criticism.</seg>
<seg>In fact, we must not forget that it is the first time since 1957, that reform, to review the model.</seg>
<seg>We are in a constitutional systems, and the authorities cannot be confused.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office.</seg>
<seg>But neither has been incorporated into the Treaties and there has been a reference to the Charter in paragraph 2 of Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.</seg>
<seg>Finally, there are some positive aspects: the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty does the Article relating to the political parties and their status does the right of this Parliament to demand of the other institutions before the Court of Justice: that is also an important factor of political control does the new formula for the European Commission, including the so-called 'lex Prodi' in the Treaty, by strengthening the President and the new composition of the Commission, it is a reasonable compromise which I accept and will work with time does and, as has been pointed out by my colleague, Mr Tsatsos, it is the way forward in the future.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, we have already made a rigorous evaluation of what happened in Nice, but it is important to remember that the Nice Summit was started with the agenda is very limited.</seg>
<seg>Let us look at things: it is not included in the work of the Treaty the Charter, not even a comment.</seg>
<seg>We want to demonstrate to the Heads of Government who we know it to do better.</seg>
<seg>In spite of the heart problems that the French Government has taken this morning, the IGC, quite frankly, has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, it is not easy to criticise the French Presidency during this debate, because it is not present. I include / understand that President Chirac.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that the Intergovernmental Conference is out of date.</seg>
<seg>2001 budget (continuation)</seg>
<seg>This does not mean, however, that things could not have been done, and I would like to divide better. two areas.</seg>
<seg>This maxim is forcing the Commission to establish priorities within a limited budget, and every government must do.</seg>
<seg>With the vote that will follow this debate it just to the long and difficult process of adoption of the budget of the European Union for 2001.</seg>
<seg>That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis recourse to Article 272 does the financial perspectives have been, despite having used the flexibility instrument.</seg>
<seg>Let me just say to the Council that, with regard to this party, we have not been without balls, and this team proposes to continue until we get the right result.</seg>
<seg>We do not want to see in the resolution, Mr Colom I Naval, it is already a review proposal for the next year, because we want to wait for the assessment of the World Bank, but we share his criticism of the way to solve the financial insufficiency in category 4 distorts the multiannual character of the great external objectives of the Union, and even the definition of the financial perspective.</seg>
<seg>For this to be possible, it will be necessary to set priorities.</seg>
<seg>The only way that the money will be used correctly and properly that our fellow citizens make available to us.</seg>
<seg>If we add the supplementary budget, which is to be expected, because it will be almost 8%, whereas in all the other areas - it is now the training policy, internal policy, including research, foreign policy, the administration, the aid to the pre-accession overall experience only a growth rate of 1.1%.</seg>
<seg>And as the cooperation is very positive, in the next supplementary budget, back in January, we will have the opportunity to continue.</seg>
<seg>I also want to criticise the relations not yet regulated between Russia and the Baltic States.</seg>
<seg>We listened with great interest to the development of the Russian society and the internal policy.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy for Russia represents the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>Although President Putin even will guarantee the democratic development of his country, it is not necessarily a guarantor of a stable Russia and democratic. democratic order is not yet a reality lived in Russia.</seg>
<seg>We do not have to be insidiosos on our part, but that we must build the Europe of economic cooperation.</seg>
<seg>As far as the Caucasus is concerned, Mr Van Orden, is absolutely right.</seg>
<seg>Anyone who looks at Russia from outside and it is isolated impressions of the country and Russian partners are in danger of selective declare this as the reality of the country that is precisely in its image of Russia.</seg>
<seg>In the political field, the common strategy for Russia is proposing to enter into a permanent dialogue on and security policy and to establish a permanent mechanism for it.</seg>
<seg>I would like to stress the seriousness that Russia is a political union with Belarus.</seg>
<seg>Do you intend to support this project, Commissioner Patten?</seg>
<seg>In that respect, during the last summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi, as Parliament will know, sent a wide-ranging dialogue on energy.</seg>
<seg>I am very hopeful personally to visit Kaliningrad in the first part of next year, and not only because there Kant after all his life in that city.</seg>
<seg>Once again, I congratulate you on your excellent report on a very important issue, that in the next few years we will come back time and time again - and I am sure in this Parliament.</seg>
<seg>You put me in a difficult position.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I would like to say that this debate is very necessary because the BSE crisis has a huge impact on feedingstuffs, on culture and the import of animal feed.</seg>
<seg>The Council has expressed its concern in many meetings with Russia, at all levels, in particular to put it to use excessive force and to avoid a possible extension of the conflict, so that it is independent and effective investigations on the violations of human rights, so that it supports the OSCE assistance group in fulfilling its mission and, finally, to ensure that it serves the transport of humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, on a point of order, that is usual in this House that the questions that cannot be answered orally sufficient answer later in writing.</seg>
<seg>(Interruption by Mr Posselt)</seg>
<seg>This directive is of 1992.</seg>
<seg>In this respect, it will be necessary to work.</seg>
<seg>These groups are clearly set out of this new proposal.</seg>
<seg>. (FR) the Presidency, and several Member States have already received letters from the European Committee of sugar manufacturers on the proposal of the Commission, who will be taken into account in its deliberations.</seg>
<seg>Question Nº 6 (H-0886 / 9):</seg>
<seg>In the first place, I have to say that, in my opinion, the President-in-Office of the Council has not yet replied to the question by Mr Korakas.</seg>
<seg>Now, it is necessary to set up this authority, and I believe that the European authorities are very concienciadas and that we will have to move forward.</seg>
<seg>More specifically, has met the representative of the Presidency, in this case the French ambassador in Algeria, with Mr Solana.</seg>
<seg>We welcome the measures proposed in this respect by the preparatory committee and agreed by the General Assembly on the method of certification of the non-governmental organisations, the preparatory process and the special session in September 2001.</seg>
<seg>The cooperation contains a number of references to the European Convention on Human Rights.</seg>
<seg>As I pointed out to the Council in your previous answer, the process of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters will enable us to better protect the rights of the people.</seg>
<seg>I would like to call it a little more.</seg>
<seg>In particular, it guarantees the political control and the strategic axis of a military operation of crisis management.</seg>
<seg>Quite simply, I would like to remind you that system of Treaty establishes a difference in treatment between indirect taxes and duties, whose harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and functioning of the internal market - Article 93 - and the approach laid down in Article 94 of the legislation that relate directly to the establishment and functioning of the common market, among which are those relating to direct taxation.</seg>
<seg>Let us look at these three sectors briefly.</seg>
<seg>If the behaviour model is that in the event of doubt all fight against all of this could break by Aires the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, which is based on regional cooperation.</seg>
<seg>In the end, we also need the cooperation with Yugoslavia, in addition to cooperation on both sides.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, our group supports the work carried out by Mr Collins in relation to the report on the viability of the negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement with the Republic of Croatia.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, over the years when I was President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I had the opportunity to attend to many Croatians in its efforts towards freedom and prosperity that they, like other peoples of our continent, along with their integration in the European institutions.</seg>
<seg>Since the results achieved by the Croatian this year, I have to say that I hope that we will be able to arrive at a rapid pace.</seg>
<seg>That is, of course, our approach and the speed with which we have adjusted to our policy towards Croatia in the last few months, bears witness to that fact.</seg>
<seg>We have a duty towards Croatia to give his government and his people all kinds of aid in the coming years and deeply thank the honourable Members for their wise advice in order to ensure that we remain that way.</seg>
<seg>It is incomprehensible in this respect that the Laskar Jihad, had the opportunity to go to the Moluccas this spring, with thousands of those in favour to exacerbate the conflict again.</seg>
<seg>in Timor, the militias block the return of the refugees and the people who provide the help find under siege.</seg>
<seg>On behalf of the Committee on Industry, I shall confine myself to three questions.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen on the excellent work he has done.</seg>
<seg>It is not the only country where this is happening.</seg>
<seg>The continuing violence in the Moluccas, in Aceh in Irian Jaya causes a great deal of pain to the population.</seg>
<seg>Tomorrow, we have here the ceremony of the award of the Sakharov Prize.</seg>
<seg>According to the most recent news arrivals of the Indonesian archipelago is urgent, too, the question of whether the situation still does not appear to be more serious, yes, more precarious, for President Wahid and is used the enemies who the rapporteur analyses.</seg>
<seg>If we want to help Indonesia, we must now act with money and action and not words.</seg>
<seg>I think that the report is extremely valuable when throwing light on what has been happening.</seg>
<seg>It is clear that the difficulties of Indonesia will not be solved overnight.</seg>
<seg>Protection of the financial interests of the Communities</seg>
<seg>Finally, it is necessary to eliminate the obstacles to its independent activities, particularly in the recruitment of staff and its structure.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, the Commission must fulfil finally by means of an internal reform process your announcement that it is not going to tolerate the fraud and that each of them is therefore going to be pursued.</seg>
<seg>I believe that this should be just the result of Nice.</seg>
<seg>We would like the Member States to open negotiations with a view to having a uniform legislation in the field of criminal law, however, we do not want to put our countries a Community Federal Office of the European public prosecutor.</seg>
<seg>I would also like to know why it was delayed until yesterday, after the Danish referendum on the euro, the publication of the document from the Commission on this issue.</seg>
<seg>I have made / displayed an amendment so that the names of those countries are mentioned, because it is high time that this is done to shame.</seg>
<seg>I am sure that OLAF has an interest in a way that is transparent selection of higher education 'tables.</seg>
<seg>However, in the European Parliament, we must be careful not to see the engineer in our eye so cuts to see the beam in other people's one: that of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>We are trying to put out a fire and between us with the smoke.</seg>
<seg>And nobody can understand it, I too.</seg>
<seg>With a view to achieving that aim precisely, I would like to highlight four points that I consider to be fundamental in the work of the authority of budgetary control.</seg>
<seg>The Treaty is a problem for Parliament itself.</seg>
<seg>Commissioner, it is worrying that there is to expressly draw the Commission's attention to respect for the rights of Members as it is the guardian of the Treaties.</seg>
<seg>They refer to a number of guidelines for action which the Committee on Budgetary Control can follow when it comes to problems in different areas, including those to recommend to the Committee on Budgets to freeze or reduce the amount of the appropriations allocated to the items in question in the budget for the following year does not to authorise the transfer of appropriations which involve the increase in the appropriations concerned for a certain period until they have concluded additional internal investigations are to go to ask the President of the Commission, which calls for the resignation of a Commissioner concerned by the serious problems: discovered something as well as a Caesarean one of the EU.</seg>
<seg>The report claims that they are given detailed lists of the operational activities, strict monitoring of the budget lines and the irregularities as well as an internal evaluation of the results on the part of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>Commissioner, the starting point for the transmission of information to the European Parliament is of the EC Treaty and not the interinstitutional agreement.</seg>
<seg>But the result of this common position would be, if it is not changed, that, in the end, not only would we have an equal arms with regard to America, but not even within Europe.</seg>
<seg>I do not know why it would not have to be achieved in the present case, as it has been achieved for all the other directives, in the end, to arrive at a compromise.</seg>
<seg>It is a proposal which has had a long, and I am afraid that dizzying, way to overcome some of the difficulties.</seg>
<seg>The first amendment relates to Article 4, in which it is established that has to be the authority responsible for supervising the supply.</seg>
<seg>We now have a proposal which would cause difficulties, finding the most favourable court, possible litigation as sensitive as an enterprise agreement.</seg>
<seg>In the United Kingdom, the regulation of the public takeover bids, by means of the voluntary code of practice administered by the group responsible for public takeover bids, has produced very good results: a good example here of a pragmatic approach of an extremely complex issue in which the legislation would be less appropriate.</seg>
<seg>But, more than that, the best thing is that we can manage the programme from Lisbon to create a competitive and dynamic European economy.</seg>
<seg>In the European Parliament, what we must do is to regulate a minimum form in the European area large areas which cause tension in the right of purchases, for example, the Presidency in front of shareholders, major shareholders in front of small companies or in the face of the capital market.</seg>
<seg>A number of the amendments proposed by Parliament to further improve the text of the common position of the Council, as a result, its points focus on issues which could lead to difficulties in the interpretation and that they are urgent to a faster processing of the directive.</seg>
<seg>After all, it is not proven, under any circumstances, that the proposed definition of fair price is better than any other, because the different definitions that are currently used in the Member States all work very well.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>In addition, an information law is recognised the artist to be aware of their rights, within a period of up to three years before the professional traders of art objects, what is reasonable, because they must lead to the accounts of purchases and sales.</seg>
<seg>Consequently, they should go to the Austrian legislator and not attack the European legislator here who only creates positive framework conditions for artists and auction houses.</seg>
<seg>In addition, in the case in question, the need for a common position is as much greater in that only a common position will enable the European Union to influence at international level to ensure that the interests of the creators on a global scale can be defended.</seg>
<seg>I trust in the wisdom and the wisdom of this House.</seg>
<seg>In Germany, for example, from the ECU 7 artists who transferred their rights in 1998, only 274, in fact, they obtained money whatsoever for that reason and 40% of droit of "suite 'was used to bear the costs of receiving the sum.</seg>
<seg>In short, a harmonisation of this type in that sector is not necessary.</seg>
<seg>A similar amendment had already been rejected at first reading.</seg>
<seg>They thought that the translations could continue, in spite of this very tight and difficult timetable.</seg>
<seg>However, we have reached a point where, regrettably, we can no longer postpone this any further.</seg>
<seg>The Commission proposes that this be brought forward a year.</seg>
<seg>This Parliament is, of course, in favour of those values and is going to continue to defend them.</seg>
<seg>The technology and the development of the markets will carry the change in any case.</seg>
<seg>There is no legal basis that allows us to exclude competition in those cases.</seg>
<seg>A reduction of term of universal service, the very essence of the sector of the postal service - up to 50 grammes would seriously endanger the capacity of the national postal servers independently to provide a universal service at a reasonable rates for all of the place in which they reside.</seg>
<seg>I would remind you of my Conservative colleagues involved in which they put in the United Kingdom when they tried to privatise the British postal services.</seg>
<seg>We have turned the safety net for the users of the postal services a IOC where the major postal ease up to continue with which they have always done.</seg>
<seg>I am very pleased that this notion of special services tried to bring the new technologies outside the scope of the universal support, and this is made to move on to the reserved sector of the weight limits of 50 grs. proposed to 150 grs.</seg>
<seg>We cannot tolerate, Madam President, Mr Commissioner, and we will not tolerate that a similar situation occurs.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, the European Commission has not proposed the total liberalisation of the postal services in the second phase.</seg>
<seg>This is something that I would like to wish the other European countries.</seg>
<seg>In the Dutch newspapers, Mr Bolkestein recently showed in face of the French antiliberal his position, or at least that it appeared in the holder of a newspaper.</seg>
<seg>In this respect, Spain could say something which has created this fund and it has been used the same, and this is to speak of the uncertain legal bases that the Fund is, of the virtual criteria as far as its composition and the discretionary guarantees of their implementation.</seg>
<seg>Tomorrow we voted, and I hope that, in favour of the amendment tabled by Mr Atkins or Mr Sterckx, because otherwise I shall be forced to vote against this report.</seg>
<seg>Royal Mail is in competition and it is distributed letters to me in Malmo, Sweden.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, Commissioner, what has taught the debate, or rather the problem raised by Commissioner Bolkestein in its search for a liberalisation of the postal services in the absence of any assessment of the first stage and in violation of the rules laid down by this directive which using progressive terms and values, such as modernisation, liberalisation, support for technological development, fall in a reduction of the social quality of a country.</seg>
<seg>The planned protection of universal services by means of a compensation fund, which would make it possible to use the private benefits for public services cannot be permanent.</seg>
<seg>These same limits and delays have contributed to a debate in which often ends with the instruments are confused.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, when dealing with this matter, we are talking about economic and social cohesion.</seg>
<seg>Madam President, allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, because, of course, she has made a complicated work, difficult, where she has had to try to seek a balance between proposals, starting positions and completely different points and arrival.</seg>
<seg>I am afraid that the effect will be that the current monopoly will be able to further strengthen their position at the taxpayers' expense and that the standard for the new candidates was closed.</seg>
<seg>I am also pleased to see that our liberal friends of the continent are giving an example to the British Liberal.</seg>
<seg>I certainly accept that the concept of liberalisation, per se, is nothing wrong and which can be of benefit to the consumers.</seg>
<seg>justified, since it is included in the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union, who put the completion of the internal market for the free movement of goods and services in competition environment.</seg>
<seg>The universal service is the cornerstone of Community policy in this area and all we do is designed to create the right conditions for its improvement.</seg>
<seg>The special services are one of the very important areas in which it must promote innovation and modernisation.</seg>
<seg>It has been said that the opening up to competition of almost all of the postal market seems inevitable, before the end of the decade.</seg>
<seg>I am in favour of solid there are guarantees that all the commitments will be protected on universal service.</seg>
<seg>It is for that reason, I cannot remain silent and I will not remain silent, as long as the future of the sector is threatened by the failure to fully meet the challenges that set us all in Lisbon.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.</seg>
<seg>However, I must point out that this common organisation of the markets has as its main objective, the guarantee of access to the Community market for their products.</seg>
<seg>It is absolutely necessary to find, over and above the tariff preference of EUR 300, a means to enable the effective access to quota C and evaluated after the impact of the system in these producers.</seg>
<seg>For example, we cannot fail to express our concern over the banana production in some ACP countries, small producing countries of the West Indies and in some countries in western Africa that have been traditional suppliers of the banana market, with which we have commitments which we cannot ignore.</seg>
<seg>I therefore request that this report is supported in its entirety on the part of the Members of this House, as it was in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</seg>
<seg>While the United States first condemns the periods of historical reference, and now defend their own periods of historical reference.</seg>
<seg>powerful interests involved, especially those of the Americans, who are not cultivate direct of bananas, but which have invested capital American in business.</seg>
<seg>Sometimes, it seems as if the Commission, in the proposals of deregulation in the trade and agricultural production at international level, without even further than the Cairns Group.</seg>
<seg>It is a pity that the Commission and the Council persists in a solution that can be jeopardised this production, in particular after 2006.</seg>
<seg>The successive opinions of the WTO do not say that we are not able to give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers.</seg>
<seg>Thus, the transitional period would have to be almost fifteen years and never to less than ten and compensatory aid must include the guarantee of the incomes of Community producers and the departure of the production of the outermost regions, and also an aid to the organisations should be included which market with bananas there.</seg>
<seg>I hope that today we will listen to our arguments, because the system proposed by the Commission, the tariff preference, but is EUR 300, can be seen as quite useless in the facts as the ACP producers to be will see laminates by the system called 'on arrival order'.</seg>
<seg>Votes</seg>
<seg>(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)</seg>
<seg>The Commission cannot accept the remaining amendments.</seg>
<seg>Before the vote:</seg>
<seg>(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)</seg>
<seg>Report (A5-0376 / 2000) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the reform of the procedures and institutions on budgetary control (2000 / 2008 (INI))</seg>
<seg>Most of the smokers, they do not know all the risks and to support all the costs of their choice.</seg>
<seg>During the 35 years of my long political life, I have always adhered to this legislation.</seg>
<seg>I am afraid that their hopes will be in vain.</seg>
<seg>This is our last desperate attempt to place on the packets labels and pictures which reflect the real cost of tobacco consumption.</seg>
<seg>Lehne report (A5-0368 / 2000)</seg>
<seg>I believe that this trial is still correct and excellent, and I have therefore voted against the report in its entirety.</seg>
<seg>With good reason, the Committee on Legal Affairs insists on refusing to a ceiling and a lower minimum rate of 7%.</seg>
<seg>By voting against this directive, my group wishes to present / demonstrate a political statement, so that we in Europe do not take care to create unnecessary regulations.</seg>
<seg>If it is right to condemn the dictatorship of Stalin of a few decades ago, how is it possible to be given to a minimum of confidence to Mr Putin, yardstick of the Chechen people, the godfather of the various mafias, that it insists on removing all kinds of opposition, civil society - political, trade unions, parties), to strengthen their personal power?</seg>
<seg>Certain that Indonesia would not deserve this intensification of relations, since, in the last few years, the governors of that country have distinguished themselves in either by a great democracy or by great merits does, however, we must be concerned about the Indonesian citizens and, therefore, welcome the intensification of relations and these subsidies.</seg>
<seg>The unit should only take care of the crimes committed by the EU employees.</seg>
<seg>The Theato report on the fight against fraud will enable us to find that the European Central Bank, without a doubt, to prove better his famous independence, did not consider it appropriate to add to the agreement on the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).</seg>
<seg>That concludes the explanations of vote.</seg>
<seg>Or we belong to a club or we do not belong, and it is particularly important that we recognise this principle.</seg>
<seg>Ladies and gentlemen, we do not contribute to the change of name.</seg>
<seg>The tariff only system, however, is an important element, which guarantees the balance of the Commission proposal and is an important basis to be able to achieve some progress in the Council.</seg>
<seg>The national and regional programmes for the promotion of rural development is also include measures to support the marketing of these bananas.</seg>
<seg>Europe and the United States are working in close cooperation in defence of the values which we share.</seg>
<seg>We hope that this will be discussed in future, a new round of the WTO, as well as to the consequences which the broad range of new bilateral trade initiatives will have for this round which are being discussed in the American hemisphere.</seg>
<seg>As has rightly said, the transatlantic relations have increased dramatically in the last ten years, above all, it is true, on the part of the United States, thanks to President Clinton, but I think that history will tell that to these new relations also Europe has done, which has played a fundamental role in its development, through the 1990 Transatlantic Declaration and the new transatlantic agenda under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995.</seg>
<seg>In short, it will be important to achieve a change of direction and to draw up a genuine transatlantic agenda for the year 2001.</seg>
<seg>In conclusion, I will refer to the Dominican Republic, which says that it is assumed that the WTO should become an impartial referee of common rules, in which the countries could learn to act according to the rules.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, although we are not allowed to see us for the decline of the Communist sham, the collapse of the Soviet Union, a single superpower: the United States of America.</seg>
<seg>I know that the Commissioner has a good and very constructive dialogue with Parliament and the committees involved with these issues.</seg>
<seg>In accordance with the agenda, the next item is the joint debate on the following reports:</seg>
<seg>These objectives, primary and secondary ones, will be the acid test of what they have to judge the specific proposals made / displayed by the Commission.</seg>
<seg>A solution, it is a known fact that, in this way, the establishment of a single country, with the possibility of serving in the whole of the Union could make it possible an avalanche in those countries with lower taxation.</seg>
<seg>Thus, in 1992, an agreement was reached, then as a minimum harmonisation, according to which the normal rate of VAT could not be less than 15%, and the Member States have had the power to implement one or more able rate to 5%, in this case with the derogations.</seg>
<seg>We have asked the European Commission to ensure that distortions of the market do not take place, and that this report on the results to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg>Indeed, the aim of this proposal is correct, but the method is outrageous and if we really want to promote the e-economy in Europe, a proper signal should be to establish a zero rate of VAT for our companies that operate via the Internet, to time to try to impose our problems to the others.</seg>
<seg>In order to be able to meet the requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will have to take all sorts of measures to restrict it.</seg>
<seg>The only case in which, until now, no tax is not collected is one of the benefits that are made in the European Union from a third country.</seg>
<seg>The positive discrimination in favour of air transport must stop.</seg>
<seg>The firms of other countries outside the Community, do not pay taxes.</seg>
<seg>The compact discs are not so archaic, and it would be necessary to impose a tax on them, while the programmes which are circulating on the Internet would be outside the imposition of a rate.</seg>
<seg>However, the solution proposed is intended to be technically impracticable and hinders the promotion of transactions on the Internet in the Union, when all anticipate its expansion.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the European Union are losing real teeth and capacity of collection.</seg>
<seg>We should be looking for ways to promote electronic commerce and not to devise new ways to burden it.</seg>
<seg>The Liberals to tell us that the children have been possible.</seg>
<seg>the Primarolo group group has drawn up a simple rules that are required.</seg>
<seg>As an objection, the group that I represent in this House believes that it would be right, while the newspapers have reduced rates of VAT normally, this reduction is not applicable to the newspapers electronically.</seg>
<seg>The taxation of kerosene can only be introduced, therefore, by means of an international consensus that allows us to guarantee equality of competition.</seg>
<seg>I particularly welcome the fact that the report reinforces one of the key points that I made / displayed in my report on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and which was put to the vote in this Parliament a few months ago, that is to say that given that, without a doubt, politically, it is difficult to achieve an international agreement on the taxation of aviation, at least in the short term, we would have to look for alternative tools to achieve the same effect, including a rate of emissions.</seg>
<seg>In fact, the industry is 100% of its infrastructure costs through charges of airports and air traffic control, that, in 1998, amounted to a total of USD 4 billion are contrary to other means of transport such as rail and road, which is still being heavily subsidised.</seg>
<seg>The current situation is not favourable.</seg>
<seg>In this context it has to be said, unfortunately, that the emissions of air traffic is a problem which, although percentage is not very great, is being increased a great deal and, therefore, we should not disregard this.</seg>
<seg>The plan will be detrimental to the development of SMEs, both inside and outside the Union, especially in view of the proposal to reduce the prohibitively exemption threshold as low turnover of 40 000 per annum.</seg>
<seg>If we are too greedy when dealing with the matter before us, we will be putting really endangering the future of the important electronic commerce in Europe.</seg>
<seg>The starting point for the suppliers of outside the Community only provide customers within the Community to be registered in a place cannot be a transfer of the tax revenue between the Member States.</seg>
<seg>Bearing in mind that the debate in the Council still continues and the will of the Commission in the short term to deal properly with the issue of VAT and electronic commerce, I think that the best thing at the moment is not to formally accept the amendments of Parliament, but, as far as possible, to make them a reality through the negotiations in the Council.</seg>
<seg>For this reason, I cannot accept the proposed amendments.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much, Commissioner, for all dossiers on which this week has referred to.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, only three months after the accident, the Commission accepted its responsibilities and taken a first package of measures, which the European Parliament endorsed the past 30 November fully.</seg>
<seg>In fact, with more than fifteen directives or regulations in force, it is urgent to standardising the practices and to exercise more control over the application of the Community regulations, to avoid important and unacceptable differences in the area of maritime safety, which could take place within the Union.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his continued commitment in the field of maritime safety.</seg>
<seg>I would like to remind you that in air safety the compensation that apply in the European area and in the North American area, they are not equivalent such sums that apply in other countries.</seg>
<seg>Secondly, I would say to the honourable Member that who might have the capacity to confiscate or to freeze the assets of a specific undertaking to compensate for damage or others, it is the French justice, which could establish responsibilities beyond the envisaged in accordance with objective criteria that it raises the current international rules on pollution by hydrocarbons.</seg>
<seg>The Commission considers that these provisions are a step in the right direction towards the establishment of a fairer system of pricing, which, in addition, encourage a more rational and efficient use of the road network.</seg>
<seg>As a result of the criticisms we have received, particularly in Ireland and France, the measure changed and now the British Minister of Finance has given a different turn him: now it is presented as a levy on right of employment for all, including those of the British lorry drivers.</seg>
<seg>I am committed to ensuring that the food that is available to consumers, whether they come from inside or outside the European Union, to meet the highest standards.</seg>
<seg>. (in) of course, I include / understand the concern of the honourable Member.</seg>
<seg>I am sorry to say, Commissioner, that your answer is of no interest to me.</seg>
<seg>The question raised by the honourable Member is important.</seg>
<seg>In Nigeria, Chevron has been accused by the indigenous population all-ijaw to instigate violence against it and even to pay to the Nigerian soldiers to shoot the demonstrators in the shipbuilding basis of warri.</seg>
<seg>. (in) in her report adopted on 15 November, the committee came to the conclusion that operating aid under Regulation 1540 / 98 have not allowed us to resolve the problem of the South Korean policies of prices.</seg>
<seg>I believe that the whole of intentions is hugely reassuring, but the reality is that in the meantime our shipyards are closing down.</seg>
<seg>Question Nº 38 put by (H-0868 / 9):</seg>
<seg>Mr Commissioner, I include / understand that it does not want to change its decision ten Member States are contrary to the tariff.</seg>
<seg>This initiative is based on a Council regulation, to amend the Rules of Procedure, which defines the egp.</seg>
<seg>I represent some producers and, for that reason, I feel a deep concern.</seg>
<seg>We are working on it in committee, we have not taken up this week, Poul Nielson in being absent from a trip to the Balkans.</seg>
<seg>We are working on the safeguard clause and if Mr Clegg needs arguments to talk to the producers of beet, I have them at their disposal.</seg>
<seg>I would like to thank Mr Liikanen this very positive and brilliant response.</seg>
<seg>I will discuss this matter with my services once we know the budgetary resources available for the next financial year.</seg>
<seg>At the moment, the efforts of my services and my personal are focused on limiting the distance between the parties to the future and to court.</seg>
<seg>In the same way that the courts of Düsseldorf, Munich and other German cities have specialised in patent law, and there are also courts specialising in London, a Community court which meets and judges cases relating to Community patents will have to be very specialised.</seg>
<seg>In order to prevent this provisional situation becomes a permanent, on 13 July 1999, on 13 July last year, the Commission stated in a letter to the Member States of their obligation to use appropriate courts in the Community framework.</seg>
<seg>As our parliamentary right of the House will know, the presentation of a complaint by itself does not affect the progress of the project.</seg>
<seg>Question Nº 47 by (H-0877 / 9):</seg>
<seg>This means, therefore, that the Commission will only make use of legal measures which it has such as it is stated in the Rules of Procedure.</seg>
<seg>The question is where these students must come to understand that when is this cycle of studies and complete it in Great Britain has the right to achieve results.</seg>
<seg>The King could be chosen for a limited period of most welcome the Finnish Members of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>We could also see as an issue which affects competition, because it will be possible to continue to be sold without taxes in the southern part of the Baltic Sea, on the road between Stockholm and Helsinki, whereas this is not possible in the route between Umeå and Vaasa.</seg>
<seg>What we need to do is to correct this situation through the promotion of multilingual content, because they are a condition which is essential for the success of the European content industry.</seg>
<seg>The issue of most widespread concern to me is that the small companies do not always have sufficient guarantees and a conflicting commercial record to offer to the investor.</seg>
<seg>In order to complete the development of the ambitious European programme and-contain it is necessary to simplify and consolidate from the point of view of security, the estimated procedures.</seg>
<seg>For that reason, the objective of the public support measures for the promotion of the content industry of the EU is to be the achievement of a high level of culture and the diversification of the same.</seg>
<seg>On the other hand, are the communication networks, which require the content to fill their virtual space constantly, and which take account of the subordination of the content of their purchase, its use without special attention to the production of rules.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I very much welcome the programme for the European digital content, and I would like to emphasise two points.</seg>
<seg>That is why I support the amendments that call for the adoption of specific actions in the field of the new technologies.</seg>
<seg>First, on the social and cultural role of digital content, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament insists on the social and cultural dimension of the digital content.</seg>
<seg>assessment and management of environmental noise</seg>
<seg>In fact, I am grateful for the support that the Christian Democrats and, by the way, is also a part of the Liberal Group, have given this amendment in particular to reduce aircraft noise.</seg>
<seg>This year alone, six years after the date indicated, and under strong pressure from the French Government, the Commission has published / displayed a proposal to establish harmonised noise indicators.</seg>
<seg>This proposal is, in fact, very moderate, if we consider that the Scandinavian countries already have stricter rules than those we proposed for the year 2012.</seg>
<seg>orly, Schiphol, Barcelona and other airports comply with strict measures already.</seg>
<seg>Another important point which we propose is included, and which is going to be essential in the context of the problem of aircraft noise is the definition of additional noise indicators, in addition to what the rapporteur has said.</seg>
<seg>Due to a lack of common standards in the European Union, we have seen situations of known distortion of competition between airports and lack of fairness between the citizens of the various Member States.</seg>
<seg>That is why the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange seems very important to me.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, first of all, I must say that I am in favour of the present report.</seg>
<seg>This was, in fact, the purpose of Amendment No 36, but I think that the idea has still not been developed in depth.</seg>
<seg>We would have to look carefully at this issue and to adopt soon in both areas a combined approach, setting out on the one hand, the limit values for different noise emission sources and, on the other hand, quality standards for emissions.</seg>
<seg>We need more time and I regret that we have not had, even though, in general terms, I support the framework directive.</seg>
<seg>Once the Member States have given comparable information, the Commission will study the question to introduce Community limit values and other measures to reduce the number of people who are affected by the noise, and will present / demonstrate a report to the Council and Parliament.</seg>
<seg>Food additives other than colours and sweeteners</seg>
<seg>These are the three criteria.</seg>
<seg>Thank you very much, Mr Bouwman, I sympathise with you, because if you have the throat as estropajo, I have it as a floorcloth, as we say in the north of the Rhine does the fact of the matter is that it seems to me that the influenza in this way is doing the rounds.</seg>
<seg>If the diet problems become permanent, moreover, increases the risk of contracting cancer.</seg>
<seg>Then, it was also found that the Commission did not have the necessary instruments to take appropriate action.</seg>
<seg>Tomorrow we have in the programme to another stage. will then come to turn to our colleague Marit Paulsen, of the Liberal Group, that we will have the opportunity to further clarify the directive before us.</seg>
<seg>The Member States and the Commission have a better instrument now to ensure the effective implementation of Community legislation on feed and, in the event of emergency situations arise in third countries, they can adopt measures without delay.</seg>
<seg>We know that the majority of Europeans live in cities, and until now, these issues have been in embryonic stage when it comes to the cities.</seg>
<seg>The planning process must be applied in a fair and innovative way.</seg>
<seg>Multiannual Programme 2002-2004 for sustainable development in urban areas is a suitable instrument for this purpose, as well as the implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent means of coordination and development of actions.</seg>
<seg>In order to ensure that the climate change threat, it is necessary that the transport lowers and fossil fuels in the local area give in.</seg>
<seg>These have been many who have suggested that the budget is too small.</seg>
<seg>The aim is that the main partners in this context, the Commission and the networks of local authorities, which have the legal responsibility to develop and implement the policies of sustainable development in urban areas.</seg>
<seg>The Court of Justice of the European Communities and the bodies of conflict resolution in the WTO even consider that, sometimes, the precautionary principle to be applied in the environmental field and in the field of public health, and sometimes even against the European, as shown by the outstanding issue of cheese drawn up with fresh milk.</seg>
<seg>The aim is not to be the restriction or compensation of damage, but that the basic objective must be to prevent damage to the health or the assets of the people.</seg>
<seg>In 1996, the European Parliament still in favour of a ban on the use of animal meal in the whole of the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle does, even if only for that reason.</seg>
<seg>It has never existed, and it will never be a complete scientific certainty on new substances or on new products.</seg>
<seg>Finally, if we want the application of the precautionary principle is to be effective and credible, it is essential to the participation of all interested parties, including the representatives of civil society, in the political decisions regarding their application</seg>
<seg>And, finally, that public health and the environment must take precedence over other considerations, particularly in the economic.</seg>
<seg>An essential condition for the application of the precautionary principle is that the concern about the possible harmful effects is being provided with a scientific basis.</seg>
<seg>Only yesterday, in Lisbon, at first hand, an American professor George Carlo, to whom the Food and Drugs Administration has entrusted the last seven years a study on the effects of radiation on human health, revealed that there is a risk that the use of mobile phones assists the emergence of brain tumours, Alzheimer's disease and injuries in the skin.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the environment and public health are like a complex machine with a lot of jobs that we look at and we managed to be able to take part, and that does not sit.</seg>
<seg>The application of this principle must be avoided at all costs to stifle innovation and economic activity, to generate timidity and industrial immovability, to become an instrument to discourage competition.</seg>
<seg>As you will have noted, the Parliament, the Commission's position is in line with most of the issues raised in the motion for a resolution.</seg>
<seg>The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.</seg>
<seg>Article 2 enshrines the right to life and on every occasion on which terrorism in Spain kills a person, the whole of the Union is affected, in that it is one of the most essential principles.</seg>
<seg>We do not want to replace the legally established institutions, but to encourage them to protect our rights and our freedoms without concessions to the terror.</seg>
<seg>Votes</seg>
<seg>Also, the comments of the Council agreed on the classification of the budget lines relating to the project of early retirement of the Commission and on the administrative expenditure of the fisheries agreements.</seg>
<seg>(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)</seg>
<seg>That is to say, it is no longer present.</seg>
<seg>The 23,428 achieved licences will seem to them a few, but on the other hand, they will be pleased that space is given to them so that they can grow.</seg>
<seg>The result of this deletion, which began to be applied in the middle of last year, was, as we had anticipated, a dramatic adjournment of the rate of approval of projects and implementation of payments, with which the annual implementation of authorisations for this Fund, at the end of June 2000, was reduced by a percentage point.</seg>
<seg>The text is a letter in ideal objective for closure in practice by the General Secretariat of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg>Before my trip, who said to me: "it is Christmas and in Bergamo we celebrate Christmas and the lucia. will be.</seg>
<seg>In addition, we oppose the agricultural overproduction, and the use of resources allocated to information to sell them.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I voted in favour of the report'a-margallo and Garcia-Margallo report on the taxation of electronic commerce.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I will try to reform before the year 2004 with some explanation of vote in favour of Malta.</seg>
<seg>However, I say this with some formality: it is the best that I can accept a Europe, in my view, far too liberal!</seg>
<seg>The existence of a target date would encourage the sector of postal services to develop and to modernise their services and, at the same time, which would facilitate the planning and investment in the markets.</seg>
<seg>They will continue to pressure. consolidate its position with the money that is with the distribution of shipments of more than 150 grammes.</seg>
<seg>The liberalisation of the postal services, as was proposed by the Commission, is not adequate and coherent, which is why I have voted in favour of the report and all the amendments which made / displayed expressed that same direction.</seg>
<seg>De Roo report (A5-0378 / 2000)</seg>
<seg>We also have reservations about Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31, not being convinced that they are compatible with the WTO.</seg>
<seg>The Commission's proposal is unacceptable as it stands, because it represents a capitulation by the American dictatorship this capitulation is unworthy of our European project and the environmental and social model which we say we want to build.</seg>
<seg>It attempts to against respect for the national identity and, as it is stipulated in Article 6 (3) of the Treaty of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>It is important to stress that the linguistic minorities, instead of being swallowed up by the globalisation of the Internet, are finding this as a means of new cultural and economic openness.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, in the absence of other results, the negotiations which took place in Nice will have made the intentions of the protagonists of the European Union is clear.</seg>
<seg>In this respect the tone of the joint resolution is too simplistic.</seg>
<seg>The delay in the publication of the written conclusions - that they are not yet officially available at present, four days rather late shows very well how difficult it is to draw up clear decisions taken in the confusion.</seg>
<seg>The only way to avoid dangerous conflicts in the future, to keep the concept of traditional according to which Europe is based on mutual respect for national communities.</seg>
<seg>The Nice Summit concluded on Sunday, with an agreement which would have to give rise to a draft Treaty.</seg>
<seg>The resolution on Nice, voted today, does not reflect this.</seg>
<seg>Finally, a reference to the social policy, in which France had committed in the presentation of your Presidency, but that, in the end, was handed over full of very little, apart from the declarations of intent and the professional qualifications of documents of very vague and clearly inadequate content to the existing problems and the enormous discontent, of which the demonstration of the workers in Nice was also important expression.</seg>
<seg>In the really important issues such as taxation, taxes, social policy, asylum and immigration, everything will continue as before.</seg>
<seg>What is striking in the debate on Nice is the impression at the end of which the Treaty has a father or mother and child of anyone: the French Presidency was invested in principle, instead of accepting clearly the results of the IGC and their reasons are the political groups which States correspond to the governments of the Member States more criticism.</seg>
<seg>On the contrary, the influence of national democracies, by means of the restriction of the right to veto and is to be given more power to the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>If these consequences had been able to calculate in my year of birth, in 1994, at the end of the Chicago Convention, possibly an exemption would not have been agreed tax on fuel and other products of aviation.</seg>
<seg>Given that zero risk does not exist, the scientists or, at least, the politicians must apply the principle of proportionality, judge the uncertain risks and assume their responsibilities.</seg>
<seg>But this Parliament also fought to ensure that this reduction in the resources for innovative policies was compensated for using the flexibility instrument laid down in a clause of the budgetary provision.</seg>
<seg>We all have a part to play in this important area because, in a truly global market in which we find ourselves, the new ideas - with the appropriate resources and support, firm and realistic - will do that in Europe we can maintain our place at the forefront of technological development in the new industries and the technology of the communications in particular.</seg>
<seg>In the previous speaker already hard words against the budgets were made, and that is that EUR 400 million really are the minimum funding, with which, in the second part of the exercise, it is necessary to take advantage of the opportunities it offers additional financing that the flexibility instrument, and, as has been pointed out in the report.</seg>
<seg>In my opinion, it will accompany automatically, and not, as is the conclusion of the report, a reduction of European added value.</seg>
<seg>As we all know, in the European Union, unemployment is concentrated in the less territories economic and technologically developed, in particular in those of Objective 1 Nº, and that is why it is necessary that the innovative actions do not only have a simple technical nature, but which are inspired by an explicit will of economic development and employment.</seg>
<seg>When I go back to my own region, the East of England, and find that not a single local government has used that money in this last period, I doubt that we have all been the effective means that there are to be in the future by welcoming these new communities.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, my first words to Helmut Markov to thank and congratulate him on the constructive presentation, competent and extremely serious in the draft communication relating to the innovative actions of the ERDF for the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg>Energy efficiency and the aspects of environmental policy have not been forgotten in these directions. may give rise to innovative actions as a third question, which concerns the regional identity and sustainable development.</seg>
<seg>However, we hope that the projects are elected at regional level, as, moreover, has seen to it, Mr Berend in his speech.</seg>
<seg>The debate is closed.</seg>
<seg>That is why we are calling for in this report, and the three amendments that we have added that the Commission should increase its efforts to present / demonstrate a conciliation complaint to the WTO.</seg>
<seg>I believe that the Commissioner must prove to the industry, which is doing everything it can, in this respect, to deal with the external threat to our industry.</seg>
<seg>Finally, of course, we hope that, on 18 December, the agreement is to be discussed at the meeting of the Group, 6 from the OECD "vessels'.</seg>
<seg>However, all the indications that the final objective takes time and time again, so that we were not able to achieve it.</seg>
<seg>As you all know, the simple discussion of this procedure will need more than six months.</seg>
<seg>For major corporations, and for its political lawyers, demanding less been it simply means that the state and its finances should be to their sole disposal.</seg>
<seg>But to achieve this, so that the process will make it possible to consolidate the shipbuilding industry, jobs and to offer reassurance to the families who are dependent on it, remain necessary aid beyond 31 December 2000, because the market situation is not equality, but of lack of honesty with regard and the dumping.</seg>
<seg>The Commission encourages the improvement of the competitiveness of the shipbuilding industry in the EU, but in the face of massive cuts of prices in the Korean shipyards, the increase in the productivity of that can be achieved is not enough.</seg>
<seg>The Council stressed that this support mechanism must not distort competition within the EU.</seg>
<seg>The presence of the damaged water nuclear submarine in the Bay of Algeciras has been done already, unfortunately, in a diplomatic conflict between a military nuclear power and colonial and a Member State of the second category, according to the latest classification of Nice, which does not require their rights and holding pens before child explanations.</seg>
<seg>When, through medical report broadcast in the country in which the owner lives - or, in the British press, it was discovered that the disease was serious, instead of changing this centre changed the skills to the centre.</seg>
<seg>And, of course, we await with interest the Commission's response to check whether the objective has been achieved.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, I would also like to see my first words were sympathy to the family of the murdered councillor, and with the members of the Group of the European People's Party, and by rejecting this fascist barbarity of ETA and the groups that are protecting it.</seg>
<seg>I also believe that it would be a good idea if the submarine Tireless leads to Great Britain for its repair, as soon as possible, as soon as the appropriate weather conditions.</seg>
<seg>You asked whether the Commission considers that the Directive 89 / 618 / Euratom on information to the people in the event of radiological emergency, and the Directive 96 / 29 / Euratom, on basic safety standards, is for the implementation of the submarine and what measures have been taken as a result.</seg>
<seg>In accordance with the usual procedure for the complaints, we cannot make this answer public, although we can say in broad outline of what it says.</seg>
<seg>One aspect of the Euratom Treaty is the transport of waste contaminated between Member States are, of course, but Gibraltar is part of the United Kingdom and all contaminated waste will go from one part of the United Kingdom to another part of the United Kingdom, without passing through any Member State of the European Union.</seg>
<seg>All they have to do is to win the confidence of the people who live on the rock.</seg>
<seg>However, we see a Member State here that deals with the public to another Member State, as it should do it with any other country in the world, as if, in fact, affectio was not any societatis fifty years after the start of the European company, as if European solidarity had not made progress in the least.</seg>
<seg>It is a fact that at a given moment that the only submarine that operate in British waters was a German submarine.</seg>
<seg>There is under discussion, but the citizens based on their knowledge or its intuition, direct its attention to the European institutions.</seg>
<seg>The lack of spending in new military equipment because of cuts in the area of defence of the British Labour Government will lead in the future, without a doubt, more frequent episodes of defective military equipment to withdraw to carry out fundamental objections.</seg>
<seg>The competence of the Community, no matter how much some people want something else, includes the classification of ports to carry out repair work in submarines, neither questions of technical safety of nuclear reactors and the requirements for a submarine has withdrawn to repair them in another place.</seg>
<seg>It would be necessary, to provide more assistance to them, to call for the Community institutions to strengthen the financial resources, both human and material from the UNHCR had.</seg>
<seg>I ask the Commission again to increase this aid and that it is always to establish the UNHCR as a coordinating body in all contracts concluded with the NGOs.</seg>
<seg>Therefore, we must be able to have access to the civilian victims and their equipment on the ground, would have to be able to move with certainty and to have the necessary resources to fulfil their mission.</seg>
<seg>On 22 November the Commission adopted a communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those who apply asylum throughout the Union is granted, which was the set goal in Tampere for the common European asylum system.</seg>
<seg>Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the work that Mrs Ogata has made the UNHCR, and to wish him.</seg>
<seg>It seems important to us that we are pushing Amnesty political in Yugoslavia that recovery which mentioned, but it is also very important to us that we condemn without any doubt resurgence of incursions and terrorist activities in borders between Serbia and Albania and Kosovo, because it reminds us of worrying way what happened during the Kosovo conflict, which were responsibilities of Western powers.</seg>
<seg>In paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of our compromise resolution, we are very clear.</seg>
<seg>I would also appeal to President Kostunica to clarify what has happened with people like Mr Ukshin Hoti, of whose fate we have dealt with here on several occasions and in whose fate we know nothing.</seg>
<seg>I also subscribe to the one that is an appeal to the KFOR to destroy any act of violence in the Presevo Valley.</seg>
<seg>I welcome the measures already KFOR has taken to tackle the problem and continue to advocate moderation all parties.</seg>
<seg>b5-0916 / 2000 by Mr Baron Crespo and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists does</seg>
<seg>This clause was decided in the Palace of the currency in March 1990, and I know well, because I had the privilege to be there in the Minutes of the inauguration of President alwyn, after the referendum on ending the regime of General Pinochet was put.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak in favour of the joint resolution on which we shall vote.</seg>
<seg>It is important that the international community has exercised its right of democratic control, not as interference in the internal affairs of an independent country, but as a political process, to prevent and preventive measures.</seg>
<seg>The situation in the prisons and the police barracks, with torture and ill-treatment, is totally unacceptable.</seg>
<seg>This is exactly the same treatment that we see in Western Europe, and before the protests, Minister hikmet Mr Turco has postponed the transfer to a political and social consensus is reached on the reform of the prison in Turkey.</seg>
<seg>It is a matter of urgency, and that is why we decided to include this item on the agenda.</seg>
<seg>It will process the next 8 of january. is supposed to have contributed to a meeting of Tunisian opponents in France, which, on the other hand, it denies.</seg>
<seg>When the Members and the people responsible for these associations are to meet the day of the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the police nature of their houses and those who attend this meeting are attacked in the street by men dressed civil.</seg>
<seg>The second problem is, in fact, only a part of a set of harassment.</seg>
<seg>My group, like this Parliament, is particularly sensitive to the situation of human rights in Tunisia and the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a little restraint, please.</seg>
<seg>The negotiations are going very well and I am pleased to see that these negotiations are receiving speed, and I hope that it leads to the conclusion that his referred to by the honourable Member.</seg>
<seg>Several Members have referred to the position of the prisoners in Turkey.</seg>
<seg>b5-0912 / 2000 by Mr Van Hecke, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats are</seg>
<seg>We could not, in my opinion, Mr President, Commissioner, to withdraw with regard to this attitude.</seg>
<seg>In this context, the seizure of power by the military have taken place, as always, only served to make the situation worse.</seg>
<seg>This attitude fits in well with the continuation of the policy of French imperialism.</seg>
<seg>The Commission's recent violence too are concerned.</seg>
<seg>The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.</seg>
<seg>The unfair competition aid to destroy good circles for the shipbuilding industry, to the loss of knowing how to do it () and jobs, and can take a long time to monopoly situations, which will not benefit to world trade.</seg>
<seg>Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting</seg>
<seg>By this, I would like to thank all my colleagues for the contribution that you have also given in the procedure for the submission of amendments and the technical nature of the Commission because they have been elements extremely valuable to make a success of the resolution.</seg>
<seg>The adoption of the social agenda at the Nice European Council welcome, and we expect us, in particular, that the Member States are to take advantage of this opportunity to encourage the development and the coordination of social security systems and care for the elderly, and promote other measures, such as, for example, lifelong learning, to ensure their reintegration into working life.</seg>
<seg>The promotion of training continued throughout life - something that has already been mentioned by another speaker - is another issue which I also support.</seg>
<seg>Of course, the people of more than 60 or 70 years can still do a great deal of useful, but it is a mistake to do that, to their age, their incomes depend on their work.</seg>
<seg>Already, in its monthly report in July 2000, the European Central Bank issued very serious warnings in this respect.</seg>
<seg>As far as I am concerned, the Member States can cope with this problem far better themselves by means of their own legislation.</seg>
<seg>With its proposals for an active life in old age, society will come to a whole generation.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary to fulfil the promises on pensions, but the pensions must be guaranteed by the own resources of these countries, with no need to go to the common financial policy of the EU to fulfil its payment.</seg>
<seg>Over the last 100 or 150 years we have experienced the greatest social revolution, than it has more than doubled the average life expectancy of the people.</seg>
<seg>This is the purpose of the mathematical extension of life, that the medical progress has allowed.</seg>
<seg>They received compensation - the whole of society saw itself, therefore, affected, older workers left the use, but it was not made young workers and many jobs were removed.</seg>
<seg>The result of the family and fiscal policy should instead be that women and men with family responsibilities are free to decide whether or not they wish to develop a job or not.</seg>
<seg>My brother and I met there with him.</seg>
<seg>Other future initiatives in the area of public health, above all, involve the issues relating to the health and care for the elderly and the promotion of a healthy ageing.</seg>
<seg>. (IT) Mr President, I accept Amendments Nos 2 and 3 made / displayed by Mr Pronk, in which it maintains that there is a need to amend the text, and insists on the concept of demographic development in relation to the issue of population ageing.</seg>
<seg>It is not a question of double the advertising operations or promotion of operators in the sector and the public authorities.</seg>
<seg>Mr President, the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, in principle, was also in favour of the proposal of the Commission.</seg>
<seg>It is therefore very important to provide a compensation and it may very well be made concrete through measures of marketing and advertising.</seg>
<seg>I believe that in the context of the marketing and sales, it would be necessary to give a more central place to lifelong training in the training programmes, as the new technologies, the management of the promotion, offer entirely new opportunities for logistical a modern.</seg>
<seg>First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Dary, for her excellent report.</seg>
<seg>My next point refers to the question of exports and the intervention.</seg>
<seg>It is not necessary to pay for certain products which are not required, or do propaganda to them.</seg>
<seg>Everyone has sufficient food, so that if we embarked on a product, of course we are against the use of another.</seg>
<seg>Amendment No 18, and the first part of Amendment No 24, which reduce from two to three years the regularity with which the issues and products selected will be revised in order to improve the effectiveness of the promotional instrument.</seg>
<seg>Jutta Haug, like the rapporteur, that is to say, as a man, and Mr Markus Ferber, like the rapporteur, that is to say, as women.</seg>
<seg>This will enable us to see how, with slight modifications great effects can be achieved in practice.</seg>
<seg>This is temporarily our last Friday in Strasbourg, that is to say, that Strasbourg is going to lose twelve days of the presence of the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg>For the rest, I should like to wish a happy Christmas and a prosperous, but, above all, wise new century to everybody, but, in particular, to those who think that this is worth the trouble to be here on a Friday, in the last sitting of the year 2000 in Strasbourg.</seg>
